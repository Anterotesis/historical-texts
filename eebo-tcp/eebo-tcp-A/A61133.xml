         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have fairly ſet down how far each of you have attained in the Myſtery of <hi>Truth;</hi> and ſurely we are all ſhort of the <hi>glory</hi> which ſhall be revealed in the <hi>Temple</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and there are ſuch <hi>clouds</hi> rolling about each <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> that may darken it, or <hi>ſomething</hi> of it.

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.2.</note> So as the common <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>infirmitie</hi> amongſt us, may be a <hi>riſe</hi> for a <hi>common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie</hi> amongſt us: and ſeeing we all <hi>come out of</hi> Babylon (though in ſeveral wayes) to the <hi>glorious Temple</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath ſent down <hi>to be with men,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> thus diverſly thither; yet our ſeveral and diſtinct <hi>goings</hi> are but like ſo many <hi>Travellers</hi> to the <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> ſome travel from the <hi>North,</hi> ſome from the <hi>South,</hi> and from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſome from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> yet all thither; though too, there may be ſome miſtaking of the way in <hi>each,</hi> becauſe of the little <hi>light</hi> that is abroad.

            </p>
            <p>One thing I have more. Let us ſeek for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>revelation,</hi> to open to us the Myſtery of the Scriptures called <hi>The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> for in that <hi>Book</hi> is the <hi>Prophecie</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> laid up, and the <hi>ſeaſons</hi> and <hi>times</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> revealed. Let us ſearch and ſeek out by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> even that <hi>Jeſus</hi> which was in the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and gave it out to <hi>John;</hi> for there is none found worthy to open the <hi>Book</hi> with <hi>Seals</hi> but the <hi>Lamb.</hi> Surely in the Myſtery of <hi>Angels, Vials, Sea</hi> of <hi>glaſſe</hi> with <hi>fire, Temple</hi> with <hi>Smoke,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> with the <hi>everlaſting
<pb facs="tcp:42211:3"/>
Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Angel enlightening the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Whore</hi> in <hi>skarlet</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pearls,</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>abomination,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt</hi> like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Horns</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>mark</hi> in the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> and in the right <hi>hand,</hi> the <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>ſelling,</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>God</hi> with <hi>men,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Reſurrection,</hi> the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>pure cryſtal River</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>Holy Jeruſalem deſcending from God,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe is much of the glory wrapped up, and from theſe ſhall the Truth we contend for, appear to our further <hi>enlightening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet one thing more. We that are thus contenders for Ordinances, for the <hi>Temple</hi> and the <hi>Veſſels</hi> in it, let us take heed we forget not him who is greater then the <hi>Temple;</hi> for one greater then the <hi>Temple</hi> is here. It would be ſpiritually conſidered, that while we ſtrive for the <hi>Veſſels</hi> and <hi>Cups,</hi> we ſpill not the <hi>Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ought to be ſo carried by all of us, that, becauſe we are ſo much in <hi>opinion,</hi> we may not be thought to place <hi>Religion</hi> there, as I fear too many do, making a Chriſt of the very Ordinance of Chriſt, and preſſing ſome outward Ordinances of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſo legally; as ſome hearing ſuch a power of <hi>ſalvation</hi> put into them, and finding an outward <hi>diſpenſation</hi> more eaſily <hi>got</hi> then the ſpiritual, make <hi>haſte</hi> thither onely, and then ſit down as ſaved under a meer outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. The Lord grant that we may neither undervalue an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance nor the leaſt Inſtitution of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> nor raiſe it up into a <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>Law</hi> above or beſide the <hi>Law-giver.</hi> We muſt now learn to know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> leſſe after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and not to embody <hi>ſalvation</hi> in a meer outward diſpenſation, and ſo incarnate <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> over again from the glory and ſpirituality he is in.</p>
            <p>Brethren, farewell: For my part I am fully aſſured from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Church of Chriſt here, or <hi>Goſpel-fellowſhip</hi> of the <hi>Saints;</hi> and unto this <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> I endeavour;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>If any man will do his will he ſhall know of the Doctrine,</hi> Joh. 7.17.</note> and I have one way to reveal Truth to me which I cannot conceal, nor yet cannot practice as I would, and that is this;</p>
            <p>To ſee Truth by living in the power of Truth, and by firſt obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt to live in us in the power of his ſuffering, death, and Reſurrection; for ſurely Jeſus Chriſt muſt do all (though more gloriouſly and ſpiritually) over again in his, which he did in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>If Jeſus Chriſt the Light be in us, the Light by which every out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpenſation is ſeen, will flow in; for where the Sun is, there will be every beam with it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now from theſe I argue,</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

Now who ſhall be the <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Interpreter</hi> of this <hi>Word of God,</hi> to each mans conſcience in the <hi>things of God,</hi> but he who is <hi>Lord</hi> of the conſcience, in things immediately <hi>divine</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpiritual?</hi> The <hi>conſciences</hi> of men are under a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>immediate Interpreter</hi> of the Word, even the <hi>Spirit of the Lord,</hi> in all things of <hi>ſpiritual cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,</hi> as every <hi>Scripture-truth,</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> in the <hi>Word</hi> is: and this is not onely ſtrengthened and clear from the Word, but from a <hi>teſtimony</hi> which ſome when they read, may know better then many others.</p>
                     <p>By the Clauſe, <hi>According to the Word of God,</hi> we underſtand, <hi>ſo far as we do or ſhall in our conſciences conceive the ſame to be according to the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now each man ſtanding thus <hi>ingaged</hi> in his own particular and in his own proper <hi>conſcience</hi> by a Covenant recommended and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, each is bound to bring forth the evidence of their <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> in particular, concerning this to which they are covenanted: So as <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>you,</hi> being covenanted againſt <hi>Popery, Hereſie,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, <hi>you</hi> and <hi>I</hi> ſtand bound by our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>conſciences</hi> to reveal to the State, who hath recommended ſuch a <hi>Covenant</hi> unto us, what our <hi>conſciences</hi> interpret according to this Word, againſt <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Hereſie,</hi> unleſſe there could be one univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal or publike infallible Interpreter of the Word of God and Truth, who might determine concerning Hereſie and the Word of God, and whoſe <hi>determinations</hi> is as in the <hi>formerly inspired Apoſtolic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And ſurely that one Clauſe, <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> is moſt providentially inſerted; for if we be ſo cloſely covenanted to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, how tender ought we to be? leſt in this dark ſeaſon of our diſcerning, we oppoſe ſomething of the <hi>Word,</hi> and ſo in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, perſecute what we covenant to maintain.

I ſigh to conſider: There would be edge againſt edge, authority againſt authority, power againſt power, and all the State or Kingdom involved into blood and cofuſion: So as we muſt conſider things according to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not according to their temporary or occaſional <hi>advantages.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, more then any. He that gives him that which God hath given him, gives more then any that pretend to give him the moſt.</p>
                     <p>The pretenders that bid for the Magiſtrate at this time are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They that put him as an help and government in the Church, as ſome,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.28.</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> they of the <hi>Erastian</hi> way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that make uſe on him but as an help to the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally, and by way of forrain aſſiſtance, as others, <hi>viz.</hi> they of the <hi>Preſbyterial</hi> way.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They that give him power over body, goods, over all moral and civil behaviours of men, <hi>Profeſſors</hi> and <hi>Beleevers,</hi> of what ſort ſoever, of what opinion ſoever, as I and the reſt of our <hi>Brethren</hi> do, praying with all manner of ſupplication that under them we may lead a peaceable, godly, and quiet life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But why dare you not ingage Civil Magiſtracy in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion over conſciences, as ſome others do?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, In all things morally good and evil, God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged them, and hath ſet the Law and Light of nature and conſcience in all people to ſide with them, <hi>condemning</hi> and <hi>excuſing</hi> what they and their Law doth <hi>condemn</hi> and <hi>excuſe,</hi> and thus to bear witneſſe with their <hi>dominion</hi> and <hi>power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in things of pure Goſpel-myſtery and Evangelically good or evil, I dare not ingage them (whatever others do) over conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe I give more to their juſt power, and becauſe I dare not draw them into ſuch principles, which hath broken more Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then all the other <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>devices</hi> of men.</p>
                     <p>For things of Worſhip which are laid up in the <hi>pure ſimple myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> in the Light of the Spirit, not of nature, as all meer Goſpel-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is, to ingage the <hi>Magiſtrates ſword</hi> into theſe, is rather a way to daſh them againſt every mans conſcience, and ſo in time to lay in a <hi>fatal power</hi> or a <hi>fatal ſuffering.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We know that power which makes Kingdoms <hi>ſoùndeſt</hi> in their Dominion, and moſt laſting, is the trueſt and wholſomeſt; and ſurely that which ingages them leſt into that part of the ſoul, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which can leſt endure to be oppreſſed, is the ſafeſt and moſt peaceable.</p>

               <p>Your <hi>Queſtion</hi> was accordingly put by you, and accordingly <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered</hi> by me. And for my appearing for <hi>Truth</hi> not all at once in my Treatiſes, you may ſee I was not haſty to beleeve, nor to write in the behalf of a Truth before I ſaw it, nor to plunge my ſelf into any Way till I had examined it.

in thoſe degrees but by <hi>Scripture</hi>-warrant. And I could name to you examples of another ſort; <hi>Auguſtine, Luther,</hi> both finding <hi>truth</hi> but in <hi>degrees;</hi> and the latter ſweetly acknowledging how he was enlightened by <hi>beam</hi> after <hi>beam.</hi> Angels, who lie more naked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and take in the things they know, by way of <hi>Viſion;</hi> yet ſee not any of that <hi>will</hi> of God which gives <hi>Laws</hi> to them, but as he reveals: Much leſſe ſuch as we who <hi>dwell in houſes of clay,</hi> and whoſe <hi>foundations are in the duſt,</hi> and who come by the <hi>ſight of things diſcourſively,</hi> and by <hi>ſpiritual reaſoning;</hi> God giving in the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Truths in a <hi>natural,</hi> yet <hi>ſupernatural way.</hi>

               <p>But for that Notion of <hi>Independency</hi> you ſpeak on, I dare not own it, becauſe I account my ſelf both under a ſpiritual and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Supremacy; under Jeſus Chriſt and the Magiſtrate ſeverally, and exempt from neither.

And if you call the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Independent</hi> for this, we muſt ſuffer till the Lord bring forth <hi>our righteouſneſſe as the noon-day.</hi> Yet this you and we both know, that when <hi>Truth</hi> would not embody or mingle at any time with <hi>corruptions,</hi> it had preſently the name of <hi>Sect, Schiſm, Faction</hi> (all which are implyed in the name <hi>Independency</hi>) put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.

               <p>And for that you ſay of me in your <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that I am rather <hi>opinionative</hi> then <hi>paſſionate,</hi> I cannot take it ſo ill from you that will needs be no enemy to me: I interpret any thing from ſuch a one on the better ſide of it.

               <p>I wonder he, who hath writ a whole Book of Policie, ſhould be ſo unpolitick as to think it ſeaſonable, ſince it tends to retard the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Government, whereto the Parliament is ſo much ingaged by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Solemn League and Covenant, <hi>Art.</hi> 1. already ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it up in Ordinance for Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though the liberty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lengthens the Debates, and delays the Votes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo much the more, becauſe they are more in number then we, and becauſe their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are final, as ours are not.</p>
               <p>Anſwer.</p>
               <p>For ſome things in my Book of Policy, I praiſe the Lord I can look on them as on part of the darkneſſe I was in: and I can freely joyn with any in cenſuring any unregenerate part in me, as I eſteem much of my Carnal reaſon to be. <hi>When I was a childe, I spake as a childe;</hi> neither <hi>have I any fruit</hi> now (as the Apoſtle ſayes) <hi>of ſome of thoſe things.</hi> Nor would I have any go thither for direction, but ſo far as they find <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>ſound Reaſon.</hi> I cannot but give a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning this Book, becauſe I would have Readers to look on any thing from me, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, as I receive in <hi>light.</hi> And methinks I ſcarce do any thing which I could not with <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when it is done, finde ſomething to <hi>retract</hi> in it: either
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42211:20"/>
ſomething is too <hi>dead,</hi> or too <hi>dark,</hi> or too <hi>carnal.</hi> Thus you ſee I willingly help you againſt my ſelf; and I account it a part of my condition here, not to ſee all at once.</p>
               <p>For the unſeaſonableneſſe of my Quere, you alleadge the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant</hi> in Art. 1. wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to endeavour Reformation; and the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now where is my <hi>unſeaſonableneſſe? The Parliament is endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.

May we diſcover any thing to the <hi>State</hi> we conceive of malignity or danger in Civil things, and not in Spirituals? Is not the Spiritual or ſoul-liberty, the more glorious liberty of the <hi>Subject? We cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard,</hi>

               <p>I have gathered up into one <hi>bundle</hi> your pieces of a <hi>lighter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: I would not ſtay <hi>tything Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> but I haſten to <hi>the weightier matters of the Law.</hi> A word onely to each.</p>
               <p>For baiting my Quere with Truth and Peace, you allude to Chriſt's allegory, that we are <hi>fiſhers of men:</hi> and if I have no worſe things to <hi>bait</hi> with then theſe two, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> none need, I hope, be afraid of the <hi>hook.</hi> And for the proof of them both, <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>time</hi> will evidence.</p>
               <p>For me, <hi>a private Divine, to put a Quere of State and Religion.</hi> What were <hi>John Hus, Wickliff, Luther, Paphnutius,</hi> who in their ſeveral ages gave out their teſtimonies? They were but ſingle men, compared with <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Synods.</hi> Not that I would compare with <hi>them,</hi> who am leſſe then the <hi>leaſt of all the mercies of God;</hi> yet they were but <hi>ſingle,</hi> though <hi>ſingular</hi> men. And what if a <hi>private Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt may bid a private man <hi>ſtand and speak to the people.</hi> There is a <hi>law of the Spirit</hi> commands to ſpeak as well as the <hi>Law of a State;</hi> and though you ſpeak by the <hi>later law,</hi> another may ſpeak by the <hi>former.</hi> And what though a <hi>Quere</hi> both of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> Is not our <hi>Covenant</hi> mixt accordingly of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> Doth not the State it ſelf mix with Religion where Churches are <hi>National?</hi> And how can I ſpeak properly but to <hi>both,</hi> where both are in <hi>intereſt?</hi>

               <p>For that of <hi>my taxing the Miniſters</hi> for deſiring power; none have reaſon to ſpeak but the <hi>guilty;</hi> it concerns not the <hi>innocent.</hi> It is not ſtrange for <hi>ſome Miniſters</hi> to affect <hi>Government,</hi> or rather <hi>ruling:</hi> we have ſo much of <hi>Prelacie</hi> yet left, and working in the Countrey with us; and if not in the City too, I refer you to maſter <hi>Coleman.</hi>

               <p>For the <hi>word rendred from the Original</hi> metaphorically; I quoted onely the Text, to my remembrance, to the Printer's hand; and how he came by the metaphor, I know not; but I finde fault as well as you: However, to make the beſt of it now, <hi>tranſlations</hi> of Scripture are not all <hi>Grammatical,</hi> as you know; nor to the <hi>letter,</hi> as I could wiſh them with you.</p>
               <p>For <hi>artificial colours,</hi> or <hi>Rhetorical,</hi> &amp;c. You make me guilty of ſuch verniſh as I have not laid on, to my knowledge; nor have much to lay on, if I would: <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which were my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are fair enough of themſelves, without any <hi>colour</hi> of mine: and I deſire not to bring forth <hi>either,</hi> but in the <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of the ſpirit; and if there be any thing of their own beauty there, call it not <hi>artificial;</hi> put not <hi>ſuspitions</hi> and <hi>jealouſies</hi> into any, that ſuch things as they ſee are not ſo, to make men <hi>Sceptical.</hi> It is as much injury to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to <hi>miſreport</hi> them, as to <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi> them.</p>
               <p>And for your <hi>logical marſhalling my reaſons,</hi> I thank you; you took more pains with them then I would do.

               <p>Firſt, I know not what Counſellors you mean; but they are too wiſe a Senate to be carried by any <hi>intereſt</hi> but their own; and I wiſh them no other Counſellors then <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> nor do I know that they are ſo fully perſwaded of any ſuch <hi>Government.</hi> I believe ſome of them are not ſo fully principled for your way; and then they all are not perſwaded ſo of the <hi>Government:</hi> nor have you yet been able to make out the <hi>evidence</hi> of every <hi>truth</hi> you preſented them from clear <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſaving your Art of deductions and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and prudence: and if all cannot be perſwaded that <hi>State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> or <hi>Publike conſcience</hi> is not ſo <hi>wholly</hi> nor <hi>fully</hi> perſwaded: then, as you imply, a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Publike conſcience</hi> is like a <hi>Particular conſcience;</hi> which if it doth not <hi>Wholly conſent,</hi> is <hi>doubtful,</hi> or <hi>weak:</hi> for it is not in <hi>Spiritual things</hi> as in <hi>Civil: Votes</hi> of <hi>major parts</hi> make <hi>Laws,</hi> and they ſtand good from any ſuch <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Policie:</hi> but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſaw that <hi>rule</hi> in the Goſpel for any ſuch proceedings in <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things:</hi> but that is a <hi>Law</hi> in Chriſt's Kingdom, not that which is <hi>voted</hi> ſo, but that which <hi>is</hi> ſo in the truth of it: For elſe <hi>Popery</hi> were the beſt; for it hath moſt <hi>voices</hi> and <hi>counſels.</hi> So as unleſſe you can prove the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be of one minde in it, how can you prove a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo fully <hi>perſwaded</hi> in <hi>minde</hi> as you imply? Let them prove a Truth by moſt <hi>voices</hi> that pleaſe or can; but I wiſh the buſineſſe of a <hi>State-conſcience,</hi> in a thing of this nature, were more enquired into then yet it hath been.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:42211:22"/>But if the <hi>Parliament</hi> were fully perſwaded of the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> yet there would be a new queſtion, yea, and is, very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſcuſſed by our worthy Brethren Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, how they could be perſwaded of the <hi>impoſing,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of <hi>ſetling.</hi> For my part, if there muſt be an <hi>impoſing</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> (for I would have the State-conſciences left to their <hi>liberty</hi> as well as Particular, and yet Truth to have the liberty of acceſſe unto them) I would have the power of the Parliament laid up there: we have had too ſad experience when it hath been given out from thence, and truſted too far. <hi>Paul</hi> referred himſelf thither, (<hi>I ſtand,</hi> ſays he, <hi>at Ceſar's Judgement-ſeat)</hi> rather then to the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> Chriſt had more favour from <hi>Pilate</hi> a Romane Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the Prieſt.</p>

Now if they cannot finde ſo much <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> as to warrant it for Chriſt's Government, how can there be a purely Goſpel-warrantable, a <hi>full perſwaſion,</hi> or <hi>faith,</hi> where there wants a <hi>word of faith</hi> to ſecure it?</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall form your Argument you half made to my hand thus, and return another with uſury.</p>
               <p>Your Argument is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe that ſet up a Government which they cannot be fully perſwaded on, cannot but ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, the Parliament cannot be fully perſwaded of this Government:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>if they ſet it up, they cannot but ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My proof is this, in behalf of your Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That conſcience which is not wholly conſenting, is not fully perſwaded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, ſuch is the State or Publike conſcience, viz.</hi> not fully conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time:</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>the State-conſcience is not fully perſwaded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note</p>
               <p>Becauſe ſome are more for it, ſome are leſſe for it.</p>
               <p>I prove the State-conſcience not fully conſenting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That conſcience which hath not Scripture to ſecure it, cannot be fully conſenting or perſwaded:</hi> viz. <hi>as</hi> full perſwaſion <hi>is taken in the</hi> Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, ſuch is the Publike conſcience at this time concerning this preſent Government:</hi> viz. <hi>not</hi> fully perſwaded <hi>from</hi> Scripture <hi>concerning it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42211:22"/>Therefore, <hi>the Publike or State-conſcience cannot be ſo fully conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or perſwaded.</hi> viz. <hi>in a</hi> Scripture-<hi>ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note.</p>
               <p>Becauſe they which cannot call it a <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> are not ſecured concerning it by the <hi>Word;</hi> and then, by conſequence, are not ſo fully conſenting, nor perſwaded.</p>

               <p>If we take his reaſon to ſtand immediately againſt obedience, and ſo conſequently againſt commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is more formal, but ſtill as fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Repugnant to Religion and reaſon, againſt former Proteſtations, and the Covenant; for ſome will always ſcruple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>Some of this might have been ſpared. Let us have as much <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and as little <hi>reviling</hi> as may be. Your reaſon is. Becauſe then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Proteſtations</hi> nor <hi>Covenant</hi> of State can be adminiſtred; for ſome will always ſcruple. So as here is the force of your reaſon; Becauſe <hi>Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> in the State are put upon a <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unwilling</hi> and <hi>malignant,</hi> therefore <hi>Government</hi> ſhould.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a <hi>truth</hi> of Government, and the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of it, is but indirectly, unſutably, and diſproportionably proved from <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants.</hi> Indeed, under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Iſrael, Covenants</hi> were more agreeable to the way of that Church; they were <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> then; and it was a way of <hi>obligation</hi> and <hi>engagement</hi> ſitted more to the <hi>Policie</hi> of that Nation: They were a People or Nation of <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſingled out from the <hi>world,</hi> and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>carnal Ordinance:</hi> and their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was ſitted to the <hi>whole Nation</hi> by God himſelf; and ſo <hi>Covenants,</hi> &amp;c. gathered them up from the <hi>world</hi> into their <hi>National way of Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c. But now, the <hi>way of Church</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> changing, and the <hi>Laws</hi> of ſuch kinde of external <hi>Pedagogie</hi> ceaſing, and a more <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Law</hi> coming in, you might have done well, ere you took things thus for granted, to clear the way of Covenants under the Goſpel, and not to prove one probable thing by another. Thoſe of your way are againſt a little Church-covenant, and why not a great one?</p>
               <p>For the impoſing of <hi>Proteſtations</hi> now, &amp;c. It is not my work here to diſcuſſe; nor am I againſt any way of <hi>State-ſecurity</hi> that may conſiſt with ſound <hi>Prudence:</hi> and for the <hi>spiritual</hi> part of them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42211:23"/>
wherein men <hi>covenant</hi> in the <hi>things of God,</hi> let every one be fully <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own minde:</hi> That is the Apoſtle's <hi>rule,</hi> I am ſure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any ſay to the contray, and will ſtand. In <hi>civil things,</hi> I would have any <hi>way</hi> or <hi>deſigne</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> that is fairly and juſtly Politick: in <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> onely ſuch <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> as are <hi>Gospel-ways,</hi> and may ſute with the <hi>New Testament</hi>-believers.</p>
               <p>And now you are to prove more then perhaps you thought on; that is, to clear a <hi>Church-covenant,</hi> which many of your Way are againſt: for though you condemn it in ſome Churches, not of your Way; yet a <hi>National Church-covenant</hi> you plead for. And how can this be both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> that a <hi>great Church-covenant</hi> is lawful, and a <hi>little one</hi> unlawful? a <hi>National Church-covenant</hi> lawful, and a <hi>Particular</hi> or <hi>Congregational Church-covenant</hi> unlawful? This one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way: To ſhew you how one may miſtake his way in a miſt: you were proving a Government, and now you are engaged to prove Chuch-covenants, which you are both for and againſt.</p>
               <p>And yet, after all this of <hi>Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> there is no fair proof of <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> a <hi>Government,</hi> or <hi>impoſing</hi> it in your way and deſigne from theſe. It is not ſafe going to the <hi>State</hi> for a <hi>Patern</hi> for the Church. If the <hi>State</hi> in certain ſeaſons of <hi>unfaithfulneſſe</hi> and <hi>unsettlement,</hi> contrive any way of <hi>ſecurity</hi> or <hi>aſſurance</hi> (neceſſity is often a <hi>law-maker</hi> in States, yet not ſo in the Church) will you from hence argue for a liberty in the Church? Will you make <hi>Neceſſity</hi> your <hi>Gospel,</hi> your Law-giver there? Neceſſity is ſometimes a <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pender</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but no <hi>Law-maker.</hi>

               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>But, Why of <hi>leſſer moment?</hi> All things are of <hi>moment</hi> in <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi> Indeed if they be ſuch as be not the <hi>Goſpel</hi>'s, they are then, as you ſay, of <hi>leſſer moment:</hi> and yet of moment too, in another ſenſe; for, <hi>Traditions of men make void the Commandments of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are grounds of <hi>Prudence</hi> any Scripture-grounds to rule by. <hi>Prudence</hi> hath let in more <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> then any thing. <hi>Prelacy</hi> had its <hi>Prudence</hi> for every <hi>New additional</hi> in <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> And if <hi>Presbytery</hi> take <hi>Prudence</hi> too, let the Reader judge what may follow.</p>
               <p>And what is that, <hi>Not directly from Scripture, yet not repugnant?</hi> Surely Chriſt's rule is not ſuch; he oppoſes any <hi>Tradition</hi> to the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God. <hi>Not directly from Scripture,</hi> is <hi>repugnant to Scripture:</hi> ſuch is the <hi>oneneſſe, entireneſſe, indiviſibility,</hi> and <hi>eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> of the <hi>Truth.

               <p>Becauſe, for that of their being devoted, it makes againſt ſetting up <hi>Doctrine</hi> as well as <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Authority of Parliament</hi> as well as <hi>Authority of Miniſters:</hi> They, not Miniſters, make Statutes.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>To your firſt, <hi>That inſtruction muſt go before,</hi> I have anſwered to this before, as you propounded it before: One word more will ſuffice. What kinde of <hi>inſtruction</hi> is it you mean, but <hi>authoritative compulſive inſtruction,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Schoolmaſters,</hi> even your own inſtance, and here moſt pertinent, who teaches and whips every one of <hi>thoſe</hi> that will not <hi>underſtand as well as he?</hi> Something an <hi>unreaſonable</hi> way of <hi>correction</hi> in matters of <hi>pure beleef</hi> &amp; <hi>conſcience,</hi> and beſt among boys, as your inſtance implies: Men of <hi>Scripture-conſciences</hi> cannot bear it.</p>
               <p>And for that you ſay <hi>it makes againſt Doctrine as well as Diſcipline:</hi> Yea, in ſome ſort it is granted; for neither <hi>Doctrine</hi> nor <hi>Diſcipline</hi> ought to be forced but in a <hi>Gospel-way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for that you ſay <hi>it makes againſt the Parliament, becauſe they make Statutes:</hi> I anſwer, Nothing makes againſt a <hi>Legiſlative</hi> power, which reduces it to <hi>purer,</hi> and <hi>clearer,</hi> and <hi>freer</hi> Principles: And thus the Parliament very juſtly argues in all their Remonſtrances touching the <hi>King,</hi> while they go about to reduce him to his <hi>just</hi> Rights, from thoſe exorbitancies he ſuffers himſelf to be brought into.

               <p>His ſecond reaſon of experience, That the ſpeedy ſetling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> takes little root but in the outward man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concluding pathetically, <hi>Why, do not dayes ſpeak, and multitude of yeers teach knowledge</hi>? In anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the fault was not in the over-speedy ſetling, but in the choice of a wrong Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>Doctrine</hi> goeth on with <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and ſo the power of the Word may go deep into the conſcience, as a Schoolmaſter who teaches and corrects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is an hedge or wall about the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> a goad to the <hi>Means of Grace,</hi> a curb to <hi>licentious courſes;</hi> though with many it go but to the outward man, that is not to be imputed to the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> but their <hi>corruptions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe where the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> hath been rightly choſen and ſetled, God hath bleſſed it with <hi>better fruits;</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where there is no <hi>Hereſie</hi> nor <hi>Schiſm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For that of <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job, Why, do not dayes ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c. it makes not for his purpoſe; but that Wiſdom is with the ancient, and gray-headed to be heard before young or green-headed counſellors, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>To your firſt, <hi>That the fault was in the choice of a wrong Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, That is the fear now, leſt there ſhould be a choice of a wrong Government, and ſo the ſame fault ſhould be committed again: And this very Government hath no <hi>Image of Divine Right</hi> upon it, nor hath it warrant in all things from the Word, as your ſelf acknowledge.</p>
               <p>To your ſecond, <hi>That Doctrine and Diſcipline go together</hi> &amp;c. Yea, <hi>pure Doctrine</hi> and <hi>pure Diſcipline</hi> go rightly together: and if either
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42211:27"/>
be impure or unſound, there is ſo much the more danger: So as this is an Argument rather againſt you, becauſe where Doctrine opens the conſcience, and lets in any thing of Diſcipline but that of the pure Word, there is one evil onely mended with another.</p>
               <p>And for your Inſtance of a <hi>Schoolmaſter,</hi> who both teaches and corrects: You know we are not to <hi>prove,</hi> but to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> by ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: And that of a Schoolmaſter is a fitter illuſtration for the <hi>Pedagogy</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and that Diſcipline then the Goſpels: You know the Apoſtle uſes it onely to <hi>that; The Law was our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſte,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>To that of your deſcription of the Government <hi>that it is a curb, a goad,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, There is nothing you ſay of Government in theſe words, but may be ſaid of any civil Government, nay, of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> when it was in its primitive form: But that onely which you ought to ſay, and which onely differences it from all deviſed forms of men, as your Covenant binds you, and ought to be your onely reaſon for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and ſetting it up, is this: Is it the Scriptures form or model? Is the people ſo in the exerciſe and capacity of it as in the Goſpel times? If ſo, then you prove ſomething. And further: All this you ſay is true in a kinde too of Chriſts government; but yet, in ſome ſort communicable with deviſed governments. The only diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſſential marks are not to be a curb and goad, but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <hi>onely mark,</hi> and <hi>image,</hi> and ſome <hi>ſpiritual operations,</hi> &amp;c. which no other deviſed form of man hath.</p>
               <p>To your other, of <hi>the bleſſings and bleſſed fruits in</hi> Scotland, <hi>that there is no Hereſie nor Schiſm there,</hi> Let Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> (our learned and pious Brother) ſpeak for us both, from his experiences. And for that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> time will ſhew whether it will prove to be a bleſſing or no, to want that which you call <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Surely to be free from Hereſie and Schiſm, in a Scripture ſenſe, it is ſuch a bleſſing as the whole Goſpel cannot patern. What? No Hereſie in a whole Kingdom? No Schiſm in a whole Kingdom? Never ſuch a pure Church heard on? <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Coloſſe, Jeruſalem, Antioch,</hi> all not comparable? The worſt I wiſh our Brethren there, is, that all were ſo pure as we hear on. Indeed <hi>Scotland</hi> had the honour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us firſt in the work of <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> but leſt <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould be puffed up, <hi>England</hi> ſhall have the glory (I hope) to improve that liberty to a fuller light, which ſome would cloſe up too ſoon, in the narrowneſſe of a Presbytery.</p>
               <p>Methinks there is ſomething of this nature conſiderable in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42211:27"/>
                  <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who though they follow the firſt Light in <hi>Germany,</hi> yet the Lord hath ſuffered them to ſtick there without a fuller Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the firſt may be laſt, and the laſt firſt; For if a State be covenanted ſo cloſe to the Word, they had need be favourable and free to all that are accordingly covenanted; for each mans conſcience is the Interpreter in himſelf of what makes for or againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he takes; and by this very Covenant, you are all to be tender to conſciences, becauſe the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (not power of <hi>men)</hi> can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Will of God; but in their <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>prudential</hi> things onely, they may intrepret <hi>themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To that of</hi> Job, <hi>That with the ancient is wiſdom, and with the gray-headed;</hi> which you apply in way of reproach to the <hi>younger,</hi> whom you call as it were green-heads: I anſwer, That the elder I eſteem as fathers, and the <hi>younger</hi> we know are ſuch in whom the Lord ſpeaks more <hi>gloriouſly,</hi> as he himſelf ſaith, Your <hi>young men</hi> ſhall ſee viſions, and upon your ſons and daughters I will powre out <hi>my Spirit,</hi> your old <hi>men</hi> ſhall <hi>dream</hi> dreams. Now whether is it more excellent to <hi>dream</hi> dreams, or to <hi>ſee</hi> viſions? The Lord delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the young <hi>men</hi> of the Provinces. Surely we may more ſafely hearken to the younger that ſee <hi>viſions of Reformation,</hi> then to the elder that <hi>dream dreams</hi> of it onely.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle's and primitive times are the times we are to look at for a <hi>patern</hi> and <hi>model.</hi> Tis true, there is great diſproportion; for they were Apoſtles who gave the government then; yet are but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Divines, as you ſay by me, if you be compared with them.</p>
               <p>For that of the <hi>converſion from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no ſuch diſproportion there neither, but that very propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath himſelf foretold, and ſet forth: For how doth a <hi>Iewiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichristian State</hi> differ? Nay, how doth a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42211:28"/>
                  <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> or <hi>Paganiſh</hi> State, differ from an <hi>Antichristian</hi> or <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial</hi> State, as <hi>Parochial</hi> or <hi>Pariſh</hi> is in that notion? Chriſt hath put them that are out of the Church under that very <hi>notion, Matth.</hi> 19.17. and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> makes the Antichriſtian State to be as unlawful as a <hi>Paganiſh,</hi> and calls out equally from that as from the other, as by comparing 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4. together will appear.</p>
               <p>So, as ſpeaking of things and notions, I cannot but ſpeak in a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture way; nor am I uncharitable in this neither, though I thus ſpeak; I look on thouſands in this State as godly beleevers: It is not the Paſtors I write againſt, but the way. There may be a <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court; a <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s houſe; a <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man, though out of the <hi>Church;</hi> a <hi>Luther</hi> even in <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Lord enlighten.</p>
               <p>So as <hi>government</hi> and <hi>diſcipline</hi> is a <hi>Churches right,</hi> and <hi>priviledge,</hi> not the <hi>worlds</hi> and <hi>nations priviledges,</hi> as ſo and then.

Surely that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> is the Churches; and that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Proverbs,</hi> makes not for the diſcipline of a Church at all.</p>

               <p>I agree with you in that too, yet not ſo fully; for <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>great Prophet</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> preached the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all compariſons,</hi> in <hi>ſalt, water, leven, muſtard ſeed, ſowers, husbandmen, vines, vineyards,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I agree with you; and here the Controverſy might be ended: If your Temples ſhall be of <hi>living ſtones;</hi> the Controverſy is granted: But becauſe I will not ſeem to miſtake you, I beleeve the <hi>ſpirituall building</hi> you mean, and I, are not the ſame here: You mean as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the <hi>inviſible ſpirituall,</hi> or <hi>Church myſticall;</hi> and yet <hi>there,</hi> all is not ſo <hi>Homogeneall</hi> and of the ſame kinde neither: The <hi>head</hi> of the body is <hi>both God and man,</hi> and one <hi>member</hi> like one <hi>ſtar</hi> differs from <hi>another</hi> in <hi>glory.</hi>

               <p>It is true; But what is that to <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion drives up to?

               <p>And doth <hi>He</hi> rule any in his Church with his <hi>Rod of Iron,</hi> who were not called in firſt by his <hi>Golden Scepter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for that of his <hi>Iron rod</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. that is ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not as <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> but of <hi>Nations.</hi>

               <p>To that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.19. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>The yoke eaſie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they make not againſt a ſpeedy, but a grievous Government;</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſſe my ſelf better then in your own words, They make againſt a <hi>grievous Government,</hi> which is all I aim at in the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And whereas you ſay <hi>the yoke is not eaſie to fleſh and bloud,</hi> ſo ſay I too; it is very burdenſom, and the <hi>Commandements grievous</hi> to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate;</hi> and therefore I prove from hence, that it is onely a fit and ſutable yoke for the <hi>Saints,</hi> and a <hi>Commandement</hi> for them. And there is the ſame <hi>proportion</hi> of the outward government to the outward <hi>man</hi> that there is of the other <hi>ſpirituall Laws</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the inward <hi>man,</hi> and none but the Saints can delight in either. Men are to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually moulded and framed to the Law of <hi>Goſpel-diſcipline:</hi> that kind of Diſcipline is not like your <hi>civil</hi> Diſcipline: this way of Diſcipline you would have, is too <hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>Nationall;</hi> it takes in a people to ſubdue as the Laws of Civill Policie, which finding a people unſubdued, ſubdues them: So doth not <hi>Chriſt</hi> as we read of; the diſpenſation of the Word (not the government) ſubdues.</p>
               <p>And thus with much ado, you only prove them to be as I intended them, no <hi>Commandements</hi> for the <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>unregenerate,</hi> or in a word, <hi>Chriſts government</hi> no <hi>Nationall government.</hi>

               <p>To that where you ſay, <hi>Nor hath his place any ſober ſenſe</hi> in it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.17. The <hi>new wine will be alwayes new, and the longer delayed, the older the bottles will be.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
               <p>I wonder that one of your experience in the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>pleaſant</hi> with a <hi>Scripture allegory,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Scripture</hi> is of <hi>wine.</hi> You jeſt on it, as if it had made the <hi>ſenſe</hi> leſſe ſober, I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my <hi>younger</hi> pen ſhould reprove the <hi>aged</hi> for <hi>jeſting,</hi> which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> ſayes <hi>is not convenient.</hi> And truly it is not comely for the <hi>ſervants</hi> to play upon the <hi>Maſter of the Feaſt,</hi> or any thing in his houſe, eſpecially upon his wine, which alludes ſo to his <hi>blood,</hi> and which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>drink</hi> with us <hi>new</hi> in his <hi>Fathers Kingdom.</hi>

               <p>Nor will the Bottles be <hi>older,</hi> as you ſay, the longer the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is delayed, if the <hi>power of the Word</hi> be there for <hi>renewing them.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The acts and times for divine Providence towards his Church are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.

               <p>My proof was to ſhew there was no ſuch <hi>morall neceſſity</hi> of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe it was not ſetled. Now, what have you overthrown here?

               <p>But, to anſwer you in your ſcope:</p>
               <p>You bring this to prove, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not to be imitated in all things. I grant it. But what is that to prove that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſetled not his <hi>Government</hi> when he began his <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> or <hi>Johns?</hi> For the buſines on your part is to find out, either that the <hi>Government</hi> was ſetled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or with the <hi>Miniſtery;</hi> or there was as much <hi>neceſſity</hi> of it as of the <hi>Word;</hi> but for ſome <hi>reaſon;</hi> and not from any <hi>thing</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> but ſome other <hi>extrincicall reaſon;</hi> it was delayed: Which ought not to take <hi>place</hi> now.</p>

               <p n="2">2. You muſt prove but the ſame again, that the <hi>government</hi> you have, is the <hi>government,</hi> there withall <hi>Goſpel-neceſſaries</hi> take in; elſe, though the <hi>Goſpel-government</hi> be never ſo <hi>old,</hi> yours is but <hi>new;</hi> and this Argument is no better then the firſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Till then, you ſee with all you can do, you cannot prove but Chriſts government was divers yeers in bringing forth by himſelf and his Apoſtles; and ſo by your own account, you ought not to be before them, unleſſe you aſſume fuller Revelations of truth then they did.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader judge whether any of theſe makes for the <hi>ſetting</hi> up your <hi>government,</hi> or the taking <hi>down</hi> my <hi>reaſons.</hi>

What have you got now by your Logick?</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay in your ſecond, Chriſt gave gifts and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for government; I anſwer, If <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>Pariſhes</hi> have ſuch <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>qualifications</hi> as in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſet it up when you pleaſe; if not what haſte?</p>

               <p>The Biſhops government being put downe, it is neceſſary ſome other ſhould be ſet up, and before all the Preſbyteriall.</p>

               <p>Indeed it is unequall: It is betwixt a government of <hi>man</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> as you confeſſe, and a <hi>Scripture-government;</hi> betwixt an huge Nationall Government, and <hi>Chriſts little flocke,</hi> or <hi>Church.</hi> Nor is it a Controverſie with the <hi>high Court</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> we contend not with them, but humbly <hi>petition</hi> and <hi>repreſent</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> unto them: but this is the old way to winde in under the <hi>wing</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> and to engage them.

               <p>But how is this? Is a <hi>legall preſcription</hi> better hold then a <hi>Goſpel preſcription?</hi> Is it more priviledge to be founded upon a <hi>Statute,</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> then <hi>Scripture?</hi>

               <p>To the ſecond <hi>Objection</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> of Hereſies and Schiſms, and ſo they might have done from <hi>Iohn's</hi> firſt Sermon, he ſaith,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why doth he begin at <hi>Iohns</hi> firſt Sermon? Were not the <hi>Eſſeans, &amp;c.</hi> Hereticks and Schiſmaticks? <hi>See</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He makes <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> which from <hi>Iohn's</hi> firſt Sermon to the last, make up Twenty nine yeers. After the Epiſtles, he brings in the ſending the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was but five yeeres after the firſt Sermon of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Before the end of the Epiſtles, that Government was not which we finde in Scripture; and if ſo, the Church-government was not long ſuſpended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor would it prejudice our expedition: People of that Age could not be ſo eaſily gathered as with us they may be.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42211:40"/>5. What was long in eſtabliſhing in Primitive times, cannot be ſaid to be haſtily done now, after ſo many diſcuſſions and delibrate reſolutions.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>You ſay firſt, <hi>Why begin I for Hereticks and Schiſmaticks from</hi> Iohn's <hi>firſt Sermon:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin there, becauſe there began the <hi>myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And yet I ſhew you that no <hi>Government</hi> began with that <hi>Goſpel manifeſtition;</hi> by which I made appeare that if Government had been of ſuch <hi>moral neceſſity,</hi> why was it not <hi>given out</hi> with the Goſpels firſt <hi>giving out</hi>?</p>
               <p>Now you prove in a <hi>chronologicall</hi> diſcourſe the ſpace of <hi>time</hi> from <hi>Iohns Sermon</hi> to <hi>Pauls Epiſtle,</hi> to make the <hi>time</hi> appeare for <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And, after you have ſummed up all the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>periods,</hi> and finde it no two or three <hi>yeers</hi> work, you conclude People of that age could not be ſo eaſily gathered as now: Nor the <hi>long eſtabliſhing</hi> then to be an <hi>haſty eſtabliſhing</hi> now.</p>
               <p>And now, after all this <hi>diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>ravellings</hi> out of <hi>time</hi> from <hi>Iohns Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. What have you gained? Not that the <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was ſoone ſetled. Then you have proved (much to my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and in a clearer and fuller computation then <hi>I</hi> did) the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> So as you have onely beene taking ſome <hi>learned paines,</hi> if you well obſerve, and the <hi>Reader</hi> well obſerve you, to prove that the <hi>Government</hi> at firſt was not ſuddenly caſt into <hi>modell</hi> nor <hi>brought forth</hi> in <hi>practice,</hi> which is the very thing <hi>I</hi> aimed at; and truely your paines in it have beene more exact then mine; and I thank you for it.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <hi>It ought not to be ſo now; nor can it be ſaid to be hastily done now, that was done ſo long ago.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay true in that: But you know the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale</hi> it that <hi>formed</hi> it; and it formed it at firſt by <hi>degrees:</hi> and the way of <hi>Revelation</hi> hath beene more <hi>yeeres</hi> then the firſt <hi>forming;</hi> reckon but your <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> yeeres as exactly as you have done your firſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> yeeres, and you may be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. So as all, both the firſt <hi>Revelation</hi> of it from Propheſies, and the latter from <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> makes all for the not haſtening, which I aimed at.</p>
               <p>Indeed if you can as infallibl aſſurey us this <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>model</hi> is the very <hi>forme</hi> then given out, it were very true that you ſay, <hi>That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be haſtily done now, what was done ſo long ago:</hi> viz. <hi>If it be that very one which was done ſo long ago.</hi>

               <p>Maſter <hi>Ley</hi>'s Reſolution. Pag. 40. &amp; 41.</p>
               <p>To that of Hereſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſaith;</p>
               <p>What if they do not ſtir up their Patrons againſt the State, &amp;c. but they buſily poyſon the ſouls of the people; and ſhall they (if as <hi>Paul Beſt</hi>) be ſuffered to blaſpheme, and reproach, and perturb the publike Peace? An Indulgence much like old <hi>Elies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If Truth be not more precious then Peace, Why doth our Saviour ſay, He came not to ſend Peace? and why do the Fathers contend ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> about a letter? And why we ſo with the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion rather then be at Peace with them?</p>
               <p>For that <hi>of morall tranſgreſſions, he would have the Magiſtrates ſet on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Set on? By whom? We have not ſuch mean thoughts of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate as to make mention of him in ſuch terms of diſparagement.</p>
               <p>And for all his Diſciplines regulating men for religious walking, there will be worke enough for the Magistrate to bring them under ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill tryall for contumacy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>What? If hereſies ſtir not up, they poyſon ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they poyſon, let the Goſpel antidote be applyed then, and no other way which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> will not bear nor allow; there is the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>weapons</hi> not <hi>carnall,</hi> but <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that of old <hi>Elies</hi> indulgences which you ſpeak on, you are ſtill looking upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> though you tell us of <hi>Christ.</hi> Make the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>England</hi> the ſame; a <hi>Iewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> State the ſame; and then we ſhall allow you both <hi>Elies</hi> ſin, and his <hi>ſons maintenance</hi> by <hi>tythes</hi> and <hi>offerings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Truth is more precious then Peace;</hi> yet there is a <hi>Peace</hi> precious as well as <hi>Truth,</hi> even the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the buſineſſe; You would prove <hi>Truth</hi> to be precious, to the diſadvantage of <hi>Peace;</hi> and therefore you bring in the <hi>Fathers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and us againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> againſt <hi>peace:</hi> But what would you prove?

               </p>
               <p>But, What of the <hi>contentions</hi> ſpoken on of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> &amp;c. If there be any quarrelling for <hi>Truth</hi> either by the <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>us,</hi> but in a <hi>Goſpel-way,</hi> we are not excuſable; neither doth <hi>Christ</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Truths</hi> drawing <hi>ſwords,</hi> but of <hi>ſwords</hi> drawn againſt Truth; which is no Argument for you. When <hi>Peter</hi> would draw a <hi>ſword</hi> in the defence of <hi>Truth, Chriſt</hi> bid him put it up. So far is he againſt your way of defending Truth.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>By whom ſhould Magiſtrates be ſet on?</hi> and <hi>that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak in ſuch diſparaging words.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>There will be work for the Magiſtrate enough, to puniſh the contumacious, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>To that of <hi>Truth being otherwiſe armed from Heaven,</hi> I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>We think it not meet to divide the ſubſervient means from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power, nor the exerciſe of Diſcipline from his aſſiſtance who can make it effectuall, the ſword of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Gidion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that of <hi>the imputation of jealouſie, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a godly jealou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The faulty jealouſie is theirs that would ſtifle the Government: but there is a fear which we profeſſe of Gods anger for connivence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with hereticall men <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is in ſome an averſeneſſe to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie in a true zeal and love of God.</p>
               <p>There be many other cauſes of jealouſie, but I will take but that one of the Lords and Commons, <hi>p.</hi> 43.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Maſter Saltmarſh</hi> had well conſidered who were engaged, &amp;c. he

               <p>Reply.</p>
               <p>You ſay you cannot <hi>divide Diſcipline from his aſſiſtance, who can make it effectuall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is from the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> This is a ſigne without further Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that you do not hold your <hi>government</hi> for <hi>Chriſts,</hi> because it cannot be <hi>effectuall</hi> of it ſelfe, without help from <hi>below,</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> and to another <hi>power</hi> then <hi>its own;</hi> nor is the <hi>ſword</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Gideon</hi> any fair and juſt proof for joyning <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy;</hi> it joyns onely <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Magiſtates.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But then they are <hi>warrantable</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi>-ways of <hi>ſecurity.</hi> That is no <hi>godly Jealouſie</hi> which ſets up other wayes; as <hi>Herod</hi> killing all the <hi>children</hi> to ſecure his Kingdome; <hi>David</hi> diſſembling to eſcape; <hi>Jacob</hi> to get a <hi>bleſſing:</hi> there is Jealouſie, but no godly Jealouſie nor warrantable ſecurity. So to ſecure any <hi>way,</hi> though of <hi>truth,</hi> by a <hi>power</hi> not allowed on in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as no ſuch compulſive power is in your way, is not to be <hi>jealous</hi> with a godly <hi>Jealouſie;</hi> though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but ſome of thoſe may be <hi>godly</hi> who are ſo <hi>jealous,</hi> but not in <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſay that <hi>ſome fear Gods anger for their Communion with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know all ſuch <hi>fear</hi> is onely <hi>warrantable</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> not in the <hi>world:</hi> It is not ſo with the <hi>Nations</hi> now as with the <hi>Iews.</hi> Now if we have not <hi>communion</hi> with them in the <hi>Nation,</hi> we muſt go out of the <hi>world.</hi> But, What <hi>communion</hi> is this you mean that will bring <hi>Gods anger</hi>?
