         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Secondly, the whole discourse of this Libeller is</hi> superfluous <hi>and impertinent: for what is this to the truth of religion, or what preiudice to the common cause, if some few places should by some ouersight be mistaken?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The matter which the Libeller aimeth at, by other mens reading (as it seemeth) rather then his owne, is in</hi> Luthers <hi>booke,</hi> de Miss. priuat.<note place="margin">A slaunder of Luther, that hee should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse hee was stirred vp of the diuell, to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Masse.</note> tom. 7. <hi>where</hi> Luther <hi>indeede reporteth, in the beginning of that treatise, how the diuell tempted him in the night, and set before him his hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, in the celebrating of priuate Masses, contrary to the institution of Christ, and that therein he committed most grosse idolatrie, in worshipping bread and wine in steed of the bodie and bloud of Christ. And whereas it might be said vnto him, that the diuell is a lier, he answereth:</hi> Ipse sic adoritur: The diuell so setteth vpon a man, that first he apprehendeth some solide truth, that cannot bee denied, &amp; so doth turne and tosse it, and doth cast such goodly shew vpon a lie, that hee may deceiue the most circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: <hi>as that thought, that stroke</hi> Iudas heart, was true, I haue betrayed innocent bloud:
<pb facs="tcp:14822:10"/>
               <hi>But this was a lie: Ergo,</hi> you must despayre of the mercie of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So</hi> Luther <hi>saith,</hi> The diuell lieth not, when he vrgeth a mans sinne: Confessus quidem sum, &amp;c. <hi>I confessed being ouercome by the law of God, before the diuell, that I had sinned, and was damned as</hi> Iudas: sed verto me ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum cum Petro: <hi>but I turne my selfe vnto Christ with</hi> Peter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the summe of the whole narration, there set downe by</hi> Luther <hi>of this temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Any man may now see the cauilling spirits of Papists:</hi> Luther <hi>onely reporteth how Sathan dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his hypocrisie and idolatrie, while he was a Masse priest, not to stirre him vp against the Masse, but to bring him into despayre; but that God deliuered him with</hi> Peter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They may say as well that when Sathan sifted</hi> Peter, <hi>and set before him his sinne, which drew such bitter teares from</hi> Peter, <hi>that Sathan mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to repentance: or that when</hi> Paul <hi>felt the pricke of his flesh, the messenger of Sathan sent to buffet him, whereupon he betooke him to prayer, that Sathan also stirred the Apostle to prayer. So then</hi> Luthers <hi>conuersion and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Masse was a sequell, but no effect of Sathans temptation: the diuell intended his confusion, God thereby wrought his conuersion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like cauill against</hi> Luther <hi>is vttered by</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>and vented againe by the Libeller, pag.</hi> 167. that Luther thinketh that if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

himself should minister the Sacraments, that they might bee fruitfull and effectuall: <hi>whereas</hi> Luther <hi>saith not if the diuell himselfe, that is in his owne person, as the diuell: but these are his words,</hi> ego pono, <hi>but I set downe this,</hi>

               <hi>that if</hi> I should afterward know, the diuell irrepsisse, to haue crept into the office of a pastor of the church, &amp; in the shape of a man to be called to preach and baptize, &amp;c. that the Sacraments therefore are not without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie. <hi>Thus they curtall and mangle his words, and alter his meaning at their pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vntrue also it is, that the Apocalypse hath no more ancient authoritie, then the Councell of Carthage, p.</hi> 130. <hi>That</hi> Leo <hi>confirmed not, that the bloud issuing out of a certaine Crucifixe, was the bloud of Christ, pag.</hi> 131. <hi>That</hi> Gregorie 7. <hi>was not a sorcerer and adulterer. pag.</hi> 159. <hi>That it is a fabulous tale of the taking vp of diuers thousands heads of children in</hi> Gregories <hi>mote, pag.</hi> 160. <hi>That father</hi> Fox <hi>is belied, whereas he is truly alleaged contradict. 5. pag.</hi> 166. <hi>That it is a lie, that</hi> Nectarius <hi>abrogated priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, contradict.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 169. <hi>That the ancient fathers are called heretikes, contradict.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 177. <hi>That we should hold, that adulterie, murther, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, in the regenerate are no sinnes, contrad.</hi> 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 202. <hi>These apparant vntruths the Libeller vttereth, as more at large may be seene in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall answers: and therefore he is worthie of</hi> Esops <hi>reward, who being asked what liers gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>

               <hi>Secondly, this Libeller is not free from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions: he affirmeth, that</hi> Saul <hi>was elected, and yet damned, pag.</hi> 191. <hi>contrarie to the opinion of</hi>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, the Libeller himselfe is full of falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>

He doth the like, pag.</hi> 247. <hi>falsific.</hi> 10. <hi>as is declared also in the defence, pag.</hi> 226. <hi>falsific.</hi> 5. <hi>in alleaging a canon of the Councell of Colen, in these words,</hi> to heare Masse, <hi>he addeth</hi> Masse, <hi>of</hi>

               <hi>his owne. Pag.</hi> 268. <hi>corrup.</hi> 7. <hi>he misreporteth the words inferring thus:</hi> He maketh S. <hi>Paul</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme absolutely that faith worketh by loue. <hi>See the correction of that corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, he is found to be a corrupter of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: as pag.</hi> 123. <hi>vntruth</hi> 1. the scripture saith it was Samuel, <hi>whereas the scripture saith only,</hi> Saul knew it was Samuel. <hi>Pag.</hi> 141. <hi>vntruth</hi> 11. <hi>he readeth,</hi> Saul an elect and good man, 1. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 9. 2. <hi>for,</hi> Saul was a goodly young man and faire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus it is euident how the Libellers eyes were blinded, and hoodwinked with selfeloue toward himselfe, and hatred toward others, that while he prieth to finde faults abroad, he forgetteth his owne at home. He should haue remembred our Sauiours words to the Iewes, Ioh.</hi> 8.

               <pb facs="tcp:14822:12"/>
               <hi>examined himselfe: whereas now the reproch, which he would fasten vpon others, of</hi> vntruths, contradiction, falsification, corruption, <hi>is cast vpon himselfe.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the first:</hi> 1. <hi>Though the defender take not vpon him to be a principall dealer in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, nor to be a professed challenger, as the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler boldly aduentureth: but doth confesse with</hi> Augustine: Absit vt mihi apud catholicos<note place="margin">Cont.

            <p>2. <hi>Yet he maketh no doubt to encounter with this chalenger, and is assured he is able to defend, whatsoeuer by him can be impugned: neither doth he shew himselfe such a terrible hackster, but that a</hi> Protestant pygmie, <hi>as he scornefully calleth him, at any time dare grapple with this</hi> Popish pusio: <hi>who euery where bewrayeth his</hi>

            <p>3. <hi>Because our aduersaries doe make great brags, and pretend a desire, that a free disputation and confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may be had, I will briefly shew, that they intend nothing lesse, then to haue the trueth decided by a sober and indifferent conference, but onely to shew their wrangling spirits and froward nature, as may appeare by experience alreadie had of their attempts on that behalfe. First, in the disputation held at Westminster in the beginning of her Maiesties raigne, the popish disputers did behaue themselues very frowardly:</hi> 1. <hi>Where</hi>
               <note place="margin">The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of Popish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters.</note> 
               <hi>they were appointed to deliuer their minds in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they contrariwise appointed one to repeate their minde in speech.</hi> 2. <hi>When he had finished, they were asked if they had any more to say, and they answered no: yet afterward when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants had propounded their writing, they said they had much more to say.</hi> 3. <hi>Vpon the second day, whereas they were appointed to conferre of the second question, the popish Bishops stood vpon it, that they would first tender their minde in the first question.</hi> 4. <hi>They alleaged that they were commaunded to prouide their writing in Latin, whereas neuer any other order was taken, but that they should write in English.</hi> 5. <hi>Whereas</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14822:17"/>
               <hi>they were appointed to begin, they utterly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and so through their wilfulnes the disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brake off. See the report hereof penned by Master</hi> Fox. <hi>pag.</hi> 2119.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the like cariage were certaine Iesuites,</hi> Hungerus, Gretserus, Tannerus, <hi>that disputed at Ratisbone this last yeer</hi> 1602. <hi>with</hi> Hunnius, Helbronnerus, <hi>with other Ministers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine confession:</hi> 1. <hi>They before they would dispute, would haue the Ministers to proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be of the Church, and that they had the spirit of God.</hi> 2. <hi>They propounded a question impertinent concerning</hi> Vbiquitie. 3. <hi>In their disputation</hi> Tannerus, <hi>with histrionicall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, lowd outcries, scurrilous scornings, and unseemely gibings,</hi> pudoris claustra perrupit, <hi>became impudent, as the reporter writeth.</hi> 4. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he could not answere, he said nothing, but</hi> nego consequentiam, nego consequentiam, <hi>I denie the consequence, I denie the consequence.</hi> 5. Plus centies clamatum, respondeatur in forma: <hi>Aboue an hundred times they cried out, answere in forme. 6. They refused to dispute in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tongue. 7. When the Scriptures were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, they answered</hi> nihil ad rem, <hi>nothing to the purpose:</hi> ex Egidio Hunnio. <hi>Before this a conference was appointed at</hi> Wormes, <hi>where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Protestants would haue the Scripture to be the iudge of controuersies; the Colloquie was broken off. In like manner the Colloquies at</hi> Aldenburge, Mompelgard, Baden, <hi>by like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14822:17"/>
               <hi>were without fruite:</hi> ibid. <hi>And here</hi> (<hi>I thinke</hi>) <hi>I see the old peruerse Donatists come foorth againe vpon the stage, who in like manner behaued themselues in the Collatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Bishops.</hi> 1. <hi>Where it was agreed that eighteene onely of each side should come to the conference, the Donatists would haue all of their side admitted, which were all assembled to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aged men that could not come.</hi> 2. <hi>They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, that the day prescribed for the conference was past, and would haue had the Catholikes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against by default, where they were not faultie at all.</hi> 3. <hi>They required the presence of</hi>

               <hi>all the Catholikes that had subscribed, least any might be rehearsed that were not Bishops: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they had foisted in ones name, whom they (to make a cleanly excuse) affirmed to be dead in the way.</hi> 4. <hi>Whereas the Catholikes said they had</hi> 120. <hi>Bishops more at home, the Donatists affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the same for themselues, whereas they had said before, they were all come to the very aged men.</hi> 5. <hi>They desire a respite of sixe daies, which</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collat. 2. diei.</note> 
               <hi>was granted them. 6. They contend,</hi> quinam erant petitores collationis, <hi>which of them were the first mouers and crauers of that collation. 7. The Donatists striue for the name</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. 8. <hi>They obiect that the Catholikes did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> alienam causam, <hi>a cause not belonging to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collat. 3. diei.</note> 
               <hi>them. 9. When the Catholikes began to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their matter, the Donatists with noise inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them, and would not suffer them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14822:18"/>
               <hi>and hardly could the President of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> Marcellinus <hi>obtaine their silence and patience.</hi> 10. <hi>When as they were bid to sit, they wilfully refused, saying,</hi> It is written, I will not sit in the assemblie of the wicked. 11. <hi>When the Critensian Councell was alleaged, they tooke exception against it that it had</hi> consulem &amp; diem, <hi>the Consul and the day, otherwise then ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall decrees haue, which was vntrue, as the Catholikes shew both by the ancient prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that bare date of the yeere, and the Councell of Melchiades.</hi> 12. <hi>They take exception, that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. post. collation.</note> 
               <hi>sentence was giuen against them in the night. And by these and such other friuolous allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that Collation was made frustrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now because he maketh mention of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour which the French Protestants obtained with the King for a conference: I will briefly also shew, what manner of fauour it was, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different the proceeding there vsed. First, the Lord of</hi> Plessis <hi>desired, that whereas the Bishop of</hi> Eureux <hi>pretended diuers authors to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in his booke against the Masse, that his whole booke might be examined, which could not be granted. Secondly, whereas the Bishop had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken exception to 500. places,</hi> Plessis <hi>required, that the rest might be held as iustifiable, which neither was yeelded vnto. Thirdly, that the Bishop should propound those</hi> 500. <hi>places to the Lord</hi> Plessis, <hi>that he might make satisfaction: but neither could this be obtained, pag.</hi> 8. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14822:18"/>
               <hi>the Bishop would haue</hi> Plessis <hi>proceeded against</hi>
               <note place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the B. of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux, and the Lord of Plessis, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the French King.</note> 
               <hi>for default of appearance, being vncalled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded, pag.</hi> 5. <hi>Fiftly, he is denied his action of slaunder against the Bishop, if he could not proue the</hi> 500. <hi>places pretended to be corrupted. Sixtly, the issue is this,</hi> Plessis <hi>must presently without further warning make satisfaction vpon the opening of the booke, or els it should be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in his absence, pag.</hi> 11. <hi>and so about two of the clocke in the night the Bishop sent him</hi> 60. <hi>places, to the which he should make satisfaction the next day at eight of the clocke. So these</hi> 500. <hi>places were brought to</hi> 60. <hi>but only nine of them were discussed: in some of them the iudges suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in some they gaue sentence with</hi> Plessis, <hi>in some they were importuned by the Bishop to giue their verdict: in the rest they shewed too much partialitie in iudging otherwise then there was cause. The report of this conference is extant, translated out of French. Now all men may see, that these popish challengers stand altogether vpon aduantages, and call for a disputation, not because they are able to say more then their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or can expect any better successe, but to set a good face vpon the matter, that they should not seeme to say nothing. A wrangler cannot want words: and they care not, as</hi> Ambrose <hi>saith,</hi> Vt intus in animo perdat, foris victor abscedat: <hi>Though they lose a good conscience within, so they may get the victorie without. And such are their disputations, as</hi> Hierome <hi>saith of</hi>

this is directly expressed in scripture, Act. 11. vers. 26. <hi>The disciples of Antioch were the first that were called Christians:</hi> but for the name<note place="margin">The name Christian more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then Catholike.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, the practise of our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the same.

                  <p>Secondly, if <hi>Augustine</hi> were present, it can not be thought that he would subscribe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his owne iudgement: for whereas the Canon rehearseth fiue bookes of <hi>Salomon, Augustine</hi> thinketh that the booke of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus &amp; Wisedome of <hi>Salomon</hi> were only so called, <hi>propter nonnullam eloquij similitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> for some similitude of the stile, <hi>de ciuitat.

if their meaning had been to make these bookes absolutely Canonicall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, seeing the Canon of the Scriptures was confirmed before this Councell, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged<note place="margin">Two and twentie bookes of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament only cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall.</note> of the Fathers, who make but 22. bookes of the Old Testament, excluding all those which we hold to be Apocrypha: as <hi>Origen apud Euseb. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>Athanas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherefore they must bee vnderstood to take this word Canonicall in a large sense, for all those bookes which were allowed to bee read in the Church, whereof there were two sorts: some were read, <hi>ad authoritatem ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticorum dogmatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> confirmandam,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, such were the right Canonicall: some <hi>ad aedificationem plebis,</hi> for the edifying of the people, of which sort were the bookes of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, Iudith,</hi> with the rest: <hi>Hieron. praefat. in Prouer.</hi> And these were called <hi>Hagiographa, Hieron. praefat. in Tobiam:</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastici,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall bookes: the other <hi>Canonici,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall: <hi>Cyprian. in symbol.</hi> This difference of the holie writings is allowed by <hi>Sixtus Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>bibliothec.

that those books are called <hi>Protocanonici,</hi> Canonicall of the first sort, that are found in the Hebrue Canon: the other, <hi>Deuterocano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nici,</hi> Canonicall of the second sort: and in this sense doth the Councell of Carthage call the Apocryphall bookes Canonicall.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, it is neither absurd, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true to say that the Laodicene Councell, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to make mention of the Apocalypse among the Canonicall bookes, at that time iudged it also not to bee canonicall, for the authoritie of that booke was a long time doubted of: for the Councell calleth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes beside those rehearsed, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, bookes not canonicall.</p>
                  <p>3. But the Libeller hath vttered a great vntruth, that the Apocalypse hath no more ancient authoritie then the Councel of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, which was about <hi>anno</hi> 420. seeing that <hi>Origen</hi> long before holdeth it to be canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: <hi>Homil.</hi> 7. <hi>in Iosuam:</hi> where rehearsing the books of the New Testament, as of the foure Euangelists, the Acts of the Apostles, 14.

                  <p>The Libeller then might haue been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise occupied, then here to haue noted an

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:14822:38"/>Secondly, the Libeller produceth certaine reasons to shew that their religion hindreth not good life, but tendeth to vertue: 1. They teach, that a man by grace may keepe the Commaundements, whereas we say it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, which is a discouragement to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the other saith he, is an encouragement. <hi>Contrà:</hi> Nay rather theirs is a desperate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, because wee see by experience, that there is not the perfitest man, but offendeth against the law, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>In many things we sinne all,</hi> Iam. 3. 2. and therefore they perswade men, in so teaching, to build vpon a false ground, and to deceiue their owne<note place="margin">Popery stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to godlines of life.</note> soules: whereas wee teach them, that they must seeke their righteousnes, not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the law, but in the obedience of faith, yet doe exhort them, that they walke worthie of their calling: S. <hi>Paul</hi> thus saying: <hi>Not hauing mine owne righteousnes, which is by the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,</hi> Philip. 3. 9. was not therefore discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from vertue, but encouraged, saying, vers. 13. <hi>I forget that which is behind, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour my selfe to that which is before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Whereas we teach, that the motions of the flesh be sinfull, though a man consent not vnto them, because the law saith, <hi>Thou shalt not lust,</hi> Rom. 7. 7. they say, they may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of much merit. Which of these will soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perswade to suppresse euill lusts, they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14822:39"/>
that commend them, or they which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, let any reasonable man iudge? I am sure the Apostle biddeth vs mortifie, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the very lust, and rising motions of the heart, not to retaine them as a matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter merit.</p>
                  <p>3. They say their confession and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the temporall paines of purgatorie, the shame of the one, and feare of the other, prouoke to the encrease of vertue: Is not this like to be a goodly vertue, that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in feare, and for shame of men, to whom they are bound to confesse? The Apostle saith, <hi>perfect loue casteth away feare,</hi> 1. Ioh. 4. 18. We rather exhort men to confesse vnto God, that seeth the heart, and from whom nothing can bee hid, rather then in the cares of the Priest. And as for your purgatorie satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may be bought out with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and redeemed with Masses, they doe but make men more secure.</p>
                  <p>4. They hold that no man without spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reuelation can know whether he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate, and that one in Gods grace may fall away. We teach men to be sure of their<note place="margin">Certaintie of saluation nourisheth vertue.</note> saluation: this doctrine (saith hee) breedeth desperate securitie, the other maketh vs <hi>with feare and trembling to worke our saluation.</hi>

not lose his reward: as the Apostle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth 1. Cor. 15. <hi>Wherefore beloued brethren be ye stedfast, &amp;c. alwaies abundant in the worke of the Lord, for as much as ye know, that your work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> And the Apostle saith of himselfe, <hi>The Lord will deliuer me from euery euill worke, and preserue me to his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome,</hi> 2. Timoth. 4. 18. They then which are sure to be preserued vnto life, God will guide them with his spirit, and deliuer them from euill workes; and they also shall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in a godly feare and carefull endeuour worke their saluation: for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the end doth not take away the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the meanes. But contrariwise as S. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>The wauering minded man is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable in all his waies:</hi> So that he which is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering in the hope of saluation, cannot bee throughly resolued or setled to any good worke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Libeller bringeth in <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Iacobus Andrea,</hi> complaining of greater corruptions, where the Gospell is professed, then in <hi>Papatu,</hi> in time of Poperie: whence he inferreth, that it is not their doctrine, but <hi>Caluins</hi> and <hi>Luthers,</hi> that corrupteth good manners. pag. 138.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cont.</hi> 1. Though of some particular sins, and of particular places and persons, euen where the Gospell is professed, iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint may be made, yet it followeth not that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14822:40"/>
generally Protestants manners are worse, then Papists: vnlesse you wil say, that because S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith, <hi>that there was such fornication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Corinthians, as was not once named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles,</hi> that therefore the Gentiles were to be preferred before them.</p>
                  <p>2. The cause of corruption of manners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Protestants is not the doctrine, but their vnthankfull receiuing of it. As where S. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth thus of the Corinthians: <hi>I feare when I come again, least my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many of them, which haue sinned alreadie, and haue not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the vncleannes, fornication, wantonnes, which they haue committed,</hi> 2. Cor. 12. 21. Was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine (thinke you) the cause hereof?</p>
                  <p>3 Against two of our writers that thus complaine of Protestants manners, I can produce more then twenty of theirs, that crie out against popish corruptions: and some of them euen now wee will heare speake in this cause: that it may be euident to all men, that howsoeuer iniquitie in these euill daies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth both among Protestants &amp; Papists, yet thankes bee to God, the Gospell hath brought foorth more true godlines, with the comfortable fruites thereof, then euer was to be seene in Poperie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this is alleaged as an argument to cleere their profession from being an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14822:40"/>
to godly life, because to perfect remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes they require three parts of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, contrition, confession, satisfaction. pag. 139.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cont.</hi> These three we acknowledge, being<note place="margin">Popish pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance no true repen tance.</note> vnderstood according to the Scriptures, are necessarie in euery true penitent person: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sorrow and contrition, with a full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to amend the life; confession to God, and to the congregation publikely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; satisfaction not to God, but to our neighbours for iniuries committed: but as these three are taught and required in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they doe but make hypocrites, they work not true conuersion.</p>
                  <p>1. If contrition do proceed in part from mans free will: if it be not necessarie to haue a resolute and expresse purpose of newnes of life: if it must be perfect: if it bring not assurance of remission of sinnes: if it must be a meanes to iustifie vs: if a man must look to merit by it: if it be not necessarie for small fences as well as great: all which positions our aduersaries doe hold; as may be seene at large Synops. pag. 633. to pag. 640: how is it possible for a man by the popish doctrine to attaine to true contrition, which must take beginning in his owne free will, and end to his owne praise, in seeking to merit by it?</p>
                  <p>2. So likewise, to confesse vpon paine of damnation all sinnes, neuer so secret, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14822:41"/>
they be committed in minde, heart, will, cogitation onely, or in word and worke: and to none but to the Priest: to get absolution at his hands, and to merit by it: and no oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but once in the yeere, as the Papists teach: looke Synops. from pag. 640. to 650. who seeth not how farre this is from true confession, which shuld be principally made to God, not yeerely but daily, and in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, not in a selfeloue of meriting by it?</p>
                  <p>3. Concerning popish satisfaction, to teach, that God must be satisfied by our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall workes, for the punishment due to our sinnes: that the Priest is to that end to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne penance: and that it is in the power of the pastors of the Church to remit the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment: and to applie the merits of Saints, and graunt Indulgences: al which the popish Diuines doe hold and teach, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops. pag. 667. 655. What a miserable and comfortlesse satisfaction is this? which must be wrought by our selues: whereas wee are not able to answere one thing of a thousand, Iob. 9. 3. and wherein wee must looke for our release and indulgence from men: where the Scripture saith of God not of men, <hi>I will be mercifull to their vnrighteousnes, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their sinnes no more,</hi> Heb. 8. 12.</p>
                  <p>I trust it doth already sufficiently appeare, that there is no vntrueth vttered at all, in charging the popish religion to be an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

                  <p>1. First, your doctrine of purgatorie paines, which you say may be eased and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased by the prayers of the liuing, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the soule Priests, and Masses of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem:</hi> as it is an engine to to draw aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to your purses, so it breedeth carnall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie in mens soules, especially in such as are rich, who thinke to leaue behinde them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, howsoeuer they liue in the meane time, to maintaine a Priest to sing for their soules: and therefore one of your owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors saith: <hi>In hoc solo casu melior est conditio diuitis quàm pauperis, quia habet vnde suffragia fiant pro ipso:</hi> In this case onely the estate of the rich is better then the poore, because he<note place="margin">Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> hath wherwith al Suffrages should be made: <hi>Albert mag. de offic.

                  <p>3. The popish doctrine of Pardons and Indulgences, that it is in the power of the pastors of the Church to release <hi>à poena &amp; culpa,</hi> for daies, moneths, yeeres, is in al mens iudgements an open doore to all carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: as the Pardoners of <hi>Leo</hi> 10. did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, that for ten shillings any man should deliuer a soule out of purgatorie at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: <hi>ex Christian.

                  <p>4. They hold that the Sacraments do giue grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the work wrought, and that the faith of the receiuer giueth no effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:14822:42"/>5. They also teach that the wicked do eate in the Sacrament the very bodie of Christ: <hi>Rhemist.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 26. Doe not these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines now tend to great holines and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherby men are made carelesse to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselues, and to be prepared by faith to receiue the Sacraments, &amp; wicked men are made more secure, seeing they are borne in hand, that being as they are, they may bee made partakers of Christs bodie?</p>
                  <p>6. A carnall doctrine also it is, that men may doe more <hi>then is prescribed, and of their</hi>

For by this meanes men are made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to labour for themselues, depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens superabundant workes. But they in so thinking are deceiued: for euery man shall answere for himselfe, one cannot saue anothers soule: Ezech. 14. 20. <hi>Though Noah, Daniel and Iob were in the middest, &amp;c. as I liue saith the Lord, they shall deliuer neither sonne nor daughter.</hi> Vpon which words <hi>Origen</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Vnusquisque in proprio peccato morietur, &amp; in propria iustitia viuet, nihil mihi conducit martyr pater, si male vixero:</hi> Euerie man shall die in his owne sinne, and liue in his owne righteousnes: my father a Martyr shall not profit me, if I liue euill.</p>
                  <p>By these particular points of popish doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I trust it is cleere, that it is not falsely

WHether there be not variance and diuersitie in these two places of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> one while to make the Pope Iudge, another while to ioyne the Cardinals with him, as though hee were not sufficient without them: for why else are they ioyned with him?

First, that we should haue recourse to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the exposition of the Scripture: for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14822:48"/>
he referreth vs to the Councell of Trent, sess. 4. which prescribeth, that sense of the Scripture to bee followed, which either the Church holdeth, or the ioynt consent of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> referreth vs to <hi>a Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the chiefe pastor,</hi> or to <hi>the chiefe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, cum concilio aliorum pastorum, with the counsell of other pastors:</hi> these two being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, with this disiunctiue <hi>siue,</hi> or, cannot be taken in any good construction for all one: as the Libeller doth insinuate p. 147.

                  <p>1. FIrst, what difference I pray you, to say God himselfe is a witnesse to vs, and <hi>the spirit of God is a witnesse</hi> (for this is one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the libeller taketh) is not the spirit of God, God? And think you, that when <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> said, <hi>God himselfe is witnesse,</hi> he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the spirit? As though the inspiration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, protection and preseruation of the Scriptures be not the worke of the spirit of God? 2. Timoth. 3. 16. 2. Pet. 1. 21.</p>
                  <p>Yea but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith in another sense, that God is a witnesse, not by the inward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of his spirit, but <hi>by defending the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from humane profanation by heauenly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Libel. pag. 154.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cont.</hi> 1. Is this a good consequent I pray you? God beareth witnesse to the Scripture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14822:52"/>
sometime by taking vengeance: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not by the inward testimonie of his spirit. Sir Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, if your Logicke had not here failed you, you would not haue made so slender a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh <hi>the great number of miracles the fift witnesse;</hi> doth not the Scripture say, Hebr. 2. 3. <hi>God bearing witnesse thereto with signes and wonders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers miracles?</hi> God then is not a witnesse one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by punishments, but by signes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe saith afterward in the same chapter: <hi>Non omnes per internum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatum Deus docet, &amp;c. sed per corporales literas, quas legeremus &amp; cerneremus, erudire nos vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit:</hi> God teacheth not all by inward inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp;c. but by corporall letters, which we should reade and see, hee would instruct vs. We also refuse immediate reuelations and inspirations: but God by the lection and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of the Scriptures doth instruct vs. God then doth vse the Scriptures themselues as meanes of this spiritual instruction, which is the inward testimonie of Gods spirit, by our outward reading and hearing of the Scripture, inwardly witnessing the truth thereof vnto vs: how much I pray you differ we now?</p>
                  <p>3. Whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh these the witnesses of Scripture: first, the trueth of the prophesies: secondly, the agreement of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14822:52"/>
the holie writers: thirdly, God himselfe: fourthly, the perpetuall truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: may it not wel be gathered hereupon, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinketh, <hi>that God inwardly working in our hearts by the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, which wee finde to be most perfect, conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, true, doth teach vs which is the word of God:</hi> for I pray you, who maketh vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Scriptures, by the truth, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, constancie thereof? doth not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God by these meanes mouing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the heart? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> then is not slaundered at all, when it is affirmed, that in this place, he holdeth as wee doe concerning the meanes, how to know the Canonicall Scriptures: for we also teach, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by no forren or extrinsecall meanes, but from themselues, the veritie, harmonie, holines thereof, (the spirit of God hereby working in our hearts) are knowne to be the word of God.</p>
                  <p>2. Secondly, let it be seene whether in a different sense <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and wee in this place (for I deale no further) doe make the Scriptures witnesses to themselues. These are his words: <hi>Fourthly, the Scripture it selfe is witnesse, whose prophesies, if they were true of things to come, why should not the testimonies of things present be true?</hi> The Scripture then bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth witnesse to it selfe by the constant and perpetuall truth thereof: what other thing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14822:53"/>
doe we say, but that the Scripture from it self doth proue it selfe, by the truth, constancie, maiestie thereof, to be the word of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh here no mention of the Church, among these fiue witnesses: 1. The truth of prophecies. 2. The consent of the holie writers. 3. God himselfe, &amp;c. 4. The Scripture it selfe. 5. <hi>Postremò testis est, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly is witnesse the infinite number of miracles. Now I pray you (sir Cauiller) is here any mention made of the Church? your dealing is too childish to send vs to other places for <hi>Bellarmines</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: I know him to be elsewhere corrupt enough, I onely vrge his testimonie against himselfe in this place.</p>
                  <p>4. Fourthly, so is your supposed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction also reconciled: for to say that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in this place, among these fiue wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, maketh no mention of the Church, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> otherwhere he would haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures depend vpon the authoritie of the Church, is no contradiction in him that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this diuersitie, but in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth from himselfe.</p>
                  <p>But now somewhat to answere to your blasphemous railings: as pag. 154. <hi>God may punish him for such trickes of falsification, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the seducing and vtter subuersion of sillie soules, &amp;c.</hi> I say rather with S. <hi>Paul, God shall smite thee thou painted wall,</hi> Act. 23. 3.

no conscience to slaunder and reuile the members of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And if God doe sometime giue witnesse to the Scriptures, as most true it is, by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that prophane or blaspheme them, then how shall your popish writers escape vnpunished, that haue not been ashamed, thus vnreuerently to speake of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? <hi>Hosius</hi> saith it is <hi>egenum quoddam ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> a beggerly element: <hi>ex Nicol.

                  <p>Lastly, that <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and his fellowe Popes about that time did first make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall restraint of Priests mariage, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage began by a publike law to bee restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14822:57"/>
it is euident out of <hi>Auentinus:</hi> hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned such as were maried for Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and directed his speciall letters to <hi>O. tho</hi> Bishop of Constance to separate such as were maried, and forbid the rest to marrie: but that good Bishoppe resisted the Popes proceedings and would not obey. And in the Councell of Brixia this is alleaged as one cause why they deposed <hi>Hildsbrand,</hi> for that he caused diuorcements and separations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the maried: <hi>ex Vrspergens.</hi> To say then, that mariage was first generally inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Clergie not till a thousand yeeres after Christ, and yet to grant that it might be for sometime restrained before, by particular acts of some persons and places, I hope is no contradiction: What cause then had this cauiller, to follow with open crie, <hi>a shamelesse vntruth, lies and mad trickes,</hi> when as more truly these opprobries doe rebound vpon his owne head? I may liken him to the <hi>Lamia</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that is fained to sit blind at home,<note place="margin">Libr. de cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositat.</note> laying aside her eyes into some corner, and putting of them on againe when she goeth foorth: so plaieth this companion, he is sharp sighted abroad in looking vpon other, and blind in his owne house, he cannot see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Hierome</hi> could haue told him: <hi>Non faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis est venia praua dixisse de rectis:</hi> It is not a fault easily pardoned to speake euill of the right. <hi>Hieron.

                  <p>BEcause pag: 63. it is sayd, <hi>Telesphorus brought in the Lenten fast, Calixtus Ember fasts, Hyginus Chrisme,</hi> that liued some 14. or 15. hundred yeere agoe: and yet before, these are called erronious and hereticall opinions.</p>

                  <p>THe occasion of these words is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, which was to answer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the Rhemists challenge that the authors and beginners of their religion cannot be shewed, as they can produce the authors of ours: whereupon, it is declared out of their Popes decrees, who were the authors of some of their erronious vsages: as <hi>Telesphorus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus, Hyginus</hi> brought in Lent, Ember fasts, Chrisme: which is affirmed, not <hi>ex sententia scriptoris,</hi> of the sentence of the writer, but <hi>ex confessione aduersarij,</hi> by the confession of the aduersarie: for they themselues doe ascribe the beginning of these vsages to these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishops, which their confession, is a good argument against themselues. And that this is the writers meaning, it is euident, by comparing with this place, that which is handled of this matter in Tetrastyl. pill. 1. part. 3. where all these decrees of <hi>Telesphorus,</hi>

                     <hi>Hyginus, Calixtus</hi> are prooued to be forged. <hi>Telesphorus</hi> decree beareth date, when <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> and <hi>Marcus</hi> were Consuls, who were neuer together in that office. <hi>Hyginus</hi> epistles are dated, when <hi>Camerinus</hi> and <hi>Magnus</hi> were Consuls, which was neuer. <hi>Calixtus</hi> 2. epistle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futeth the error of <hi>Nouatus,</hi> that did spring vp long after.

                  <p>Thus then is this contradiction healed, that notwithstanding any thing here said: these may be erronious vsages, for all these forged authors: whom although you alleage as patroues of great antiquitie, yet we think your superstitious obseruations are nothing so ancient, and confesse with D. <hi>Sutclife: We shall not finde, where the Church of Christ hath enioyned Christians to fast Lent, and Ember daies, and vigils of Saints:</hi> which the Libeller noteth pag. 24. as an apparant difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that learned writer, and the other whom he impugneth.</p>

                  <p>SIr Cauiller, your collection is very weak: May not a man be a profitable instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Christs Church, though hee holde some erronious opinions? <hi>Tertullian</hi> fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the heresie of the Montanists in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of second mariage. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Alexandrinus</hi> did hold, that they which were baptized of heretikes, should be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed againe: <hi>Hieron. catal. scriptor. Papias, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Victorinus, Apollinarius, Lactantius,</hi> were all Chiliastes: they did hold, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full shuld raigne with Christ vpon the earth a thousand yeeres after the resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Many grosse errors are ascribed to <hi>Origen,</hi>

another world before this: that Christ for the saluation of Diuels should suffer in the ayre, &amp;c.

                  <p>Few of the Fathers beside can be named, but they had their speciall errors: will you therefore conclude (Sir Sophister) that these learned Fathers were not excellent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their times?

Because the booke would haue growne by this means to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter volume, then was fit for euery mans lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to reade, or their abilitie to reach. 2.

not, and so could not make answere? 3. There be others that haue happily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that enterprise, as that learned man, whom the Libeller in his first part traduceth, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> shall not want worke. 4. As <hi>Bellarmines</hi> authorities are omitted, except in some principal controuersies; so neither on the other side are our antiquities produced, in such number, as the writer out of his owne readings could haue alleaged, otherwise then of their owne testimonies, out of their Canons, and writers specially vrged against themselues, and turned vppon their owne heads. 5. The speciall grounds both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the trueth, and conuince error in euery controuersie, are to be taken from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which hee thought most profitable for the instruction of the Reader, and such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of the Prophets and Apostles are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and principally handled: wherein hee followeth <hi>Hieromes</hi> aduise to <hi>Pammach.

                  <p>2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in deede maketh great shew of antiquitie, but most of his ancient testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, are either out of forged authors, or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14822:66"/>
els impertinently alleaged, or by him corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and falsified: as, to giue one instance for many, his dealing in the controuersie of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie euidently sheweth.</p>
                  <p>First, the constitutions of <hi>Clemens, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius de ecclesiastic. Hierarch. Athanasius</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions <hi>ad Antiochiam, Gregories</hi> Dialogues, the Liturgie of <hi>Basil,</hi> Testament of <hi>Ephrem,</hi> are all bastard writings, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth as authenticall witnesses for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen, Eusebius, Epiphanius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Damascene,</hi> are impertinently cited for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: who indeed make mention of praier for the dead, but haue no one word of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, neither doth the Greeke Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that there is any purgatorie fire: <hi>prooem. ad concil. Florentin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> likewise, <hi>Cyprian, Ambrose, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> are brought in to bee of the Iurie for purgatorie, but they do not so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it: who so list to take view of their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as they are cited by <hi>Bellarm. libr.</hi> 1. <hi>de purg. cap.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is found to be a falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, as <hi>Bracarens. concil.</hi> 1. <hi>can.</hi> 39. these words are added of his owne, <hi>vt oraretur pro defun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis,</hi> that praier should be made for the dead. Likewise <hi>Concil.</hi> 6. <hi>sub Symmacho,</hi> these words are foisted in by <hi>Bellarmine: Sacrilegium esse</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:14822:66"/>
                     <hi>fraudare defunctorum animas orationibus:</hi> That it is sacriledge to defraude the soules of the dead of prayer, the Councell saith only, it is sacrilege, <hi>oblationes defunctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ecclesiae auferre,</hi> to take away the oblations of the dead from the Church, and conuert them to other vses. <hi>Wormatiens. c.</hi> 10. is falsely alleaged: <hi>Pro sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensis in patibulo esse sacrificandum:</hi> That they must sacrifice for those that are hanged: or els he had some new copie of his owne which he followed. By these particular instances it may appeare, what fidelitie <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath vsed in other controuersies, and how well antiquitie standeth of his side.</p>
                  <p>3. Whereas it is alleaged that inuocation of Saints is prooued by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by the Councel of Chalcedon, confirmed by act of parliament, Libel. pag. 175. as though now by the lawes of this land it were lawfull to pray to Saints. Our answere is, that in deede the Church of England alloweth the decrees of the Chalcedon, and of the other three ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels concerning the faith, and their condemnation of the heresies of <hi>Arrius</hi> in the Nicen, of <hi>Macedonius</hi> in the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinop. <hi>Nestorius</hi> in the Ephesine, <hi>Eutyches</hi> in the Chalcedon: but all the acts of this Councell for other matters it receiueth not. 2. Neither is there any Canon or decree in this Councel extant of inuocation of Saints: for that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth, is taken
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14822:67"/>
out of the colloquies and conferences, and postscripts of the Councell, not from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of any Canon, or determination thereof. 3. That which hee hath of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Proterius,</hi> and of <hi>Flauianus: Flauia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus post mortem viuit, martyr pro nobis oret: Flauianus</hi> liueth after death, let the Martyr pray for vs: doth shew the opinion which they had that the Saints prayed for them: which is another question. Neither doth it follow, that, if it be graunted, that the Saints doe pray for vs in generall, not knowing our particular necessities, not as mediators, but as fellow members wishing the perfection of the rest of the bodie, that therefore they should bee prayed vnto: neither can it bee shewed that those Fathers made any suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to those Saints, <hi>Sancte Proterie, sancte Flauiane &amp;c.</hi> Holie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Proterius,</hi> holie <hi>Flauiane</hi> pray for vs: which forme the Church of Rome now vseth. 4. Neither was this the voice of the whole Councell, but <hi>Episcopi &amp; presbyteri Constantinopolitani clamauerunt,</hi> but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and priests of Constantinople so cried, act. 11. 5. And yet we denie not, but that in this time, which was almost fiue hundred yeeres after Christ, superstition began to set foote into the Church, and these opinions of intercession and inuocation of Saints to bee embraced, though not in such manner as the Church of Rome now holdeth. Neither doe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14822:67"/>
we stand so much vpon this, what any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church either a part, or assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together did hold, as vpon what ground of Scripture their opinion was founded.</p>
                  <p>4. But as for <hi>Baals</hi> answere, <hi>Baals</hi> shauen priests haue better experience thereof, that worship stockes and stones, then they which detest all such abominations. As <hi>Baal</hi> was dumbe and mute, when his priests called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, so are popish Images, when they are prayed vnto: for they can doe neither good nor euill, as the Prophet saith, Esay. 41. 23. <hi>Xenophanes</hi> wittily derided the like follie in the superstitious Aegyptians, that in their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne<note place="margin">Where are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Baals priests.</note> sacrifices vsed to howle and crie: <hi>They are either Gods, then mourne not for them; or men, then doe not sacrifice vnto them.</hi> And a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lace demonian to him that made col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for the Idol-temples, made this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent answere: <hi>Non curo Deos me pauperiores:</hi> I care not for such beggerly Gods, that are poorer then I. Such are popish images, which of other mens purses are decked and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with gold: Such beggerly images, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, vse to giue <hi>Baals</hi> answere to their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable suppliants: which is fit enough for <hi>Baals</hi> priests, that marke and disfigure themselues with shauing and cutting, a notable badge of their hypocrisie. As <hi>Philip</hi> said to one that<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

could not be faithfull in his labour, that was vnfaithfull to his lockes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Libeller would shew vs to be enemies to antiquitie, because it is called, <hi>the vaine shew of mothworne antiquitie:</hi> and the<note place="margin">1</note> vulgar Latine translation of the Bible partly done by <hi>Hierome,</hi> partly corrected by him,<note place="margin">2</note> partly receiued from another most ancient edition commended by <hi>Augustine,</hi> is termed <hi>an old blind Latine translation:</hi> and the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, <hi>Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Ambrose,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3</note> 
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> should bee called Heretikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they held that Antichrist should come of the tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> Libel. pag. 177.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrà.</hi> True antiquitie is not called <hi>moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1</note> but that shew of antiquitie, which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> pretendeth to prooue the name and office of Cardinals, is so called; because like as a garment eaten with moths, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to commend it, but the oldnes thereof: so are his allegations borne out onely with the name and shew of antiquitie. For that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged out of the Romane Councell vnder <hi>Siluester</hi> can. 6. sheweth neither the name of Cardinals appropriate to the Church of Rome, nor yet their office, which is to elect the Pope: The Canon onely saith, that there should be seuen Cardinals in Rome, because the Citie was deuided into seuen regions: and euery one should be a principall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of his quarter. This prooueth not that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14822:68"/>
there were Cardinals only in Rome: but the principall Ministers of other Churches were so called, as at Naples, <hi>distinct.</hi> 71. <hi>c.</hi> 5. at Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuse, <hi>distinct.</hi> 74. <hi>c.</hi> 6. And as for the office of Cardinals in electing the Pope, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth it is but of foure hundred yeeres continuance, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Cleric. c.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the vulgar Latine translation<note place="margin">2</note> of <hi>Hieromes</hi> doing, as thinketh <hi>Sanctis Pagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in praefat. ad Clem.</hi> 7. and <hi>Driedo lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">The vulgar Latine not Hieromes translation.</note> 
                     <hi>de catalog. scriptur.</hi> neither is it that transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Italie, which <hi>Augustine</hi> commendeth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de doct.

But that it is an old blind translation, it may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare to him that will take but a little paine to compare it with the originall: as Genes. 3. 15. for (<hi>it</hi>) shall break thine head, the Latine hath, <hi>ipsa, she,</hi> referring it to the woman. Genes. 8. 4. for the <hi>seuenteenth day</hi> of the moneth, they reade <hi>seuen and twentie.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. 19. 18. for, <hi>not so I pray thee,</hi> the Latine hath, <hi>so I pray thee:</hi> leauing out, <hi>not.</hi> Genesis 24. 22. <hi>two sickles,</hi> for <hi>halfe a sickle.</hi> Gen. 36. 24. <hi>Aanh found out mules: hote waters,</hi> saith the Latine. Genes. 37. 2. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was <hi>septendecim annorum,</hi> seuenteene yeere old: <hi>sedecim,</hi> 16. yeere old, say they. Diuers hundred of such places might bee gathered both out of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14822:69"/>
old and new Testament, to shew the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vulgar Latine translation. See more here of Synops. pag. 21.</p>
                  <p>3. It is vntrue, that the Fathers are called, <hi>Heretikes:</hi> for none of them are named: but these are the words: <hi>It is a very fable and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning deuice of heretikes to make men beleeue, that Antichrist shall come of the tribe of Dan:</hi> where the Fathers are not noted, who held it as a probable opinion in their time, before Antichrist was reucaled: but the Papists, the <hi>Heretikes</hi> of these daies, who now in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Antichrist, would blind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes, that they should not see him in his colours. Neither is it here assumed, that they are heretikes for this opinion, or that it is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie simply to thinke that Antichrist shall come of <hi>Dan:</hi> but they which in other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions maintaine open heresie, doe herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vse a point of cousonage to deceiue the people. <hi>Ambrose</hi> concerning the comming of Antichrist, thus saith, <hi>The Lord shall not come before there be a defection of the Romane Empire,</hi> &amp; appareat Antichristus, qui interfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet sanctos, reddita Romanis libertate, sub suo tamen nomine: <hi>and Antichrist appeare, which shall kill the Saints, restoring libertie to the Romanes, but vnder his owne name: in</hi> 2. <hi>Thess. cap.</hi> 2. Here hee deliuereth foure markes of Antichrist, which all agree to the Bishop of Rome: first, the maiestie and authoritie of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14822:69"/>
the Empire is decaied. Secondly, he hath kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and murthered the Saints. Thirdly, hee goeth about to maintaine the libertie and iurisdiction of Rome. Fourthly, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne name, for of the Pope they are all called Papists.</p>
                  <p>Now to make men beleeue, that the Pope is not Antichrist, but that there shall come one a little before the end of the world to be borne of the Iewes, that shall conquer all the world, and worke wonders; what is it els but a cunning sleight of Sathan, and a cousoning tricke of his instruments to keep the people in suspence, and make them vnreadie for the comming of Christ? As <hi>Ruffinus</hi> thus saith, <hi>in Symbol. Scire debemus, quód salutarem Christi aduentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, conatur inimicus ad decipiendos fideles callida fraude simulare, &amp; pro filio hominis qui expectatur venturus in maiestate, filium perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis in signis mendacibus praeparare:</hi> We must know, that the enemie goeth about craftily to dissemble and colour the comming of Christ to deceiue the faithfull, and in steed of the sonne of man which is expected in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, to prepare the sonne of perdition with lying signes and hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to prooue the popish religion grounded vpon antiquitie, the Libeller gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth instance in diuers particulars. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke is affirmed in <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the firsts time to be one of the <hi>Captaines</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:14822:70"/>
                     <hi>and ringleaders</hi> of superstition, it is inferred that our land was first conuerted to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion, a thousand yeeres agoe. p. 178.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrà.</hi> 1. <hi>Austin</hi> brought in some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious rites, which now the Romane church still retaineth: but yet the grossest points of Poperie, as of adoration of Images, transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, iustification by workes, and such other, are nothing so ancient. Neither neede it seeme strange, that some errors crept into the Church a thousand yeer since, seeing that the mysterie of iniquitie began to worke in the Apostles time, 2. Thessal. 2. 7. and 6. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres after Christ, the Church began much to decline and degenerate.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Austin</hi> the Monke was not the first conuerter of the English nation: for in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> time the Britaines had receiued the Gospell: <hi>De Hierosolymis, &amp; de Britannia ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualiter patet aula calestis:</hi> Heauen is open as well in Britannie as at Ierusalem, <hi>Hieron. ad Paulin.</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> aboue an hundred yeere<note place="margin">Austin the Monke not the first conuerter of England</note> before <hi>Hierome</hi> confesseth as much: <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium vniuersam naturam verbum peruicit, &amp;c. nec humanum genus aliquod licet spectari, quod non huius susceperit disciplinam:</hi> The worde hath ouercome the nature of the vniuersall world, neither is there any kind of men to be seene, which hath not receiued the discipline thereof: <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Celsum.</hi> This our countrie was then many hundred yeeres conuerted to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14822:70"/>
the faith, before <hi>Austin</hi> was sent from Rome: And as it began in the holy Apostolike faith, so wee trust it shall make an end: and that faith which it receiued at Christs going out of the world, wee assuredly hope, through Gods mercie, that it shall render vnto Christ at his comming againe to iudge the world.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> noted <hi>Aerius</hi> for an heretike, because he denied prayer and oblation for the dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> so thought, doth it follow that all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie is on your side, and that all the fathers<note place="margin">All the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers allow not prayer for the dead.</note> so thought? <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith: <hi>Confiteantur singuli delictum suum, dum adhuc, qui deliquit, in seculo est; dum admitti co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessio eius potest; dum satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio &amp; remissio facta per sacerdotem apud Deum grata est:</hi> Confesse euery man his sinne, while he, that hath sinned is in the world; while his confession may be admitted, while satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remssion done by the priest is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto God, <hi>serm. de lapsis. Ambrose</hi> saith: <hi>Mors deteriorem statum non facit, sed qualem in singulis inuenerit, talem iudicio futuro reseruat:</hi> Death maketh no mans state worse, but such as it findeth euery man in, it reserueth to the iudgement to come, <hi>de bon. mort. cap. c.</hi> 4. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> vpon these words Eccles. 11. 3. <hi>If the tree doth fall toward the South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or toward the North, where the tree falleth, there it shall be,</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Men are as trees, the tree is cut</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:14822:71"/>
                     <hi>vp in death: which way soeuer it falleth, there it shall be: quia ibi te iudicabit Deus, vbi inuene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, videat, quo casura sit, antequam cadat, quia postquam ceciderit, non adijciet vt resurgat, sed nec vt se vertat, &amp;c. for God shall iudge thee there where he shall finde thee: let the tree looke which way it shall fall, before it doe fall: for after it be fallen, it shall no more rise, nor turne it selfe: Serm. paru.</hi> 49. If then the state of the dead cannot be altred, if they shall be iudged in that condition wherein they die, doth it not strongly follow, that it is in vaine to pray for the dead?</p>
                  <p>But what if <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe sometime<note place="margin">Augustine against prayer for the dead.</note> be of another minde, what is become then of your shew of antiquitie? as <hi>serm.</hi> 21. <hi>in Matth. Qualis quisque hinc exierit suo nouissimo die, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis inuenitur in seculi nouissimo die: nihil te adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uabit quod hîc non feceris: vnumquemque opera sua iuuabunt, aut opera sua pressura sunt:</hi> Such as euery man goeth hence in his last day, such shall he be found in the last day of the world: nothing shall helpe thee which thou hast not done here: euery mans workes shall either helpe him, or cast him down.

                     </hi> 2. <hi>Si dicis, pro quo petere debeas, dico quod pro bene &amp; male viuentibus, vt bonus perseueret, malus conuerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non pro sanctis, non pro damnatis, &amp;c.</hi> If you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14822:71"/>
say, for whom must I pray, I say for good and euill liuers, that the good may perseuere, the euill may bee conuerted, not for the Saints, not for the damned, &amp;c. The author of these Sermons, maketh but two sorts of the dead after this life, the blessed and the damned, for both which it is in vaine to pray. It may bee obiected, that serm. 44. this author alloweth suffrages to be made for the dead. I answere, that that sermon is not like to be <hi>Augustines,</hi> because it disagreeth from him in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as <hi>cont. Pelag. artic.</hi> 5. <hi>Augustine</hi> maketh but two places after this life, heauen and hel: <hi>Tertium penitus ignoramus, immo nec esse in scripturis sanctis inuenimus:</hi> The third place we are ignorant of, nay we finde it not to be in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, what if wee should yeeld you <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> and <hi>Augustine</hi> for this opinion of prayer for the dead, will ye yeeld vs them for the rest? <hi>Epiphanius</hi> directly condemneth the adoration of Images, <hi>epist. ad Ioann. Hierosoly,</hi> where seeing a painted cloath, <hi>habens imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem tanquam Christi,</hi> hauing as it were the image of Christ, he commaunded it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, because he saw the image of a man hanging in the Church of Christ, against the authoritie of the Scripture. <hi>Augustine,</hi> against the carnall presence, the adoration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the doctrine of merits, free will, and in an hundred points more, is wholy ours against
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14822:72"/>

                  <p>3.

                  <p>4. For the reuerencing of Reliques, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, that it is not lawfull for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall persons to marrie, that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for rich men to giue all their riches to the poore: they haue <hi>Hierome</hi> altogether on their side, <hi>who taught their faith, and wrote in defence thereof against Vigilantius.</hi> Libel. p. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrà.</hi> 1. Whereas all these foresaid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are proued not to be erronious, both out of the Scriptures, and by the testimonie of <hi>Augustine,</hi> this answere is made, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine is abused:</hi> but he sheweth not how, neither doth hee examine the authorities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged out of that father, Tetrastyl. pag. 100. pag. 101. whereby it may be gathered, that either those places were too euident to bee gainsaid, or without the compasse of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Clarkes reading: if hee had loosened the hold, which we haue of <hi>Augustine,</hi> in those places, wee would haue produced others to haue strengthened them, but now it shall not neede, where the aduersaries mouth is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die stopped. 2. Yet hee telleth vs, <hi>that if wee can obtaine at their hands, that either Scripture or Augustine make for them, let Hierome a Gods name be reiected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why (Sir) till such time as you haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14822:73"/>
both Scripture and <hi>Augustine,</hi> which are there vrged in defence of these opinions, they doe make for vs. But I thinke wee shall hardly obtaine so much at your hands: for you are a liberall gentleman, your manner is to graunt nothing, though neuer so eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conuinced. <hi>Brutus</hi> was wont to say: <hi>Male is videtur florem aetatis collocasse, qui nihil negare auderet:</hi> He seemeth to haue bestowed his time euill, which durst denie nothing. But I thinke they haue bestowed it worse, that dare denie any thing. But what if <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> be not so much your friend in these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as you vaunt, where are you then? First, <hi>Hierome</hi> contendeth not against <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius,</hi> for the adoration of Reliques, but for<note place="margin">Hierome would haue Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, not adored.</note> due reuerence to be giuen them: <hi>I am se intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liget Samaritanum &amp; Iudaeum, qui corpora mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum pro immundis habet:</hi> He shall see that hee is no better then a Iew or Samaritane, which counteth the bodies of the dead vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. And againe, <hi>Nos non dico martyrum reliquias, sed ne solem quidem aut lunam, non an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos aut archangelos, &amp;c. colimus &amp; adoramus ne seruiamus creaturae potius quam creatori, &amp;c. honoramus reliquias martyrum, &amp;c.</hi> We, I say not the reliques of Martyrs, but we worship not or adore the Sunne or Moone, Angels or Archangels, least we should serue the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rather then the Creator: but we honour the reliques of Martyrs, that wee may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14822:73"/>
him, whose Martyrs they are: <hi>ad Ripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi> What maketh this now for the Papists opinion, that doe not onely honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, but adore the reliques of Martyrs?</p>
                  <p>2. Neither is <hi>Hieromes</hi> opinion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther currant for the inuocation of Saints: <hi>Quis enim ô insanum caput aliquando martyres adorauit? quis hominem putauit Deum?</hi> Who (O you madbraine) euer adored Martyrs? or tooke a man to be God? <hi>De Petro legimus quod Cornelium se adorare cupientem manu sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuauit &amp; dixit, homo ego sum:</hi> We reade of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he lifted vp <hi>Cornelius,</hi> desirous to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore him, with his hand, and said, I am a man. If Martyrs and Saints are not to be adored, then not to be inuocated: for inuocation is a part of diuine adoration.</p>
                  <p>3. Concerning Ministers mariage, <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> hath these words: <hi>Si Samuel nutritus in tabernaculo duxit vxorem, quid hoc ad praeiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium virginitatis, quasi no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hodie quoque plurimi sacerdotes habeant matrimonia? &amp; apostolus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribat episcopum vnius vxoris virum, haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem filios cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omni castitate:</hi> If <hi>Samuel</hi> brought vp in the Tabernacle maried a wife, that is no preiudice to virginitie, as though many priests now a daies enioy not mariage? and the Apostle describeth a Bishop, the husband of one wife, hauing children with all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.</p>
                  <p>4. Neither doth <hi>Hierome</hi> thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14822:74"/>
alwaies for a man to giue all his riches<note place="margin">Rich men not bound to giue all away.</note> to the poore, but preferreth it only as a more perfect thing: as he saith thus to <hi>Vigilantius: Iste quem tu laudas, secundus &amp; tertius gradus est, quem &amp; nos recipimus, &amp;c.</hi> This that you commend (that is, for a man to vse his riches) is the second and third degree, which we also receiue: so that wee know, that the first is to be preferred before the second and third. For otherwise <hi>Hierome</hi> should haue spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, who did not giue all away which he had: <hi>Quo labore, quo pretio, Barraba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nocturnum habui praeceptorem? nostrum marsupium Alexandrinae chartae euacuarunt:</hi> With what labour, with what price did I get <hi>Barrabanus</hi> (a certaine Rabbin) to teach me in the night? the paper of Alexandria hath emptied my purse: <hi>epistol. ad Pammach. &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. Hierome</hi> then had money: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he could not haue been at this cost. You see now (master Controller) how well <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> standeth of your side: and yet if he were yours wholy here, you must lend him to vs for many other points, as concerning the Canonicall Scriptures, against free will, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for iustification by faith, and such other, as might abundantly be shewed, if either time or place serued.</p>
                  <p>5. Fiftly: 1. In what sense <hi>Telesphorus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus,</hi> and <hi>Hyginus</hi> are said to haue been the institutors of these vsages, of Lent, Ember
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14822:74"/>
fasts, Chrisme, is sufficiently shewed before, in the answere to contradict. 3. 2. Though they could alleage antiquitie for these toyes, yet this is nothing to the substance of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 3. And if these obseruations haue been of ancient time, yet shall they neuer be able to shew, that they were so superstitiously then kept, with so many superfluous rites, with such opinion of merite, and with such necessitie inioyned, as now in Poperie.</p>
                  <p>6. Sixtly, that <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptisme was diuers<note place="margin">Iohns baptisme not diuers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs.</note> from Christs, contrarie to the opinion of the Protestants, <hi>Augustine</hi> (saith the Libeller) standeth on our side.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrà.</hi> 1. <hi>Augustine</hi> is not wholy theirs: for whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denieth, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme was for remission of sinnes; <hi>Augustine</hi> thus confesseth: <hi>Tamen ne quisquam contendat etiam in baptismo Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis dimissa esse peccata, sed aliquam ampliorem sanctificationem &amp;c. per baptismum Christi col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latam, non ago pugnaciter, &amp;c.</hi> Yet least any man contend, that euen in <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme sinnes were forgiuen, but that some greater sanctification was conferred by Christs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme vpon those that S. <hi>Paul</hi> bid to be againe baptized, I will not striue against it. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> here seemeth to graunt, that <hi>Iohn</hi> might remit sinnes in baptisme, so that some pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and greater sanctification be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Christs. Is not the Libeller now asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14822:75"/>
to say, <hi>that he abuseth Saint Augustine, I make no doubt:</hi> but who so bold as blind ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard? It is pitie that hee had not the Author by him to examine this sentence: for hee would then haue cried out a fresh of falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because I rehearsed not all the words, as they are cited now, only for breuitie sake, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe those, which shew that, for the which the place is alleaged: but now the whole sentence being expressed, there is the same sense, which before out of part was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: onely in the margin the place is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, the 14. chapter being noted for the tenth.</p>
                  <p>2. What if wee yeeld you <hi>Augustine</hi> for this opinion; what haue you gained, if other of the fathers testifie with vs, that make <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme and Christs all one? As <hi>Ambrose</hi> confesseth: <hi>Ioannes in remissionem peccatorum in aduenientis Iesu nomine, non in suo baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, &amp;c. Iohn</hi> baptized for remission of sinnes in the name of Iesus to come, not in his own, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Spirit. cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Leo</hi> saith: <hi>Christus ad Ioannis baptisma accessit:</hi> Christ came vnto <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, <hi>de consecr. distinct.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. And wee are baptized with that baptisme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ was baptized. <hi>Ambros. serm.</hi> 41. <hi>Ergo fratres tingi debemus eodem fonte, quo Christus, vt possimus esse quod Christus:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren we must be dipped in the same fountaine that Christ was, that wee may be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14822:75"/>
the same that Christ is. And <hi>Chromatius</hi> saith, <hi>Nunquam aqua baptismi purgare peccata cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium posset, nisi tactu Dominici corporis san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificatae essent:</hi> The waters of baptisme could neuer purge the sinnes of beleeuers, vnlesse they were sanctified by the touch of the Lords bodie: <hi>in Matth. cap.</hi> 6. Wee then are baptized with that baptisme which Christ sanctified, but that was the baptisme of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Master of Sentences confesseth, that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized <hi>in nomine futuri,</hi> in the name of Christ to come, <hi>libr.</hi> 4. <hi>distinct.</hi> 2. <hi>f.</hi> and that they, which did not <hi>spem ponere,</hi> put their hope in <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, were not baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>ibid.</hi> and he thinketh that Christs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was instituted in Iordan, <hi>distinct.</hi> 3. <hi>g.</hi> but that was <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, as <hi>Leo</hi> before saith: <hi>Ergo, Iohns</hi> baptisme and Christs were alone: And if they were not baptized again, that receiued <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme in a right faith, then was it all one with the baptisme of Christ. I hope now it appeareth, that antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will not yeeld this point vnto our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</p>
                  <p>7. Concerning the profession of virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hee saith, <hi>antiquitie was of our opinion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is confessed, that the Manichees ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected vnto <hi>Augustine,</hi> the multitude of their virgines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I marueile how the <hi>Defender</hi> here escaped the <hi>Detectors</hi> censure: for the words
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14822:76"/>
alleaged are somewhat mistaken: for the Manichees did not thus obiect to <hi>Augustine: You labour to draw women of euery hand to this profession by your profession, that now in your Churches the number of professed virgines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the number of women:</hi> but this is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> obiection to the Manichees, <hi>libr.</hi> 30. <hi>cont. Faustum cap.</hi> 4. So that this testimonie sheweth a great affinitie betweene the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious endeuour of the Manichees, and the like practise in the popish Church, to make a multitude of virgines.</p>
                  <p>2. We grant the Fathers allowed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession<note place="margin">How Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie.</note> of virginitie, where they had receiued that gift, but much vnlike it was to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish vowes of single life. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the same place thus writeth: <hi>Nos hortamur vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes, vt permaneant, non cogimus inuitas, vt accedant:</hi> We exhort them that are willing to continue, but we compell none against their wils to come. And againe, <hi>Ipsi tam stultum iudicamus inhibere volentem, quam nefas &amp; impium nolentem cogere:</hi> We count it as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to forbid those that are willing, as wicked to compell the vnwilling, <hi>cont. faust. lib.</hi> 30. 4. They then forced no virgines, by cunning perswasion, as the Manichees did, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to take vpon them the profession of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, neither did they hold them against their wils: But it is an vsuall practise in the popish Church, craftily to entice yong men
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14822:76"/>
and women to professe Monkerie, and after they are once entred, they then keepe them against their minds and disposition.</p>
                  <p>8. That Christ descended into that part of hell, which is called <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and deliuered from thence the soules of <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarkes, and other faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that were there kept expecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankinde, &amp;c. the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giue sentence for vs: and it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>the most part of them to haue been in this error.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Whereas <hi>Origen</hi> is alleaged <hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>cap. Iob</hi> to proue that the Patriarkes went to heauen, <hi>a place of life and light, to Abrahams bosome, the queere of Angels, &amp;c.</hi> this answere is made, that he suspecteth that <hi>Origen</hi> is not syncerely alleaged: wherein he sheweth his great ignorance, and slender reading in the Fathers: the place is truly word for word co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out of <hi>Origen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe (saith the Libeller) <hi>Origen</hi> beleeued herein as we beleeue, and to that purpose he citeth <hi>Origen, hom.</hi> 15. <hi>in Genes.</hi> thus speaking, <hi>that Christ descended to hell to fetch Adam from thence: Quod enim dicit ad latronem, hodie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum eris in paradiso, non hoc illi solum dictum, sed etiam omnibus sanctis dictum intellige, pro qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ad inferna descendit:</hi> For what hee said to the theefe, this day thou shalt be with me in paradice, was not said onely to him, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14822:77"/>
it to be spoken to al the Saints, for whom he descended to hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contrà.</hi> 1. By this saying of <hi>Origen,</hi> all the Saints ascended to heauen, the same day, and<note place="margin">Origen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension to hell, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the Patriarkes.</note> at the same time, when the soule of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted theefe went to paradice. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinion of the moderne Papists, that hold, that Christs soule, <hi>manebat in loco animarum illo triduo, quo corpus iacebat in loco corporum,</hi> did tarie three daies in the place of soules, all which time his bodie did lie in the place of the bodies, <hi>Bellarm. libr.</hi> 4. <hi>de Christ. anim. cap.</hi> 15. And this is one of <hi>Durands</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to prooue, that Christs soule went not <hi>locally</hi> into hell, but onely <hi>effectually,</hi> in power and vertue, because in the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of Christs death the soules of the Saints were, <hi>beatificatae,</hi> made blessed, <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>distin.</hi> 22. <hi>quaest.</hi> 3. And if the same day of Christs death, their soules were in paradice, according to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens</hi> opinion, I pray you what time had Christs soule to be in hell, but onely by the vertue and power thereof: which must bee <hi>Origens</hi> meaning? Vnlesse you will say, that Christs soule was in heauen and hell in two places at once: which shift <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is driuen vnto, saying, It was not impossible vnto God, to make Christs soule to bee in two places at once, <hi>libr.</hi> 4. <hi>de Christ. anim. cap.</hi> 15. All things are possible, wee graunt vnto God: but where hath hee any warrant out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14822:77"/>
of Scripture of this his presumption?</p>
                  <p>2. And that <hi>Origen</hi> meaneth not, that Christ did fetch the Saints out of any such hell and place of darknes, as they imagine, it is euident by that which followeth within tenne lines after in the same Homilie: where <hi>Origen</hi> vpon these words of the Lord to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> Genes. 46. 4. <hi>I will bring thee backe againe: Velut si diceret, quia certamen bonum certasti, fidem seruasti, &amp;c. reuocabo te iam de hoc mundo ad beatitudinem futuram, ad perfectionem vitae aeternae, ad iustitiae coronam, quam reddet Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in fine seculorum omnibus qui diligunt eum:</hi> As if he should say, because thou hast fought a good fight, kept the faith, &amp;c. I will call thee out of this world to the blessednes to come, to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of eternall life, to the crowne of righteousnes, which God shall render in the end of the world to all that loue him. If blessednes then, perfection of eternall life, the crowne of righteousnes, be in hell; then <hi>Iacob</hi> went to hell, otherwise not.</p>
                  <p>3. Because exception is taken against that testimonie cited out of <hi>Origen</hi> vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> who is thought not to haue been the author of that booke (for the which I will not much contend, though it be ancient, and sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew the opinion of that time, that <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> was not generally held of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) I will declare <hi>Origens</hi> iudgement out of other places of his workes: as <hi>Tractat.</hi> 26.

                     <hi>in Matth.

                  <p>1.

remaineth in the elect, though it be not alwaies a perfect and glorious faith: likewise a true faith is not alwaies a like effectuall or working, but yet alwaies accompanied with loue, though not in the same degree.</p>
                  <p>2. As then <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> faith failed in these their sinnes, so also their charitie: but it therefore followeth not, that because in one act their faith and charitie failed, and in part was empaired, therefore it was wholie extinguished.</p>
                  <p>3.

                  <p>4. Wherefore your Logicke (sir Sophister) here faileth you, and you conclude weakely, from a part to the whole, that because their loue failed in part, it was wholy lost: was there no sparke of loue in <hi>Dauid</hi> neither to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">Dauid and Peters faith not vtterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> God nor man, nor no goodnes left in <hi>Peter</hi> during their seuerall tentations? When the Moone is in decreasing, hath she lost all her light? the seede, that lieth all the winter buried in the earth, hath it no life in it? So the seede of faith and charitie alwaies remaineth in the faithfull, though not alike greene and flourishing. Because you (sir Cauiller) haue shewed your selfe at this time in slaundring and railing, an vnhonest man, shall I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>4. For <hi>Salomon</hi> the same answer wil serue,<note place="margin">Salomons faith not wholy lost in his fall.</note> that though in that hainous sinne of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie both his faith and loue failed, yet it was not generally or totally extinguished: as the Lord saith, 2. Sam. 7. 15. <hi>My mercie shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from him:</hi> but where no faith nor loue is, there is no mercie. As mercie on Gods behalfe therfore did not vtterly depart from him: so neither in <hi>Salomon</hi> was faith quite rooted out: the seede of faith and loue lay buried in him, in that his heauie sleepe; and was afterward, by Gods grace awaked and reuiued. But how is it inferred, that vnlesse the fire of charitie were cleane put out in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> idolatrie must be a good worke and the louing of God? for this wicked act shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a partiall and temporall failing of faith and charitie, not a <hi>totall</hi> or <hi>finall:</hi> was there, thinke you, no goodnes, vertue, iustice, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (the fruits of faith and charitie in Gods children) remaining in <hi>Salomon</hi> in the time of his fall? The contrarie is extant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Eccles. 2. 9. <hi>My wisedome remained with me,</hi> euen in the middest of his pleasure, the light of wisedome and knowledge was not extinguished in him.</p>
                  <p>5. Concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> we affirme, that hee was alwaies a member of the Catholike Church (as it comprehendeth the number of

the predestinate) not onely when hee was a persecutor, but euen before he was borne, in respect of the foreknowledge and decree of God: yet was hee not then an actuall and present member of the Church, to the which faith is required: wherefore to dispute that <hi>Paul</hi> had no faith, when he was a persecutor, is a needlesse labour, for as yet he was not in act a member of the Church, neither had faith, before hee was called, and therefore could not lose, that, which he had not.</p>

We are further off from iustifying vngodly workes, then Papists are: for they hold that some sins are veniall and pardonable in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: we affirme, that all sins in themselues, without Gods mercie, are mortall, that is, worthie of damnation: they say, that a iust man doth not sinne in his good workes, so much as venially. Synops. pag. 922. we hold that euen the best workes of the righteous are blemished with some infirmitie: they teach, that the motions of the flesh, though neuer so wicked, are not sinfull, if a man giue not any consent, Libel pag. 134. we professe, that the very euill concupiscence, though the will concurre not with it, is sinfull.

Your sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie argument then (sir Sophister) hath no good consequence. I perceiue your Logicke and Diuinitie are both much alike: but you are not so much to be blamed, as your master, that taught you no better: as <hi>Diogenes</hi> seeing an vnmanner lie boy, gaue his master a blow on the eare, that had instructed him no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Thus <hi>Ambrose</hi> vnderstandeth the Apostle, <hi>epist.</hi> 8. <hi>Noueris Christi dona irreuocabilia, vt credas, quod semper credidisti, nec nimio moerore tuam in dubium adduc as sententiam:</hi> Know that the gifts of Christ are irreuocable, that thou maist beleeue, what thou hast alwaies belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and not with too much heauines make thy sentence doubtfull.

                  <p>2. Secondly: 1. <hi>Where children are said to be holie euen before baptisme,</hi> it is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of such holines and sanctification as<note place="margin">How chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. Neither do we say, that all the children of the faithfull are saued; that die vnbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (though in charitie wee are so to thinke) because they are within the couenant, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14822:92"/>
haue committed nothing, wherby they haue made themselues vnworthie of it) but that the want of baptisme is no impediment vnto such infants, as are within Gods gracious election: as the words doe expound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>how can they possibly perish, though they die vnbaptized?</hi> So then infants are not by the want of baptisme depriued of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>3. But how followeth it, that all the Iewes that came of <hi>Abraham be infallibly saued?</hi> whereas the question is of those onely which the vnbaptized, which liued not to the yeers of discretion to receiue or refuse faith. But it will be againe obiected: All the children of the faithfull are holie, and once holie, alwaies holie, therefore they cannot choose but bee saued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> They are holie, as I said before, being the seede of the faithfull, not by any speciall sanctification, but by a generall vocation, being borne of faithfull parents, and so members of the visible Church, admitted to baptisme &amp; other Sacraments of the Church. This externall holines and vocation may be lost: for when they come to yeeres of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and then shew themselues stubborne and refuse the holesome meanes of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they doe fall away: and so is verified that saying of our Sauiour, <hi>Many are called, but few are chosen.</hi> Some then are Loly by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

You are like those, that <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh of: <hi>Quam vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint pallentem &amp; tristem, miseram &amp; Manichea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vocant:</hi> If they see a woman pale and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, they count her miserable and a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichee: <hi>ad Eustoch.</hi> So doe you those women, that desire by the Gospell to be brought to true sorrow and repentance for their sinne. And doe you mislike, that deuout women should be well affected to the Ministers of the Gospell, and minister to their necessities againe? I will answere you with <hi>Hierome: Mulieres ministrant saluatori de substantia sua; ille qui de quinque panibus millia hominum pauit, escas sanctarum mulierum non recusat accipere:</hi> The women minister to our Sauiour of their substance, and hee that with fiue

loaues fed thousands, refused not to receiue the prouision of women: <hi>ad Princip.</hi> It may be thought, if this disciple of Rome had then liued, hee would haue carped at our blessed Sauiour and his disciples, because they suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red women to resort to their Sermons, and to minister vnto them.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, whereas S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> as he saith, <hi>taketh a vow in the largest signification,</hi> when he calleth these vowes, <hi>to beleeue, to liue well, &amp;c.</hi> as though they were improperlie called vowes: I will shew <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that <hi>in Psal.</hi> 115. <hi>Quisquis bene cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat, quid voueat Domino, seipsum voueat, seip-Sum reddat; hoc exigitur, hoc debetur:</hi> Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinketh well, what he should vow vnto God, let him vow himselfe, let him render

                  <p>Secondly, that this Synode prouided not onely against lustie common beggers (as hee beareth vs in hand) but against idle begging Friers, it is euident by these reasons: First, the words are generall: <hi>Mendicantibus validis, &amp;c. publice &amp; ostiatim mendicare penitus sit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictum:</hi> To sturdie beggers let it be wholy forbidden to begge from doore to doore.

Thirdly, the reason of the constitution is generall: <hi>Vtilius esurienti pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis tollitur, si de ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is a point of iniustice as well in begging Friers, as in others, to liue idly vpon the sweate of other mens browes. Fourthly, other ancient Canons haue prouided against wandring Monkes: as <hi>Caus.</hi> 16. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>Monachi circumuagantes,</hi> Monkes gadding about, are called, <hi>pseudomonachi,</hi> false Monks. <hi>Caus.</hi> 18. <hi>qu.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10.

                     <hi>haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the truth is not in vs.</hi> And this was one of the errors of the Pelagians: <hi>Posse esse hominem sine peccato:</hi> That a man may be here without sin: which <hi>Augustine</hi> confuteth, <hi>epist.</hi> 89. <hi>quaest.</hi> 1. by that place of <hi>Iohn:</hi> and further he saith, <hi>Omnibus est necessaria oratio Dominica:</hi> The Lords Prayer is necessarie for all, where wee pray, <hi>forgiue vs our sinnes.</hi> This doctrine is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by your owne Decrees: <hi>Distin.</hi> 25. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>in gloss.</hi> out of <hi>Hierome: Res contra naturam pene est, vt sine peccato aliquis sit:</hi> It is almost against nature, that a man should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne.

                  <p>Wherefore his meaning was, that sinne did liue, that is, raigne in the regenerate: much like to the heresie of the Eunomians, that did teach, that the committing of neuer so great sinnes should not hurt a man, if he were of their faith, <hi>Augustin. haeres.</hi> 54. and so they did suffer sinne to raigne in their disciples.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Scripture for sinne to <hi>raigne</hi> or liue in vs, is taken for all one: as Rom. 7. vers. 9. <hi>Sinne</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>reuiued,</hi> which he expoundeth vers. 14. <hi>I am carnall and sold vnder sinne:</hi> the Apostle here speaketh of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14822:105"/>
himselfe, when he was yet vncalled: for sinne then to liue or reuiue in vs, is to be sold vnto sinne. And againe, Rom. 6. 1. <hi>We that are dead vnto sinne, how shall we liue still therein?</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward<note place="margin">The liuing of sinne, and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of sinne, all one.</note> hee expoundeth what it is to liue in sinne: vers. 12. <hi>Let not sinne raigne in your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies.</hi> So then to liue in sinne, or sinne to liue in vs, is for sinne to raigne in vs. Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> interpreteth the Apostle: <hi>Qui mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui sumus peccato, &amp;c. eum describit, qui est sub gratia constitutus: cui autem dominatur pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp;c. adhuc sub lege est:</hi> We that are dead to sinne, how shall we liue therein? He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth him which is vnder grace, but he, in whom sinne ruleth, &amp;c. is vnder the law, not vnder grace, <hi>in 6. ad Roman.</hi> He then which is vnder grace, or regenerate, liueth not in sin, nor sinne liueth in him: he that is not vnder grace then hath sinne both liuing and raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in him. The Apostle also saith, Rom. 12. vers. 11. <hi>Ye are dead to sinne, but are aliue to God.</hi> There cannot be both a death of sinne and a life of sinne together in the regenerate. It is then I trust sufficiently cleered, that the liuing of sinne and raigning of sinne is all one.</p>
                  <p>Now (thou accuser of the brethren, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art) take your choise, if <hi>Proclus</hi> by the <hi>liuing</hi> of the sinne in the regenerate, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>raigning,</hi> then are wee no heretikes, for so wee hold not: if by <hi>liuing,</hi> he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

                  <p>FIrst, neither was <hi>Aerius</hi> held an heretike by <hi>Augustine,</hi> for denying prayer for the dead: but thus he said of him, as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that, <hi>in Arrianorum haeresim lapsus propria quoque dogmata addidisse nonnulla fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> That hee is reported to haue fallen into the heresie of the Arrians, and to haue added certaine opinions of his owne, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 53.

                  <p>Neither yet in the pure time of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church was prayer for the dead gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beleeued, as I haue proued before in the answere to contradict. 8. 4. p. art. 2. And this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14822:106"/>
may further appeare, because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no Canon more ancient for this matter, then from the third Carthaginian Councel, Can. 29. which was aboue 420. yeeres after Christ: but so long wee hold not the pure time of the Primitiue Church to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, which extended not much beyond the age of the Apostles, if you speake of the purest times thereof. And that Canon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of prayer for the dead, but onely of the commendation or commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the dead: <hi>Si defunctorum commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio facienda est, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is confessed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many sentences of <hi>Augustine</hi> are left out, that seeme to make for prayer for the dead. But what then? first, whereas it is graunted that <hi>Augustine</hi> held that error, to what purpose should his words be alleaged to proue that which was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Secondly, whereas it was affirmed, that sometime <hi>his speech soundeth to the contrarie,</hi> was he bound to alleage any but these words, which seemed so to sound? Thirdly, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whereas the reporter of <hi>Augustine,</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth off the sentence at these words, <hi>they are the comforts of the liuing, no helpe to the dead,</hi> and leaueth the rest that followeth: hath he not herein <hi>Augustines</hi> owne example, who repeating the same words and sentence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with very little alteration, <hi>libr. de cur. pro mortuis cap.</hi> 2. proceedeth no further, but then
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14822:107"/>
addeth other words: for there he saith thus: <hi>Curatio funeris, conditio sepulturae, pompa exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiarum magis viuorum solatia sunt, quam sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidia mortuorum:</hi> The manner of sepulture, pompe of exequies are rather comforts of the liuing, then helpes of the dead. And there hee breaketh off, no further following the course of his speech in the 34. Serm. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but what if the Libeller himself hath man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled <hi>Augustines</hi> sentence, clipping off that which maketh against him: as these words that follow: <hi>Non ergo mortuis noua merita</hi>

What reason had this (Carper) now to leaue out all these words, which shew that nothing is added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the state of the dead, but what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured while they liued: which sheweth that prayer for the dead is vaine and superfluous, if nothing thereby be obtained for the dead, which they had not before.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14822:107"/>
and a falsifier of him, and so is truly guiltie of that crime, wherewith vntruly he chargeth another?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he crieth out of false dealing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>agmina exequiarum,</hi> is translated, <hi>the rites and solemnities of buriall,</hi> wheras he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he plaieth the better translator to say, <hi>the multitude of people attending vpon the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi> Now sir, let vs see who hath translated best.

                  <p>Fourthly, this place hee saith, maketh not for the Protestants, but against them.</p>
                  <p>First, hee hath not answered those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from hence enforced: the rites and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of the buriall are comforts of the liuing, they helpe not the dead, prayer is of the rites of buriall: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it helpeth not the dead. To this he answereth nothing: but <hi>see good Reader,</hi> pag. 244. where our intent is not to denie the scope of <hi>Augustines</hi> discourse, but onely to shew, that some of his speeches sound otherwise. By the same collection, <hi>offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia postremi muneris,</hi> the offices of the last du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>erga suos,</hi> toward theirs, not <hi>suorum corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the bodies of theirs, may carrie a sound contrarie to the discourse, that prayer being one of the rites of buriall, is one of the last duties to be performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:14822:108"/>Secondly, neither is this so pregnant a place as he thinketh, for popish praier for the dead: for it shall appeare that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene this kinde of commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the dead, which <hi>Augustine</hi> here spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, and that which they vse.</p>
                  <p>1. He saith, <hi>Fideles quando moriuntur paulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines time.</note> 
                     <hi>à nobis abire, &amp; transire ad meliora:</hi> That the faithfull that die, goe away for a while, and passe to a better place: <hi>Ergo,</hi> not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie: for that is no better place: neither is it, <hi>fidei gaudium,</hi> a reioy cing or ioy of faith, as <hi>Augustine</hi> also saith, that our friends goe to be tormented in purgatorie: they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praied not for the soules of the dead as broyling in purgatorie, as the Church of Rome doth.</p>
                  <p>2. Whereas <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>This receiued from our fathers the whole Church obserueth, that for those which die in the communion of the bodie and blood of Christ, when as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed,</hi> commemorantur, <hi>in their place,</hi> ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium ipsum, <hi>at the sacrifice, it should be prayed for.</hi> He gathereth from hence, that this was the generall practise of the Church to<note place="margin">Difference betweene commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the dead, and prayer for the dead.</note> pray for the dead: whereas this onely is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that their names that were departed, were commemorated in the sacrifice, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament so called (because then they offered vp the spirituall sacrifice of praise &amp; thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, whereof it is called the Eucharist) and this commemoration, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14822:109"/>
of the dead (both which words <hi>Augustine</hi> vseth here) was as the common prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests and desires of the Church for them.</p>
                  <p>3. He saith here, that <hi>mortuis noua merita</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No new merits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the dead, by the prayers of the liuing.</note> 
                     <hi>non acquiruntur,</hi> that new merits are not by these prayers obtained for the dead. If the simple people were so taught in the popish church, they would not greatly care for their Masses and Dirges, when they are gone: but <hi>Augustine</hi> for that, thus answereth, that while they liued they obtained, <hi>vt possint eis haec vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia esse post mortem,</hi> that these things may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, when they are dead. But I pray you, if the worthines of the dead, while they liued, do make the prayers of the liuing auaileable; was it not much more effectuall to make their own prayers auaileable for themselues, while they liued, that they should not neede any prayers, when they are dead? This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice will slake the prayers of the liuing one for another for if it bee so that my accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God maketh another mans pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers acceptable for me, and he rather doth not make me better accepted with God, what neede should I haue of his prayers, seeing my acceptance with God will as soone make mine owne prayers acceptable as the prayers of another? Yea further let this be marked, that their Masses are not auaileable for the dead absolutely, but with a condition, if they were worthie while they liued, to haue Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14822:109"/>
said for them when they are dead: then the vertue and worthines of your Masses must depend vpon the vertue and worthines of those for whom they are said or sung. If you would open this secret to your blind ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, they would little regard your Trentals, Obites, Masses of <hi>Requiem,</hi> when they are gone.</p>
                  <p>4. It then appeareth, that if the Church vsed to pray for the faithfull gone to heauen, if they made commemoration and rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of them, yet thinking that they procured no new merit or fauour for them: then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that those prayers were not made vpon any necessitie, but rather of a tender compassion, piety and pitie toward the dead: as <hi>Augustine</hi> here calleth them, <hi>piae chordae</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer for the dead of pitie, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> necessitie in Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines time.</note> 
                     <hi>charorum:</hi> the tender and deuout hearts of their deare friends. Thus much <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, <hi>Confess. lib. 9. cap.</hi> 13. that his mother dying, <hi>Tantummodo memoriam sui ad altare tuum fieri desyderauit:</hi> Onely desired that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her might bee made at thine altar, and no otherwise. And though <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> prayed for her: he saith, <hi>Credo, quod iam feceris, quod rogo, sed voluntaria oris mei ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proba Domine:</hi> I beleeue, that thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie done, that which I pray for, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the voluntaries of my mouth. He ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayeth for his mother rather to shew
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14822:110"/>
his pietie and dutie toward her, then of any necessitie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, now because, this (vncharitable Censor) vaunteth of <hi>Augustine,</hi> as being wholy theirs for prayer for the dead, I will therefore at large shew what may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of that learned Fathers workes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, and draw from thence most strong and inuincible reasons against this superstitious vse.</p>
                  <p>First, it is superfluous to pray either for the<note place="margin">Reasons out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst prayer for the dead.</note> blessed in heauen or damned in hell: as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> saith, <hi>Qui orat pro martyre iniuriam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit martyri; qui orat pro damnatis, nequaquam impetrabit:</hi> Hee that prayeth for a martyr, doth wrong to the martyr; he that prayeth for the damned, shall not obtaine: <hi>ad fratres in erem. serm.</hi> 42. But after this life all are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen or hell, blessed or damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are but two places after this life:<note place="margin">Augustine knoweth no third place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side heauen and hell.</note> 
                     <hi>Duae habitationes, vna in igne aeterno, altera in regno aeterno:</hi> There are but two habitations, one in euerlasting fire, another in the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting kingdome, <hi>de verb. Apost. ser.</hi> 18. Beside these two places: <hi>Tertium penitus ignoramus, imo nec esse in scripturis sanctis reperimus:</hi> The third place wee are vtterly ignorant of, nay we finde it not in the holie Scriptures. But it will bee obiected that <hi>Augustines</hi> meaning is, that there shall be but two places at the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14822:110"/>
day of iudgement, not presently after this life. Ans. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Sub omnipotentis manu tria sunt facta habitacula, primum reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num coelorum, imum infernus, medium mundus praesens:</hi> There are three tabernacles made by the hand of the omnipotent: the first, the kingdome of heauen; the lowest, hell; the middest, this present world, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de triplie. habitac.</hi> He speaketh of the places, that are now present: but if this book shall be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, he saith in another place, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 57. <hi>Est quaedam poena futura ignis gehennae, ignis aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus: futura enim poena duas habet species, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferorum est vbi ardebat diues ille, &amp;c. &amp; altera est in fine, de qua audituri sunt, &amp;c.</hi> There is a certaine punishment to come, the fire of hel, fire euerlasting: this punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to come hath two kindes, either it is hell, where the rich man burned, &amp;c. another shall be in the end, whereof they shall heare which shall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the left hand, goe into euerlasting fire. What now is become of your third kind of fire and punishment in purgatorie?</p>
                  <p>The conclusion followeth, that it is in vain and superfluous to pray for the dead, seeing they are either in heauen or in hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If nothing profit the dead, but what they did themselues, when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, then the prayers of the liuing cannot profit them now they are dead, for it is none of their acts, neither are they now aliue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:14822:111"/>But the first is true by the testimonie of<note place="margin">No man profited being dead, but by that which he did in his life.</note>

Wherefore then (will it be said) doth <hi>Augustine</hi> allow prayer for the dead? I answere, that they did it in some commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14822:113"/>
and tender affection, not of any necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as I shewed before: and then prayer for the dead was farre differing from popish Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Masses of <hi>Requiem,</hi> as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>And what if <hi>Augustine,</hi> or any other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church, doth seeme to like and approue prayer for the dead? that is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant, vnlesse they can shew their ground out of Scripture. And this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe would haue vsed toward his writings: <hi>Auferantur de medio chartae nostrae, procedat in medium codex Dei: audi Christum dicentem, audi veritatem loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem:</hi> Let our writings bee taken out of the way, let the booke of God be brought forth: heare Christ saying, heare the trueth spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>in Psal.</hi> 57.

                  <p>Whereas then the Libeller thinketh, that these words, which were sorted out of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> doe little make against prayer for the dead; indeede it may well be, that more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant places might haue been produced out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> to that end, as any of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged: yet howsoeuer, for any thing he hath said for himself, there remaineth some life in those obiections still, and the partie

away his hold for the sacrifice of the Altar, may not hee be counted a shamelesse man, that in the same place, where he obiecteth a fault to another, committeth the same him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?

                  <p>Now in these words lieth hidden the whole sense: the Martyrs are the same bodie (or as learned <hi>Viues</hi> expoundeth) <hi>ex Christi corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> of Christs body, which is the sacrifice.

Is this any other then the mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christs Church? But how is the church otherwise offered vp in sacrifice, then by their spiritual sacrifice of praise and thanksgiuing?

                  <p>1. FIrst, the Pelagians did hold these two opinions: first, that a man may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect without sin, and keepe all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God in this life. Secondly, that a man is able to doe all this without grace by his owne free will.

And againe, <hi>epistol.</hi> 89. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> handleth these two questions seuerally: first, whether a man may attaine to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this life to be without all sinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14822:120"/>
whether mans free will doe suffice to keepe all the commandements, <hi>quaest.</hi> 2. Now then seeing the Pelagians held both these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious assertions, it was impertinent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that opinion, which to the aduersarie was not obiected. These being then two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Pelagians, that <hi>all the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be kept in this life, and that by free will without grace:</hi> the first onely is obiected, and the other as impertinent omitted.</p>
                  <p>2. But it will bee obiected, that the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians error herein was not, whether it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to keep the commandements, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one may be perfect in this life without sinne?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> All these doe depend one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for he that can keepe all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements is perfect, and consequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne. This first is proued by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Iam. 3. 2. <hi>If any man sinne not in word, he is a perfect man:</hi> much more is he perfect that sinneth neither in word nor deede. Againe, 1. Ioh. 3. 4. <hi>Sinne is the transgression of the law:</hi> he then that transgresseth not the law, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not: and he that transgresseth it, sinneth. If a man then keepe al the commandements, he also sinneth not. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Cur non</hi>

                        </gap>in. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>praeciperetur homini ista perfectio quamuis eam in hac vita nemo habeat?</hi> Why should not this perfection be commaunded, though in this life no man can haue it? The perfection com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14822:120"/>
is to keepe Gods commandements: as a little before he said; <hi>Non omni modo ex tota anima diligitur Deus:</hi> God is not here lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued altogether with the whole heart. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Tunc homo iustus erit:</hi> Then a man shall be iust without sinne (that is in the next life) when he shall with his whole soule loue God. Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> confuteth <hi>Celestius</hi> the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, that affirmed it was commanded, that man should be without sinne: shewing, that man can neither be perfect in this life, with that perfection which is commanded, nor yet perfectly keepe the commandements. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> likewise disputing against the Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that held, <hi>facilia esse Dei praecepta,</hi> that the precepts of God might be done, thus reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: first, <hi>Cur ausus es dicere facilia esse, quae nullus impleuit?</hi> How dare you say they are easie to bee done, seeing no man euer kept them? Secondly, whereas they demaunded,<note place="margin">The Lawe no man can keepe, though as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with grace.</note> whether the commandements were possible or impossible: he answereth: <hi>Si hoc mihi cum Christo commune, &amp;c.</hi> If this bee common to me with Christ, that is, to haue no sinne, <hi>quid ille proprium habuit,</hi> what was then proper to him? Thirdly, <hi>Asseris homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse sine peccato si velit, &amp;c.</hi> You say a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be without sin if he will, <hi>frustra conaris adiungere, non sine Dei gratia:</hi> and after an heauie sleepe to deceiue simple soules, you goe about in vaine to say, not without Gods grace: <hi>sic Hieron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphont.</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:14822:121"/>
Thus <hi>Hierome</hi> prooueth against the Pelagians that the commandements cannot be kept, because Christ onely was without sinne: Whereupon it must be inferred, that they which keep the commandements sinne not: yea he seemeth to mislike the Pelagians assertion, that a man may be without sinne, being not without the grace of God.</p>
                  <p>To be then without sinne in this life, and to keepe the commaundements, is all one question both with <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Hierome:</hi> and this differing from the other, whether free will be sufficient thereto without grace. <hi>Augustine</hi> then is neither mangled nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, when one opinion is singled from the other, and that onely produced which is obiected.</p>
                  <p>3. It is one question, whether it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by the grace of God to be without sin and to keep all the commandements: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether any man, <hi>de facto,</hi> hath in act liued without sinne and kept the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. The first <hi>Augustine</hi> seemeth to graunt in these words: <hi>Et si non inuenitur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo in ista vita sine peccato, id tamen dicitur pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se fieri, &amp;c.</hi> Although no man is found in this life to be without sinne, yet it may be said to be done by the helpe of Gods grace: which that it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

it is not diabolicall impietie, but humane er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>optanda affirmare, licet, quod affirmat; non possit ostendere,</hi> to affirme things to be wished, though hee cannot shew that which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: <hi>epistol. ad Innocent.

                  </p>
                  <p>But concerning the other point, that the law is impossible to be kept in fact, and that no man euer fulfilled it, <hi>Bernard</hi> doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently witnesse: <hi>Ergo mandando impossibilia non praeuaric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:14822:122"/>2. Secondly, the Rhemists then are not wronged, for these are their owne words: <hi>It is possible to loue God and keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Ioh. 14. sect. 1. they make no mention here of Gods grace, though out of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that may bee gathered to be their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we will not take them short, as this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall and vnfriendly Censurer vseth to do, for the omission of a word. Againe, they say, <hi>that good men doe keepe all Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Luk. 1. sect. 7. because the Scripture saith of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they walked in all the commaundements of God without blame: what else in effect doe the Pelagians say, when they affirme, <hi>Vitam iust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>res.</hi> 88. For as I shewed before, to keepe all the commaundements of God, and to be without sinne, doe necessarily the one follow the other. The Pelagians also held, that a<note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pelagians and Papists.</note> man might be perfect in this life: alleaging that text, Matth. 5. <hi>Be perfect as your heauenly father is perfect,</hi> and such other. The Rhemists also say, that a man may be perfect in this life, <hi>Though not in respect of the absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnes in heauen: in Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. Neyther did the Pelagians so thinke, that a man could bee as perfect here as in heauen: for they speake of that perfection, which is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scriptures: which doe not bid vs to be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14822:122"/>
so perfect: And <hi>Augustine</hi> confesseth, that such perfection, as in commaunded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, cannot be had in this life, as I shewed<note place="margin">De perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. iustit. cont.

                  <p>3. Thirdly, it will be obiected, that the Pelagians excluded the grace of God, so doe not the Papists.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> First, though therein they ioyne not with the Pelagians, yet in the other point they doe, that the commandements of God may bee kept in this life. Secondly, neither did the Pelagians vtterlie exclude Gods grace: for <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproued for ascribing so little to the help of Gods grace, afterward qualified his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thus, saying, <hi>Homines facilius implere posse per gratiam:</hi> That men may more easily fulfill by grace what they are bid to doe by their free wil, <hi>Haere.</hi> 88. And some of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans allowed that saying: <hi>Potest homo esse sine peccato pergratiam:</hi> a man may be without sin by grace. Whereupon <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia repente perfusus sum, quod Dei gratiam non negaret:</hi> I suddenly reioyced, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not the grace of God: <hi>de natur. &amp; grat.</hi>

                     <hi>cap.</hi> 11. And before <hi>Hierome</hi> sheweth, that they added this to their sentence, <hi>non sine gratia Dei,</hi> not without the grace of God. And though the Church of Rome in shew seeme to ascribe more to Gods grace then the old Pelagiáns, yet they make grace but a <hi>cooperator</hi> and fellow worker with mans free will, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> distinguisheth grace into <hi>gratiam operantem &amp; cooperantem,</hi> working grace, and felloworking grace: <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de grat. c.</hi> 2. the Rhemists call Gods speciall motion and grace assistance, Rom. 9. sect. 4.</p>
                  <p>Now then by this that hath been said, it may appeare, that <hi>Augustine</hi> is neither cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in this place, nor the Rhemists falsely charged.</p>

But in that place cited by <hi>Bellarm.</hi> there is no such thing affirmed by <hi>Augustine:</hi> for in the exposition of the Psalme I finde not so much as <hi>Salomons</hi> name, and in the enarration, he onely saith: <hi>Quid mirum si in populo Dei cecidit Salomon, in</hi>

He speaketh of the fall of <hi>Salomon,</hi> not of his reprobation: for if <hi>Salomon</hi> fell no otherwise then <hi>Adam,</hi> he was not a reprobate.</p>
                  <p>2. The Grammaticall construction of this sentence of <hi>Bellarmine, Augustinus absurdissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum censuit, quod haeresis Donatistarum, &amp;c.</hi> May seeme rather to yeeld this sense, that <hi>Augustine</hi> thought most absurdly, or a most absurd thing, then that he thought it an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd thing: for in this translation two things must be vnderstood, both the verbe, <hi>esse,</hi> to be, and <hi>hoc,</hi> or <hi>id,</hi> this: so that to make a full sense, the words must be supplied thus: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus hoc absurdissimum esse censuit: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> thought this to bee an absurd thing, that, &amp;c. But in the other construction there is a full sense in the words expressed, without any supplie. Now any simple Grammarian knoweth this, that the words expressed doe rather make the sense, if they be perfect, then words supplied or vnderstood. If euer the Libeller taught Grammer boyes, hee might haue remembred, that they are not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to say, <hi>supple,</hi> or <hi>subaudi,</hi> to supplie such or such a word, where the sentence of it selfe maketh a full sense.</p>
                  <p>3. But this is no malicious dealing (Sir
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14822:124"/>
Grammarian) if <hi>Bellarmines</hi> sense bee as you say, to mistake his meaning, especially y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> right construction of the words bearing the same. A small ouersight is neither malicious nor shamefull. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith: <hi>Non tam simplex sum, vt simplicem oris prolationem sine cordis du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitate mendaciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> putem:</hi> I am not so simple to think the simple pronouncing of the mouth without a double heart to be a lie, <hi>epistol.</hi> 89. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is rather to be blamed, that in such ambiguous termes sendeth his oracles from Rome, as <hi>Apollo</hi> in time past did propound his Oracles at Delphos so doubtfully, that they might haue a diuers meaning.</p>
                  <p>4. But what haue you gained, if it be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to you, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> meaneth, not that <hi>August. thought an absurd thing,</hi> but <hi>that it was an absurd thing that the heresie of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists after three hundred yeeres should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated into all the world?</hi> For in steed of one lie, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is said to father vppon <hi>Augustine,</hi> now is he chargeable with three: for in that <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>de vnitat. Eccles.</hi> neither the word <hi>absurdissimum,</hi> most absurd, can bee found, neither is there any mention of <hi>three hundred yeeres,</hi> nor yet is the <hi>heresie</hi> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists named: nay <hi>Augustine</hi> of purpose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraineth to call the Donatists heretikes, and their schisme heresie: <hi>Si mihi per alios vestros concederetur, schismaticos vos libentius, quam baereticos dicerem:</hi> If your fellowes would giue

Yea <hi>Augustine</hi> saith to him (<hi>fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cresconi</hi>) brother <hi>Cresconius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 63. so farre is he from calling him heretike.</p>
                  <p>And as these words are not found in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> so neither is the sense: for he speaketh not of the propagation of the Donatists er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors into all the world, but counteth it a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and mad part to thinke, that all the Churches in the world should faile, <hi>Et earum reparationem ex Africa per partem Donati, &amp;c.</hi> And the same to be repaired out of Africa by the sect of <hi>Donatus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say then as <hi>Augustine</hi> to the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Cresconius,</hi> who contended about a Grammar point with <hi>Augustine: In quibus quatuor verbis siue nominibus, quia hoc vel tibi, vel arti Grammaticae placet, &amp;c. primum corrigo &amp; muto: caetera vero tria, quia verissima dicta esse iam, vt puto, sentis, vos corrigite, vos mutate:</hi> In these foure words or names, because it so liketh you and your Grammar, I will correct and chaunge the first: but the other three, which (as I thinke) your selfe see to be truly obiected, doe you chaunge and correct. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is now much beholding vnto you, that for one fault before noted, you haue caused three or foure more to be descried.</p>
                  <p>5. Lastly, I marueile at one thing, that he which plaieth here the cunning Grammarian

So likewise in another place this skilfull Grammarian readeth the (Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calipse) of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> for (Apocalypse) pag. 130. lin. 14. But as for this point of Grammar construction, which hee obiecteth, though it be as he saith, I stand not much vpon it: but as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> answered <hi>Aeschines</hi> that found fault with him, for certaine insolent speeches: <hi>Non in eo positas esse fortunas Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae:</hi> That the state of Greece consisted not therein, whether he vsed this word or that. So neither doth the cause of religion depend vpon these points. And I say againe as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> iested with the Donatists: <hi>Nuncia ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris securitatem, ne iam timeant tanquam dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecticum, cui vides adhuc necessariam esse Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticam:</hi> Bid your fellowes be secure, that they feare not him as a disputer, whom they see to faile in his Grammar. And so I end this point with the same Fathers words, <hi>In ea re, in qua nihil causae nostrae minuitur, facilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum me praebeo:</hi> Wherein nothing of our cause is diminished, I passe not to yeeld my selfe.</p>

                  <p>1.

               <p>4. Neither is there the like case of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical and Ciuill iudgement: neither is the same course to be held in punishing of Ciuill and temporall, and spirituall offences: for the one tendeth to the dissolution of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike bodie, as the outrages of traytors and felons, and therefore must speedily bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented: the other though they doe spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Difference in Ciuill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> infect, yet are not so dangerous to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, but may more safely be forborne.

                  <p>2. And where the Apostle saith, <hi>certaine:</hi>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:14822:130"/>
this word maketh a distinction betweene those that haue faith and a good conscience, whereof the Apostle speaketh in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the verse, and them that make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of both: not betweene some that make shipwracke of a good conscience and keepe faith, and them which put away both: but the Apostle speaketh in generall of all such, that if they put away a good conscience, consequently they also wracke their faith. As the Apostle elsewhere sheweth, 1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. <hi>That they which depart from the faith, haue</hi>

                  <p>3. Sometime the manner of speech is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: Matth. 13. 15. The Prophet speaketh in the imparatiue, <hi>make the heart of this people fat.</hi> Esay. 6. 9. the Euangelist: this peoples heart is waxed fat: Matth. 1. 13. the person is changed: they shal call his name: Esay. 7. 14. <hi>she shall call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Sometime another word is vsed, but in the same sense: Matth. 4. 14. <hi>sate in darknes.</hi> Esay. 9. 2. <hi>walke in darknes.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:14822:131"/>5. The sense is gathered, not the words rehearsed: Matth. 22. 24. out of Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom. 25. 5.</p>
                  <p>6. Sometime an argument is framed out of the scripture, not there expressed, but from thence collected: as Matth. 22. 32. Christ concludeth the resurrection out of these words: <hi>I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith: <hi>Apostolis curae fuit non verba &amp; syllabas aucupari, sed sententias dogmatum ponere:</hi> The Apostles care was not to hunt after words and syllables, but to set downe the sentence.</p>
                  <p>And as the Scriptures are not corrupted, when the sense, though not the words, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: So may the Scriptures bee abused, when the same words are kept, but the sense altered: as Matth. 5. 38. <hi>an eye for an eye, &amp;c.</hi> the Pharisies did vse the words, but wrested the sense, when they applied that to priuate mens reuenge, which was lawfull onely for the Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>Now then to applie these rules: in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces obiected there is no corruption: for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. 17. 5. it is forbidden to trust in man: then consequently ver. 7. where the Prophet saith, <hi>Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord,</hi> the sense must be, that God onely is to be trusted in: therefore, <hi>not in man,</hi> is added out of the 5. verse: not <hi>foisted in,</hi> as he ignorantly and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14822:132"/>
maliciously saith. In the other place, Psalm. 50. 15. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me:</hi> an argument is from thence gathered, that wee must onely call vpon God: for who els but God doth deliuer vs? who els but God is to be glorified for our deliuerance? So that this is the order, as <hi>Augustine</hi> well sheweth: <hi>Cum tribularis inuocas me; cum inuocas me, eximam te; cum eximam te iam glorificabis me, vt iam non discedas à me:</hi> When thou art in trouble thou doest call vpon me; when thou doest call vpon me, I will deliuer thee; when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thee, thou shalt glorifie me, that now thou doe not depart from me: <hi>in Psal.</hi> 49.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to these places to adde <hi>onely,</hi> to shew the sense of the place, that God onely is to be <hi>trusted in,</hi> only <hi>called vpon,</hi> is no more corruption, then where <hi>Moses</hi> is alleaged to say: him <hi>onely</hi> shalt thou serue, Matth. 4. 10. whereas <hi>Moses</hi> only saith, <hi>him shalt thou serue.</hi>

                  <head>The Correction.</head>
                  <p>1. FIrst: He might easily haue seene that the text is not alleaged in the same forme of words: for Christ speaketh in the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14822:135"/>
second person, <hi>when you haue done, &amp;c.</hi> the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is pronounced in the first, <hi>when we haue done:</hi> therefore the sense was more aimed at then the words.</p>
                  <p>2. So much of the sentence is alleaged, as was pertinent to shew that no workes are meritorious, because when wee haue done all, wee <hi>are vnprofitable,</hi> in which word lieth the force of this testimonie in this place: Yet otherwhere the whole sentence is produced, where the occasion so requireth: as Synops. pag. 288. argum. 3. and pag. 662. arg. 2. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had no iust cause to complaine of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>3. The Euangelists in citing the old scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, repeate so much of the sentence, as is to the purpose, and leaue the rest: as Mat. 4. 13. out of Esay 9. 1. a great part of the verse is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>4. And if this bee a point of corruption, <hi>Hierome</hi> also is a corrupter of Scripture, who thus alleageth this text: <hi>Cum omnia feceritis, dicite, serui inutiles sumus:</hi> when you haue done all, say ye are vnprofitable seruants. He leaueth out: <hi>all things that are commaunded you, &amp;c. ad Ctesiphont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Secondly: 1. Our Sauiour speaketh of that profit which redoundeth to our selues: as may appeare by the parable, <hi>Doth he thank that seruant, &amp;c. So likewise,</hi> where no thankes is receiued, what profit to a man is gained or
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:14822:135"/>
deserued? And if it be taken, as he saith, that wee are vnprofitable seruants to God, this place still remaineth strong against merits: for if God receiue nothing from vs, then can we not merit or deserue from him.</p>
                  <p>2. Our Sauiour speaketh not of men in the corruption of nature, for they are not Gods seruants being not yet called, but of such as are vnder grace, and doe walke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Gods commaundements: and so doth <hi>Ambrose</hi> expound it: <hi>Quis tanta sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis beneficia digno possit aequare seruitio:</hi> Who can counteruaile so great benefits of saluation with worthie seruice? <hi>serm.</hi> 16. <hi>in Psal.</hi> 119.</p>
                  <p>3. And of all other it is most absurd, that Christ biddeth vs so to say for humilitie: as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Quomodo est humilitas vbi</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We are all vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in veritie, not only in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</note> 
                     <hi>regnat falsitas:</hi> There is no humilitie, where there is falsitie: <hi>Non ita caueatur arrogantia, vt veritas relinquatur:</hi> Doe not so take heede of arrogancie, that you leaue the veritie: <hi>Caus.</hi> 22. <hi>qis.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. 11. It is not to be thought that Christ the veritie, would haue his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles lie for humilitie: to confesse themselues to be vnprofitable seruants, if they were not so indeede. For a more full answere concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true meaning of this Scripture, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Reader to another treatise, Synops. pag. 933.</p>

                  <p>1. HEre not so much the sentence, as the sense of the Scripture is applied: doth the Scripture say nothing, but that which in so many words is expressed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? then should we want Scripture for the probation of many substantial poynts of our faith. That then is not only Scripture, which in so many words is there found, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so which may be from thence necessarily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: As our Sauiour maketh that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is inferred out of Scripture: as Matth. 22. 31. <hi>Concerning the resurrection of the dead, haue you not heard what is spoken to you of God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing:</hi> In these words our Sauiour saith, that God <hi>speaketh of the resurrection:</hi> whereof there is no expresse mention, but onely a naturall and proper collection. That then is not onely Scripture, which the words onely betoken, but which the sense also truely collected, yeeldeth, as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith: <hi>Nec putemus Euangeliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis esse, sed in sensu; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in superficie, sed in medul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la; non in sermonum folijs, sed in radice rationis:</hi> Let vs not thinke the Gospell to bee in the words, but in the sense; not in the outward
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14822:143"/>
shew, but the marrowe; not in the leaues, but in the roote, <hi>in epist. ad Galat. c.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>2. The Scripture here alleaged, Ioh. 17. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is only produced to proue that the elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are giuen vnto Christ: the wordes stand thus, <hi>Who are not contented to say, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, that Christ was giuen only for those which are giuen him, to whom he giueth eternall life,</hi> Iohn 17. 2. <hi>That is, the elect, for to them only is life euerlasting</hi> giuen: by the collection out of this text, it doth appeare wherefore it is quoted: that the elect onely are giuen to Christ, because they onely haue eternall life. The argument may be framed thus: Eternall life is giuen to all those that are giuen to Christ: none but the elect haue eternall life: <hi>Ergo,</hi> none but they are giuen to Christ. The proposition of this argument is grounded vpon the very words of the text, Iohn 17. 2. But that Christ <hi>was giuen onely for those, which are giuen him,</hi> is taken as graunted, for none that stand for vniuersall grace, that I knowe deny this assertion, but the question is, who are giuen vnto Christ. <hi>Snecanus</hi> a patron of vniuersall grace, affirmeth that <hi>Iudas</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto Christ, p. 724. wee affirme that the elect onely are giuen. Therefore seeing this Scripture was not brought forth to fortifie this assertion out of these words, <hi>Christ was giuenly only for those, &amp;c.</hi> he cannot proue any addition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:14822:143"/>And yet further, this assertion, that Christ died only for the elect giuen vnto him, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent also out of this chapter, Ioh. 17. vers. 9. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world; but for those which thou hast giuen me.</hi> From whence, this reason may be enforced: Christ prayed onely for those which are giuen vnto him; he gaue himselfe to death onely for those whom hee prayed for: vers. 19. <hi>for their sakes doe I sanctifie my self,</hi> which was by sacrificing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, Rhem. Ioh. 17. 19. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he gaue himselfe to death only for those, which are giuen vnto him, that is, the elect. Wherefore both these assertions, that the elect are onely giuen to Christ, and that Christ was giuen onely for the elect, being so euidently deduced out of scripture, it is no corruption to affirme, that the Scripture saith, <hi>that Christ was onely giuen for those, that are giuen him, that is, the elect.</hi>

                  <p>3. <hi>Ambrose</hi> proueth out of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Christ died onely for the Elect.</note> that Christ was not giuen, but only to those which beleeue: as vpon these words of Esay 9. ver. 6. <hi>Vnto vs a child is borne, a sonne is giuen: Puer natus est nobis, non Iudaeis; nobis, non Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichaeis; nobis, id est credentibus, non incredulis, &amp;c.</hi> A childe is borne to vs, not to the Iewes; to vs, not to the Manichees; to vs, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, not vnbeleeuers: <hi>Sic puer non omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus natus est, sed fidelibus:</hi> So the child was not borne for all, but for the faithfull, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de fid. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Augustine</hi> also out of the Scripture
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14822:144"/>
proueth the same: Christ died for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, which he sheweth by this scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Ioh. 11. 52. <hi>Iesus was to die for that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for that nation onely, but that hee should gather together in one, the children of God, which were scattered.</hi> But the elect are these children, and none els: <hi>Tales filij filio Christo dati sunt, quemadmodum ad patrem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ipse (vt omne, quod dedisti mihi, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam) hi ergo Christo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telliguntur dati, qui ordinati sunt ad vitam ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam, ipsi sunt illi praedestinati:</hi> Such sonnes are giuen to the sonne Christ, as hee saith to his father (that all that thou hast giuen me should not perish, but haue eternal life) these are vnderstood to be giuen to Christ, which are ordained to eternal life, they are y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, <hi>lib. de corrept. &amp; grat. c.</hi> 8. 9. Then this must be the conclusion, that Christ died for the elect and predestinate, and none els. And here by the way let it bee noted, that where <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Christ saith to his father (that all that thou hast giuen me should not perish, but haue eternall life</hi>) this sentence is neither found in these very words in the 17. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Christ prayeth to his father, nor in the 6. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the glosse noteth, <hi>dist.</hi> 4. <hi>de poenit. cap.</hi> 8. but is rather inferred vppon Christs words vttered in diuers places.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14822:145"/>
out of them that our Ladie was conceaued without sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Contra.</hi> 1. Why (Sir) as though any of these pretended corruptions of Scripture did adde to, or make any innouation in the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding text? your answere here if it were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, may serue very well for all your owne obiections.</p>
                  <p>2. It shall be shewed euen now, if you will haue a little patience, that you make bolde with the originall text, by adding to, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from it, by chopping &amp; changing of it.</p>
                  <p>3. What though this addition of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> be not in the text of your Bibles, yet is it in the text alleaged in your seruice for the Conception of the Virgin <hi>Marie:</hi> and the Pope graunted great indulgence to those which should say the (<hi>Aue Maria</hi>) with that clause: And seeing this annexed piece ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but one sentence with the (<hi>Aue Maria</hi>) being distinguished by an imperfect point; and <hi>blessed is the fruit of thy wombe Iesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>blessed is Anna thy mother, &amp;c.</hi> it cannot be but an addition to Scripture?</p>
                  <p>4. You say the conception of the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> without sinne is not grounded vpon this addition, or that we may pray to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: yet this new scripture, together with your new found feast of the Conception, is warranted by the authoritie of the Papal sea,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14822:145"/>
which hath power to allow Scripture: As it standeth in the decree of <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. <hi>De ipsius immaculata virginis mira conceptione gratias referant, &amp;c.</hi> That they should giue thankes for the miraculous conception of the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Virgin, and say Masses, &amp;c. that they may thereby by the merits of the Virgin bee made more fit, &amp;c. You imagin then, that her merits are greater because of her sinlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and so are ye more imboldened to pray to her: and therefore your inuocation vpon the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> is in part grounded vpon her miraculous conception. And all this the Pope ordaineth, <hi>by the authoritie of almightie God, and of his blessed Apostles Peter and Paul: Extrau. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>t.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing the Pope promiseth great indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to all those which shall celebrate this festiuall, and sing Masses in the honor of this miraculous conception, you must either say, that the Pope bringeth in a new seruice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant of Scripture, or that he maketh Scripture of his owne: now chuse which you will.</p>
                  <p>Now to keepe promise with you: it is an vsuall thing in your Church, both to adde to and take from Scripture, as may be seene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where in your vulgar Latin translation: It would fill a large volume to note all the places corrupted, but for a taste I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some.</p>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:14822:146"/>Genes. 21. 9. <hi>playing with Isaac,</hi> saith the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, where <hi>Isaac</hi> is added: 28. 5. <hi>Rebeckah, the mother of Esau and Iacob,</hi> left out in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin: 31. 47. <hi>both according to the proprietie of his language:</hi> this clause added. Genes. 34. 1. <hi>which she bare vnto Iacob,</hi> left out: 38. 12. <hi>the daughter of Suah Iudahs wife: daughter</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Latin: 41. 22. <hi>awaking, and againe ouercome of sleepe, &amp;c.</hi> added: 47. 22. <hi>they had their ordinarie of Pharaoh: out of the common barnes,</hi> saith the Latin. Exod. 2. 23. <hi>And she brought forth another sonne, and called his name Eleazar, saying, the God of my father is my hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and hath deliuered me out of the hand of Pharaoh:</hi> all this is added in the Latin, being not extant in the originall. A thousand such places might be remembred, wherein their Latin translation, which they haue decreed to bee authenticall, corrupteth the Hebrue text. But wee neede not giue an instance of lines, seeing they haue added whole leaues and bookes to the Canonicall Scripture, as the Apocryphal stories of <hi>Iudith, Tobie, Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees,</hi> with the rest.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne vnto my kind friend, that hath spied so many faults: what hath he gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the name of a false accuser? for there is not one of these deuised corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which either by example of Scripture, or like dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Fathers, or by conference with other places is not rectified and ratified.</p>
