         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Abbies, Priories,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE unwillingness of the Monks to part with their Land, will fall out to be just nothing, because they were yielded up to the King by a Supream Hand, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a Parliament. If a King conquer another Country, the People are loath to lose their Lands, yet no Divine will deny, but the King may give them to whom he please. If a Parliament make a Law concerning Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any other Commodity, you and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55794:7"/>
I for Example are Parliament-Men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in respect to our own private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, we are against it, yet the major Part conclude it, we are then in volv'd, and the Law is good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Founder of Abbies laid a Curse upon those that should take away those Lands, I would fain know what Power they had to curse me; 'Tis not the Curses that come from the Poor, or from any Body, that hurt me, because they come from them, but because I do something ill against them that deserves God should curse me for it. On the other side, 'tis not a Man's blessing me that makes me blessed, he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares me to be so, and if I do well I shall be blessed, whether any bless me or not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At the time of Dissolution, they were tender in taking from the Abbots and Priors their Lands and their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, till they surrendred them (as most of them did) indeed the Prior of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Richard Weston,</hi> being a stout Man, got into <hi>France,</hi> and stood out a whole Year, at last submitted, and the King took in that Priory also, to which the Temple belonged, and many other Houses in <hi>England,</hi> they did not then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55794:7"/>
cry no Abbots, no Priors, as we do now no Bishops, no Bishops.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth put away the Friars, Aliens, and seized to himself 100000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and therefore they were not the Protestants only that took away Church Lands.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, when all the Abbies were pulled down, all good Works defaced, then the Preachers must cry up Justification by Faith, not by good Works.</p>

            <head>Articles.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE nine and thirty Articles are much another thing in <hi>Latin,</hi> (in which Tongue they were made) than they are translated into <hi>English;</hi> they were made at three several Convocations, and confirmed by Act of Parliament six or seven Times after. There is a Secret concerning them: Of late Ministers have subscribed to all of them, but by Act of Parliament that confirm'd them, they ought only to subscribe to those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which contain matter of Faith, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the first Subscriptions. But Bisho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Bancroft</hi> (in the Convocation
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55794:8"/>
held in King <hi>Jame</hi>'s days) he began it, that Ministers should subscribe to three Things, to the King's Supremacy, to the Common-Prayer, and to the Thirty Nine Articles; many of them do not contain matter of Faith. Is it matter of Faith how the Church should be govern'd? Whether Infants should be baptized? Whether we have any Property in our Goods? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>Baptism.</head>
            <p n="1">1. 'TWas a good way to persuade Men to be christned, to tell them that they had a Foulness about them, <hi>viz.</hi> Original Sin, that could not be washed away but by Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Baptising of Children with us, does only prepare a Child against he comes to be a Man, to understand what Christianity means. In the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it has this Effect, it frees Children from Hell. They say they go into <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Infantum.</hi> It succeeds Circumcision, and we are sure the Child understood nothing of that at eight Days old; why then may not we as reasonably baptise a Child at that Age? in <hi>England</hi> of late years I ever thought the Parson
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55794:8"/>
baptiz'd his own Fingers rather than the Child.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Primitive Times they had God-fathers to see the Children brought up in the Christian Religion, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, when the Father was a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Mother was not, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when the Mother was a Christian, the Father was not, and therefore they made choice of two or more that were Christians, to see their Children brought up in that Faith.</p>

            <p n="1">1. 'TIS said the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>Deuteron. 2. [A Bastard shall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth Generation.] Non ingredietur in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam Domini,</hi> he shall not enter into the Church. The meaning of the Phraise is, he shall not marry a <hi>Jewish</hi> Woman. But upon this grosly mistaken; a Bastard at this Day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Dispensation, cannot take Orders; the thing haply well enough where 'tis so settled; but 'tis upon a Mistake, (the Place having no reference to the Church) appears plainly by what follows at the third Verse <hi>[An Ammonite or Moabite shall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55794:9"/>
not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to the tenth Generation.]</hi> Now you know with the <hi>Jews</hi> an <hi>Ammonite</hi> or a <hi>Moabite</hi> could never be a Priest; because their Priests were born so, not made.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Bible, Scripture.</head>
            <p n="1">1. 'TIS a great Question how we know Scripture to be Scripture, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Church, or by Man's private Spirit: Let me ask you, how I know any thing? how I know this Carpet to be green? First, because some body told me it was green; that you call the Church in your Way. Then after I have been told it is green, when I see that Colour again, I know it to be green, my own Eyes tell me it is green, that you call the private Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>English</hi> Translation of the Bible is the best Translation in the World, and renders the Sense of the Original best, taking in for the <hi>English</hi> Translation, the Bishop's Bible as well as King <hi>James</hi>'s. The Translation in King <hi>James</hi>'s time took an excellent way. That Part of the Bible was given to him who was most excellent in such a Tongue (as the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> to <hi>Andrew Downs)</hi> and then they met
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55794:9"/>
together, and one read the Translation, the rest holding in their Hands some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either of the learned Tongues, or <hi>French, Spanish, Italian,</hi> &amp;c. if they found any Fault, they spoke; if not he read on.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no Book so translated as the Bible for the purpose. If I tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate a <hi>French</hi> Book into <hi>English,</hi> I turn it into <hi>English</hi> Phrase, not into <hi>French English [Il fait froid]</hi> I say 'tis cold, not, it makes cold; but the Bible is rather translated into <hi>English</hi> Words than into <hi>English</hi> Phrase. The <hi>Hebraisms</hi> are kept, and the Phrase of that Language is kept: As for Example, [He uncover'd her Shame] which is well enough, so long as Scholars have to do with it; but when it comes among the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Lord, what Jeer do they make of it!</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Scrutamini Scripturas.</hi> These two Words have undone the World; because Christ spake it to his Disciples; therefore we must all, Men, Women and Children, read and interpret the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth made a Law, that all Men might read the Scripture, except Servants; but no Woman, except Ladies and Gentlewomen, who had Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and might ask somebody the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55794:10"/>
The Law was repeal'd in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Days.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Lay-men have best interpreted the hard Places in the Bible, such as <hi>Johannes Picus, Scaliger, Grotius, Salmansius, Heinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If you ask which of <hi>Erasmus, Beza,</hi> or <hi>Grotius</hi> did best upon the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, 'tis an idle Question: For they all did well in their Way. <hi>Erasmus</hi> broke down the first Brick, <hi>Beza</hi> added many things, and <hi>Grotius</hi> added much to him, in whom we have either something new, or something heighten'd, that was said before, and so 'twas necessary to have them all three.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Text serves only to guess by, we must satisfie our selves fully out of the Authors that liv'd about those times.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In interpreting the Scripture, many do as if a Man should see one have ten Pounds which he reckon'd by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. meaning four was but four Unites, and five sive Unites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he had in all but ten Pounds; the other that sees him, takes not the Figures together as he doth, but picks here and there, and thereupon reports, that he hath five Pounds in one Bag, and six Pounds in another Bag, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55794:10"/>
nine Pounds in another Bag, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when as in truth he hath but ten Pounds in all. So we pick out a Text here and there to make it serve our turn; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we take it altogether, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd what went before, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, we should find it meant no such thing.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Make no more Alegories in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than needs must, the Fathers were too frequent in them, they indeed before they fully understood the literal Sense, look'd out for an Alegory. The Folly whereof you may conceive thus: Here at the first sight appears to me in my Window a Glass and a Book; I take it for granted, 'tis a Glass and a Book, thereupon I go about to tell you what they signifie; afterwards upon nearer view, they prove no such thing; one is a Box made like a Book, the other is a Picture made like a Glass where's now my Alegory?</p>
            <p n="11">11. When Men meddle with the literal Text, the Question is, where they should stop: In this Case, a Man must venture his Discretion and do his best to satisfie himself and others in those Places where he doubts, for although we call the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Word of God (as it is) yet it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55794:11"/>
was writ by a Man, a mercenary Man, whose Copy, either might be false, or he might make it false: For Example, here were a thousand Bibles printed in <hi>England</hi> with the Text thus, <hi>[Thou shalt commit Adultery]</hi> the Word <hi>[not]</hi> left out; might not this Text be mended?</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Scripture may have more Senses besides the Literal; because God understands all things at once; but a Man's Writing has but one true Sense, which is that which the Author meant when he writ it.</p>
            <p n="13">13. When you meet with several Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Text, take heed you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing against the <hi>Tenets</hi> of your Church; but do as if you were going over a Bridge, be sure you hold fast by the Rail, and then you may dance here and there as you please; be sure you keep to what is settled, and then you may flourish upon your various Lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The <hi>Apocrypha</hi> is bound with the Bibles of all Churches that have been hitherto. Why should we leave it out? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has her <hi>Apocrypha</hi> (viz.) <hi>Susanna</hi> and <hi>Bell and the Dragon,</hi> which she does not esteem equally with the rest of those Books that we call <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</hi>

            <head>Bishops before the Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">1. A Bishop as a Bishop, had never any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: For as soon as he was <hi>Electus Confirmatus,</hi> that is, after the three Proclamations in <hi>Bow-Church,</hi> he might exercise Jurisdiction, before he was consecrated, not till then, he was no Bishop, neither could he give Orders. Besides, <hi>Suffragans</hi> were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and they never claim'd any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Anciently the Noble-Men lay within the City for Safety and Security. The Bishops Houses were by the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, because they were held sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which no body would hurt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There was some Sense for <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> at first, when there was a Living void, and never a Clerk to serve it, the Bishops were to keep it till they found a fit Man, but now 'tis a Trick for the Bishop to keep it for himself.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For a Bishop to preach, 'tis to do other Folks Office, as if the Steward of the House should execute the Porter's or the Cook's Place: 'Tis his Business to see that they and all other about the House perform their Duties.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:55794:12"/>
5. That which is thought to have done the Bishops hurt, is their going about to bring Men to a blind Obedience, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing things upon them [though perhaps small and well enough] without prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and insinuating into their Reasons and Fancies, every Man loves to know his Commander. I wear those Gloves; but perhaps if an Alderman should command me, I should think much to do it: What has he to do with me? Or if he has, peradventure I do not know it. This jumping upon things at first Dash will destroy all: To keep up Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, there must be little Addresses and Applications, whereas Bluntness spoils it quickly: To keep up the Hierarchy, there must be little Applications made to Men, they must be brought on by little and little: So in the Primitive Times the Power was gain'd, and so it must be continued. <hi>Scaliger</hi> said of <hi>Erasmus; Si minor esse voluit, major fuisset.</hi> So we may say of the Bishops, <hi>Si minores esse volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, majores fuissent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Bishops were too hasty, else with a discreet Slowness they might have had what they aim'd at: The old Story of the Fellow, that told the Gentleman, he might get to such a Place, if he did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55794:12"/>
not ride too fast, would have fitted their turn.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For a Bishop to cite an old Canon to strengthen his new Articles, is, as if a Lawyer should plead an old Statute that has been repeal'd God knows how long.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>Bishops in the Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">1. BIshops have the same Right to sit in Parliament as the best Earls and Barons, that is, those that were made by Writ: If you ask one of them <hi>[Arundel, Oxford, Northumberland]</hi> why they sit in the House? they can only say, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sate there before them, and their Grandfather before him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so say the Bishops, he that was a Bishop of this Place before me, sate in the House, and he that was a Bishop before him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed your latter Earls and Barons have it express'd in their Patents, that they shall be called to the Parliament. <hi>Objection,</hi> but the Lords sit there by Blood, the Bishops not. <hi>Answer,</hi> 'Tis true, they sit not there both the same way, yet that takes not away the Bishops Right: If I am a Parson of a Parish, I have as much Right to my Gleab and Tithe, as you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55794:13"/>
have to your Land which your Ancestors have had in that Parish Eight Hundred Years.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bishops were not Barons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had Baronies annex'd to their Bishopricks (for few of them had so, unless the old ones, <hi>Canterbury, Winchester, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. the new erected we are sure had none, as <hi>Glocester, Peterborough,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides few of the Temporal Lords had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Baronies.) But they are Barons, because they are called by Writ to the Parliament, and Bishops were in the Parliament ever since there was any mention, or sign of a Parliament in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Bishops may be judged by the Peers, tho' in time of Popery it never hapned, because they pretended they were not obnoxious to a secular Court; but their way was to cry <hi>Ego sum Frater Domini Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi> I am Brother to my Lord the Pope, and therefore take not my self to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you; in this Case they impanell'd a <hi>Middlesex</hi> Jury, and dispatch'd the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether may Bishops be present in Cases of Blood? <hi>Answ.</hi> That they had a Right to give Votes, appears by this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when they did go out, they left a Proxy, and in the time of the Abbots, one
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55794:13"/>
Man had 10, 20 or 30 Voices. In <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time, there was a Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Canons, by which they were forbidden to be present in Case of Blood. The Statute of 25th. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth may go a great way in this Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Clergy were forbidden to use or cite any Canon <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the latter End of the Statute, there was a Clause, that such Canons that were in usage in this Kingdom, should be in force till the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Commissioners appointed should make others, provided they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the King's Supremacy. Now the Question will be, whether these Canons for Blood were in use in this Kingdom or no? the contrary whereof may appear by many Presidents in <hi>R.</hi> 3. and <hi>H.</hi> 7. and the beginning of <hi>H.</hi> 8. in which time there were more attainted than since, or scarce before: The Canons of Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Blood were never receiv'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but upon pleasure. If a Lay-Lord was attainted, the Bishops assented to his Condemning, and were always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the passing of the Bill of Attainder. But if a Spiritual Lord, they went out, as if they car'd not whose Head was cut off, so none of their own. In those Days, the Bishops being of great Houses, were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55794:14"/>
often entangled with the Lords in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Treason. But when d'ye hear of Bishop a Traytor now?</p>
            <p n="5">5. You would not have Bishops meddle with Temporal Affairs, think who you are that say it. If a Papist, they do in your Church; if an <hi>English</hi> Protestant, they do among you; if a Presbyterian, where you have no Bishops, you mean your Presbyterian Lay-Elders, should meddle with temporal Affairs as well as Spiritual. Besides all Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Temporal, and in no Church, but they have some Jurisdiction or other. The Question then will be reduced to <hi>Magis</hi> and <hi>Minus;</hi> They meddle more in one Church than in another.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Objection.</hi> Bishops give not their Votes by Blood in Parliament, but by an Office annext to them, which being taken away they cease to vote, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not the same Reason for them as for Temporal Lords. <hi>Answ.</hi> We do not pretend they have that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the same Way, but they have a Right: He that has an Office in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> for his Life, the Office is as much his, as his Land is his that hath Land by Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55794:14"/>
7. Whether had the inferior Clergy ever any thing to do in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>Answ.</hi> No, no otherwise than thus, There were certain of the Clergy that used to assemble near the Parliament, with whom the Bishops, upon occasion might consult (but there were none of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, as 'twas afterwards settled, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Dean, the Arch-Deacon, one for the Chapter, and two for the Diocess) but it happened by continuance of time (to save Charges and Trouble) their Voices and the Consent of the whole Clergy were involved in the Bishops and at this Day the Bishops, Writs run, to bring all these to the Parliament, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops themselves stand for all.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Bishops were formerly one of these two Conditions, either Men bred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists and Civilians, sent up and down Ambassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> and other Parts, and so by their Merit came to that Greatness, or else great Noble Men's Sons, Brothers, and Nephews, and so born to govern the State: Now they are of a low Condition, their Education no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that way; he gets a Living, and then a greater Living, and then a greater than that, and so comes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55794:15"/>
9. Bishops are now unfit to Govern, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Learning, they are bred up in another Law, they run to the Text for something done amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> that nothing concerns <hi>England;</hi> 'tis just as if a Man would have a Kettle, and he would not go to our <hi>Brazier</hi> to have it made, as they make Kettles, but he would have it made as <hi>Hiram</hi> made his Brass-work, who wrought in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Temple.</p>
            <p n="10">10. To take away Bishops Votes, is but the beginning to take them away; for then they can be no longer useful to the King or State. 'Tis but like the little Wimble, to let in the greater An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Objection.</hi> But they are but for their Life, and that makes them always go for the King as he will have them. <hi>Answer.</hi> This is against a Double Charity, for you must always suppose a bad King and bad Bishops. Then again, whether will a Man be sooner content, himself should be made a Slave, or his Son after him? [when we talk of our Children, we mean our selves,] besides, they that have Posterity are more obliged to the King, than they that are only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in all the Reason in the World.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55794:15"/>
11. How shall the Clergy be in the Parliament, if the Bishops are taken away? <hi>Answer.</hi> By the Laity, because the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, in whom the rest of the Clergy are included, are sent to the taking away their own Votes, by being involv'd in the major Part of the House.

         <div type="part">
            <head>Bishops out of the Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IN the beginning Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were alike, like the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Country, whereof one is made Deputy Lieutenant, and another Justice of Peace, so one is made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, another a Dean; and that kind of Government by Arch-bishops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops no doubt came in, in imitation of the Temporal Government, not <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Divino.</hi> In time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, where they had a Legatus, there they placed an Arch-Bishop, where they had a Rector, there a Bishop, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might be instructed in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55794:16"/>
which now they had received into the Empire,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that speak ingeniously of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters, say, that a Bishop is a great Presbyter, and during the time of his being Bishop, above a Presbyter: as your President of the Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, is above the rest, yet he himself is no more than a Doctor of Physick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Words [Bishop and Presbyter] are promiscuously used, that is confessed by all: and tho' the Word [Bishop] be in <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> yet that will not prove the Bishops ought to have a Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the Presbyter, tho' <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> had by the Order that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them: some Body must take care of the rest, and that Jurisdiction was but to Excommunicate, and that was but to tell them they should come no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Company. Or grant they did make Canons one for another, before they came to be in the State, does it follow they must do so when the State has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them into it? What if <hi>Timothy</hi> had power in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet</hi> over the <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Does it follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishops must have the same in <hi>England?</hi> Must we be govern'd like <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creet?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55794:16"/>
4. However some of the Bishops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> yet the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Kingdom had ever been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, for whatever Bishops do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the Law permits, <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> can controul, or send them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He that goes about to prove Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> does as a Man that having a Sword, shall strike it against an Anvil, if he strikes it a while there, he may peradventure loosen it, tho' it be never so well riveted, 'twill serve to strike another Sword (or cut Flesh) but not against an Anvel.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If you should say you hold your Land by <hi>Moses</hi> or God's Law, and would try it by that, you may perhaps lose, but by the Law of the Kingdom you are sure of it; so may the Bishops by this Plea of <hi>Jure Divino</hi> lose all. The Pope had as good a Title by the Law of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> as could be had, had he not left that, and claim'd by Power from God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is no Government enjoyn'd by Example, but by Precept; it does not follow we must have Bishops still, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have had them so long. They are equally mad who say Bishops are so <hi>Jure Divino</hi> that they must be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55794:17"/>
and they who say they are so An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian, that they must be put away, all is as the State pleases.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To have no Ministers, but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 'tis as in the Temporal State they should have no Officers but Constables. Bishops do best stand with Monarchy, that as amongst the Laity, you have Dukes, Lords, Lieutenants, Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to send down the King's Pleasure to his Subjects; so you have Bishops to govern the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy: These upon occasion may address themselves to the King, otherwise every Person of the Parish must come, and run up to the Court.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Protestants have no Bishops in <hi>France,</hi> because they live in a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Country, and they will not have Catholick Bishops; therefore they must govern themselves as well as they may.</p>
            <p n="10">10. What is that to the purpose, to what End were Bishops Lands given to them at first? you must look to the Law and Custom of the Place. What is that to any Temporal Lord's Estate, how Lands were first divided, or how in <hi>William</hi> the Conquerours Days? And if Men at first were juggled out of their Estates, yet they are rightly their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. If my Father cheat a Man, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55794:17"/>
he consent to it, the Inheritance is rightly mine.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If there be no Bishops, there must be something else, which has the Power of Bishops, though it be in many, and then had you not as good keep them? If you will have no half Crowns, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly single Pence, yet Thirty single Pence are half a Crown; and then had you not as good keep both? But the Bishops have done ill, 'twas the Men, not the Function; As if you should say, you would have no more Half-Crowns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were stolen, when the Truth is they were not stolen because they were Half Crowns, but because they were Mony, and light in a Thieves hand.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They that would pull down the Bishops and erect a new way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do as he that pulls down an old House, and builds another in another Fashion; there's a great deal of Do, and a great deal of Trouble: the old Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish must be carried away, and new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials must be brought; Workmen must be provided, and perhaps the old one would have serv'd as well.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If the Parliament and <hi>Presbyterian Party</hi> should dispute, who should be Judge? Indeed in the beginning of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55794:18"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was such a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, between the <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, was appointed to be Judge, but the Conclusion was, the stronger <hi>Party</hi> carried it: For so Religion was brought into Kingdoms, so it has been continued, and so it may be cast out, when the State pleases.</p>
            <p n="14">14. 'Twill be great Discouragement to Scholars, that Bishops should be put down: For now the Father can say to his Son, and the Tutor to his Pupil, <hi>Study hard, and you shall have Vocem &amp; Sedem in Parliamento;</hi> then it must be, <hi>Study hard, and you shall have a Hundred a Tear, if you please your Parish. Object.</hi> But they that enter into the Ministry for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are like <hi>Judas</hi> that look'd after the <hi>Bag. Answ.</hi> It may be so, if they turn Scholars at <hi>Judas</hi>'s Age; but what Arguments will they use to persuade them to follow their <hi>Books</hi> while they are young.</p>

            <head>Books, Authors.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE giving a <hi>Bookseller</hi> his Price for his <hi>Books</hi> has this Advantage, he that will do so, shall have the Refusal of whatsoever comes to his Hand, and so by that means get many things, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he never should have seen. So 'tis in giving a <hi>Bawd</hi> her Price.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In buying Books or other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, 'tis not always the best way to bid half so much as the Seller asks: witness the Country Fellow that went to buy two groat Shillings, they ask'd him three Shillings, and he bad them eighteen Pence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They counted the Price of the Books <hi>(Acts</hi> 19. 19.) and found Fifty Thousand Pieces of Silver, that is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sextertii, or so many Three-half-pence of our Money, about Three Hundred Pound Sterling.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Popish Books teach and inform, what we know, we know much out of them. The Fathers, Church Story, School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, all may pass for Popish Books, and if you take away them, what Learning will you leave? Besides who must be Judge? The Customer or the Writer?
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55794:19"/>
If he disallows a Book, it must not be brought into the Kingdom, then Lord have Mercy upon all Scholars. These <hi>Puritan</hi> Preachers, if they have any things good, they have it out of Popish Books, tho' they will not acknowledge it, for fear of displeasing the People: he is a poor Divine that cannot severe the Good from the Bad.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis good to have Translations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they serve as a Comment, so far as the Judgment of the Man goes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In answering a Book, 'tis best to be short, otherwise he that I write against will suspect I intend to weary him, not to satisfie him. Besides in being long I shall give my Adversary a huge Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, somewhere or other he will pick a Hole.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In quoting of Books, quote such Authors as are usually read, others you may read for your own Satisfaction, but not name them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Quoting of Authors is most for matter of Fact, and then I write them as I would produce a Witness, sometimes for a free Expression, and then I give the Author his Due, and gain my self Praise by reading him.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55794:19"/>
9. To quote a Modern <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, where I may use a Clasic Author, is as if I were to justifie my Reputation, and I neglect all Persons of Note and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that know me, and bring the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial of the Scullion in the Kitchen.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Of all People Ladies have no reason to cry down Ceremonies; for they take themselves slighted without it. And were they not used with Ceremony, with Complements and Addresses, with Legs and Kissing of Hands, they were the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulest Creatures in the World; but yet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55794:20"/>
methinks to kiss their Hands after their Lips, as some do, is like little Boys, that after they eat the Apple, fall to the Paring, out of a Love they have to the Apple.</p>

            <head>Chancellour.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Bishop is not to sit with a Chancellor in his Court (as being a thing either beneath him or beside him) no more than the King is to sit in the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> when he has made a Lord-Chief-Justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Chancellour govern'd in the Church, who was a Lay-man: And therefore 'tis false which they charge the Bishops with, that they challenge sole Jurisdiction: For the Bishop can no more put out the Chancellor than the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor the Bishop. They were many of them made Chancellors for their Lives, and he is the fittest Man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, because Divinity so overwhelms the rest.</p>

            <p n="1">1. 'TIS the Tryal of a Man to see if he will change his side; and if he be so weak as to change once, he will change again. Your Country Fellows have a way to try if a Man be weak in the Hams, by coming behind him and giving him a Blow unawares, if he bend once, he will bend again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lords that fall from the King after they have got Estates, by base Flattery at Court, and now pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, do as a Vintner, that when he first sets up, you may bring your Wench to his House, and do your things there; But when he grows Rich, he turns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious, and will sell no Wine upon the Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Colonel <hi>Goring</hi> serving first the one side and then the other, did like a good Miller that knows how to grind which way soever the Wind sits.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After <hi>Luther</hi> had made a Combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Germany</hi> about Religion, he was sent to by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to be taken off, and offer'd any Preferment in the Church, that he would make choice of: <hi>Luther</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, if he had offer'd half as much

at first, he would have accepted it; but now he had gone so far, he could not come back: In Truth he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a greater thing than they could make him; the <hi>German</hi> Princes courted him, he was become the Author of a Sect ever after to be call'd <hi>Lutherans.</hi> So have our Preachers done that are against the Bishops; they have made themselves greater with the People than they can be made the other way; and therefore there is the less Charity probably in bringing them off. Charity to Strangers is enjoyn'd in the Text; by Strangers is there under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood those that are not of our own Kin, Strangers to your Blood; not those you cannot tell whence they come, that is, to be charitable to your Neighbours whom you know to be honest poor People.</p>

To be called, was nothing else, but to become a Christian, to have the Name of a Christian, it being their own Language: For among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they made a Doctor of Law, 'twas said he was called.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Turks</hi> tell their People of a Heaven where there is sensible Pleasure, but of a Hell where they shall suffer they don't know what. The Christians quite invert this Order, they tell us of a Hell where we shall feel sensible Pain, but of a

Now that of the Asses Head might proceed from such a Mistake as this; by the <hi>Jews</hi> Law, all the Firstlings of Cattle were to be offered to God, except a young Ass, which was to be redeemed, a Heathen being present, and seeing young Calves and young Lambs kill'd at their Sacrifices, only young Asses redeem'd, might very well think they had that silly Beast in some high Estimation, and thence might imagine they worshipped it as a God.</p>

he never considers how his Meal is drest, takes a bit, and away; but when he stays within, then he grows curious, he does not like this, nor he does not like that he will have his Meat drest his own way, or peradventure he will dress it himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It hath ever been the Gain of the Church when the King will let the Church have no Power to cry down the King and cry up the Church: But when the Church can make use of the King's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then to bring all under the King's Prerogative, the Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> go one way, and the Court-Clergy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

            <p n="5">5. All confess there never was a more learned Clergy, no Man taxes them with Ignorance. But to talk of that, is like the Fellow that was a great Wencher; he wish'd God would forgive him his Leachery, and lay Usury to his Charge. The Clergy have worse Faults.</p>

            <p n="3">3. All things are Gods already, we can give him no right by consecrating any, that he had not before, only we set it apart to his Service.

This will give you some Light to understand the Quarrel betwixt a Prince and his Subjects; tho' there be a vast Distance between him and them, and they are to obey him, according to their Contract, yet he hath no power to do them an Injury; then they think themselves as much bound to vindicate their Right, as they are to obey his Lawful Commands; nor is there any other Measure of Justice left upon Earth but Arms.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The other place <hi>[Dic Ecclesiae] tell the Church,</hi> is but a weak Ground to raise Excommunication upon, especially from the Sacrament, the lesser Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, since when that was spoken, the Sacrament was instituted. The <hi>Jews Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia</hi> was their <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> their Court: so that the meaning is, if after once or twice <hi>Admonition,</hi> this Brother will not be reclaim'd, bring him thither.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The first Excommunication was 180 Years after Christ, and that by Victor, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome:</hi> But that was no more than this, that they should Communicate and receive the Sacrament amongst themselves, not with those of the other Opinion: The Controversie (as I take it) being about the Feast of <hi>Easter.</hi> Men do not care for Excommunication, because they are shut out of the Church, or delivered up to <hi>Satan,</hi> but because the Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55794:35"/>
takes hold of them, after so many Days a Man cannot Sue, no not for his Wife, if you take her from him; and there may be as much reason, to grant it for a small Fault, if there be contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as for a great one. In <hi>Wectminster-Hall</hi> you may Out-law a Man for forty Shillings, which is their Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you can do no more for Forty Thousand Pound.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When <hi>Constantine</hi> became Christian, he so fell in love with the Clergy, that he let them be Judges of all things; but that continued not above three or four Years, by reason they were to be Judges of Matters they understood not, and then they were allowed to meddle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Religion; all Jurisdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him, and he scanted them out as much as he pleas'd, and so things have since continued. They Excommunicate for three or four Things, Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Adultery, Tythes, Wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the civil Punishment the State allows for such Faults. If a Bishop Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a Man for what he ought not, the Judge has Power to absolve and punish the Bishop: if they had that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from God, why does not the Church Excommunicate for Murder, for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55794:35"/>
Theft? If the Civil Power might take away all but three Things, why may they not take them away too? If this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication were taken away, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would be quiet; 'tis that they have a mind to, 'tis that they would fain be at. Like the Wench that was to be Married; she ask'd her Mother when 'twas done, if she should go to Bed presently: no, says her Mother, you must dine first, and then to Bed Mother? no you must dance after Dinner, and then to Bed Mother? no, you must go to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and then to Bed Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Rock, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Successours govern'd all; but when the Civil State became Christian, they appointed who should govern them, before they govern'd by agreement and consent: if you will not do this, you shall come no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, but both the Independant Man, and the Presbyterian Man, do equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Civil Power, tho' after a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner.</p>

The Independant may as well plead, they should not be subject to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Things, not come before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, or a Justice of Peace, as they plead they should not be subject in spiritual things, because St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>It is so, that there is not a wise Man amongst you?</hi>

            <p n="3">3. The Pope challenges all Churches to be under him, the King and the two Arch-Bishops challenge all the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be under them.

ALL might go well in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, if every one in the Parliament would lay down his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and aim at the general good. If a man were sick, and the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Physicians should come to him, and administer severally, haply so long as they observ'd the Rules of Art he might recover, but if one of them had a great deal of Scamony by him, he must put off that, therefore he prescribes Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

God to give us Peace. Commonly we say a Judgment falls upon a Man for something in him we cannot abide.

            <p n="2">2. Little things do great works, when the great things will not. If I should take a Pin from the Ground, a little pair of Tongues will do it, when a great Pair will not.

            <p n="1">1. THere's no such Thing as Spiritual Jurisdiction, all is Civil, the Churche's is the same with the Lord Mayors. Suppose a Christian came into a Pagan Country, how can you fancy he shall have any Power there? he finds faults with the Gods of the Country; well, they will put him to Death for it: when he is a Martyr, what follows? Does that argue he has any spiritual Jurisdiction? If the Clergy say the Church ought to be

            <p n="2">2. Nothing has lost the Pope so much in his Supremacy, as not acknowledging what Princes gave him. 'Tis a scorn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Civil Power, and an unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Priest. But the Church runs to <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> lest if they should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what they have by positive Law, it might be as well taken from them as given to them.</p>

            <head>King.</head>
            <p n="1">1. A King is a thing Men have made for their own Sakes, for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness-sake. Just as in a Family one Man is appointed to buy the Meat; if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Man should buy what the other lik'd not, or what the other had bought before, so there would be a confusion. But that Charge being committed to one, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Discretion pleases all; if they have not what they would have one day, they shall have it the next, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The word King directs our Eyes; suppose it had been Consul, or Dictator: to think all Kings alike is the same folly; as if a Consul of <hi>Aleppo</hi> or <hi>Smyrna</hi> should claim to himself the same Power that a Consul at <hi>Rome,</hi> What, am not I a Consul? or a Duke of <hi>England</hi> should think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self like the Duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> nor can it be imagin'd, that the word <gap reason="foreign">

What matter is it then what they Preach or Teach in the Schools?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Kings are all individual, this or that King, there is no Species of Kings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A King that claims Priviledges in his own Country, because they have them in another, is just as a Cook, that claims Fees

in one Lord's House, because they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in another. If the Master of the House will yield them, well and good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Text <hi>[Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar</hi>'s] makes as much against Kings, as for them, for it says plainly that some things are not <hi>Caesars.</hi> But Divines make choice of it, first in Flattery, and then because of the other part adjoyn'd to it <hi>[Render unto God the things that are Gods]</hi> where they bring in the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A King outed of his Country, that takes as much upon him as he did at home, in his own Court, is as if a Man on high, and I being upon the Ground, us'd to lift up my voice to him, that he might hear me, at length should come down, and then expects I should speak as loud to him as I did before.</p>

            <head>King of England.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE King can do no wrong, that is, no Process can be granted against him. What must be done then? Petition him, and the King writes upon the Petition <hi>soit droit fait,</hi> and sends it to the Chancery, and then the business is heard. His Confessor will not tell him, he can do no wrong.</p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55794:47"/>
2. There's a great deal of difference between Head of the Church, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governour, as our Canons call the King. Conceive it thus, there is in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> a Colledge of Physicians, the King is Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of those, but not Head of them, nor President of the Colledge, nor the best Physician.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After the Dissolution of Abbies, they did not much advance the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, for they only car'd to exclude the Pope: hence have we had several Translations of the Bible upon us. But now we must look to it, otherwise the King may put upon us what Religion he pleases.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Twas the old way when the King of <hi>England</hi> had his House, there were Canons to sing Service in his Chappel; so at <hi>Westminster</hi> in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Chappel (where the House of Commons sits) from which Canons the Street call'd <hi>Canon-row</hi> has its Name, because they liv'd there, and he had also the Abbot and his Monks, and all these the King's House.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The three Estates are the Lord's Temporal, the Bishops are the Clergy, and the Commons as some would have it [take heed of that] for then if two agree the third
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55794:47"/>
is involv'd, but he is King of the Three Estates.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The King hath a Seal in every Court, and tho the Great Seal be called <hi>Sigillum Angliae,</hi> the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet 'tis not because 'tis the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Seal, and not the Kings, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from <hi>Sigillum Hiberniae, Sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Scotiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The Court of <hi>England</hi> is much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. At a solemn Dancing, first you had the grave Measures, then the Corran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes and the Galliards, and this is kept up with Ceremony; at length to <hi>French</hi>-more, and the Cushion-Dance, and then all the Company dances Lord and Groom, Lady and Kitchen-Maid, no Distinction.

But in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time, there has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>French</hi>-more, and the Cushion-Dance, <hi>omnium gatherum,</hi> tolly, polly, hoite come toite.</p>

            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55794:48"/>
            <head>The King.</head>
            <p n="1">1. 'TIS hard to make an Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the King and the Parliament. If you and I fell out about Money, you said I ow'd you Twenty Pounds, I said I ow'd you but Ten Pounds, it may be a third Party allowing me twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Marks, might make us Friends. But if I said I ow'd you twenty Pounds in Silver, and you said I ow'd you twenty Pounds in Diamonds, which is a Summ innumerable, 'tis impossible we should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree. This is the Case.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The King using the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, as he did in Mr. <hi>Pymm</hi> and his Company, that is, charging them with Treason, because they charg'd my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and Sir <hi>George Ratcliff;</hi> it was just with as much Logick as the Boy, that would have lain with his Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, us'd to his Father, you lay with my Mother, why should not I lie with yours?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is not the same Reason for the King's accusing Men of Treason, and carrying them away, as there is for the Houses themselves, because they accuse one of themselves. For every one that is accused, is either a Peer, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55794:48"/>
and he that is accused hath his Consent going along with him; but if the King accuses, there is nothing of this in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The King is equally abus'd now as before; then they flatter'd him and made him do ill Things, now they would force him against his Conscience. If a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian should tell me, every thing I had a mind to was good for me, tho' in truth 'twas Poison, he abus'd me; and he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses me as much, that would force me to take something whether I will or no.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The King so long as he is our King, may do with his Officers what he pleases; as the Master of the House may turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all his Servants, and take whom he please.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The King's Oath is not security e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our Property, for he swears to Govern according to Law; now the Judges they interpret the Law, and what Judges can be made to do we know.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The King and the Parliament now falling out, are just as when there is foul Play offer'd amongst Gamesters, one snatches the others stake, they seize what they can of one anothers. 'Tis not to be ask'd whether it belongs not to the King to do this or that: before when there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55794:49"/>
was fair Play, it did. But now they will do what is most convenient for their own safety. If two fall to scuffling, one tears the others Band, the other tears his; when they were Friends they were quiet, and did no such thing, they let one anothers Bands alone.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The King calling his Friends from the Parliament, because he had use of them at <hi>Oxford,</hi> is as if a Man should have use of a little piece of Wood, and he runs down into the Cellar, and takes the Spiggot, in the mean time all the Beer runs about the House; when his Friends are absent, the King will be lost.</p>

            <p n="1">1. KNights Service in earnest means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the Lords are bound to wait upon the King when he goes to War with a Foreign Enemy, with it may be one Man and one Horse, and he that doth not, is to be rated so much as shall seem good to the next Parliament.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Allodium</hi> is a Law Word, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Feudum,</hi> and it signifies Land that holds of no body.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Latimer</hi> is the Corruption of <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> it signifies he that interprets <hi>Latin,</hi> and though he interpreted <hi>French, Spanish,</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> he was call'd the King's <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> that is, the King's Interpreter.</p>

3. If you look upon the Language spoken in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Time, and the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage spoken now, you will find the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be just, as if a Man had a Cloak that he wore plain in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, and since, here has put in a piece of Red, and there a piece of Blue, and here a piece of Green, and there a piece of Orange-tawny. We borrow Words from the <hi>French, Italian, Latin,</hi> as every Pedantick Man pleases.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have more Words than Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, half a Dozen Words for the same thing. Sometimes we put a new signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to an old Word, as when we call a Piece a Gun. The Word Gun was in use in <hi>England</hi> for an Engine, to cast a thing from a Man, long before there was any Gun-powder found out.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Words must be fitted to a Man's Mouth; 'twas well said of the Fellow that was to make a Speech for my Lord Mayor, he desir'd to take measure of his Lordship's Mouth.</p>

            <head>Law.</head>
            <p n="1">1. A Man may plead not guilty, and yet tell no Lye; for by the Law, no Man is bound to accuse himself; so that when I say Not Guilty, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55794:50"/>
is, as if I should say by way of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase, I am not so Guilty as to tell you; if you will bring me to a Tryal, and have me punish'd for this you lay to my Charge, prove it against me.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ignorance of the Law excuses no man; not that all Men know the Law, but because 'tis an excuse every Man will plead, and no Man can tell how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was outlaw'd in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> I being of Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. A Merchant had recover'd Costs against him in a Suit, which because he could not get, we advis'd to have him Out-law'd for not appearing, and so he was. As soon as <hi>Gondimer</hi> heard that, he presently sent the Money, by reason, if his Master had been Out-law'd, he could not have the Benefit of the Law, which would have been very prejudicial, there being then many Suits depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and our <hi>English</hi> Merchants.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every Law is a Contract between the King and the People, and therefore to be kept. A hundred Men may owe me an Hundred Pounds, as well as any one Man, and shall they not pay me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are stronger than I? <hi>Object.</hi> Oh
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55794:51"/>
but they lose all if they keep that Law. <hi>Answ.</hi> Let them look to the making of their Bargain. If I sell my Lands, and when I have done, one comes and tells me I have nothing else to keep me. I and my Wife and Children must starve, If I part with my Land; must I not therefore let them have my Land, that have bought it and paid for it?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Parliament may declare Law, as well as any other inferiour Court may, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the King's Bench. In that or this particular Case, the King's Bench will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you what the Law is, but that binds no body whom the Case concerns: So the highest Court, the Parliament may doe, but not declare Law, that is, make Law that was never heard of before.</p>

How should I know I ought not to steal, I ought not to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, unless some body had told me so? Surely 'tis because I have been told so? 'Tis not because I think I ought not to do them, nor because you think I ought not; if so, our minds might change,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55794:51"/>

Because the most part of them followed their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and if some one Man had made himself wiser than the rest, he govern'd them, and they willingly submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to him. <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. And as in <hi>Athens</hi> the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers made the People knowing, and therefore they thought themselves wise enough to govern; so does preaching with us, and that makes us affect a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: For upon these two Grounds we all would be Governours, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we think our selves as wise as the best, or because we think our selves the Elect, and have the Spirit, and the rest a Company of Reprobates that belong to the Devil.</p>

            <head>Minister Divine.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE imposition of Hands upon the Minister when all is done, will be nothing but a designation of a Person to this or that Office or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55794:56"/>
in the Church. 'Tis a ridiculous Phrase that of the Canonists <hi>[Conferre Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines]</hi> 'Tis <hi>Coaptare aliquem in Ordinem,</hi> to make a Man one of us, one of our Number, one of our Order. So <hi>Cicero</hi> would understand what I said, it being a Phrase borrowed from the <hi>Latines,</hi> and to be understood proportionably to what was amongst them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those Words you now use in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Minister <hi>[receive the Holy Ghost]</hi> were us'd amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> in making of a Lawyer; from thence we have them, which is a villanous Key to something, as if you would have some other kind of Praefeture, than a Mayoralty, and yet keep the same Ceremony that was us'd in making the Mayor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Priest has no such thing as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indelible Character: what difference do you find betwixt him and another Man after Ordination? only he is made a Priest, (as I said) by Designation; as a Lawyer is call'd to the Bar, then made a Serjeant: all Men that would get Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over others, make themselves as unlike them as they can, upon the same Ground the Priests made themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Laity.</p>

4. A Minister when he is made, is <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria prima,</hi> apt for any form the State will put upon him, but of himself he can do nothing. Like a Doctor of Law in the University, he hath a great deal of Law in him, but cannot use it till he be made some bodie's Chancellour; or like a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, before he be receiv'd into a House, he can give no body Physick; indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Master of the House hath given him charge of his Servants, then he may. Or like a Suffragan, that could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but give Orders, and yet he was no Bishop.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Minister should preach according to the Articles of Religion established in the Church where he is. To be a Civil Lawyer let a Man read <hi>Justinian,</hi> and the Body of the Law, to confirm his Brain to that way, but when he comes to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, he must make use of it so far as it concerns the Law received in his own Country. To be a Physician let a Man read <hi>Gallen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates;</hi> but when he practises, he must apply his Medicines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Temper of those Men's Bodies with whom he lives, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Heat and Cold of Climes, otherwise that which in <hi>Pergamus</hi> (where <hi>Gallen</hi> liv'd) was Physick, in our cold
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55794:57"/>
Climate may be Poyson. So to be a Divine, let him read the whole Body of Divinity, the Fathers and the Schoolmen, but when he comes to practise, he must use it and apply it according to those Grounds and Articles of Religion that are established in the Church, and this with Sense.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There be four things a Minister should be at; the Conscionary Part, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siactical Story, School Divinity, and the Casuists.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Conscionary Part, he must read all the chief Fathers, both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> wholly. St. <hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> both the <hi>Gregories,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Clemens, Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi> which last have more Learning in them than all the rest, and writ freely.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For Ecclesiastical Story let him read <hi>Baronius,</hi> with the <hi>Magdeburgenses,</hi> and be his own Judge, the one being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Papists, the other extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For School Divinity let him get <hi>Javel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Edition of <hi>Scotus</hi> or <hi>Mayco,</hi> where there be Quotations that direct you to every Schoolman, where such and such Questions are handled. Without School Divinity a Divine knows nothing Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55794:58"/>
nor will be able to satisfie a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man out of the Pulpit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Study of the Casuists must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Study of the School-men, because the Division of their Cases, is according to their Divinity; otherwise he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with them will know little. As he that begins with the study of the Reports and Cases in the Common Law, will thereby know little of the Law. Casuists may be of admirable use, if discreetly dealt with, though among them you shall have many Leaves together very impertinent. A Case well decided would stick by a Man, they will remember it whether they will or no, whereas a quaint Position di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Birth. The main thing is to know where to search; for talk what they will of vast Memories, no Man will presume upon his own Memory for any thing he means to write or speak in publick.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>[Go and teach all Nations.]</hi> This was said to all Christians that then were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the distinction of Clergy and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; there have been since, Men design'd to preach only by the State, as some Men are design'd to studdy the Law, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to studdy Physick. When the Lord's Supper was instituted, there were none
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55794:58"/>
present but the Disciples, shall none then but Ministers receive?</p>
            <p n="8">8. There is all the reason you should believe your Minister, unless you have studied Divinity as well as he, or more than he.</p>
            <p n="9">9. 'Tis a foolish thing to say Ministers must not meddle with Secular Matters, because his own profession will take up the whole Man; may he not eat, or drink, or walk, or learn to sing? the meaning of that is, he must seriously attend his Calling.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Ministers with the Papists [that is their Priests] have much respect, with the Puritans they have much, and that upon the same ground, they pretend both of 'em to come immediately from Christ; but with the Protestants they have very little, the reason whereof is, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation they were glad to get such to take Livings as they could procure by any Invitations, things of pitiful Condition. The Nobility and Gentry, would not suffer their Sons or Kindred to meddle with the Church, and therefore at this day, when they see a Parson, they think him to be such a thing still, and there they will keep him, and use him accordingly; if he be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55794:59"/>
that is singled out, and he is us'd the more respectfully.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Protestant Minister is least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, appears by the old Story of the Keeper of the Clink. He had Priests of several sorts sent unto him; as they came in, he ask'd them who they were; who are you to the first? I am a Priest of the Church of Rome; you are welcome quoth the Keeper, there are those will take Care of you, and who are you? A si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd Minister. You are welcome too, I shall fare the better for you: And who are you? A Minister of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> O God help me (quoth the Keeper) I shall get nothing by you, I am sure you may lie and starve, and rot, before any body will look after you.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Methinks 'tis an ignorant thing for a Church-man, to call himself the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ, because St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Apostles call'd themselves so. If one of them had a Voice from Heaven, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> had, I will grant he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, I will call him so too. Must they take upon them as the Apostles did? Can they do as the Apostles could? The Apostles had a Mark to be known by, spake Tongues, cur'd Diseases, trod upon Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can they do this? If
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55794:59"/>
a Gentleman tells me, he will send his Man to me, and I did not know his Man, but he gave me this mark to know him by, he should bring in his Hand a rich Jewel; if a Fellow came to me with a Pebble-Stone, had I any reason to believe he was the Gentleman's Man?</p>

            <p n="1">1. ALL those mysterious things they observe in Numbers, come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon this very ground, because Number in it self is nothing, has not to do with Nature, but is meerly of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Imposition, a meer Sound. For
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55794:61"/>
Example, when I cry one a Clock, two a Clock, three a Clock, that is but Man's division of Time, the time it self goes on, and it had been all one in Nature, if those Hours had been call'd Nine, Ten, and Eleven. So when they say the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Son is Fortunate, it means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for if you count from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth backward, then the First is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, why is not he likewise Fortunate?</p>

            <head>Oaths.</head>
            <p n="1">1. SWearing was another thing with the <hi>Jews</hi> than with us, because they might not pronounce the Name of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no Oath scarcely, but we swear to things we are ignorant of: For Example, the Oath of Supremacy; how many know how the King is King? what are his Right and Prerogative? So how many know what are the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Parliament, and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject, when they take the protestation? But the meaning is, they will defend them when they know them. As if I should swear I would take part with all that wear red Ribbons in their Hats, it may be I do not know which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55794:61"/>
Colour is Red; but when I do know, and see a red Ribbon in a Man's Hat, then will I take his Part.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I cannot conceive how an Oath is imposed, where there is a Parity <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the House of Commons, they are all <hi>pares inter se,</hi> onely one brings Paper, and shews it the rest, they look upon it, and in their own Sense take it: Now they are but <hi>pares</hi> to me, who am none of the House, for I do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my self their Subject; if I did, then no question, I was bound by an Oath of their imposing. 'Tis to me but read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Paper in their own Sense.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a great difference between an Assertory Oath, and a Promissary Oath. An Assertory Oath is made to a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and I must swear so, as Man may know what I mean: But a Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Oath is made to God only, and I am sure he knows my meaning: so in the new Oath it runs [whereas I believe in my Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will assist thus and thus] that [whereas] gives me an Outloofe, for if I do not believe so, for ought I know, I swear not at all.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In a Promissary Oath, the mind I am in is a good Interpretation; for if there be enough happen'd to change my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55794:62"/>
mind, I do not know why I should not. If I promise to go to <hi>Oxford</hi> to Morrow, and mean it when I say it, and afterwards it appears to me, that 'twill be my undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; will you say I have broke my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise if I stay at Home? certainly I must not go.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Jews</hi> had this way with them, concerning a Promissary Oath or Vow, if one of them had vow'd a Vow, which afterwards appear'd to him to be very prejudicial by reason of something he either did not foresee, or did not think of, when he made his Vow; if he made it known to three of his Country-men, they had Power to absolve him, though he could not absolve himself, and that they pick'd out of some Words in the Text: Perjury hath only to do with an Assertory Oath, and no Man was punisht for Perjury by Man's Law till Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s time 'twas left to God, as a sin against him; the Reason was, because 'twas so hard a thing to prove a Man perjur'd: I might misunderstand him, and he swears as he thought.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When Men ask me whether they may take an Oath in their own Sense, 'tis
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55794:62"/>
to me, as if they should ask whether they may go to such a place upon their own Legs, I would fain know how they can go otherwise.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If the Ministers that are in seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred Livings will not take the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, threaten to turn them out and put in the old ones, and then I'll war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you they will quietly take it. A Gentleman having been rambling two or three Days, at length came home, and being in Bed with his Wife, would fain have been at some thing, that she was unwilling to, and instead of complying, fell to chiding him for his being abroad so long: Well says he, if you will not, call up <hi>Sue</hi> (his Wife's Chamber-maid) upon that she yielded presently.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Now Oaths are so frequent, they should be taken like Pills, swallowed whole; if you chew them you will find them bitter: if you think what you swear 'twill hardly go down.</p>

I love Apples best of any Fruit, but it does not follow, I must think Apples to be the best Fruit. Opinion is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein I go about to give reason why all the World should think as I think. Affection is a thing wherein I look after the pleasing of my self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Twas a good Fancy of an old Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick: The Gods which are above Men, had something whereof Man did partake, [an intellect Knowledge] and the Gods kept on their Course quietly. The Beasts, which are below Man, had something whereof Man did partake, [Sense and Growth] and the Beasts lived quietly in their way. But Man had something in him, whereof neither Gods nor Beasts did partake, which gave him all the Trouble, and made all the Confusion in the World; and that is Opinion.</p>

3. 'Tis a foolish thing for me to be brought off from an Opinion, in a thing neither of us know, but are led only by some Cobweb-stuff; as in such a Case as this, <hi>Utrum Angeli in vicem colloquantur?</hi> if I forsake my Side in such a Case, I shew my self wonderful light, or infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, or flattering the other Party: But if I be in a business of Nature, and hold an Opinion one way, and some Man's Experience has found out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I may with a safe Reputation give up my side.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis a vain thing to talk of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, for a Man for his heart can think no otherwise than he does think.

            <head>Parliament.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ALL are involv'd in a Parliament. There was a time when all Men had their Voice in choosing Knights. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's time they found the inconvenience, so one Parliament made a Law, that only he that had forty Shillings <hi>per annum</hi> should give his Voice, they under should be excluded. They made the Law who had the Voice of all, as well under forty Shillings; as above; and thus it continues at this Day. All consent civilly in a Parliament, Women are involv'd in the Men, Children in those of perfect Age; those that are under forty Shillings a Year, in those that have forty Shillings a year, those of forty Shillings in the Knights.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All things are brought to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, little to the Courts of Justice: just as in a Room where there is a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55794:64"/>
presented, if there be Persons of Quality there, the People must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and stay till the great ones have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Parliament flying upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men, and then letting them alone, does as a Hawk that flyes a Covey of Partridges, and when she has flown them a great way, grows weary, and takes a Tree; then the Faulconer lures her down, and takes her to his Fist: on they go again, <hi>heirett,</hi> upsprings another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, away goes the Hawk, and as she did before, takes another Tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Dissenters in Parliament may at length come to a good end, though first there be a great deal of do, and a great deal of Noise, which mad, wild Folks make: just as in brewing of Wrest-Beer, there's a great deal of Business in grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mault, and that spoils any Man's Cloaths that comes near it: then it must be mash'd, then comes a Fellow in and drinks of the Wort, and he's drunk; then they keep a huge quarter when they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it into the Cellar, and a twelve Month after 'tis delicate fine Beer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It must necessarily be that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers are worse than they were in the beginning of the Parliament. If a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55794:65"/>
comes to a sick Man, he lets him Blood, it may be scarifyes him, cups him, puts him into a great disorder, before he makes him well; and if he be sent for to cure an Ague, and he finds his Patient hath many Diseases, a Dropsie, and a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, he applies Remedies to 'em all, which makes the cure the longer and the dearer: this is the Case.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Parliament-men are as great Princes as any in the World, when what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they please is priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; no Man must know the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Priviledges, and whatsoever they dislike is breach of Priviledge. The Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is no more than Speaker of the House of Commons; but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at <hi>Venice,</hi> are not so much as our Parliament-men, nor have they that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the People, who yet exercise the greatest Tyranny that is any where. In plain truth, breach of Priviledge is only the actual taking away of a Member of the House, the rest are Offences against the House. For Example, to take our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess against a Parliament-man, or the like.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Parliament Party, if the Law be for them, they call for the Law; if it be against them, they will go to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55794:65"/>
Way; if no Law be for them, then for Law again: Like him that first call'd for Sack to heat him, then small Drink to cool his Sack, then Sack again to heat his small Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. The Parliament Party doe not play fair Play, in sitting up till two of the Clock in the Morning, to vote something they have a mind to. 'Tis like a craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gamester, that makes the Company drunk, then cheats them of their Money.</p>
            <p>Young Men, and infirm Men go away; besides, a Man is not there to persuade other Men to be of his mind, but to speak his own Heart, and if it be lik'd, so, if not, there's an end.</p>

            <p n="3">3. 'Tis most undoubtedly true, that all Men are equally given to their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, only thus, one Mans Pleasure lies one way, and anothers another: Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are all alike simply considered in themselves; he that hunts, or he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Common-Wealth, they both please themselves alike, only we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that, whereby we our selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some Benefit.

            <p n="2">2. There is no reason Plays should be in Verse, either in Blank or Rhime; only the Poet has to say for himself, that he makes something like that, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body made before him.

simply in it self is no more hurtful, than putting on my Cloaths, or doing any thing to make my self like other Folks, that I may not be odious nor offensive to the Company.

'Tis ridiculous to speak, or write, or preach in Verse. As 'tis good to learn to dance, a Man may learn his Leg, learn to go handsomely; but 'tis ridiculous for him to dance, when he should go.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis ridiculous for a Lord to print Verses: 'tis well enough to make them to please himself, but to make them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, is foolish.

He was a wise Pope, that when one that used to be merry with him, before he was advanc'd to the Popedom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain'd afterwards to come at him, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming he was busie in governing the Christian World) the Pope sends for him, bids him come again, and (says he) we will be merry as as we were before; for thou little thinkest what a little Foolery go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the whole World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Pope in sending Relicks to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, does as Wenches do by their <hi>Wassels</hi> at <hi>New-years-tide,</hi> they present you with a Cup, and you must drink of a slab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by stuff; but the meaning is, you must give them Moneys, ten times more than it is worth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. the Pope is Infallible, where he hath Power to command; that is, where he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55794:70"/>
must be obeyed, so is every Supream Power and Prince. They that stretch his Infallibility further, do they know not what.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When a Protestant and a Papish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, they talk like two Mad-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not agree upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; the one way is to destroy the Pope's Power, for if he hath Power to command me, 'tis not my alledging Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the contrary can keep me from obeying: For Example, if a Constable command me to wear a green Suit to Morrow, and has Power to make me; 'tis not my alledging a hundred Reasons of the Folly of it, can excuse me from doing it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There was a Time when the Pope had Power here in <hi>England,</hi> and there was excellent Use made of it, for 'twas only to serve Turns, (as might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested out of the Records of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which Divines know little of.) If the King did not like what the Pope would have, he would forbid the Pope's Legate to land upon his Ground. So that the Power was truly then in the King, though suffered in the Pope. But now the Temporal and the Spiritual Power (Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual so call'd, because ordain'd to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55794:70"/>
End) spring both from one Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are like to twist that.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Protestants in <hi>France</hi> bear Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the State, because though their Religion be different, yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other King but the King of <hi>France.</hi> The Papists in <hi>England</hi> they must have a King of their own, a Pope, that must do something in our Kingdom, therefore there is no reason they should enjoy the same Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Amsterdam</hi> admits of all Religions but Papists, and 'tis upon the same Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The Papists where e'er they live, have another King at <hi>Rome;</hi> all other Religions are subject to the present State, and have no Prince else-where.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Papists call our Religion a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Religion; but there was once, I am sure, a Parliamentary Pope; Pope <hi>Urban</hi> was made Pope in <hi>England</hi> by Act of Parliament, against Pope <hi>Clement:</hi> The Act is not in the Book of Statutes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because he that compiled the Book would not have the Name of the Pope there, or else he would not let it appear that they medled with any such thing, but 'tis upon the Rolls.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When our Clergy preach against the Pope, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55794:71"/>
preach against themselves, and crying down their Pride, their Power and their Riches, have made themselves Poor and Contemptible enough; they dedicate first to please their Prince, not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would follow. Just as if a Man were to go a Journey, and seeing at his first setting out the Way clean and fair, ventures forth in his Slippers, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Dirt and the Sloughs are a little further off, or how suddenly the Weather may change.</p>

requir'd it, which were things meerly Temporary for the time that State stood. But Divines make use of them to gain Power to themselves, (as for Example) that of <hi>Die Ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church; there was then a Sanhedrim, a Court to tell it to, and therefore they would have it so now.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Divines ought to do no more than what the State permits. Before the State became Christian, they made their own Laws, and those that did not observe them, they Excommunicated, <hi>[naughty men]</hi> they suffered them to come no more amongst them. But if they would come amongst them, how could they hinder them? By what Law? by what Power? they were still subject to the State, which was Heathen. Nothing better expresses the Condition of Christians in those times, than one of the meetings you have in <hi>London,</hi> of Men of the same Country, of <hi>Sussex</hi>-Men, or <hi>Bedfordshire</hi>-Men; they appoint their Meeting, and they agree, and make Laws amongst themselves <hi>[He that is not there shall pay double,</hi> &amp;c.] and if any one mis-behave himself, they shut him out of their Company: But can they recover a Forfeiture made concerning their Meeting by any Law? Have they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55794:72"/>
any power to compel one to pay? but afterwards, when the State became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, all the Power was in them, and they gave the Church as much, or as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as they pleas'd; and took away when they pleas'd, and added what they pleas'd.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Church is not only subject to the Civil Power with us that are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, but also in <hi>Spain:</hi> if the Church does Excommunicate a Man for what it should not, the Civil Power will take him out of their Hands. So in <hi>France,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Angiers</hi> alter'd something in the Breviary; they complain'd to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Paris,</hi> that made him alter it again, with a <hi>[comme abuse.]</hi>

            <head>Prayer.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IF I were a Minister, I should think my self most in my Office, reading of Prayers, and dispensing the Sacraments; and 'tis ill done to put one to officiate in the Church, whose Person is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible out of it. Should a great Lady, that was invited to be a Gossip, in her place send her Kitchen-Maid, 'twould be ill taken; yet she is a Woman as well as she; let her send her Woman at least.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>[You shall pray]</hi> is the right way, because according as the Church is set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, no Man may make a Prayer in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick of his own Head.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis not the Original Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-book; why: shew me an original Bible, or an original <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. Admit the Preacher prayes by the Spiris, yet that very Prayer is Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer to the People; they are ty'd as much to his Words, as in saying <hi>[Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p n="5">5. There were some Mathematicians, that could with one fetch of their Pen make an exact Circle, and with the next touch, point out the Centre; is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reasonable to banish all use of the Compasses? Set Forms are a pair of Compasses.</p>

If a Man hath a voluble Tongue, we say, he hath the gift of prayer. His gift is to pray long, that I see; but does he pray better?</p>
            <p n="7">7. We take care what we speak to Men, but to God we may say any thing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The people must not think a thought towards God, but as their Pastours will put it into their Mouths: they will make right Sheep of us.</p>

            <head>Preaching.</head>
            <p n="1">1. NOthing is more mistaken than that Speech <hi>[Preach the Gospel]</hi> for 'tis not to make long Harangues, as they do now a days, but to tell the News of Christ's coming into the World; and when that is done, or where 'tis known already, the Preacher's Work is done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Preaching in the first sense of the word ceas'd as soon as ever the Gospel was written.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Preacher says, this is the Meaning of the Holy Ghost in such a place, in sense he can mean no more than this; that is, I by studying of the place, by comparing one place with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; by weighing what goes before, and what comes after, think this is the Meaning of the Holy Ghost; and for shortness of Expression I say, the Holy Ghost says thus, or this is the Meaning of the Spirit of God. So the Judge speaks of the King's Proclamation, this is the Intention of the King; not that the King had declared his Intention any other way to the Judge, but the Judge examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Contents of the Proclamation, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the purport of the Words the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55794:75"/>
King's Intention; and then for shortness of expression says, this is the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nothing is Text but what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Bible, and meant there for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Place, the rest is Application, which a discreet Man may do well; but 'tis his Scripture, not the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Preaching by the Spirit (as they call it) is most esteemed by the Common-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because they cannot abide Art or Learning, which they have not been bred up in. Just as in the Business of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; if one Country Fellow amongst the rest, has been at the School, the rest will under-value his Skill, or tell him he wants Valour: <hi>You come with your School-Tricks: There's</hi> Dick Butcher <hi>has ten times more Mettle in him:</hi> So they say to the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>You come with your School-Learning: There's such a one has the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Tone in preaching does much in working upon the peoples Affections. If a Man should make Love in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tone, his Mistress would not regard him; and therefore he must whine. If a Man should cry Fire, or Murther in an ordinary Voice, no body would come out to help him.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:55794:75"/>
7. Preachers will bring any thing into the Text. The young Masters of Arts preached against <hi>Non-Residency</hi> in the University; whereupon the Heads made an Order, that no Man should med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing but what was in the Text. The next Day one preach'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Words, <hi>Abraham begot Isaac:</hi> when he had gone a good way, at last he observ'd, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Resident; for if he had been Non-Resident, he could never have begot <hi>Isaac;</hi> and so fell foul upon the Non-Residents.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I could never tell what often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meant after a Church is settled, and we know what is to be done; 'tis just as if a Husband-man should once tell his Servants what they are to do, when to sow, when to reap, and afterwards one should come and tell them twice or thrice a Day what they know already. You must sow your Wheat in <hi>October,</hi> you must reap your Wheat in <hi>August, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. The main Argument why they would have two Sermons a Day, is, because they have two Meals a Day; the Soul must be fed as well as the Body. But I may as well argue, I ought to have two No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, because I have two Eyes, or two Mouths because I have two Ears. What
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55794:76"/>
have Meals and Sermons to do one with another?</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Things between God and Man are but a few, and those, forsooth, we must be told often of; but things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man are many; those I hear of not above twice a Year, at the Assizes, or once a Quarter at the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones; but few come then: nor does the Minister exhort the People to go at these times to learn their Duty towards their Neighbours. Often preaching is sure to keep the Minister in Countenance, that he may have something to do.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In preaching they say more to raise Men to love Vertue than Men can possibly perform, to make them do their best; as if you would teach a Man to throw the Bar; to make him put out his Strength, you bid him throw further than it is possible for him, or any Man else: Throw over yonder House.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In preaching they do by Men as Writers of Romances do by their chief Knights, bring them into many Dangers, but still fetch them off: So they put Men in fear of Hell, but at last bring them to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Preachers say, do as I say, not as I do. But if a Physician had the same
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55794:76"/>
Disease upon him that I have, and he should bid me do one thing, and he do quite another, could I believe him?</p>
            <p n="14">14. Preaching the same Sermon to all sorts of People, is, as if a School-Master should read the same Lesson to his several Forms: If he reads <hi>Amo, amas, amavi,</hi> the highest Forms Laugh at him; the younger Boys admire him: So 'tis in preaching to a mix'd Auditory. <hi>Obj.</hi> But it cannot be otherwise; the Parish can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided into several Forms: What must the Preacher then do in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? <hi>Answ.</hi> Why then let him use some expressions by which this or that condition of people may know such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine does more especially concern them, it being so delivered that the wisest may be contented to hear. For if he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it altogether, and leaves it to them to single out what belongs to themselves (which is the usual way) 'tis as if a Man would bestow Gifts upon Children of several Ages: Two Years old, Four Years old, Ten Years old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there he brings <hi>Tops, Pins, Points, Ribbands,</hi> and casts them all in a Heap together upon a Table before them; though the Boy of Ten Years old knows how to chuse his <hi>Top,</hi> yet the Child of Two Years old,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55794:77"/>
that should have a <hi>Ribband,</hi> takes a <hi>Pin,</hi> and the <hi>Pin</hi> e'er he be aware pricks his Fingers, and then all's out of Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Preaching for the most part is the glory of the Preacher, to shew himself a fine Man. Catechising would do much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Use the best Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, though but few understand; for the Ignorant will sooner believe the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious of the Parish, than the Preacher himself; and they teach when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipate what he has said, and believe it the sooner confirm'd by Men of their own side. For betwixt the Laity and the Clergy there is, as it were, a continual driving of a bargain; something the Clergy would still have us be at, and therefore many things are heard from the Preacher with suspicion. They are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of some ends, which are easily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, when they have it from some of themselves. 'Tis with a Sermon as 'tis with a Play; many come to see it, which do not understand it; and yet hearing it cry'd up by one, whose judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they cast themselves upon, and of power with them, they swear and will die in it, that 'tis a very good Play, which they would not have done if the Priest
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55794:77"/>
himself had told them so. As in a great School, 'tis the Master that teaches all; the Monitor does a great deal of work, it may be the Boys are affraid to see the Master: so in a Parish 'tis not the Minister does all; the greater Neighbour teaches the lesser, the Master of the House teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. First in your Sermons use your Logick, and then your Rhetorick. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick without Logick is like a Tree with Leaves and Blosoms, but no Root; yet I confess more are taken with Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick than Logick, because they are catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a free Expression, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not Reason. Logick must be natural, or it is worth nothing at all: Your Rhetorick Figures may be learn'd: That Rhetorick is best which is most sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and most catching. An instance we have in that old blunt Commander at <hi>Cadis,</hi> who shew'd himself a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, being to say something to his Soldiers (which he was not us'd to do;) he made them a Speech to this purpose; <hi>What a shame will it be, you</hi> English-men, <hi>that feed upon good Beef and Brewess, to let those Rascally</hi> Spaniards <hi>beat you that eat nothing but Oranges and Limons.</hi> And so put more Courage into his Men than he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55794:78"/>
could have done with a more learned Oration. Rhetorick is very good, or stark naught: There's no <hi>Medium</hi> in Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. If I am not fully perswaded I laugh at the Oratour.</p>
            <p n="17">17. 'Tis good to preach the same thing again, for that's the way to have it learn'd. You see a Bird by often whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learn a Tune, and a Month af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter record it to her self.</p>
            <p n="18">18. 'Tis a hard Case a Minister should be turned out of his Living for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing they inform he should say in his Pulpit. We can no more know what a Minister said in his Sermon by two or three words pickt out of it, than we can tell what Tune a Musician play'd last upon the Lute, by two or three sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Notes.</p>

Doing herein just like School-Boys, when one of them has got an Apple, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the rest have a mind to, they use all the Arguments they can to get some of it from them: <hi>I gave you some t'other Day: You shall have some with me another time:</hi> When they cannot prevail, they tell him he's a Jackanapes, a Rogue and a Rascal,</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHen you would have a Child go to such a place, and you find him unwilling, you tell him he shall ride a Cock-horse, and then he will go presently: So do those that govern the State, deal by Men, to work them to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55794:79"/>
their Ends; they tell them they shall be advanc'd to such or such a place, and they will do any thing they would have them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A great Place strangely qualifies. <hi>John Read</hi> (was in the right) <hi>Groom of the Chamber to my Lord of</hi> Kent. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney <hi>Noy</hi> being dead, some were say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how would the King do for a fit Man? Why, any Man (says <hi>John Read)</hi> may execute the Place. I warrant (says my Lord) thou thinkst thou understand'st enough to perform it. Yes, quoth <hi>John,</hi> Let the King make me Attorney, and I would fain see that Man, that durst tell me, there's any thing I understand not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Pageants are a coming there's a great thrusting and a riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another's Backs, to look out at the Window; stay a little and they will come just to you, you may see them quietly. So 'tis when a new States-man or Officer is chosen; there's great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and listning who it should be; stay a while, and you may know qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Missing Preferment makes the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters fall foul upon the Bishops: Men that are in hopes and in the way of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55794:79"/>
rising, keep in the Channel, but they that have none, seek new ways: 'Tis so amongst the Lawyers; he that hath the Judges Ear, will be very observant of the way of the Court; but he that hath no regard will be flying out.</p>
            <p n="5">5. My Lord <hi>Digby</hi> having spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the House of Commons, for which they would have question'd him, was presently called to the upper House. He did by the Parliament as an Ape when he hath done some waggery; his Master spies him, and he looks for his Whip, but before he can come at him, whip says he to the top of the House.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some of the Parliament were discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that they wanted places at Court, which others had got; but when they had them once, then they were quiet. Just as at a Christning some, that get no Sugar Plums, when the rest have, mutter and grumble; presently the Wench comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with her Basket of Sugar-plums, and then they catch and scramble, and when they have got them, you hear no more of them.</p>

Just as you see the Archbishop has his Prerogative Court, but we know what is done in that Court. So the King's Prerogative is not his will, or what Divines make it a power, to do what he lists.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THey that would bring in a new Government, would very fain perswade us, they meet it in Antiquity. thus they interpret Presbyters, when they meet the word in the Fathers: Other professions likewise pretend to Antiquity. The Alchymist will find his Art in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s <hi>Aureus ramus,</hi> and he that delights in Opticks will find them in <hi>Tacitus.</hi> When <hi>Caesar</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us, they had Perspective-Glasses, by which he could discover what they were doing upon the Land, because it is said, <hi>Positis Speculis:</hi> the meaning is, His Watch or his Sentinel discover'd this, and this, unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Presbyters have the greatest power of any Clergy in the World, and gull the Laity most: For Example; admit there be twelve Laymen to six Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the six shall govern the rest as they please. First because they are constant, and the others come in like Church-War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in their turns, which is an huge
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55794:81"/>
Advantage, Men will give way to them who have been in place before them. Next the Laymen have other professions to follow: the Presbyters make it their sole Business; and besides too, they learn and study the Art of perswading; some of <hi>Geneva</hi> have confess'd as much.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Presbyter with his Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, is like a young Tree fenc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with two, or three, or four Stakes; the Stakes defend it, and hold it up; but the Tree only prospers and flourishes; it may be some Willow Stake may bear a Leaf or two, but it comes to nothing. Lay-Elders are Stakes, the Presbyter the Tree that flourshes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Queries were sent to the Assembly concerning the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Presbytery, their asking time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them, was a Satyr upon themselves: For if it were to be seen in the Text, they might quickly turn to the place, and shew us it. Their delaying to answer makes us think there's no such thing there. They do just as you have seen a fellow do at a Tavern Reckoning, when he should come to pay his Reckoning, he puts his Hands into his Pockets, and keeps a grabling and a fumbling, and shaking, at last tells you he has left his Money at

            <head>Priests of Rome.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Reason of the Statute against Priests, was this; In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> there was a Statute made, that he that drew Men from their civil Obedience was a Traitor. It happen'd this was done in privacies and confessions, when there could be no proof; therefore they made another Act, that for a Priest to be in <hi>England</hi> was Treason, because they presum'd that was his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to fetch Men off from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dy'd, and King <hi>James</hi> came in, an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest does thus express it: <hi>Elizabetha in orcum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusa, successit Jacobus alter Haereticus.</hi> You will ask why they did use such Language in their Church. <hi>Answ.</hi> Why does the Nurse tell the Child of raw Head and bloody Bones, to keep it in awe?</p>

               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55794:82"/>
4. The Priests of <hi>Rome</hi> aim but at two Things, to get Power from the King, and Money from the Subject.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the Priests come into a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, they do as a Man that would set fire on a House; he does not put fire to the Brick-Wall, but thrusts it into the Thatch. They work upon the Women, and let the Men alone.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For a Priest to turn a Man when he lies a dying, is just like one that hath a long time solicited a Woman, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain his end; at length makes her drunk, and so lies with her.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHen a doubt is propounded, you must learn to distinguish, and show wherein a thing holds, and wherein it doth not hold: Ay, or no, never answer'd any Question.

            <p n="1">1. IN giving Reasons, Men commonly do with us as the Woman does with her Child; when she goes to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket about her Business, she tells it she goes to buy it a fine Thing, to buy it a Cake or some Plums. They give us such Reasons as they think we will be catched withal, but never let us know the Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the School-Men talk of <hi>Recta Ratio</hi> in Morals, either they understand Reason as it is govern'd by a Command from above; or else they say no more than a Woman, when she says a thing is so, because it is so; that is, her Reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades her 'tis so. The other Acception has Sense in it. As take a Law of the Land, I must not depopulate, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son tells me so. Why? Because if I do, I incurr the detriment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reason of a Thing is not to be enquired after, till you are sure the Thing it self be so.

A great Lord and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man talking together, there came a Boy by, leading a Calf with both his Hands; says the Lord to the Gentleman, You shall see me make the Boy let go his Calf; with that he came towards him, thinking the Boy would have put off his Hat, but the Boy took no Notice of him.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55794:84"/>

            <p n="2">2. Religion amongst Men appears to me like the Learning they got at School. Some Men forget all they learned, others spend upon the Stock, and some improve it. So some Men forget all the Religion that was taught them when they were Young, others spend upon that Stock, and some improve it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Religion is like the Fashion, one Man wears his Doublet slash'd, another, lac'd, another plain; but every Man has a Doublet: So every Man has his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We differ about Trimming.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Men say they are of the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Quietness sake; but if the Matter were well examin'd you would scarce find Three any where of the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in all Points.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every Religion is a getting Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for though I my self get nothing, I am subordinate to those that do. So you
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55794:85"/>
may find a Lawyer in the <hi>Temple</hi> that gets little for the present, but he is fitting himself to be in time one of those great Ones that do get.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Alteration of Religion is dangerous, because we know not where it will stay; 'tis like a <hi>Milstone</hi> that lies upon the top of a pair of Stairs; 'tis hard to remove it, but if once it be thrust off the first Stair, it never stays till it comes to the bottom.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Question.</hi> Whether is the Church or the Scripture Judge of Religion? <hi>Answ.</hi> In truth neither, but the State. I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a Boil; I call a Company of Chirurgeons about me; one prescribes one thing, another another; I single out something I like, and ask you that stand by, and are no Chirurgeon, what you think of it. You like it too; you and I are Judges of the Plaster, and we bid them prepare it, and there's an end. Thus 'tis in Religion; the Protestants say they will be judged by the Scriptures; the Papists say so too; but that cannot speak. A Judge is no Judge, except he can both speak and command Execution; but the truth is they never intend to agree. No doubt the Pope where he is Supream, is to be Judg; if he say we in <hi>England</hi> ought to be subject to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55794:85"/>
him, then he must draw his Sword and make it good.</p>
            <p n="8">8. By the Law was the Manual received into the Church before the Reformation; not by the Civil Law, that had nothing to do in it; nor by the Canon Law, for that Manual that was here, was not in <hi>France,</hi> nor in <hi>Spain;</hi> but by Custom, which is the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> and Custom is but the Elder Brother to a Parliament: and so it will fall out to be nothing that the Papists say: Ours is a Parliamentary Religion, by reason the Service-Book was Established by Act of Parliament, and never any Service-Book was so before. That will be nothing that the Pope sent the Manual; 'twas ours, because the State received it. The State still makes the Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into it what will best agree with it. Why are the <hi>Venetians</hi> Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks? because the State likes the Religion: All the World knows they care not Three-pence for the Pope. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is not at this day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>France.</hi>

was where the rest of the Christian Church was <hi>Papist.</hi> Our Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever since the Apostles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis better. <hi>Protestant.</hi> So did ours. That there was an Interruption of it, will fall out to be nothing, no more than if another Earl should tell me of the Earl of <hi>Kent;</hi> saying, He is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Earl than he, because there was one or two of the Family of <hi>Kent</hi> did not take the Title upon them; yet all that while they were really Earls; and afterwards a great Prince declar'd them to be Earls of <hi>Kent,</hi> as he that made the other Family an Earl.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Disputes in Religion will never be ended, because there wants a Measure by which the Business would be decided: The <hi>Puretan</hi> would be judged by the Word of God: If he would speak clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he means himself, but he is asham'd to say so; and he would have me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him before a whole Church, that has read the Word of God as well as he. One says one thing, and another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and there is, I say, no Measure to end the Controversie. 'Tis just as if Two Men were at Bowls, and both judg'd by the Eye; One says 'tis his Cast, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther says 'tis my Cast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and having no Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55794:86"/>
the Difference is Eternal. <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> Satyrically express'd the vain Disputes of Divines, by <hi>Inigo Lanthorne,</hi> disputing with his Puppet in a <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Fair.

            <p n="11">11. In Matters of Religion to be rul'd by one that writes against his Adversary, and throws all the Dirt he can in his Face, is, as if in point of good Manners a Man should be govern'd by one whom he sees at Cuffs with another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thinks himself bound to give the next Man he meets a Box on the Ear.</p>
            <p n="12">12. 'Tis to no purpose to labour to reconcile Religions, when the Interest of Princes will not suffer it. 'Tis well if they could be reconciled so far, that they should not cut one anothers Throats.</p>
            <p n="13">13. There's all the Reason in the World, <hi>Divines</hi> should not be suffer'd to go a Hair beyond their Bounds, for fear of breeding Confusion, since there now be so many Religions on Foot. The Matter was not so narrowly to be look'd after when there was but one Religion in Christendom; the rest would cry him down for an Heretick, and there was no Body to side with him.</p>

14. We look after Religion as the Butcher did after his Knife, when he had it in his Mouth.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Religion is made a Juggler's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; now 'tis a Horse, now 'tis a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, now 'tis a Boar, now 'tis a Man. To serve Ends Religion is turn'd into all Shapes.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Pretending Religion and the Law of God, is to set all things loose. When a Man has no mind to do something he ought to do by his Contract with Man, then he gets a Text and interprets it as he pleases, and so thinks to get loose.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Some Mens pretending Religion, is like the roaring Boys way of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, <hi>[Their Reputation is dear, it does not stand with the Honour of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,]</hi> when, God knows, they have neither Honour nor Reputation about them.</p>
            <p n="18">18. They talk much of settling Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Religion is well enough settled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, if we would let it alone: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we might look after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. If Men would say they took Arms for any thing but Religion, they might be beaten out of it by Reason; out of that they never can, for they will not believe you what ever you say.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55794:87"/>
20. The very <hi>Arcanum</hi> of pretending Religion in all Wars, is, That something may be found out in which all Men may have Interest. In this the Groom has as much Interest as the Lord. Were it for Land, one has One Thousand Acres, and the other but one; he would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so far, as he that has a Thousand. But Religion is equal to both. Had all Men Land alike, by a <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> then all Men would say they fought for Land.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WE have had no national Synod since the Kingdom hath been settled, as now it is, only Provincial; and there will be this inconveniency, to call so many Divines together; 'twill be to put Power in their Hands, who are too apt to usurp it, as if the Laity were bound by their Determination. No, let the Laity consult with Divines on all sides, hear what they say, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of their Reasons; as they do by any other profession, when they have a Difference before them. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Gold-smiths, they enquire of them, if such a Jewel be of such a Value, and such a Stone of such a Value, hear them, and then being rational Men judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:55794:90"/>
2. Why should you have a Synod, when you have a Convocation already, which is a Synod? Would you have a superfetation of another Synod? The Clergy of <hi>England</hi> when they cast off the Pope, submitted themselves to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power, and so have continued; but these challenge to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and so to be above the Civil Power; these chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Power to call before their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries all Persons for all Sins directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God, as proved to be Sins by necessary Consequence. If you would buy Gloves, send for a Glover or two, not Glovers-Hall; consult with some Divines, not send for a Body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There must be some Laymen in the Synod, to over-look the Clergy, lest they spoil the civil Work: Just as when the good Woman puts a Cat into the Milk-House to kill a Mouse, she sends her Maid to look after the Cat, lest the Cat should eat up the Cream.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Ordinance for the Assembly, the Lords and Commons go under the Names of learned, godly, and judicious Divines; there is no Difference put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and the Ministers in the Context.</p>

5. 'Tis not unusual in the Assembly to revoke their Votes, by reason they make so much haste, but 'tis that will make them scorn'd. You never heard of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil revok'd an Act of its own making; they have been wary in that, to keep up their Infallibility; if they did any thing, they took away the whole Council, and yet we would be thought Infallible as any Body. 'Tis not enough to say, the House of Commons revoke their Votes, for theirs are but Civil Truths, which they by agreement create, and uncreate, as they please: But the Truths the Synod deals in are Divine; and when they have voted a thing, if it be then true, 'twas true before; not true because they voted it, nor does it cease to be true, because they voted otherwise.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Subscribing in a Synod, or to the Articles of a Synod, is no such terrible thing as they make it; because, If I am of a Synod, 'tis agreed, either tacitely or expresly.

2. To make an Impropriation, there was to be the Consent of the Incumbent, the Patron, and the King; then 'twas confirm'd by the Pope: Without all this the Pope could make no Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or what if the Pope gave the <hi>Tythes</hi> to any Man, must they therefore be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away? If the Pope gives me a Jewel, will you therefore take it away from me?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> what then? 'Twas very well done of him: It does not follow therefore that I must pay Tythes, no more than I am bound to imitate any other Action of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis ridiculous to say the Tythes are God's Part, and therefore the Clergy must have them: Why, so they are if the Laymen has them. 'Tis as if one of my Lady <hi>Kent</hi>'s Maids should be sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Room, and another of them should come and take away the Broom, and tell for a Reason, why she should part with it; 'Tis my Lady's Broom: As if it were not my Lady's Broom, which of them soever had it.</p>

by <hi>John O Powls</hi> in the Play, who acted the Priest; one that was to be hang'd, being brought to the Ladder, would fain have given something to the Poor; he feels for his Purse, (which <hi>John O Powls</hi> had pickt out of his Pocket before) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it, crys out, He had lost his Purse; now he intended to have given some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Poor; <hi>John O Powls</hi> bid him be pacified, for the Poor had it already.</p>

            <p n="1">1. DO not under-value an Enemy by whom you have been worsted. When our Country-men came home from fighting with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and were beaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible Faces (as you still see the Sign of the <hi>Saracen</hi>'s Head is) when in truth they were like other Men. But this they did to save their own Credits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Martial-Law in general, means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Martial-Law of this, or that Place; with us to be us'd in <hi>Fervore Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> in the Face of the Enemy, not in time of Peace; there they can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way neither Limb nor Life. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders need not complain for want of it, because our Ancestors have done gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant things without it.</p>

3. <hi>Question.</hi> Whether may Subjects take up Arms against their Prince? <hi>Answer.</hi> Conceive it thus; Here lies a Shilling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and me; Ten Pence of the Shilling is yours, Two Pence is mine: By agreement, I am as much King of my Two Pence, as you of your Ten Pence: If you therefore go about to take away my Two Pence, I will defend it; for there you and I are equal, both Princes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Or thus, two supream Powers meet; one says to the other, give me your Land; if you will not, I will take it from you: The other, because he thinks himself too weak to resist him, tells him, of nine Parts I will give you three, so I may quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy the rest, and I will become your Tributary. Afterwards the Prince comes to exact six Parts, and leaves but three; the Contract then is broken, and they are in Parity again.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To know what Obedience is due to the Prince, you must look into the Contract betwixt him and his People; as if you wou'd know what Rent is due from the Tenant to the Landlord, you must look into the Lease. When the Contract is broken, and there is no third Person to judge, then the Decision is by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55794:98"/>
Arms. And this is the Case between the Prince and the Subject.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Question.</hi> What Law is there to take up Arms against the Prince, in Case he break his Covenant? <hi>Answer.</hi> Though there be no written Law for it, yet there is Custom, which is the best Law of the Kingdom; for in <hi>England</hi> they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done it. There is nothing exprest between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the King of <hi>France;</hi> that if either Invades the other's Territory, the other shall take up Arms against him, and yet they do it upon such an Occasion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis all one to be plunder'd by a Troop of Horse, or to have a Man's Goods taken from him by an Order from the Council Table. To him that dies, 'tis all one whether it be by a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Halter, or a Silk Garter; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the silk Garter pleases more; and like <hi>Trouts,</hi> we love to be tickled to Death.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Soldiers say they fight for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; when the Truth is they have their Honour in their Pocket. And they mean the same thing that pretend to fight for Religion. Just as a Parson goes to Law with his Parishioners; he says, For the good of his Successors, that the Church
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55794:98"/>
may not loose its Right; when the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to get the Tythes into his own Pocket.</p>
            <p n="9">9. We govern this War as an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man does a Casting-Net; if he has not the right trick to cast the Net off his Shoulder, the Leads will pull him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River. I am afraid we shall pull our selves into Destruction.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We look after the particulars of a Battle, because we live in the very time of War. Whereas of Battles past we hear nothing but the Number slain. Just as for the the Death of a Man; when he is sick, we talk how he slept this Night, and that Night; what he eat, and what he drunk: But when he is dead, we only say, he died of a Fever, or name his Disease; and there's an end.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Boccaline</hi> has this passage of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, They came to <hi>Apollo</hi> to have their Profession made the Eighth Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which he granted. As soon as it was nois'd up and down, it came to the Butchers, and they desired their Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be made the Ninth: For say they, the Soldiers have this Honour for the killing of Men; now we kill as well as they; but we kill Beasts for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of Men, and why should not we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55794:99"/>
have Honour likewise done to us? <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> could not Answer their Reasons, so he revers'd his Sentence, and made the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Trade a Mystery, as the Butchers is.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Law against Witches does not prove there be any; but it punishes the Malice of those People, that use such means, to take away Mens Lives. If one should profess that by turning his Hat thrice, and crying Buz, he could take away a Man's Life (though in truth he could do no such thing) yet this were a just Law made by the State, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should turn his Hat thrice, and cry Buz, with an intention to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Man's Life, shall be put to death.</p>

            <p n="1">1. HE that hath a handsome Wife, by other Men is thought happy; 'tis a Pleasure to look upon her, and be in her Company; but the Husband is cloy'd with her. We are never content with what we have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You shall see a Monkey sometime, that has been playing up and down the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55794:99"/>
Garden, at length leap up to the top of the Wall, but his Clog hangs a great way below on this side; the Bishop's Wife is like that Monkey's Clog, himself is got up very high, takes place of the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Barons, but his Wife comes a great way behind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis reason a Man that will have a Wife should be at the Charge of her Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and pay all the Scores she sets on him. He that will keep a Monkey, 'tis fit he should pay for the Glasses he breaks.</p>

            <head>Wisdom.</head>
            <p n="1">1. A Wise Man should never resolve upon any thing, at least never let the World know his Resolution, for if he cannot arrive at that, he is asham'd. How many things did the King resolve in his Declaration concerning <hi>Scotland,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to do, and yet did them all? A Man must do according to Accidents and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Never tell your Resolution before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; but when the Cast is thrown, play it as well as you can to win the Game you are at. 'Tis but folly to study how to play Size-ace, when you know not whether you shall throw it or no.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:55794:100"/>
3. Wise Men say nothing in dangerous times. The Lion you know call'd the Sheep, to ask her if his Breath smelt: she said, Ay; he bit off her Head for a Fool: He call'd the Woolf and ask'd him; he said no; he tore him in pieces for a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer. At last he call'd the Fox and ask'd him; truly he had got a Cold and could not smell. King <hi>James</hi> was pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <head>Wit.</head>
            <p n="1">1. WIT and Wisdom differ; Wit is upon the sudden turn, Wisdom is in bringing about ends.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nature must be the ground-work of Wit and Art; otherwise whatever is done will prove but Jack-puddings work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wit must grow like Fingers; if it be taken from others, 'tis like Plums stuck upon black Thorns; there they are for a while, but they come to nothing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that will give himself to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways to get Money may be rich; so he that lets fly all he knows or thinks, may by chance be Satyrically Witty. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty sometimes keeps a Man from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rich; and Civility from being Witty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Women ought not to know their own Wit, because they will still be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55794:100"/>
it, and so spoil it; like a Child that will continually be shewing its fine new Coat, till at length it all bedawbs it with its pah Hands.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Fine Wits destroy themselves with their own Plots, in medling with great Affairs of State. They commonly do as the Ape that saw the Gunner put Bullets in the Cannon, and was pleas'd with it, and he would be doing so too: at last he puts himself into the Piece, and so both Ape, and Bullet were shot away together.</p>

            <head>Women.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>LET the Women have power of their heads, because of the Angels.</hi> The reason of the words <hi>because of the Angels,</hi> is this; The <hi>Greek</hi> Church held an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Angels fell in Love with Women. This Fancy St. <hi>Paul</hi> discreetly catches, and uses it as an Argument to perswade them to modesty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Grant of a Place is not good by the Canon-Law, before a Man be dead; upon this ground some Mischief might be plotted against him in present possession, by poisoning or some other way. Upon the same reason a Contract made with a Woman, during her Husband's Life, was not valid.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:55794:101"/>
3. Men are not troubled to hear a Man dispraised, because they know, tho' he be naught, there's worth in others. But Women are mightily troubled to hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them spoken against, as if the Sex it self were guilty of some Unworthiness.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Women and Princes must both trust some body; and they are Happy, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy according to the desert of those under whose Hands they fall. If a Man knows how to manage the Favour of a Lady, her Honour is safe, and so is a Princes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An Opinion grounded upon that, <hi>Genesis 6. The Sons of God saw the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men that they were fair.</hi>

            <head>Year.</head>
            <p n="1">1. 'TWas the Manner of the Jews (if the Year did not fall out right, but that it was dirty for the People to come up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the Feast of the Passover; or that their Corn was not ripe for their first Fruits) to intercalate a Month, and so to have, as it were, two <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruaries,</hi> thrusting up the Year still high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>March</hi> into <hi>April's</hi> Place, <hi>April</hi> into <hi>May</hi>'s Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereupon it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us to know when our Saviour was born, or when he dy'd.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:55794:101"/>
2. The Year is either the Year of the Moon, or the Year of the Sun; there's not above eleven Days difference. Our moveable Feasts are according to the Year of the Moon; else they should be fixt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho' they reckon ten Days sooner beyond Sea, yet it does not follow their Spring is sooner than ours; we keep the same time in natural things, and their ten Days sooner, and our ten Days later in those things mean the self same time: just as twelve <hi>Sous</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> are ten Pence in <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The lengthening of Days is not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly perceiv'd till they are grown a pretty deal longer, because the Sun, though it be in a Circle, yet it seems for a while to go in a right Line. For take a Segment of a great Circle especially, and you shall doubt whether it be straight or no. But when that Sun is got past that Line, then you presently perceive the Days are lengthened. Thus it is in the Winter and Summer Solstice; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true Reason of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Eclipse of the Sun is, when it is new Moon; the Eclipse of the Moon when 'tis full. They say <hi>Dionysius</hi> was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Eclipse that happened at our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Death, because it was neither of these, and so could not be natural.</p>

            <head>Zelots.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ONE would wonder Christ should whip the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and no body offer to resist him (considering what Opinion they had of him.) But the reason was, they had a Law, that whosoever did profane <hi>Sanctitatem Dei, aut Templi;</hi> the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, or the Temple, before ten Persons, 'twas lawful for any of them to kill him, or to do any thing this side kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him; as whipping him, or the like. And hence it was, that when one struck our Saviour before the Judge, where it was not lawful to strike (as it is not with us at this Day) he only replies; If I have spoken Evil, bear Witness of the Evil; but if Well, why smitest thou me? He says nothing against their smiting him, in case he had been guilty of speaking Evil, that is Blasphemy; and they could have prov'd it against him. They that put this Law in execution were called Zelots; but afterwards they committed many Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
