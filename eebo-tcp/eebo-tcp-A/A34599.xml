            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe, to
have alwaies a Conſcience void of

But yet this I confeſſe unto you, that I am
leſſe then the leaſt of all the Meſſengers
of Chriſt; for I am not worthy to bee
called a Meſſenger, or Miniſter; for I
perſecuted the Church of God, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
the Faith of Jeſus the Chriſt;
that held foorth all his Royall Offices,
<hi>King, Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> according to
his outward adminiſtration, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Members into his Spiritual
Kingdome: And ſided with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian

denyed, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, whom

and the Sonne,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22.
For though I, with the Antichriſtian
Biſhops, and Prieſts, did acknowledge
Jeſus the Chriſt, our high Prieſt that
ever liveth to reconcile us unto God;
yet wee have perſecuted them that hold
his Kingly and Propheticall Office to

this according to the Vulgar
Latine, <hi>Solvere Jeſum,</hi> to diſſolue Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
that is, to receive him onely in

ſpirit of Antichriſt. Now when the

and convicted me of all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
I had done in my ſpirituall
Captivity under Antichriſt, eſpecially,
that I had crucified Jeſus the Chriſt

doe? The Spirit and the Bride, the

Then I gladly received the Word, was
Baptized, and was added to the Church,

Thirdly, To take common ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
that is, ſuch a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

a falſe and ſandy foundation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That when a man hath

he conſidered not his own body now dead,

                        <p>The promiſe was abſolute, and

they are qualified with ſuch gifts

3. 26, 28, 29. The fruits of ſuch an
union with Chriſt, ſuch duties and
gifts of ſanctification be, when they
be ſincere: otherwiſe, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
were made to ſuch ſoules, in
reſpect of ſuch conditions, then the
reward promiſed would belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, not of grace, but of debt,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. A promiſe made to any
condition, after it be made, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
due debt to him, in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſuch condition is to be found:
But therefore that ſuch promiſes
might be of grace, they are made
to us, not as wee are indued with
ſuch and ſuch conditions; but as
wee who have ſuch and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are united unto Chriſt.
Whence it is, that ſuch bleſſings of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in ſuch promiſes, as they are
tendered to us in Chriſt, ſo are they
fulfilled to us in Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98175:25"/>
we look for the bleſſing, not
in our gifts and duties; but in going

fuller manifeſtation of him to us,
and of comfort in him. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
A thirſty ſoule, to whom
promiſe is made that hee ſhall be
ſatisfied; hee looketh not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

nor from any right his thirſting
might give him in the promiſe; but
hee looketh to be ſatisfied by going
unto Chriſt, in drinking more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly

Chriſt himſelf directeth ſuch droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

make uſe of ſuch kind of promiſes;
<hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> No man can ſee his gifts and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſanctification in himſelfe, but
hee muſt firſt have ſeen Chriſt by
faith, the Spirit of Chriſt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
his underſtanding in the

Chriſt, and for himſelfe, untill

So then theſe conditions, and the
promiſes made to them, doe not
give us our firſt ſight of Chriſt,
nor the firſt glymyſe of light and

Sir) The Word of Chriſt being the Rule
<pb facs="tcp:98175:44"/>
of <hi>Englands</hi> Reformation; the good
Lord (that writeth his Lawes in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
hearts, according to his new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.) put it into
my minde, ſeriouſly to conſider, What
Schiſme was, that I had covenanted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.
And ſearching the Scriptures, I
found it thus written, 1. <hi>Tim. 6. 3. If any
man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to
the wholeſome words, even the words of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and to the Doctrine
which is according to godlineſſe.</hi> Verſ. 4.
<hi>He is proud, knowing nothing; but doting
about Queſtions, and ſtrife of words;
whereof commeth envy, ſtrife, raylings,
evill ſurmiſings.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>Perverſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings
of men of corrupt mindes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute

is godlineſſe; from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf.</hi>
Yea, and after a further enquiry, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
aright the things that are controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongſt us; by the good providence
of the Almighty, I found two Texts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, ſetting forth two ſorts of
men, Diametrally oppoſing one another,
as light doth darkeneſſe, truth doth falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
the one th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s written: 1 <hi>John 5. 1.
Whoſoever beleeveth that Jeſus is the
Chriſt, is borne of God.</hi> And the other,
thus; 1 <hi>John 2. 22. Who is a lyar, but he
<pb facs="tcp:98175:44"/>
that denyeth that Jeſus is not the Chriſt,
He is Antichriſt, that denyeth the Father
and the Sonne.</hi> And when I thought to
underſtand the difference, it was to hard
for me, untill I went into the Sanctuary
of God; where the Father of glory, of his
good pleaſure, revealed to me (the moſt
unworthyeſt of all his ſervants) the truth
of that; which (I conceive) is the root
of all our Controverſies, and gave me to
underſtand the meaning of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
is the Chriſt,</hi> viz. <hi>the eternall King,
Prophet, Prieſt of the Church of the new
Teſtament, ratified with his bloud, whom
the Father of glory hath exalted to bee
Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Acts 2. 36. <hi>and head,</hi>
Epheſ. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Is borne of God.
Seeing no man can ſay,</hi> (that is confeſt)
<hi>that Jeſus is the Lord but by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
1 Cor. 12. 3.</p>
                  <p>Hence I find it written, <hi>Joh. 1. 11. Jeſus
came to his owne, but his owne received
him not,</hi> that is, for the Chriſt, that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
which was to come: but onely for
the <hi>Carpenters ſonne;</hi> Matth. 13. 58. The
reaſon was, becauſe none could underſtand
that Myſtery: <hi>but they onely to whom the
Father of heaven revealed it,</hi> Matth. 11.
14. Hence, when Jeſus demanded of his
<pb facs="tcp:98175:45"/>
Diſciples? <hi>Whom doe men ſay that I the
Sonne of Man am? Peter anſwereth,
thou art the Chriſt, the Sonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God: Jeſus anſwereth, Bleſſed art
thou Simon Bar-Jona; for fleſh and blood
hatb not revealed this unto thee; but my
Father in heaven. And thou art Peter,
and upon this Rock</hi> (Jeſus the Chriſt,
whom thou haſt confeſſed) <hi>I will build my
Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16. 16, 17, 18. Many for
fear durſt not in thoſe dayes confeſſe Jeſus
to be the Chriſt: Inſtance the Parents of
the blind man: Becauſe the Jewes had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that if any did confeſſe, that hee
was the Chriſt; <hi>He ſhould be put out of
the Synagogue,</hi> John 9. 22. But ſo many
as recived him <hi>(viz.</hi> to be the Chriſt) to
them he gave power to be called the ſons
of God; even to them that beleeve in his
name; which were borne not of bloud
nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will of man, <hi>But of God, John</hi> 1. 12, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And as for that other Text of the holy
Scripture that doth univerſally oppoſe it
the heavenly Father gave me thus to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it: 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 22. Who is a lyar (<hi>viz</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orne of the evill one, who is a lyar, and
the father of lyes, and abode not in the
truth, <hi>John</hi> 8. 14. But hee that denieth
<pb facs="tcp:98175:45"/>
that JESUS (whom hee confeſſeth
dyed for his ſinnes; and roſe againe
the third day, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
Is not the Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
King and Prophet of his Church,
in all his outward adminiſtrations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
in admitting of Members into
his ſpirituall Kingdome, according to his
royall Commiſſion, <hi>Matth. 28. 18, 19.
Mark.</hi> 15. 15, 16. (though he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him to be his eternall Prieſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
liveth, to make interceſſion to God
for him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. He is that Antichriſt
<hi>(viz.</hi> an enemy and adverſary to Jeſus

the Sonne, He that denieth the Sonnes
Authority, to bee the eternall King,
and his Commiſſion to bee in force,
<hi>Matth. 28. 18, 19, 20. Mark.</hi> 15. 15,

Denieth the Father, that ſanctified the
Sonne, <hi>and ſent him into the World,</hi> John
10. 36. <hi>and raiſed him from the dead,</hi>
and exalted him to bee Lord and Chriſt,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. Hence it is (my Honoured

have ſtudied to exalt Jeſus the Chriſt, it
<pb facs="tcp:98175:46"/>
being the Primitive. Faith <hi>once given to

named with the name of Jeſus in

<hi>Hebr. 4. 8. &amp;c.</hi> others. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I find the Scriptures giving that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to him in divers places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>I am not the Chriſt,</hi>
John 1. 20. The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>
ſaid, <hi>I know the Meſſiah commeth which
is called the Chriſt,</hi> John 4. 25. <hi>Apollos</hi>
mightily convinced the Jewes, ſhewing
by the Scriptures, <hi>that Jeſus was the
Chriſt,</hi> Acts 18. 28. Now that I received
from the Lord, I could not but make
knowne to you, You being one of the
tender hearted Loyall Covenanters, a
Member of that High and Honourable
Court, under whoſe ſhade Conſcientious
Covenantours (that contend for the faith
of Jeſus the Chriſt, once given to the

                  <p>Know (worthy Sir) that the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the faith of Jeſus the Chriſt,
is a cauſe of ſo many Schiſmes, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
maintained in the earth. Diſdaine

give you an heart to receive it, It will be a
Jewell ſurpaſſing all earthly Treaſure.
For if Ieſus the Chriſt bee your Prophet

the Faith of thoſe twelve Diſciples
<hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Epheſus</hi> bee a ſaving
Faith in the time of his Miniſtery
becauſe Chriſt was come (though
they were ignorant of it, being a
that time in <hi>Aſia)</hi> and had finiſhed
all thoſe things that were written
of him in the Law of <hi>Moſes, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and the Pſalmes,</hi> Luke 24. 44.
But as neither the twelve Diſciples
of Chriſt could not underſtand that
all things were fulfilled of him:
untill hee had opened their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
that they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Scriptures: And then they
rightly underſtood the end of his
ſuffering, death, and reſurrection:
namely, <hi>That repentance, and remiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinnes, ſhould bee preached in his
name among all Nations, beginning at
Ieruſalem,</hi> Luke 24. 45, 46, 47, &amp;c.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98175:80"/>
So neither could theſe twelve <hi>Paul</hi>
found at <hi>Epheſus</hi> know it; becauſe,
<hi>they had not heard, whether there were
any holy Spirit, yea, or nay;</hi> and ſo
were ignorant of the death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of Chriſt, untill the Lord
was pleaſed by his good Spirit to
open their underſtanding, by the
miniſtery of <hi>Paul;</hi> therefore it is
written, <hi>When they heard it, they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
Act. 19. 5.</p>

11. If they therefore ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Faith and Baptiſme
they had received from <hi>John,</hi> they
had no promiſe that waiting they
ſhould receive the gift of the holy
Spirit. But to the Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
that <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſidue of
the Apoſtles preached, there was
a promiſe of giving the gifts of the
holy Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. And when
theſe twelve which had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by <hi>John,</hi> or his Diſciples,
heard it, they ſubmitted them ſelves,
and were baptized in the name of
the Lord Jeſus; <hi>(viz.</hi> into that
profeſſion of Faith <hi>Paul</hi> preached,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 3, 4.) And when</hi> Paul <hi>had
laid his hands on them, the holy Spirit
came upon them, and they ſpake with
new tongues, and propheſied; and the
men were about twelve,</hi> Acts 19. 5, 6.
Such an inſtance likewiſe wee have
in <hi>Samaria; Philip</hi> preaching the
things concerning the Kingdome
of God, and the name of Jeſus
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98175:81"/>
Chriſt, and <hi>they were baptized both
men and women,</hi> Act. 8. 12. <hi>When the
Apoſtles which were at Hieruſalem
heard it, they ſent</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John
<hi>unto them: And when they were come
down, they prayed, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the holy Spirit: (For as yet hee
was fallen upon none of them, onely they

them, and they received the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
Acts 8. 14, 15, 16, 17. So that by

the name of the Lord Jeſus; and
