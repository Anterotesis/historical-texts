            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE late Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> so many Years famous for Wit, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Cunning in Law above any, being so Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Year 1684. in a Tryal between <hi>Thomas Neale,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and her Ladyship, before the then Lord Chief Justice <hi>Ieffryes,</hi> to have the Deeds by her then produced not believed, such of her Heirs and Executors as have not renounced (which some of them have) the having any thing to do with her Title (as well in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of her Ladyships Honour, as of the Integrity of such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Attorneys, as then were imployed in the Cause, in Case they should be so again) do give out of late, that though she and they then were so cruelly baffled, they however will try for't again. Now for the Honour of both Judges and Jury before whom that Cause was then tryed, and for the Benefit of the Free-holders of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> whose Estates may be possibly subject to be claimed by Deeds left by her Ladyship, she having often declared she had Title to many more Houses and Lands than she in her Life time had sued for, as also for the Satisfaction of such as are in the least desirous to know the Truth of this Matter.</p>
            <p>The following Tryal is Printed, with a Map of the Land then tryed for, being about seven Acres in <hi>Shadwell,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> of which the Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> by a Verdict the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term before had got the Possession. The State of the Question being whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the said seven Acres was part of the ancient Inheritance of the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls, London</hi>; to whom the said Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was Lessee and so now the Lessor of the Plaintiff, or part of <hi>Wapping-Marsh</hi> that had been dreined by one <hi>Vanderdelf,</hi> and after sold to the <hi>Stepkinses,</hi> under whom Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> did claim: As likewise is with it reprinted Three or Four Sheets of Paper writ in the Year 1687. comparing the Lady <hi>Ivy's</hi> Title with that of the Creditors of Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Bateman,</hi> and the Heirs of <hi>Witchcutt,</hi> for Lands in <hi>Wapping</hi>; with a Map thereof as it now lies, most plain and exactly agreeing with the Boundaries mentioned in the old Deeds on Record, by which alone, and no other, they claim, and now are possest of the same. To which also is added a Pamphlet entituled, <hi>Allimony Arraigned,</hi> writ by Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy</hi> (her Husband) himself; Reprinted herewith to make the Book sell the better, and to the longer perpetuate so true and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Story.</p>

                     <p>MAY it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Council in this Case with the Plaintiff, and the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be whether the Lessor or the Plaintiff hath a good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Tenements in Question, which are about Three or Four Hundred Tenements near <hi>Radcliffe</hi> in <hi>Shadwell</hi> Parish, and the Ground thereof is, say we, the ancient Inheritance of the Church of St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> who have had the Possession thereof for Four or Five Hundred Years. We shall prove Leases down for some Hundreds of Years, till we come to that made to the Lessor of the Plaintiff under whom we claim. We will begin with the last Lease of Dean <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> 30. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1678. upon the surrender of the Lease made by Dean <hi>Sandcroft,</hi> now my Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

And so <hi>Nowell</hi> seems to have been put for the Maker of this Lease, as being put upon the Top; when in Truth he was not Dean till long after. Upon your Oath, in whose Name was that Lease Lett that is here spoken of.</p>

                     <p>Then I assure you this Book is grandly suspicious.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                     <p>If in case you come and produce a Book, and you value your selves upon the Antiquity of it, as an Evidence that this Land did belong to the Dean and Chapter, and leased by them 5 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. and in that Book <hi>Nowell</hi> is written by the same Hand as the rest of the Book, as Dean then, but because you find <hi>Collet</hi> was then Dean, and <hi>Nowell</hi> not till threescore Years after, <hi>Nowel,</hi> is turned by another hand to <hi>Collet,</hi> it draws a great Suspicion certainly upon your Book, as set up for a purpose.</p>

                     <p>It is true, my Lord, if we did that it were something, but we find an old Book among the Evidences of the Church, and we produce it as such; we have not alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, therefore it cannot be done for our purpose.</p>

                     <p>I am persuaded there may be an ancient Book, and this may be such an one, but it looks a little untoward in this Particular. You, <hi>Spencer,</hi> did you look upon those two particular Passages?</p>

                     <p>As to Mr. <hi>Baron</hi> or Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> themselves, I did never see them come to search: But some for them have.</p>

                     <speaker>Spencer.</speaker>

                     <p>But to put it out of doubt, we have the second Lease, which does recite this Lease of <hi>Collett</hi>'s.</p>

                     <p>Nay, my Lord, we have another piece of Evidence that will fortify that Book to be true, as to the Foundation of it, that such a Lease was then made as the Book says; for we have a kind of Particular, or Catalogue of the Evidences of the Dean and Chapter. It is an ancient Writing. And in this there is mention parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly made of a Lease made in 5 <hi>H.</hi> VIII.

                     <p>Then, may it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I am of Counsel in this Cause for the Defendant, my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi> The Plaintiffs have given you a sort of Evidence for a Title; but the Truth of it is, all that they say will not make a Conclusion such as they would have from their Premises: For all that they have proved, is that the Deans of <hi>Pauls</hi> successively one after another have made Leases. They did in the beginning tell you, they had had this Land hundreds of Years: But what have they had? and what Leases have they made? But only a Mill, a Bakehouse, a Trough of Lead, and all Houses, Lands, Meadows, and Pastures thereto belonging. We do not deny but that they are to have a Mill; their Leases are all so, even the new ones do most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Tract and Words that were used in Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths times. But here is the truth of our Case: That the Dean and Chapter had a Mill we agree; nay, more than that we agree that they have Eighteen Acres that lye on the North side of <hi>Ratcliff</hi> High-way, and also that they have another parcel of Land called the <hi>Lynches.</hi> That this may be understood, we now crave leave to deliver Maps to the Court and the Jury.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then, my Lord, I will go on. We agree, I say, they had a Mill which is now taken down and put in another place: We shall shew them where it did stand, and that was no part of the Land now in Question. The Jury have seen the place, and I hope have had a satisfactory view of it. There was once a Mill standing, and there was once a Pond, but that Mill and Pond doth stand elsewhere. The Land in Question we say was anciently Marsh Ground, and subject to the overflowing of the Water, and it is so to this Day. In <hi>H.</hi> VIII. time it was by one <hi>Vanderdelf,</hi> a Dutchman, drained. This
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103513:5"/>
by Act of Parliament <hi>Richard Hill</hi> was made Owner of and he convey'd it to <hi>Stepkin,</hi> who was the Defendants Ancestor, and whose Heir she is. And the Boundaries are set down in that, and the subsequent Conveyances, which cannot possibly stand with those that their Mill is said to stand in. We shall shew by several Records the Queen had a Title to it by a Conveyance in way of Mortgage to her, and this afterwards was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again to the Ancestor of my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi> We yield they had a Mill, and they have increased the Rent sufficiently upon it, not to need other Mens Land. 'They have Houses built upon it, I know not indeed how much, but I think it is near 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year that yields to them. If then we can demonstratively shew you where our Ground is, and where theirs is, and if we affirm our Title by Records and good Conveyances, then by a Pretence to a Mill I hope they shall not grind us, or take away all our Land.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I crave leave to answer the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that has been given, before I enter upon our Title. They have spent a great deal of time to derive down a Title to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls,</hi> to a Mill, a Bake-house, and some little Ground thereto belonging. And truly, as Mr. Serjeant says, no Man ever questioned the Dean and Chapter for their Mill, and Bake-house, and Leaden Trough. But the thing in Question is, seven Acres and an half of Land, which in the Memory of Man was Marsh Ground: If you observed it, Gentlemen, upon the view how it lies, you know the <hi>North</hi> Bound is the Dean's <hi>Lynches,</hi> the <hi>South</hi> Bound is the <hi>Thames Wall,</hi> the <hi>West</hi> Bound <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> and the <hi>East</hi> Bound is the <hi>Hilly-ground</hi> that is called <hi>Cock-hill</hi>: And we say as to all this Land, it is none of the Dean and Chapter's, nor ever did pass or was enjoy'd by this Lease, but we shall shew you it was under another Lease: I must observe that it is very strange upon their own Evidence that a Mill <hi>cum Pertinentiis</hi> should pass se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Acres of Ground; and a Mill that was demolished so long ago as in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Time, for so we shall plainly shew you it was, and that these Lands containing so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Revenue should not have a Survey taken of then, or a Boundary made of the Land that they might know what was theirs, and what their Neighbours. For your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the Jury may observe in all the Leases and Conveyances down to this time in Dean <hi>Collett</hi>'s Lease, and onward there was nothing mentioned but a Mill with the Apurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or a Tenement with the Apurtenances. But they have not one fixed Boundary of their Lands; and really it cannot be presumed the Dean and Chapter should be so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Besides, in the ancient Lease that they produce of <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. Time there was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to pay the Quit-Rent; as for Lands holden of the Mannor of <hi>Stepney,</hi> and we did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that they would have brought some of the Rolls and Records of that Mannor, and out of some Survey there remaining, would have given a particular Testimony of what Lands belong to the Dean, and what doth not. But in Truth, we say this is properly Marsh-Land, for that will be your Question, Gentlemen, that you are to try, I believe, at last: Whether these seaven Acres thus bounded on <hi>Foxes-Lane West,</hi> on the <hi>Thames South,</hi> on the Hilly-way called, <hi>Cock-hill,</hi> or <hi>Mill-ditch East,</hi> and on the Dean and Chapter's <hi>Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches North,</hi> be Marsh-ground. The Dean and Chapter have given Evidence of some Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which upon the Surrenders were delivered up to them, but there are none produced; they only read the Entries in their Books. Now we shall demonstrate that this Mill of theirs was an Overshot-mill, for there is mention made of a Leaden Trough, which is the only proper Instrument of an Overshot-mill: Therefore we will first settle (because they themselves will not) what is theirs, and then we doubt not to give you Satisfaction that this was never any of theirss but the undoubted Inheritance of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, and not a Foot of it belongs to any other Man living. But further, since they will not we shall produce a piece of Evidence, which indeed we must thank Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> for; for he blabbing it about that he had a Survey of the Mannor of <hi>Stepney</hi> which would do our work, put us upon searching there for it, and we have it here, and there you will find a particular of all the Dean's Lands, under 33 <hi>s.</hi> and 4 <hi>d.</hi> Quit-Rent: And the Particulars are thus described in that Book (which shews that there was a Tenement that stood by the Mill, and that paid a Quit-Rent, and the other Lands came under that Quit-Rent) Twenty Acres called <hi>Shadwell-field</hi> that lyeth on the <hi>North</hi> Side of <hi>Ratcliff</hi> High-way, known at this Day, and all this piece of Ground of Twenty Acres is built upon and improved, which was one part of the Land that came under a Quit-Rent, but not pretended to be any part of this. The next is Five Acres, called <hi>The Linches,</hi> and it appears by the Record to be but five Acres, and so it is measured now. <hi>Ratcliff</hi> High-way went on the Top of the Hill, and this is called the <hi>Lynch-way,</hi> not improved nor built upon, and is exactly abutted according to our Records, and decyphered by Acres to an Acre. Then comes the third Parcel, and that only concerns you to enquire of, whether these seven Acres and an half be parcel of that: And that is described in the Record to be a Tenement called <hi>Derrick-hills,</hi> which is a Bake-house with a Mill, and the Lead and Trough, the Appurtenances of the Mill at
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103513:6"/>
the Rent of 33 <hi>s.</hi> and 4 <hi>d.</hi> These are all the Parcels named of the Dean and Chapter's Lands. And at the last Tryal when they produced the Deed of Purchase whereby this was conveyed to the Dean, which I think was in <hi>H.</hi> III. Time, it yielded but 3 <hi>l.</hi> a Year in the whole, and now in time it is come to 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, without this great Gobbet, which they intend now if they can to swallow up: And now as to this Parcel all they can claim is but a Mill, and in the later Leases it is a House where the Mill stood, and that we shall shew by Records where it stood; and it is said to be called <hi>Derrick-hills,</hi> and scituate on the <hi>East</hi> end of the Marsh now in Question. And to go a Step farther, we shall shew that this was altered in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time; for in 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. the Book wherein their Lease is, makes mention of the Mill as standing; then in 10. <hi>Dec.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Ph. &amp; M.</hi> there is a kind of Mistery which we shall by our Evidence unriddle: For then though the Tenant had above Forty Years in being and to come, he must renew his Lease from Dean <hi>Fecknam</hi> at that time. Now we shall shew that the 20th of the same <hi>December,</hi> this Place where the Mill then lately stood was let to <hi>Iohn Carter, Oarmaker.</hi> There is in that place at this Day Lands and Houses, that yield the Dean and Chapter an Hundred Pounds a Year, distinct from the <hi>Linches</hi> and the <hi>North</hi> Ground of <hi>Ratcliff</hi> High-way, and that is a very good Improvement for a Mill and a Bake-house, and a Leaden Trough, and a Ditch for the Water. Now by their Lease in 1630. they recite that the Mill was not worth the keeping up, and according to the Power given them by the Lease, 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> to pull down the Mill; it was pull'd down, and built upon, and it came to yield them 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Year as it doth at this Day. After this we shall call Witnesses to set forth that in this Place in the <hi>East</hi> End of <hi>Cocock-hill</hi> in the Memory of Man there was found the Floor of the old Mill, and there are those living that can attest it. So we shall shew they are fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wrong Pool, they have sufficient to answer their Deed of purchase; and all the Evidence that hath been given you will appear to be only to entertain the Court with an amusing nothing, and to take up the time. But we shall go yet a Step further, and shew beyond all peradventure, that this Land in question was Marsh Ground: And the other side must admit, that if it be Marsh Ground the Dean and Chapter have nothing to do with it, never pretended to a Foot of it, nor doth any Tittle of their Evidence mention Marsh Ground. And truly we will admit it to them if it be not Marsh Ground we have nothing to do with it. So that Gentlemen, your great Question is, whether this be Marsh Ground or not? And thereupon the main of the Question will be about the <hi>East</hi> Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alone, and no other: For that <hi>Wapping-marsh</hi> bounded <hi>South</hi> on the <hi>Thames, North</hi> on the <hi>Lynches,</hi> and <hi>West</hi> on St. <hi>Katherines</hi> is no Question, nor never was in all the Tryals that have been. Therefore the only point that the Evidence is to be applied unto is about the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Boundary. That we lay to be <hi>Cock-hill,</hi> anciently called <hi>The Hilly-way,</hi> or <hi>Mill-bank,</hi> now <hi>Cock-hill,</hi> and in the Records of <hi>Stepney</hi> Mannor, it is called <hi>Cornhill:</hi> And it is a rising hilly Ground, it appears to be so to this Day, I appeal to the Jury who have seen it. Now that this was Marsh Ground, and the Inheritance of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, we shall prove by these steps. First we shall produce an Act of Parliament made in 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. wherein the Bounds appear to be plainly the same as now we say they are at this day, only now it is all built, that is all the Difference; and the Marsh doth thereby contain 130 Acres. Now by that Act, the whole Marsh is vested as to one Moiety in <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> as Assigne, of <hi>Vanderdelf</hi> the Dutchman, who had dreined it, and for his Pains was to have one half and he agreed with Participators among whom <hi>Stepkins</hi> was one, and had 53 Acres, and particularly this Land. So that the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> must derive a Title from this Act, if he will have the Land. But we shall shew how they colour their Possession. Afterwards <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> II. <hi>Nov.</hi> 37 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. he doth make a Lease to the Dean and Chapters <hi>Miller,</hi> and that for Thirty Four Years, wherein you will exactly see the Boundaries of the Act are pursued. After he had leased it thus to the Dean's Miller, he passeth away the Inheritance to <hi>Thomas Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> in time, 16. <hi>Apr.</hi> 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. <hi>Mercellus Hall</hi> the <hi>Miller,</hi> after <hi>Stepkins</hi> had obtained the Inheritance upon Agreement between them gets a Lease from <hi>Stepkins</hi> of 128 Years of the Lands in Question, as you may see by the Bounds they are exactly the same, and this was in time 20. <hi>Apr.</hi> 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> VI. So the <hi>Miller</hi> had now Ground on both sides the way that is called <hi>Cock-hill.</hi> On the <hi>East</hi> side by Lease from <hi>Hill,</hi> on the <hi>West</hi> side by Lease from <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</hi> Then in point of time we shall come to shew the Lease made to <hi>Roper.</hi> For <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Hall</hi> after he had taken this long Lease from <hi>Stepkins</hi> 30 <hi>Nov.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> doth demise the Land in Question to <hi>Richard Roper</hi> for Twenty Four Years: And we shall shew that in all the Queen's Time <hi>Roper</hi> was Tenant. Then <hi>Iasper Hill,</hi> who was the Heir of <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> in 12 <hi>Nov.</hi> 5 <hi>&amp;</hi> 6 <hi>Ph. &amp; M.</hi> by Deed and afterwards 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by Fine and common Recovery, conveys all these Lands particularly by Name, and releaseth them to <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Macheline Stepkin,</hi> and the Heirs of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and so lodged the Inheritance in the <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinses,</hi> all but that which was thus out in a long Lease to <hi>Marcellus Hall.</hi> We shall prove
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103513:6"/>
that before <hi>Richard Hill</hi> died, he entred into a Statute to <hi>Vivold</hi> and <hi>Salvago</hi> for a great Sum of Money; and this Statute comes to be extended 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and there this Land not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these Leases, are siezed and extended as <hi>Hill</hi>'s Lands. We shall shew all this Land upon a Commission of <hi>Sewers</hi> had a Survey taken of it. When we have shewn all these Records, and proved that this is Marsh Ground, and not a Witness of theirs, but must acknowledge it to be Marsh Ground; (for that place of <hi>Foxes-Lane,</hi> was raised at least Nine Foot, and so proportionably was the rest of the Ground: And it appears at this day that upon a high Tide, all their Sellars are overflown) I think then you will make no doubt, whether this be our Land or no; and to proceed in this Order that I have opened, we will first shew you the Survey. There was one thing I forgot about the Eleven Acres.—</p>

                     <p>My Lord, upon the Second of <hi>August,</hi> 1682. was the first time I ever saw my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> to my Knowledge; and she was informed by one Mr. <hi>Viccarer,</hi> that I had several Writings of <hi>Winterburn</hi>'s; I told her I had so, and my Lady desired me to search among them, if there were any Writings that concerned <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s Estate; I told her it would take up a Months time to look them all over, for there was a great Quantity of them.

                     <p>How did you gather by reading the Outside, that it concerned my Lady <hi>Ivy?</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I only read <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s Name:</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s Name you say.</p>

                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>What Deed do you ask me upon?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>That Deed, the only Deed you have seen here. What is your Christian Name?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>If I mistook you I beg your Pardon; our Question is concerning this very Deed now Shewn to you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought you had meant the Lease of 128 Years.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Well then, let that pass for a mistake; I would know of you now something concerning this Deed. Look upon it— (which he did—) upon your Oath when saw you that Deed first?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot say what day it was.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>But, look you, if I mistook you not, (if I did, I ask your Pardon agen) Did not you say, you found that very Deed among a great many other Writings of <hi>Winterburn's</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103513:7"/>
in a Room, so many Foot long, and so many Foot Wide, in your Garrot? Did not you say, that in time you saw my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> first upon the 2d of <hi>August,</hi> 82. that you found that Deed in <hi>September</hi> following? And did not you tell us, that you did believe in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that in the Year 1669. Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> had this Writing among others, sent to the Chamber of such a Gentleman in <hi>Grays-Inn</hi>; that they remained there Three Months, and then were brought back again to you; and you believe in your Conscience this was one of them? And did not you say, when I asked you, how you came to know this belonged to my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>; you said, because my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> had spoke to you to look if there was any thing belonging to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and you read the Outside of the Deed, and found <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>'s Name, and so you knew it to concern her? Did not you say all this?</p>

                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe I did.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Now tell me then by the Outside of that Deed, how thou can'st tell that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Stepkin</hi>'s, for if thou can'st, thou art more crafty than any body here I believe?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought it had been the long Lease, for that has <hi>Stepkins</hi> on the Outside.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, let that pass for a mistake; we must now begin again upon a new matter: when first saw you that Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>In <hi>September,</hi> 1682.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>How do you know that?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I put my Hand to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you read the Inside of that Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>No, I did not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Look you then, we ask you how you came to know it was a Deed belonging to <hi>Stepkins?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I read the Backside, and put my Hand it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>How came you to put your Hand to this Deed as belonging to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> when you never looked into the Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>When I found this Deed to have written upon it <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> I did believe it was something that concerned the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Let us see the Deed now— (which was done)— You say that was the Reason upon your Oath?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, it was.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Then look upon it again, and do not be surprized, but let us have truth come out in God's Name. Was that the Reason?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>It was my Lord.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>I would fain see Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> I have a question to ask him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Here he is, my Lord.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Give Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> his Oath— (which was done)— Look upon the Outside of that Deed, and upon your Oath tell us whose Hand Writing that is.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sutton.</speaker>
                     <p>All but the word (<hi>Lect.</hi>) is my Hand Writing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Are not the words <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> all of your Hand Writing?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sutton.</speaker>
                     <p>It is.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Then how could'st thou know this to belong to the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s by the word <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> when you first discovered this Deed in <hi>September,</hi> 1682. and you found it by your self, and put your hand to it; and yet that <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> be written by Mr. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> which must be after that time.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>He says he knows it, because he put his Hand to it, I suppose he read somewhat of the Inside.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>He said the Backside, the Outside; he did not read the Inside.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I desire our Evidence may not be anticipated.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Attorney, I would not anticipate your Evidence, but I must tell you by the way, your Evidence anticipate themselves: And this fellow <hi>Knowles,</hi> without any more adoe, has proved himself an errant notorious Knave. And if your Evidence will blunder and spoil themselves, I cannot tell how to help it. I knew, as soon as I saw the Deed, that that was <hi>Sutton</hi>'s hand; I know his hand, as well as that you are Mr. Attorney.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray, My Lord, give me leave to ask him a question, which I hope may clear all this matter, for it is plain the Man is mistaken.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mistaken? Yes, I assure you very grosly. Ask him what Questions you will; but if he should Swear as long as Sir <hi>Iohn Falstasse</hi> fought, I would never believe a word he says.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you look into the middle of any one of the Deeds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I did.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Can you tell which you looked into the inside of, and which you did not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>The Lease and some others I did, but I cannot particularly tell.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Then, my Lord, here is the Case: Here are multitudes of Deeds, and a Man looks on the Inside of some, and the outside of others; is it possible for a Man to speak positively to all the particular Deeds, without being liable to mistake?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Sollicitor you say well, if he had said I looked upon the outside of some, and the inside of others, and where ever I saw either on the outside, or in the inside the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103513:8"/>
Name of <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi>; I layd them by, and thought they might concern my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> that had been something. But when he comes to be asked about this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deed, and he upon his Oath shall declare that to be the Reason why he thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> because of the Name of <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> upon the outside, and never read any part of the Inside, when <hi>Sutton</hi> swears <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> was written by him, what would you have a Man say?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Sol. Gen.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I have but this to say; if there were never a Deed delivered by <hi>Knowles</hi> to my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> or <hi>Sutton</hi> where <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi>'s name was written on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of it, but by Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> I confess it were a strong Objection: But where there are other Deeds, and a great many, a Man may easily be mistaken. It is impossible for any Man in a Multitude of Deeds that he finds among a great Parcel, and delivers many of them out to take it upon his Memory particularly which he looked on the inside of, and which he looked on the backside or outside of.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Did not he give it as a particular Reason of his Knowledge, that they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my Lady <hi>Ivy:</hi> For wherever he saw <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> or <hi>Stepkins,</hi> he thought that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Wherever he saw those Names, that is, either in the inside or out side.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Under Favour, Sir, he did not say so; but positively said, he knew it by that Name. And you shall never argue me into a belief that it is impossible for a Man to give a true Reason, if he have one, for his Remembrance of a thing.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>I beg your pardon, my Lord, as I apprehended him, he swore he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the inside of some, and the outside of others, and there were a great many of them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>And I beg your Pardon, Mr. Sollicitor, I know what he swore as well as any Body else: If indeed he had sworn cautiously and with care, it might have been taken for a slip or a mistake.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, we must leave it upon its own Weight; but we are not come to our Title yet: I have the Deed in my Hand, which is a very old one, and therefore needs not such exact Proof. He is mistaken we do own it, and I must appeal to the Court whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man may not be mistaken in a great multitude of Deeds.</p>

                     <p>Well, now after all this is done, let him give an account how he came to know this to belong to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> if he can. I speak it not to prejudice your Cause, but only to have the Truth come out. But for the Witness that swears, it may affect him I assure you. Give him the Deed, and let him look upon it— Look upon the inside, and look upon the outside too.</p>

see If I could do her any Kindness or Service in any of those Deeds. The first time that I saw her was the Second of <hi>August,</hi> as near as I can remember, and then I told her, I was Executor to <hi>Winterburn,</hi> and had a great many Writings; said she, do you know the Hand of <hi>Stepkins?</hi> if you do, and can find any Writings that relate to <hi>Stepkins</hi> you will do me a great Kindness.</p>

                     <p>He does so, Mr. Attorney. But now I would ask him this Question; If there were no mention of any <hi>Hall,</hi> how came you to find out that this Lease from <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> to <hi>Carter,</hi> should affect <hi>Stepkins</hi> or my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi>

                     <p>When I had found the Lease for 128 Years, I laid it by, and looked further for other things, and found a Mortgage which concerned my self, and that made me more eager to look for what might concern me besides, that I was not so careful as I should have been of the Lease of 128 Years, but mixed it among the Writings again, but I told my Lady I had found such a Deed, and she ordered Mr. <hi>Banister</hi> to help me to find it again.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, we desire we may go on and give our Evidence intire, they would fain break in upon us, and take up another hour in quarrelling with our Witness. When we hear them in their time offer to impeach the Validity of the Deed, then will be our time to justifie it; and I doubt not but we shall give a satisfactory account of it. Pray will you give an account of the Deed you snap'd up the last time.</p>

                     <p>Then pray mind what I say, and consider of it. The 16th of <hi>September,</hi> 1682. was the time that you went on purpose to look for Deeds at Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>'s House?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I was there on the 7th Day of <hi>September,</hi> and that was the first Day that ever I came into Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>'s House in my Life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>There were some Deeds, it seems, that Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> had found before.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>As he told me, he had mislaid them.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>And when did you come to have an account that he had found those Deeds first?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>It was after I had paid him 3 <hi>l.</hi> For Water.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>It was the Fifth or Fourth of <hi>September.</hi>

                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>On the 7th of <hi>September</hi> he desired me to come and help him and assist him in finding out the Deeds that he had mislaid.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L.C.I.</speaker>

                     <p>That is my Hand.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>The Paper I have in my Hand was written at the same time.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I set my Hand to several Deeds that I found there, to some Writings, on the 7th of <hi>September,</hi> and to others on the 16th.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Now tell us which of them it was that thou didst put thy Hand upon this Deed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe it might be the Seventh.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Didst thou not see that Deed before the Seventh of <hi>September,</hi> 1682. upon thy Oath?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Never.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Who was with you when you first found that Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray, my Lord, let this Note be read, and that will clear all.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>No, by no means, Mr. Attorney, he may make use of what Notes he pleases, to refresh his own Memory; but we will never support or prop up a Perjury at that rate, I assure you, by a Note. Was Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> with you when you found that Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>He was.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you take it upon your Oath that that Deed was found the Seventh of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> 1682. in the Garret at Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>'s House?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot tell which of the two, it was the Seventh or the Sixteenth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Was it one of the two, upon your Oath?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>It was one of the two.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Now call Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> again.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>There he is, my Lord, if your Lordship please to look upon the Deed— <hi>Knowles</hi>'s Name was to it likewise, but scraped out.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, we will ask him about it. But Mr. <hi>Banister</hi> positively swears he was at the finding of this Deed. What say you <hi>Knowles</hi>?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I know nothing of it, my Name is not to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Was your Name ever to it, or not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>No, never.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dobbins.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But it was to it at the Tryal in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you set your Name to all the Deeds you found in the Garret?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I did.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Upon your Oath, <hi>Banister,</hi> did you set your Name to any Deeds that he did not, that were found there?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe I might do so, I would not swear punctually to it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Was he with you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>He was with me in the very same Chamber.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not know that ever I put my Hand to that Deed in my Life.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you ever see that Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I cannot say I did, I remember nothing of it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>I ask you once again, when you found this Deed was he with you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>You, <hi>Knowles,</hi> did you ever trust him to look and search any Deeds in your Garret, but when you were by your self?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>No, my Lord.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I would ask you upon your Oath, because you are the Persons that had these Deeds in your Custody, was there any Deeds delivered out of your Hand that you did not set your Hand to?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe there was never an one.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>How came this Deed which he swears was found there, not to have your Hand to it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Knowles.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not know that ever I saw it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Did Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> say he was looking for Deeds of his own concern when he found the first Deed?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>He did say he had looked before, and had found some of these Deeds, and then mislaid them, and desired my Assistance to find them again.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>What did he say to you at first?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>He said he had been spoken unto by my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> to look for deeds that might concern her Ancestors, and he had found some; but finding some also that concerned himself, he had mislaid my Ladys, and desired me to help him to find them again.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>What Imployment have you under my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>I am her Rent-gatherer.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Her Bayliff I suppose: But now you speak of what my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> desired of <hi>Knowles,</hi> I would ask you a Question, lest it slip out of my Memory. Were you present at any time when my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> spoke to Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> to look after any Deeds?</p>
                  </sp>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I have.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Lutwich.</hi>
                     </speaker>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>Because they were ancient Deeds, and I was to look out where the Lands were that they did concern.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray now answer my Question, look upon it, and tell me what Deed do you take it to be?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a Deed of Sale to <hi>Stepkins.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>My hand is to it, and this is one of the Deeds, I take it to be so, that was found in the Garret at Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>'s House.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Is there any Deed of the Sixteenth of <hi>April, 6 Edw. 6.</hi> from <hi>Hill</hi> to <hi>Stepkins</hi> in that Note.</p>

                     <p>With your favour my Lord, I conceive it is, for that will make it plain that he is mistaken.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe he is; but with your favour, it is not a fair Question, you are only to ask him, whether that Deed given in Evidence be there?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>I would ask him one short question, my Lord, and I think it is a fair one.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>I never saw the Lease, but as I was here at the last Tryal, when there was a Verdict for this Estate to be my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s, and afterwards the 22 of <hi>December</hi> last, I had an opportunity of being with Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> he being with Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> my Ladies Husband since dead, at the <hi>Kings head Tavern,</hi> with whom I had some business. Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> was there first (I suppose it was by appointment they met) and in half an hour Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> came up stairs; after they had changed two or three Complements, they came to talk about meeting at Mr. Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Chamber in the <hi>Temple,</hi> to Treat about their Controversie. Says Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> let there be a Forfeiture upon it of 50 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid by him that faills. No, says Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> I will make no forfeiture, but I will certainly meet there. Says Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> again, and I question not but to give such satisfaction as whereby to convince you and my Lady, that this is not her Estate. I should be glad to hear that, says Mr. <hi>Brian,</hi> why I hope you do not think the Deeds are Forged? No, says Mr. <hi>Neale,</hi> I do not think they are forged. Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me a long time ago, to shew me that Deed, and I might have had it in my possession, but I would not; for if I had, I should have been the aptest man in the world to burn it.

                     <p>To the intent that I knew better where the Lands did lye then she did, and when my Lady found any Deeds, I set my Hand to them, and then found the places where the Lands lay.</p>

                     <p>Yes it is, this is one of the Deeds that was found at Mr. <hi>Knowles</hi>'s.</p>

                     <speaker>Banister.</speaker>
                     <p>This is Rat-eaten, and so I know it again, and there is a Rat-eaten Deed set down in my paper.</p>

                     <p>I hope the folly of our Witnesses in such Circumstances, shall not rob us of our own Land, and that it appears to be plainly.</p>

                     <p>Nay, let us ask but one at once, pray. I will ask you a plain Question; Did you know the Marsh before it was built upon?</p>

                     <p>Yes, Sir, that I did.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>How far did the Marsh-Ground go?</p>

                     <p>To <hi>Cock-hill</hi> Eastward, as far as the broad Bridge; Westward as far as <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi>

                     <p>The River of <hi>Thames</hi> did flow round about it, and there were Boggs, Trees and Bushes, and such things.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>How could it be an overshot Mill? how could the Mill be turned but with the Tide?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Their Evidence makes it appear such by the Leaden Trough, which is an Instrument belonging only to an Over-shot Mill.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Tell not me of the Leaden Trough, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>; look you upon the Survey you produced, and take Notice of the last Paragraph, and there you will find the Words <hi>Prox' adjacent' cuidam Tenemento, &amp;c.</hi> What make you of that?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray, my Lord, let it be read.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>I will in the mean time ask your Witness a Question. Friend, thou seemest to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103513:16"/>
be a Man that understands something. Thou sayst <hi>Foxes-Idne</hi> was a Bank before it was built, and the Tide before that time came up to that Bank, both high and low. Now suppose there had been a Mill in that Ground, how should it have been driven?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hughes.</speaker>
                     <p>I will tell your Honour; my Lord, by Report, and I suppose it may be true; the Mill stood all the Tide of Flood, and when the Flood was at High-Water, there was a Dam which kept it in, and it went out again at Ebb-Tide, and so the Mill was drove.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>There is your Overshot Mill gone then, Mr. Atorney.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>If ever Seven or Eight Acres of Gound can be the Appurtenances of a Mill, I should much wonder.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr Attorney, I can tell you of a Mill over against this Place, which I my self, and we all can remember. All the Estate about it was in the <hi>Traps</hi> Family, he was a Gentleman of our House; all the Water that drives that Mill, and two or three Mills that serve that side of the River, is taken in as the Tide comes in, and is pent in as he says by a Dam, and when they open that, the Mill turns back again. For I would sain have all these things that seem to be dark cleared by the way as they go. I will suppose all the Records you have read to be right, and that it is called <hi>Ratcliff-Mill,</hi> and then there is the <hi>Mill-bank,</hi> and the <hi>Hilly-bank,</hi> and the <hi>Hilly-way</hi>; it is plain then there was a <hi>Mill-bank,</hi> or a <hi>Hilly-bank,</hi> or whatever you call it. It so falls out that the thing now in Question is made plain upon your own Evidence, there was really Ponds, and Gutters, and those things that were to satisfie the Mill: This Mill comes to be plucked down, and the Ponds and all the Sleuces come now to be built upon: This is not like your Marsh Ground that is on the Western part of the Bank, but it is Parcel of Mere or Marsh, as the Pond and the rest sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled up by those things, that till such time as the Mill was taken away were Receptacles for to pen up the Water that came in with the Tide. What is the meaning of those Words in the Survey that I spoke of before, and the several Tenements and Orchards, and Ponds, and Sewers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all those things. Would you have it that this should all point to the Scite of the Mill, as though all the Boundaries should extend to the East end of the Mill?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. S. <hi>Stringer.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That was the Reason why I asked but now how big the whole was.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>And will what you would have, Mr. Attorney, a Ditch or two ever answer the Words in the Survey?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Nor will all their Words amount to divers Closes of Ground, as this must make in the whole.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>But this you yourself say, is the <hi>Derrick-hills,</hi> in the Survey; and you do take it as soon as the Mill was pulled down in one place, it was set up in another.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>After he had taken our long Lease he erected one, we say, upon our Ground for he had pulled down the old Mill, and lett that to <hi>Carter.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, it is plain that the old Mill and the new Mill were not upon the same Ground from <hi>Carter</hi>'s Lease.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Sollicitor, You indeed agree among your selves that it is plain, but alas the Fact is quite contrary.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Mr. S. <hi>Maynard.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, we do make our Argument for the Defendants Title as your Lordship does apprehend it. The Boundaries towards the East is made the Mill and <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff-Town.</hi> This place that contains Seven Acres, though it had Passages for the Water, is not the Mill, and it can never be, that so much Ground can be reckoned to be Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Mill: It is the Mill it self that is the East bound.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

                     <p>Take it to be so as your Lordship says, that there is mention of a Mill-Bank, that cannot lye East, for it lyeth in a little Pond—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Good Brother let us not puzzle that which is as plain as that the Sun shines. The controversy is about all the West part of <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>No, it is the East bound that we contend for.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Attorney, if you will mistake the Point I cannot help it, I assure you I do not. Pray take notice of it, it is called 130 Acres in your Act of Parliament.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, my Lord, 130 Acres.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Now then the East of your Land by your own shewing is Mill-Bank; the East of Mill-Bank is the Mill, whereas the West part is St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> so all your Deeds and Records say but the East part of the Land is Mill-Bank.</p>

                     <p>The East Bound your Lordship sees is the Mill: Now your Lordship makes an Objection, that if it were as we say, an Overshot Mill, it could not have been driven—</p>

                     <p>Do not, pray, make any silly Objection for me, and then think to answer it. I tell you I do say, that it is impossible there could be any Mill there, but a Tide-Mill: The thing is as plain, Mr. Att. as any thing in the World can be Go on with your Evidence.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                        <hi>Shadwell</hi> it was called, I knew no other Name it had; and that Well was wharfed about, and there was a Piece of Wood about Six Foot long put into it, and it was on the hide of the Hill, a Cooper had it in his Possession, and he used to put his Hoops into it—</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                     <p>I remember their was a Ditch that run along way, there were three or four Bridges over it.</p>

                     <speaker>Somerley.</speaker>
                     <p>It had Planks to go over, and it was a deep Ditch.</p>

                     <p>I lived there 26 Years ago, and in the time since I lived in it, it is raised the Length of my Stick and more: For when the Tyde came in strong, it used to drive Stones and Planks in at the Windows. There was a Waterhouse erected upon <hi>Wapping-Wall,</hi> and they went to lay Pipes along the Street, but they could not lay them there, for they found great Pieces of Timber, and other things in the Ground that hindered it, and upon that they raised the Ground.</p>

                     <speaker>Barefoot.</speaker>
                     <p>There was a Mill in my time, that went with the Tide, and all the Water that came down from that Mill, came into a Pond, and so to the Mill-dam, and so drove this Mill.</p>

                     <speaker>Barefoot.</speaker>
                     <p>It was driven by the Water that came from the River in a Sluce.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                     <p>The upper Ground was the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, but the lower Ground was Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s.</p>

                     <p>Was there a Bridge over the <hi>Lynch</hi> Ditch at the end of <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi>

                     <p>Do you know it was Marsh-ground on the East side of <hi>Foxes-lane?</hi> did it ever lie under Water?</p>

                     <speaker>Barefoot.</speaker>
                     <p>At high Tides and such as that it was overflowed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>But at common Tides did it use to go over <hi>Foxes-lane?</hi>

                     <p>I cannot tell that truly, it is now raised very high, it was much lower; but I am sure the Tide sometimes came beyond.</p>

                     <speaker>Barefoot.</speaker>
                     <p>There was no Passage to go through, but at <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi>

                     <p>It went into the Dam, and so drove the Mill. There was an Iron Mill built by one <hi>White</hi> Twenty Years after.</p>

                     <p>Through <hi>Wapping</hi> and <hi>Shadwell: Shadwell</hi> is the lower way.</p>

                     <p>And then to come to the Admeasurement, taking in the Place in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it makes just 130 Acres, which is our Number and no more.</p>

                     <p>we claim this as Marsh-Land; which they have nothing to do with, and the Number of Acres will not be answered without it. Mr. <hi>Holwell,</hi> have you admeasur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marsh?</p>

                     <p>Why, my Lord, it is no more than 130 Acres, and so much we must have.</p>

<stage>[Which was done.]</stage> — Mr. <hi>Holwell,</hi> how much pray, is the Land between <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> and the Mill?</p>

                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Can you expect then that all those Words of Gardens, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should be answered under seven Acres and an half. Besides, the first and ancient Reservation of Rent was 10 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, after it was increased to 16 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, and it doth appear the Mill turned to so little Account that it was pulled down, and so the Land was to answer the Rent, which for a ground-rent upon a Church-Lease in those Days was very great. Have you done now?</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; If we should give no further Evidence at all than what we have already given: But leave it upon this, I dare affirm it plainly appears that they have no Title at all to this Land. As to their last piece of Evidence I would first give an answer to that, and that is their Verdict; and that which I would observe upon it, and say to it, is this; it was a Verdict obtained upon forged Deeds. Deeds found, as is pretended, and as you have heard from their two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Witnesses, in a very extraordinary manner found in a Garret. But by what Art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and that they are forged I question not but we shall give you Satisfaction. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as to their Admeasurement, it seems as they would have it 130 Acres is the Question about the extent of the Marsh. So much they claim, and we shall bring two Surveyors that will give you an account upon their Oaths, that between <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> which we say is the West Boundary of our Land, and the East of theirs, and <hi>Hermitage-Dock,</hi> where the Marsh ends, there is above 130 Acres, and so they do not want their Number. For all the Evidence that they have given out of Records, we agree them to be as they say, and by that Agreement shall do our selves no harm at all; for they all do confirm our Assertion: They place the Eastern Bound of the Marsh at <hi>Ratcliff-Town</hi>; now at <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> doth <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff-Town</hi> begin. The Art has been to confound the Cause by puzling Boundaries, when it is a plain apparent mistake they run upon, and indeed I may very well say, a wilful one too. They would have us confine all to a Mill and a little Ditch, when they are at least seven Acres always enjoyed with it, and all called the Mill, which had a Pond, Gardens, Orchards, Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now there are very large Drains necessarily made, to keep the Water from annoying the Inhabitants, and to carry it away. But for a further Evidence of our Title, we shall first prove that upon a Bill exhibited in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> by Mr. Attorney General against <hi>Stepkins</hi> their Ancestor, to know what Incroachments had been made, what belonged to the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and what to Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> are fully set out. There it is proved that the Bounds of the Marsh were <hi>Wapping-wall, alias Foxes-lane.</hi> The Marsh was continually overflown with Water, but now in our Ground there was a great many Ditches and places to keep the Water for the Service of the Mill. When we come to build upon our Ground, which was 15 <hi>Iacobi</hi> (then it began) then he brought an Action and did pretend that we did incroach the Wall somewhat into the Marsh, there we had a Verdict upon a View, and after a Non-suit upon full Evidence. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Bill exhibited in Chancery against <hi>Stepkins</hi> the Father, wherein the Bounds are set forth, and he in his Answer particularly enumerates the Boundaries. And it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103513:19"/>
the Reputation of the Place, that this was the Dean's Lands, surveyed as the Deans Lands, sold in the late Times of Usurpation as the Dean's Lands. The first thing, my Lord, which they produced, and that we did then, and do now controvert is <hi>Carter</hi>'s Lease; this, they say, was found in the Garret, and they bring two Witnesses for it: But how they have behaved themselves, what confusion there is in their Evidence, you see—</p>

                     <p>Brother <hi>Stringer,</hi> if you have any Evidence to give, pray give that first, and leave your Remarks till the last, you shall then say what you will, but first give your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, we shall pursue your Direction: We say, upon <hi>Foxes</hi> Building, <hi>Stepkins</hi> surmising that the Wall belonged to him, comes and brings an Action of Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against <hi>Foxes</hi> Tenants for this Wall, and upon Tryal the Verdict went against him. Then there was another Action brought, and he was Nonsuit upon that. Afterwards there was a Bill preferred against him, and in his answer he confesseth that his Wall Marsh bounded upon <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi> Here are the Bill and Answer.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, we have this further Piece of Evidence; we have here a Lease made by <hi>Stepkins</hi> of seven Acres of Land, Westward of <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> which divides the Marsh from the Mill-Ditches, and there is a Covenant that if he recover any part of Wall, Marsh-Wall, the Tenant shall have the Advantage of it, and increase his Rent.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, as I did open it, there was an Information exhibited by Mr. Attorney Gen. <hi>Noy,</hi> 7 <hi>Car.</hi> I. against our Tenants and theirs, and upon that Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation there were Examinations of Witnesses, and all the Bounds of both Parties parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly set out, which make it all as plain and clear as can be. This cannot be set up to serve a Turn, it was in 7 <hi>Car.</hi> I. so long ago, and when that shews the Wall to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> it answers all their pretence of a Lease—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Look you Brother, that cannot be given in Evidence, and I will tell you why, if it were an Information against <hi>Stepkins</hi> himself, he being the Party under whom they claim, no doubt it were Evidence. But it is against the Tenants of the one, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the other; who only could support their own Tenancies, but they could not know their Landlords particular Titles, and then this cannot be Evidence to bind their Inheritance.</p>

                     <p>We submit it to you, my Lord. Then we shall offer you a Survey. In the Year 1649. this was exposed to Sale as Church Lands, and a Survey taken and found to be the Inheritance of the Church of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and as such sold for 9500 <hi>l.</hi> and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Purchasors till the Restoration.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and to that very Person sold from whom they say they had these Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which they have produced. That is to <hi>Winterburn,</hi> whose Executor <hi>Knowles</hi> was, as he says; and if he had such a Lease, which had then been forty Years in being, would he have given so much Money or ventured to purchase it as the Inheritance of the Church.</p>

                     <speaker>Curtlett.</speaker>
                     <p>Sometimes it was reputed Mrs. <hi>Moors,</hi> sometimes <hi>Winterburns,</hi> sometimes ones, sometimes anothers.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                     <p>Do you remember the Mill that was in this Ground in Question?</p>

                     <speaker>Curtlett.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, very well.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                     <p>How was that Mill driven?</p>

                     <speaker>Curtlett.</speaker>
                     <p>The Water came in at <hi>Bell-wharf,</hi> Eastward, out of the <hi>Thames</hi> into the Pond, and so run beyond <hi>Broad-bridge,</hi> and vented it self into divers Ditches, and when the Tide went out, it returned back again, and imployed the Mill.</p>

                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Curtlett.</speaker>
                     <p>Some of them to <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> and one principal Ditch turned up half way the Lane, that People were forced to have Boards and Planks to go over it.</p>

                     <p>The Thing is very plain, had it been as they say, an Overshot mill, this Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was made of Water for it, for ought I see, would have drowned all the Ground round about it.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, It could be no Over-shot-mill, for the Water will not rise high enough to drive such a Mill; it ran in several Ditches to preserve it from rising to overflow the Ground. Besides, my Father, who was a Mill-wright himself, told me he had known it Threescore Years, and knew it always a Ground-shot-mill: He told me of all the Mill, about <hi>London,</hi> what they were.</p>

                     <p>Thirty or Forty Years: But I had no acquaintance with that Mill they speak of; But I know it is impossible for any Over-shot-mill to be there: For I keep part of a Tide-mill my self, and have done so this Forty Years, and I know the Water must rise at least Ten, Twelve, or Fourteen Foot higher than it needs in a Tide-mill. For we take in our Water as the Tide comes in, and we have a pair of Gates that are hung with Hinges at the Top, which open as the Tide comes in, but the Water as it goeth out, shuts it again, and that keeps the Water to stand three or four Hours in some Mills, and then we have only Gutts that belong to the Wheel, and then we draw up the Gates the Water goes out. We have no Water that comes above the Shaft, which is half the Heighth of the Wheell, which is Sixteen Foot high. To talk of an Over-shot-mill the Water must rise so high as to go over the whole Marsh.</p>

                     <p>At the upper End of <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> as we go Westward, and just at the side of the Church-yard, there is one now and brick'd over Head, where they used to fetch Water: I never knew any other.</p>

                     <p>Sir, we hope we shall not need to be taught which is our Inheritance.

                     <speaker>Marr.</speaker>
                     <p>The Land which is counted <hi>Wapping-Marsh,</hi> which is bounded on <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> East, on the Dean's Land West, upon <hi>Grash-Mill, Well-close, Nightinghal lane,</hi> &amp;c. if we take it to the upper Ground, doth contain 130 Acres, but take in that which is in Question too, and it makes 141 Acres.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you measure it too Mr. <hi>Leyburn.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Leyburn.</speaker>
                     <p>I did so too, Sir, and it is as he says.</p>

                     <speaker>Leyburn.</speaker>
                     <p>I took the whole from St. <hi>Katharines</hi> to <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> and it makes 130 Acres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Upland and Foreland, and the like between <hi>Grash-mill</hi> and <hi>Wall-marsh-wall:</hi> It is at least so much; it is, I think somewhat more, the Ditches being undetermined.</p>

                     <p>If your Lordship please, we have only a short Question to ask Mr. Baron <hi>Gregory</hi>; if he please to be sworn—</p>

                     <p>—Where is Mr. <hi>Knowles?</hi> Sir, you were pleased to say that the Writings were carried to Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>'s Council in <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> and that that Writing was among them.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, Mr. Baron <hi>Gregory</hi> had the Perusal of these Writings.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>But, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> my Brother <hi>Gregory</hi> was not named to be the Counsellor in <hi>Grays-Inn.</hi>

                     <p>Well Brother, we cannot help your staying now, but remember you had an Offer made you at first, and you are punished for refusing it. Go on Brother <hi>Stringer.</hi>

                     <p>My Lord, that which we were surprized with the last Trial, was the Newness of these Deeds to us. It look'd to us to be so strange a thing, so amazing a thing to us, that we knew not how to give an answer to it. We have since considered of these things, and your Lordship doth see what account they themselves have given of them. And what an improbability it is that these Deeds should be found, as they say. Here was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103513:22"/>
a Possession which we have proved under the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> Lease for so long, this they would strip us of these Deeds that they have trumped up. It made us look into it more warily, and we cannot conceive it probable, or any thing likely, that the Deed of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase whereby this Land is pretended to be purchased into the Family of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, should be found in the Hands of the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> Lessee, who likewise purchas'd it of the State, as the Inheritance of the Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi> How could the Deed of Purchase from <hi>Hill</hi> be in our Lessees House.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>

                     <p>It was not, that is a mistake.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>S. Pemberton.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Good Mr. Attorney, do not interrupt me. We must rely upon it that they swore it the last time, and that the Deed of Inheritance made four days before our Deed, on purpose to warrant the Trick. Here is likewise a Surrender made between <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Stepkins</hi> produced. How the Deans Lessees should come to have that Deed of Surrender? But to satisfie your Lordship in this matter, We shall give a Full and a Fair Evidence, that these Deeds are forged.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, we have had a violent suspicion, that these Deeds were forged. But we suspect it now no longer, for we have detected it, and will shew as palpable self-evident Forgery upon the Face of these Deeds as ever was. I desire to see the Deed of the 13th of <hi>November,</hi> in the 2d and 3d years of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> from <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> to <hi>Roper:</hi> and that of the 22th of <hi>December,</hi> in the same years, from <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> to <hi>Carter,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see too. Your Lordship sees the use of these Deeds. The one is grafted upon our Lease from Dean <hi>Fecknam,</hi> where it is recited, that the Mill is demolished, and a new one erected in another place (says their Deed,) and upon that they set up the Notion of an Overshot-Mill, and all the puzling Matter brought into this Cause. But I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove them plainly forged.</p>

                     <p>That is an undertaking indeed.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Bradbury.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>It is an undertaking indeed to detect the Defendants Articles, but I will venture upon it, and shall demonstrate it so evidently, that Mr. Attorney himself shall be convinced they are forged.</p>

                     <p>If your Lordship please to look upon them, the Stile of the King and Queen in both run thus. The one is, This Indenture made the thirteenth day of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the Second and Third Years of the Reigns of our Soveraign Lord and Lady <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Grace of God King and Queen of <hi>England, Spain, France,</hi> both <hi>Cicilies, Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defenders of the Faith, Arch Dukes of <hi>Austria,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Millain</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> Counties of <hi>Hasburg, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Tyroll.</hi> The other is, This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture made the 22th day of <hi>December</hi> in the same Year. Now in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 2 and 3 of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> it was impossible for any man in the World to draw a Deed in this Form that those two Writings are —</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I had the hint from my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his first Institutes, not as to this particular Stile, for I know he is mistaken there, but for the detecting of Forgeries in general.</p>

And lastly, <hi>Burgundy</hi> was never put before <hi>Millain.</hi> Now to prove all this, that I say I have here all the Records of that time, which will prove their Stile to be otherwise. <hi>First,</hi> We shall shew the Acts of Parliament of that time. The sitting began the 21th of <hi>October,</hi> in that Year which was before their Deeds, and ended the 9th of <hi>December</hi> after. We shall first read the Titles of the Acts of Parliament, and you will find them just as I have opened them. Read the Statute Book.</p>

                     <p>Acts made at a Parliament begun and holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the one and twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> in the Second and Third Years of the Reign of our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign Lord and Lady <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> by the Grace of God King and Queen of <hi>England, France, Naples, Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defenders of the Faith, Princes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> Arch Dukes of <hi>Austria,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Millain, Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Haspurg, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Tyroll,</hi> and there continued and kept until the Dissolution of the same, being the ninth day of <hi>December</hi> then next ensuing.</p>

                     <p>Here in the Acts made by the Publick Council of the Kingdom the Style is in the ancient manner. And your Lordships observes these no small differences. Here first <hi>Spain</hi> is left out in the enumeration of the Kingdoms, and so <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of them. In the Deeds <hi>Spain</hi> is put in before <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Sicilies</hi> made a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here in the Style of the Act they are called but Princes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> that in the Deeds is quite left out. And then in the Acts of Parliament, <hi>Millain</hi> is put before <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in the Deeds, <hi>Burgundy</hi> before <hi>Millain.</hi> And how this great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Style should come to be put in a Millers Lease, is strange. We have next an account of all the Fines of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term, which was the Term next following; for their first Deed happens to be in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, and then the Parliament sate too.</p>

                     <p>Here are likewise the Fines of <hi>Easter</hi> Term following, which shew that still the Old Style continued in all the publick Records. And if we could as easily have brought all the Enrolments of Deeds that would prove the same.</p>

                     <p>But I cannot see how these Deeds could be truly made at that time when they stand single, and none like them can be shewn, except they come from the same Forge that these do. I cannot believe the Miller alone, or he that drew his Leases for him, could so long before prophecy what manner of Style should hereafter be used.</p>

                     <p>—But to go a little further to satisfie your Lordship that they are very likely to be forged, We shall give some evidence that this is not an unusual thing with some People concerned in this Cause.

                     <p>To speak plain, my Lord, we call them to give an account of my Lady <hi>Ivies</hi> forging a Mortgage from one Sir <hi>William Salkhill</hi> for 1500 <hi>l.</hi> of a House in St. <hi>Martins Lane,</hi> to which forgery Mr. <hi>Duffet,</hi> that Ladies Husband was privy, and what benefit he should have by it you will hear. Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> pray will you tell what you know of my Lady <hi>Ivie</hi> in this matter.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, that which I have to say is this; My Lord, I am Tenant to my Lady <hi>Salkhill,</hi> Sir <hi>William Salkhill</hi>'s Widow, in a House in St. <hi>Martins Lane,</hi> and was so to her Husband a year and a half before he died. The House hath been built backward, and the Garden side they kept to themselves; But all the House that was first built, I took, and have it still. My Lord, my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> did come to the House about three months before Sir <hi>William</hi> died, parting from her Husband Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy,</hi> she came thither as a Refuge, where she had been before, and was received very kindly. He died, as I said, about three months after, and my Lady then desired to know how accounts stood between Sir <hi>William</hi> and her about monies he had lent her, and supplied her with. And upon the Account she appeared to owe Sir <hi>William</hi> 96 <hi>l.</hi> she then took 4 <hi>l.</hi> more out of my Lady <hi>Salthills</hi> mony, and told her, now Madam, I owe you 100 <hi>l.</hi> She had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as a Guest there without paying any thing for it, and at his death she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with my Lady <hi>Salthill</hi> three quarters of a year after. And being there (as she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) in great kindness to me, she persuaded my Lady and me, that the Lease of my Ladies House should be turned over to me in trust for a Debt of fourscore pounds that was owing to me by Sir <hi>William Salkhill.</hi> Said I to my Lady <hi>Salkhill,</hi> Madam I am in no doubt of my mony, I pay as much Rent as this in a Year and more, I can pay my self that way, pary let not me meddle with any such thing, Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> will be persuaded I intend to cheat them if I should. But still my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> was at it, and prevailed upon my Lady <hi>Salkhill</hi> to press me to it. At last upon their importunity, said I, if it be necessary for my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies service, let it be done what you think fit. She therefore gave direction to Mr. <hi>Sutton,</hi> and he come to me, and I directed him to draw a Writing to turn over the House to me as a security. He asked me how much my Debt was; Fourscore Pounds said I. Said he, I should see my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Lease, to my Lady, for he must take some things out of it to draw this by. He did see it, and took as much by Note out of it as he thought fit, to make the other by. Then a Writing was drawn, this was in <hi>Iune</hi> 1670,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103513:23"/>
or 1671. I am not certain particularly which, but she brings this Writing, and my Lady <hi>Salthill</hi> signed it by her desire, and my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> were both Witnesses to it. About a year after I heard that she set on foot a Mortgage of her own upon this House from Sir <hi>William Salthill.</hi> I wondred at it, because when the Account was made up she appeared to be in Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Debt; and I told those that told me of it, I would believe it when I did see it. I was then informed the Writing was at <hi>Malmesbury.</hi> She after went out of Town, and comes back again in a little while, and this Writing, as I heard, was shewn to several persons of my acquaintance that came to me and told me they had seen it, but said I so have not I, but when I see it I will believe it. At last Serjeant <hi>West,</hi> who was a Relation of mine, I married his Aunt, one day brought over this Writing to me, and told me he had got this Writing at last, and leave from my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> to let me see it. I looked upon it, and there I did see at the bottom, where the Seal was, <hi>William Salkhill,</hi> and then I turned to look upon the Witnesses names. No, says he, you must not see that, who are Witnesses to the Deed, for my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> made me promise, before she let me have it to shew you, that you should not see the Witnesses names. Then said I again, I have seen enough to give me satisfaction: I was a little the more confirmed that the thing was not a reality but fiction, and so I told him. My Lady saw that would not pass, she offered, provided Mrs. <hi>Duffet,</hi> my Ladies Daughter, might have the advantage of the House to release the matter.</p>

                     <speaker>Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>For 1500 <hi>l.</hi> that Sir <hi>William Salkhill</hi> owed her, which I thought some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange, seeing, as I said, she owed Sir <hi>William</hi> so much at his Death. At last I came to produce my Writing, (for she told me I might give Mrs. <hi>Duffett</hi> a Right to the House.) Now I had not read over the Writing made to me, but now when I came to look upon it, instead of a Mortgage for securing my Debt, mine was a Deed of Sale from my Lady <hi>Salkhill,</hi> whereby the House and the Lease from my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> were sold me for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score pound, at which I was a little amazed. My Lady then was pleased to say I was a Cheat, tho' I had no hand in it, nor indeed would have had any thing at all done but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s importunity and my Lady <hi>Salkhills,</hi> I gave direction only for a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, I did see Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> Forge and Counterfeit several Deeds for my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly I hope I mistook her, and did not hear right what she said. Pray Mrs. speak it over again, and consider well what you say.</p>

                     <p>I say, my Lord, I did see Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> Forge and Counterfeit several Deeds for my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi> The first thing that I do remember was in the Tryal between her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and she Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> did by her Order counterfeit a Bond from him to some third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and several Letters pretended to be written from Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> were counterfeit. The next thing that I remember; Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> was writing upon a Parchment: I asked him what he was writing? He answered me, he was counterfeiting one <hi>Glovers</hi> Lease, by which my Lady would get many hundreds of Pounds, and for which he should have 500 <hi>l.</hi> I desired him to consider what he did, for before that time he had been accounted a very honest man. Some time after that my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> did upon a Pique to my Mother, my Lady <hi>Salthill,</hi> set a-foot a Mortgage she pretended to have of the House in St. <hi>Martins lane</hi> for 1500 <hi>l.</hi> from my Father. She did once tell me she had such a Mortgage, as she pretended real, but that it was drowned in a Trunk of Writings coming from <hi>Malmesbury.</hi> Said I, my Mother and Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> will not believe it if you do not let them see it. I am satisfied as to my concern in it, and would not have you proceed in it, for she pretended she did it for my advantage. But afterwards Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> and she did agree to make a Writing, in my sight, of a Mortgage.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Was my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> by when the Writing was made as you say.</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. <hi>Duffett.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>She was by, giving him order how to make it, and what Ink he should use to make it look old, and they forced me to make the Ink, and to fetch Saffron to put in it to make it look old.</p>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Mrs. I would ask you one Question by the way, whether while these things were doing at any time, any body did come in and give you any Interruption?</p>
                  </sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> and my Lady made me oftentimes stand at the Door (for we were but Lodgers) that no one might come and disturb them, and I never remember any that came in thither but one Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> an Attorney, my Lady's Attorney.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Did he see any of this done?</p>

                     <speaker>Mrs. <hi>Duffet.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>I cannot say he helped to do any thing, for when he came in they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sent me out to see that no Body should come upon them; and so what he did I cannot say. But he was let in when Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> was counterfeiting for my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Duffett.</speaker>
                     <p>For the making of the Outsides look Old and Dirty, they used to rub them on Windows that were very Dusty, and wear them in their Pockets to crease them, for some weeks together, according as they intended to make use of them.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, as it happens we have that Deed she talks of, called <hi>Glovers</hi> Lease, here.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Duffett.</speaker>
                     <p>As for this Deed, I cannot swear this is the Deed, there have been so many made by them. But he did counterfeit a Deed that he told me was one <hi>Glovers</hi> Lease.</p>

                     <p>Mrs. you were going on to tell how they did use their Deeds they made. Pray tell us how they used to lay them in the Balcony's, and all you know of the Art.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mrs. Duffett.</speaker>
                     <p>When they had been rubbed upon the Window to make them look Dirty, and they were to pass for Deeds of a great many years standing, it was used to lay them in a Balcony, or any open place for the Rain to come upon them and Wet them, and then the next Sunshine-day they were exposed to the Sun, or a Fire made to dry them hastily, that they might be shrivelled.</p>

                     <p>I have seen my Lady her self write some great Letters of the Names first upon other Papers, which Mr <hi>Duffett</hi> could not so well hit, and he has writ the rest.</p>

                     <p>For my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> I did not know what they were that were-written, but he said they were forged; and with Ink out of these Bottles he said he could make new written Writings look like Old ones very soon.</p>

                     <p>Then may it please your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury, I shall begin to answer their Evidence about the First. They have produced some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Evidence out of many Records to convict our Deeds of Forgery. In truth, if they had not brag'd of this very thing, it had been a shrewd Objection, because we could not have been prepared to have given an answer to what we could not have foreseen, we should have been accused of. But upon their Boasts they have put us upon the search as well as they, and we can give as good an Account of it. They tell you they had their Hint from my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> but that hint has lead them into a great Error, for he is mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken himself in the <hi>Computation</hi> of this Time, as he is in a great many other things.</p>

                     <p>I know he is mistaken, but I depend not upon his Remarks of that time. I said only I had the general Hint about detecting Forgeries from thence.</p>

                     <p>But yet for all your Confidence of the Demonstration, your Foundation fails: For, My Lord, to settle the Fact, we shall shew that the King of <hi>Spain, Charles</hi> V, who was likewise Emperor, resigned his Crown the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> in the 2d and 3d Years of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> It is true, the Parliament Rolls, in the Title of them relating to the first Day of the Session, there the Style that was used at first, could not be altered. But the Fact of their being the King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> was so notorious to all the World, that we shall shew you in Multitudes of the Rolls of that Year the Style was in our Deeds; so that the Use might be various, but that will not prove our Deeds forged. It may be the Courts of Law might not take notice of it, as to alter the Style till <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> though we have not searched so far among them, but the common Conveyances which are upon Record in the Rolls, there it is altered. And as to the time of their becoming King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> we have an History that tells you the very Day when the King resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was the 25th of <hi>October.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>I tell you, Gentlemen, methinks Mr. Attorney has been very fortunate to Day in giving very satisfactory Answers to two Objections: First, they would quite destroy Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>'s Title to this Land, by a piece of Evidence that they had never had but that Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> had bragged of it, and that was the Survey which with much Confidence of the Victory was produced, and yet, when it was so to me, it seemed the stabbingest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Defendants cause had, but that you are to have with you, and must Judge upon it. Now he tells you again, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> has been a Blab of his Tongue, and could not keep the Secret to himself, but must brag that the Deeds were forged, for the Style of the Queen's Reign is changed; and by this bragging they have smoked the Business, and can shew Records for it. But now instead of Records, the Upshot is a little lousy History: Can that be an answer to those great Numbers of Records brought by the other side? Is a printed History, written by I know not who, an Evidence in a Court of Law?</p>

                     <p>I did search in the Rolls, and find many in that Year like these. And my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> is utterly mistaken, he says it was not altered till the 4th and 5th Years of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>

                     <p>Lord, Gentlemen, what do you make of us, to keep us here with I do not know what: Mr. Attorney he tells us that Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was so great a Block-head to brag of this, and so we were prepared for an Answer; but all the Answer is, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> is mistaken, and there are many Records, but we have none of them, <hi>Praemoniti, Praemuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> If he did brag so, and you knew it, and would not bring Records to wipe off the Objection, it is ten times worse than if it had been answered only with the unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>But, my Lord, they have gone a little farther in this Case, and indeed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than becomes them I think, to lay Aspersions upon my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> as if she were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guilty of Forgery. And for that Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> swears that she did pretend she had a mortgage of a House in St. <hi>Martins-lane</hi> for 1500 <hi>l.</hi> and this Mortgage he says he was told of by some that did see it, whereupon he did likewise desire to see it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out seeing of it, he declared he would never be satisfied of the Reality of the thing, and thereupon Mr. Serjeant <hi>West</hi> brought it him, and he saw it, but was not permitted to see the Witnesses Names, and thereupon he was more dissatisfied than before about it. But if Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> had given any the least Intimation of such a thing, now we would have gratified them with a sight of it in Court, where he should have had his full view, for my Lady has it still, and it is a true Mortgage, and for a real Consideration. But he says this is released, and she did that as is supposed to suppress any Inquiry after it. But with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell,</hi> the Fact is otherwise. My Lady <hi>Salthill</hi> pretended to a Debt from my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> for Nine Years Diet for Four Persons, and the Reckoning being made according to my Lady <hi>Ivy's</hi> Quality, was made so high, that it paid off the Mortgage: But he has the Deed still—</p>

                     <p>My Lord, in answer to that we say, he has been pleased to give it a great deal of Garniture, and as he is Master of the Ceremonies to adorn the Story with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Flourishes of his own Kindness and Interests—</p>

                     <p>Mr. Solicitor, you are not to judge of that whether it be Flourish only or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Court and the Jury are the Judges of that, and truly I think it very material to the Cause.

                     <p>So I do, my Lord, as well as I can. The next Witness is this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mrs. <hi>Duffet</hi>; she swears that she saw her Husband, Mr. <hi>Duffett,</hi> counterfeit many Deeds, she does not particularize them: And here have been likewise several Letters read, that did import a Transaction and Correspondence between my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> and him.</p>

                     <p>Pray, Mr. Sollicitor, remember she swears she saw that Lease of <hi>Salthills,</hi> and that called <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, this Witness that swears this, is not only a Person unfit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; but is contradicted by a Record, and for that, my Lord, it stands thus: Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> as is well known, had his Tryal for the matter about which she now swears: For Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> on the behalf of Alderman <hi>Ireton,</hi> undertook to pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Duffett,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure somebody to swear that the Deed called <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease to be forged. Upon this there was an Information exhibited in this Court against Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> for Subornation; and upon full Evidence <hi>Iohnson</hi> was Convicted for his Endeavour. And the Record of that Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we have here, and desire to have produced and read.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>And I tell you, Mr. Solicitor, that is no Evidence in this Case.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, pray, good my Lord? Did not they here just now swear her?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>But the Information put in by Mr. Attorney <hi>Noy,</hi> pray remember, was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be read, because not against any of the Parties, but third Persons.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>But pray, my Lord, give me leave to apply it to the Objection here made in our Case to the Credit of our Deeds. They say it is suspicious, because my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> used to forge Deeds, and particularly <hi>Duffett</hi> they say, did once forge for her <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease. Now to answer that, we come to shew that my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> did not forge <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease, but there was indeed an Art used to persuade <hi>Duffett</hi> to swear it forged, when indeed it was not, for which Trick, <hi>Iohnson,</hi> that was the Agent or Instrument, was convicted, and that Conviction is, I think, a good Evidence that it was not forged.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>None in the World, Mr. Sollicitor, and that from the very Evidence that has been given in this Cause this Day: For it is plain, if you will believe this Woman (and I yet see no cause to the contrary) that she was coming into the Court to have sworn the Truth, which would have perhaps cleared <hi>Iohnson,</hi> but my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> would needs keep
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103513:25"/>
her away. Now if <hi>Duffett</hi> were so great a Rogue as to forge, he would not stick to swear to protect that Forgery; and then how easy a thing was it, had <hi>Iohnson</hi> been the greatest Saint in the World, to have got him convicted upon what <hi>Duffett</hi> came to swear against him, though had she come then in, <hi>Duffett</hi> would have appeared one not at all fit to be credited.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I have then one thing more to offer, I cannot tell indeed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be material, for it seems I have been so unhappy as to offer some things that have not been though material—</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>You have so indeed, Mr. Solicitor, I must speak the Truth, there have been several things offered as Evidence, which in another cause and Place would not I am sure have been offered.</p>

But that which I would say now is this: We have here the Husband's Oath concerning this matter, that this Woman who now takes upon her to swear these Forgeries and things, told him she could have 500 <hi>l.</hi> if she would swear against my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Is that Evidence against the Wife?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sollicitor.</speaker>
                     <p>He is now dead it seems, but here is his Oath.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Pray consider with your self, could the Husband have been a Witness against the Wife about what she told him upon an Information for that Offence of Subornation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>No, my Lord, I think not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Could the Wife be an Evidence against the Husband for the Forgery?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>No, my Lord, she could not; and yet she swears it upon him here.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>That is not against him, Man, he is out of the Case, but against my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>; and how can the Oath of the Husband be Evidence here.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Suppose my Lord, that both Husband and Wife were brought as Evidence against my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> were that good?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly that were very good.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Why then my Lord, one of them says, that she saw such and such things done by Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> and by him for her; and the other says, such things were not done, but she confessed she could have 500 <hi>l.</hi> to swear they were done: Shall not this Evidence be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to contradict the other?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, good Lord, Gentlemen, is the Philosophy of this so witty, that it need be so confidently urged? is it good Logick, that because they both were good Witnesses against my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> therefore either of them is a good Witness against the other? Shall the Husband's Oath be read against the Wife to fix a Crime upon her? Sure you do not intend this should pass for Argument, but to spend time.</p>

                     <p>We are not, now my Lord, examining what <hi>Duffett</hi> swore about Forgery or not Forgery; but is not this Confession of hers an Argument against the Credit of her Testimony, who now says she saw my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> do so and so, when she has confessed she could have Money to swear against my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi>

                     <p>And so you shall, Sir, from the Court, as long as I sit here; and so shall every body else, by the Grace of God. I assure you I care not whether it please or displease: we must not have our time taken up with impertinent things, for I must say there have been as many offered in this Cause to day, as ever were in any Cause that ever I heard, and if all be not as some will have it, then they must be in Passion presently. The Court gives all due Respects, and expects them.</p>

                     <p>It seems then by having this Gentleman so ready, they were aware of this too: I suppose Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> brag'd of this too, or else the guilty Conscience put them upon preparing for it. But yet I think they do us no great harm by it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>You will give our Evidence an Answer I suppose by and by: But we will go on to the rest of yours. As to the Bill and Answer in the Year 1629. In that of <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> it is said, he makes the Bounds Eastward to be <hi>Foxes-lane:</hi> But it is plain, he that gives in that Answer was not acquainted with the Transactions of the Estate before his own time. And if you consider the time of that Answer, there was near Fourscore Years then past since the Lease made, and so long it had been out of the Family render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pepper-corn Rent, and so the profitable Interest was only the Four Acres surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by the Tenant, before the Licence to <hi>Alien.</hi> And it appears not that he had any Notice of the Reversion. But I observe in the Answer there is one Passage remarkable: That there was a way time out of Mind that did part his Land and that which was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Dean and Chapters Land. Now that doth not tie it up to make <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> that same way; but only says generally there was an old way which must be understood of the way down from <hi>Cock-hill</hi> to <hi>Bell-wharf:</hi> So that I take it that is no conclusion upon us. Nor upon the same Ground is that Lease made 13 <hi>Iacobi</hi> by <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> where he abutts his Land upon that Wall which is called <hi>Wall-marsh-wall,</hi> and covenants to have the Rent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, if any thing beyond that be recovered. For there was near Threescore Years to come then of this Lease, and he had no pretence of Title to contest it at that time, and so the Verdicts are all answered that way, the Lease expired not till the Year 1680.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Then, my Lord, for the Survey that they produce of the late times by Order of the Committee of Parliament for Sale of Church-lands; how that should give a Title, I do not understand. It is the first time I ever heard of a Particular of Dean and Chapters Lands to be an Evidence, when at that time there was no Dean and Chapter. But that which is a clear Answer to it is this; <hi>Winterburn,</hi> who had the Lease from the Church did also claim under <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> who had a Lease for Ninety Years: That in time expired in the Year 1640. That Interest being then determined he gets these put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Survey (which it was his interest to do) as the Inheritance of the Church, which would gain him a Fee Simple upon his Purchase, he concealing the long Lease, and they being so long in Possession, whereas otherwise he could only have an Estate for Years: and it appears all the Deeds were in his Custody at that time; For the other Witnesses that speak to the Wall that we must leave to the Juries Consideration upon the Ballance of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: For, with Submission, my Lord, taking the Evidence as it stands together, if that Lease of <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> be a good Lease, these several Conveyances we produce are support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and do explain that: He surrenders four Acres, which are the Lands that are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conveyed to <hi>Fox,</hi> which is mentioned in the deed of his Surrender to be the Green Hilly Bank, and that was the Boundary of the four Acres, but what becomes of the other seven Acres and an half, they have given no account of it hitherto. But surely, my Lord, upon that first Survey, I take it, there is a strong Evidence concurring with our Assertion, for that saith, the South Boundary of the Dean's <hi>Lynches</hi> is Wall Marsh, now then, if there be seven Acres to go forward from thence, that just reacheth up to <hi>Cock-hill.</hi> And all the other Bounds plainly concur with ours; and upon the perusal of the Survey which it is consented to on both sides, the Jury shall have with them, I believe they will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied our Bounds and that agree. Upon the whole Evidence I submit it for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. We have done, my Lord.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>Only I would ask Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> a Question; whether the Bill and Answer now given in Evidence, were not given in in Evidence at the last Tryal.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sutton.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, it was.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet the Verdict went for us then, as I hope it will now.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Have you all done, Gentlemen? Will you say any thing for the Plaintiff?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>No my Lord, we leave it to your Lordship and the Jury.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Then Gentlemen of the Jury, This Evidence has been very long; I think the Tryal has held us as long as any Cause that ever happened in <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> of this Nature; I mean, except one, this many Years. I think we met with but one in all our Books, that held near so long: That indeed was rather something longer, the famous Cause of <hi>Colt</hi> in this Court, but besides that, I never heard of a Cause of this length before.</p>
                     <p>But, Gentlemen, it is a Cause of Value, and a Cause of great Weight and Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it hath depended in the Evidence of it upon abundance of Circumstances, so that it may be impossible for me to remember all the Evidence that has been given. But as neat
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103513:26"/>
as I can I will give you what Assistance I am able, in recollecting what has been said on both sides. Some of you I have observed have taken Notes, and that will save me and you some trouble; I will give you a Scheme fairly of that which is the Question. And it will be very much more ease to you, because you have had a View of the Matter, than can be thought I can make it by any Direction of mine.</p>
                     <p>The Question in short is, Whether seven Acres and an half of Land, now built upon to a very great value, as the Witnesses say 2000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, lying on the East-side of the Lane that is called by the name of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Lane, betwixt that and the Mill, called <hi>Ratcliff Mill,</hi> be part of the Marsh that formerly belonged to the Family of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s; or whether or no that be not part of the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls</hi> Inheritance. If it belong to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls,</hi> then the Issue is with the Lessor of the Plaintiff; but if it be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, and part of the Marsh-land, and was so according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent boundaries, then the Issue is with the Defendant.</p>
                     <p>The Plaintiff comes and shews for his Title. <hi>First,</hi> That this was all along enjoyed under the Church of <hi>Pauls</hi> Leases. <hi>Knowles</hi> who formerly did receive the Rents of the very thing in Question till (77) before this Question, says, in his Testimony, he received them in the Right, and on the behalf of Mr. <hi>Neal,</hi> who claims by Lease from the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That is not sufficient to maintain his Title, but they come and shew the Original, and in point of time 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they say that one Dean <hi>Collett</hi> made a Lease of the Lands in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for 45 years. And to prove this, a Book is produced to you, wherein there is a short Entry made which takes no notice at all of any thing more, but that there was such a Lease of a Mill in <hi>Shadwell</hi> with the appurtenances. But upon their producing that Writing, it is found to be a Paper Writing, and there was an Objection, and a material one, made upon the Face of the Thing it self. For there were two places that seemed to be suspicious as made directly to humour an Evidence of such a Lease in 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. having Dr. <hi>Collett</hi>'s name inserted, who hapned to be Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> at that time: Whereas <hi>Nowell</hi> was originally the Name that was set there, with the same hand that the other part of the Writing was. Thereupon it came to be enquired into, how it came to pass that <hi>Nowels</hi> Name was struck out and <hi>Collets</hi> put in. That seemed to insinuate, as if this was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on purpose to shoar up an Evidence, and humour the time. For it could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that <hi>Nowell</hi> should come to be Dean when that Lease was made, who was not Dean till so long after, in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time as I take it. Now had this Objection met with this Book alone, it would have made the Evidence Lame, and they would have been thought to have set an ill Leg forwards. But to take off that, they come after and shew a Parchment Scrole, which takes notice likewise of such a Lease: And their Officer <hi>Spencer</hi> says he had seen that Scrole many years, and so it could not be a new thing for this purpose. It is an old Rental, or some such thing, in time in some short time after, where is mention made of a Lease by Dean <hi>Collett,</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for 45 Years, which humours the time exactly, and supports the Credit of the other Evidence. This is that they give as an Answer to that Objection. It might be a mistake as to the Name, but this will shew that it was not a contrived matter for this purpose.</p>
                     <p>The next Peice of Evidence they go to is 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. and for that time they come and produce Leases, those that are at least in Law evidences of Leases, and those are the Church Books, Ancient Books that have been always read and allowed for Evidence. And thereby they shew that one Dr. <hi>May,</hi> then Dean of St. <hi>Pauls, viz.</hi> 23 <hi>Feb.</hi> 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. did let the Lands in Question to <hi>Ioan Hall</hi> and <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> and he let it as the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Lands for 45 years at the Rent of 10 <hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
                     <p>Then they tell you in the 2d and 3d of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> 10 <hi>December,</hi> one <hi>Deane Fecknam</hi> takes notice of the former Leases, and lets it to <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi>; and that is for 90 years, wherein there is the Old Rent taken notice of, and some Increase made: And there is in that Lease a Covenant to repair the Mill, and that has given a Rise to something that makes part of the present Question, which they that are for the Defendant call a License to remove the Mill. You Gentlemen will have the Deeds with you, and are to judge of them.</p>
                     <p>The Leases from 5 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to this Dean <hi>Fecknam,</hi> are only Leases made for years, and by reason of these Leases for Years, and the long Lease which they pretend to, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants Counsel insist upon it, that they could not be let in to controvert the Plaintiffs Title, for the last Lease for 128 years from <hi>Stepkins</hi> to <hi>Hall,</hi> expired in time but in the Year 1680.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:103513:27"/>Now say the Plaintiffs Counsel (and they produce that which is very material in the Case) 5 <hi>Aug.</hi> 1636. This was then let to one <hi>Mary More,</hi> the Relict of one <hi>Adrian More,</hi> formerly the Assignee of the Lease that came from Dean <hi>Fecknam</hi> to <hi>Marcellus Hall.</hi> And there instead of continuing it a Lease for Years, he lets to <hi>Mary Moor,</hi> in consideration of the former Leases, and turns it into an Estate for three Lives. So far then was the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> from apprehending himself to be but Lessee for Years, that he takes upon him to create Freeholds, which only he that has the Inheritance can do.</p>
                     <p>They go on further, and tell you, That in 1640. the same Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sold her Interest to one <hi>Whitwick</hi> and <hi>Winterburn,</hi> there is a new Estate made to them for three Lives. These continue in Possession under that Lease, till Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> purchased in their Interest; and his Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Dean <hi>Sandcroft,</hi> he made another Lease to the said Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> for three Lives, and there is a great Increase of Rent, 80 <hi>l.</hi> during the Life of one of the former Surviving Lives, and then to 100 <hi>l.</hi> Then comes the Lease made to the now Lessors of the Plaintiff by this Reverend Divine that is here, now Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> the present Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> at yearly 240 <hi>l.</hi> And this is the substance of the Evidence first given by the Plaintiff: For his Title which is underneath that last Lease of Dean <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> which they say is a good Title; and in case it doth appear that the Lands are the Inheritance of the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> 'it is not controverted by the Defendants, but that the Plaintiff must have a Verdict for him.</p>
                     <p>But say they which are for the Defendants, this is not their Inheritance, but the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; and to prove their Objection, they produce abundance of Deeds, of which, as well as I can, I will give you a punctual and particular account. For with all the faith and fidelity I can, I will give you the Substance of what has been said on both sides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It is not to be doubted, for it is beyond all Contradiction plain, there were 130 Acres of Marsh-land, Lands covered with Water, which one <hi>Vander-Delf,</hi> a Dutchman, undertook to Drain, and had an Act of Parliament made <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to encourage him for his endeavours to drain it, giving him the one half. That Act of Parliament is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and it is there said to be 130 Acres.</p>
                     <p>Now you are to take notice of the boundaries of this Marsh-land, as making the state of this Question. The Act of Parliament bounds the Marsh upon the <hi>Hermitage,</hi> or such a Mill, called <hi>Grash-Mill,</hi> upon the <hi>West.</hi> It is bounded on the High-way, leading to <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff,</hi> on the <hi>North,</hi> which is called <hi>Ratcliff</hi> High-way to this day; it is bounded to the River of <hi>Thames</hi> on the <hi>South,</hi> and it is bounded upon the Town of <hi>Ratcliff</hi> towards the <hi>East.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards in <hi>H.</hi> 8<hi>ths</hi> time comes in <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> who was owner of some part of this Marsh (<hi>Vander-Delfs</hi> moiety) and he in time 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. became indebted to one <hi>Salvago</hi> and another, and there he comes and acknowledges a Statute to them for their Debt. And because I would have you have all things before your view that were done at one time) in the same Year there is a Mortgage made of the Lands of <hi>Richard Hill</hi> (among which they for the Defendant apprehend are comprized the Lands in Question (as Marsh-land) to <hi>Salvago</hi> for the payment of their mony:) and in that Mortgage the same words are made use of for the boundaries, as are in the Draining Act. This to derive their Title, they produce to shew, that there was such an Ownership, and such a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
                     <p>Then they tell you that 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the same <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> he goes and divides some part of these Lands, that is to say Eleaven Acres and a half, and that he conveys away by Lease for 34 years to <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> whom I name the more particularly, because it is a Name that has been much canvassed, and gives a Countenance to the Title on both sides. Now in that Deed whereby this is thus conveyed to <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> there is no notice taken particularly of the Eastern boundary to be the Mill, or the Mill-bank, or the Hilly-bank. Now say they, the Mill was just upon the Point, hard by that place that is called now by the name of <hi>Cockhill,</hi> and so that Boundary doth take in the thing in Question, the seven Acres and an half, because that Deed takes notice of the Mill Hilly-bank or Way.</p>
                     <p>In the next place they offer you this for Evidence, that in 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. the same <hi>Richard Hill</hi> for 130 <hi>l.</hi> sells his Land to <hi>Thomas Stepkins.</hi> And when it comes to convey the Inheritance to him, it is laid to be under the same boundaries, as are mentioned there bounded on the Hilly-bank or Mill-bank Eastward. Now, say they, that sheweth plainly, that still the Mill was the thing that was intended to the Boundary; and there being seven Acres and an half of Land between the Mill and the Western bounds, those seven Acres cannot be construed to extend to a Mill with the Appurtenances, but rather it is to bound upon the Mill and include the Lands, then to have the Lands go with the Mill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:103513:27"/>They proceed further and say, that <hi>Tomas Stepkins</hi> the same Year did for 50 <hi>l.</hi> let this to <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> for 128 years at a Pepper-corn Rent, which Lease expired but in 1680. and till now we could not come to litigate that Matter, because he had made such a Lease. But then I am to take notice by the Way, and so must you into the Bargain; there is another boundary made there, abutting on the Well there, called <hi>Shadwell,</hi> and the way leading from <hi>Shadwell</hi> to the <hi>Lynches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this they come to tell you further, that <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> 22 <hi>December,</hi> 2 and 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> let a Lease to <hi>Carter,</hi> and that was for 20 Years. Now you are to take notice that in this Lease of <hi>Carters,</hi> there is notice taken of a Mill, and about an Acre of Land thereto belonging, very carefully put in. And that say, they sheweth that your Boundary could not extend to so much as seven Acres.</p>
                     <p>And to back that Evidence, they shew you a certain Survey, taken in Queen <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth</hi>'s time, concerning the Mannor of <hi>Stepney,</hi> which you are by consent to have with you, and you will do well to consider it well in your Perusal of it.</p>
                     <p>And now comes the main Deed. Say the Defendants Counsel, it falls out that you are but Lessee under <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> who was Lessee under us, and was obliged in a particular Covenant, that he should not let any part of this Land without the License of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor <hi>Stepkins,</hi> who made him such a long Lease. But it hapned he had a mind to let some part of this Land to the Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> from whom he had a Lease of the Mill. And accordingly he had a License from <hi>Stepkins</hi> so to do, which, say they, is the reason why they come to lay claim to our Land. This they take notice to be in time, 16 <hi>Nov.</hi> 2 and 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> When I must tell you by the Way, that the first Lease pretended by them to be made to <hi>Marcellus Hall,</hi> is the long one, 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. by <hi>Thomas Stepkins</hi>; so that <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> came to be Lessee under the Dean and Chapter, before he had any Authority or Interest from <hi>Stepkins,</hi> nay before he had any <hi>Lease</hi> from <hi>Hill.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, if your Lordship pleases to remember, <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> did take first by Lease from <hi>Richard Hill</hi> in 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>Pardon me, Mr. Attorney, I did not Misrepeat it; I say he first had a Lease from the Dean and Chapter.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>M. <hi>Att. Gen.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That was of the Mill only—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>That is contented, and the very gist of the Question, Mr. Attorney, how much is comprehended in that Lease?</p>
                     <p>But to go on with the Defendants Evidence. Then in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 2 and 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> is the Deed to <hi>Roper,</hi> of which I shall have occasion to say more anon.</p>
                     <p>In 5 and 6 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> comes <hi>Iasper Hill,</hi> the Son of <hi>Richard Hill</hi> (the first Owner of the Land, and that entred into the Statute to <hi>Salvago,</hi>) he makes a Conveyance to <hi>Macheline Stepkin, Thomas</hi>'s his Widow and <hi>Iohn Stepkin</hi> his Heir, Mother and Son; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which afterwards there is a Surrender made by <hi>Marcellus Hall</hi> to <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> Son and Heir of <hi>Thomas,</hi> of four Acres, which, say they, was not assigned with the other seven to the Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then in 3 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> pursuant to the Conveyance made by <hi>Iasper Hill</hi> to the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, there is a Fine and Recovery suffer'd, and 4 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Deed to lead the Uses of that Fine which are to <hi>Iohn Stepkin,</hi> and his Mother, and the Heirs of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But still in all these Deeds and Conveyances, there is mention made of the Mill, Mill-bank, or Hilly-bank, or Hilly-way, to be the boundaries, and likewise of <hi>Shadwell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that they produce a Bond, wherein <hi>Spinola</hi> is bound to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> to take off the Statute entred into the 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by <hi>Richard Hall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then 14 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they produce a Commission of Sewers, where notice is taken of the several Landholders of <hi>Wapping-Marsh,</hi> who were liable to make satisfaction for any want of Repairs or defects in the Marsh. There <hi>Roper</hi> is taken notice of as a Tenant, and one <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Stepkins</hi> too: and they do infer from hence, that <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Ropers</hi> Land is part of this, and was under <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and is enjoyed to this day under the Title of the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>They go on further, and tell you, that 15 <hi>Elizabeth, Stepkins</hi> became indebted to the Crown by taking a Tellers Debt upon him, and had a mind to secure the Debt, and therefore conveys his Land to the then Treasurer, Attorney General and Soliciter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to secure a great Sum of Mony, and this Land they would have to pass among the Rest.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, 17 <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Commissioners sit again, and there is a Return made of all those that were Landholders, the same named before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103513:28"/>Then 7 <hi>Iacobi,</hi> was there a Re-grant out of the Crown, made to <hi>Sepkins</hi> of all his Land. Wherein generally speaking the Bounds of the Land belonging to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> are called the <hi>Mill-bank,</hi> &amp;c. This must, say they, of necessity take in the Lands in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, otherwise it is impossible that should be the Boundary. And they make use of this further Argument; say they, We have taken a Survey of all the Lands, those in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the other Marsh-lands, from <hi>Hermitage-dock, alias</hi> St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> even to this Mill; and it doth just humour the Number of Acres in the Act for draining <hi>Wapping-marsh,</hi> that is to say, it makes just 130 Acres. All which they say plainly belongs to the <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>Thy then come to examine their Living Witnesses, and they have produced them in this Order as I name them. Their Witnesses have been as they are in my Paper. One <hi>Hughs,</hi> and <hi>Somerley,</hi> and <hi>Holmes,</hi> and <hi>Barefoot,</hi> and <hi>Cope,</hi> and <hi>Holwell.</hi> And the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what they say is this: The Old Woman <hi>Barefoot</hi> says, she has known the place in Question this threescore and odd Years; she remembers well the Scituation of it, and that the Water drove another Mill first, and did not come near to <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> by a Quarter of a Mile, but run more to the <hi>North.</hi> And this Land, she says, was always reckoned to be <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s, and she never knew any one have any thing to do there but they. And in as much as there was some discourse concerning a Well, she says she doth remember there was a Well between <hi>Foxes-lane</hi> and the Mill, and that was half a Mile off <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> and was always called <hi>Shadwell.</hi> She remembers it so well, that if there were as many Wells as there are Pains in the Glass Window before you, that was the right Well, and there was no other, Well called <hi>Shadwell,</hi> but that.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Hughs</hi> tells you, he remembred the Land before it was built upon, that at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ordinary Tides, the Water used to come up to <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> and at High-tides over it; but the Land has been raised much higher since that.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Cope,</hi> he gives an account of his knowing it above threescore Years ago, and he in general says, he did not know how far Westward the Water went that drove the Mill; but <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> he says, was the way from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South,</hi> westward of the Mill, and he knew not any way Eastward of the Mill but <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> for <hi>Cockhill</hi> is Eastward of the Mill. And much like to this was the Testimony of the other Witnesses; which being done, they concluded with the Evidence of the Surveyor <hi>Holwell,</hi> about the admeasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this, as I remember or can collect, is the Substance of the Defendants Evidence before the Plaintiffs Reply.</p>
                     <p>And then as to that which was offered by the Defendants, as Evidence of the Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Plaintiffs give this Answer; and it is that which will be the Pinching Question in this Cause to all Eternity; whether or no, Mill-bank, or Mill-hill, or the Hilly-way, or whatsoever else it is called in their Old Deeds, be not that which is now called <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Say they, <hi>First,</hi> by your own Evidence, that same Ancient Survey that you produced, and which, by Consent, you Gentlemen of the Jury are to have with you; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of 130 Acres that belongs to the Marsh, there is notice taken of <hi>Lynches,</hi> as belonging to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls.</hi> But then in the last Paragraph of the Back-side of the Leaf (so we call the second side, for distinction sake) you will find this taken notice of; Which said Marsh doth bound on the Lands hereafter mentioned on the <hi>East.</hi> And what are the Lands thereafter mentioned. These you will find, <hi>Item.</hi> holden by the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls,</hi> one Messuage called <hi>Derrick hills,</hi> another Tenement called so and so, and several Orchards, Gardens and Ponds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a Water-mill thereunto belonging. So that there was on the East-part of the Marsh-Land, Orchards, Gardens, a Messuage, a Tenement, Waters, Ponds, Fishings, and a Mill, and several other things. Now if in case the Eastern Boundaries of the Marsh came up to the Mill you speak of, how comes it to pass, that you your self in your own Survey, make the Eastern bounds to be upon these Lands, and all these belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls.</hi> And when they come to read the Particulars of what belonged to the Dean and Chapter, that Survey bounds to the Dean and Chapters Land upon the Marsh-land. You that have been upon the View may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; and you see the Eastern part of the Mill was the Wast-ground, and made a Lane to carry down Ballast, as the Witnesses say. This doth just humour all the Old Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries.</p>
                     <p>Nay to shew that this is really so, they say, That in time, in the Year 1615. there was an Action commenced before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Coke,</hi> when he fate in this Court, wherein this Controversie arose. <hi>Fox,</hi> who was as well Tenant to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls,</hi> as he was to <hi>Stepkins,</hi> he comes, and he builds upon that old Wall, called
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103513:28"/>
                        <hi>Wall marsh-wall,</hi> which begot a Contest betwixt <hi>Stepkins</hi> who was the Ancestor of my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> and this <hi>Fox,</hi> and upon that Contest this was the Question, Whether there had been any Incroachment upon the Marsh? Not but that the Wall was reckoned even by <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> to be the Boundary, though running as <hi>Stepkins</hi> said, Twenty Foot into the East part of the Marsh; and there <hi>Stepkins</hi> was nonsuited. Afterwards it came into the Common-Pleas, and there there was a Verdict whereby it was setled that the whole Wall belonged to the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Pauls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But afterwards Mrs. <hi>Moor,</hi> the Lessee of the Church would not be quiet with this, but exhibits a Bill against <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> and others, and to settle the Boundaries, because he pretended Incroachments upon his ground. They therefore require him to ascertain the matter upon his Oath. He in his Answer confesseth he had heard of the Verdict before-mentioned, but knew nothing of it himself, but when he comes to set forth the Boundaries, he is so far from taking Notice that the Boundaries take in the Lands in question, that he tells you there was an ancient Bank which was the ordinary Bounds between his Land and the Land of the Church; and this is a High-way, a common High-way. But it was true as he believed they had incroached, though such a Verdict and Nonsuit were obtained by them. Not that ever he pretended to any thing on the Eastern part of that Passage or Bank (called <hi>Foxes-lane</hi>) but he pretended to Twenty Foot on the Western Part of it as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment.</p>
                     <p>They say further too, that notwithstanding all this, <hi>Iohn Stepkins</hi> was not so confident of his Title to even those Twenty Foot on the West part, but that he comes and makes a Bargain with another Man, I will lett you this East part of the Marsh-land, and if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any of the Wall you shall pay such a Rent for it; but if not, you shall hold it as you did before. So jealous he was of his Title, even to that which he thought was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon.</p>
                     <p>And they fix it thus to humour and explain the Particulars mentioned of Orchards, Ponds, Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for here were a great many Sluces and Cutts for the Water to be received in, and so all may well be comprehended under the Name of a Mill with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances, and that they say goeth a great way in the Question. You are to consider of it, Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>Then they further shew, that whereas the other side surmise the Boundary to be <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> which they would have to be placed a great way higher, by the place called <hi>Cock-hill</hi>; here comes an Old Man that tells you he knew the place Sixty Years ago and above, and there was no other Well called <hi>Shadwell,</hi> but that which was where now the Church stands, and that is on the West part of <hi>Foxes-lane.</hi> Now I must tell you upon the Evidence it is pretty strong, because he gives such an account of it that it was bricked over, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Well to all People, which must make the thing very notorious; and he never heard of any other Well called <hi>Shadwell.</hi> It is true there might be a Spring on the one side of this Ground in Question, and the other, you have heard the Evidence on both sides, I must leave it at large to you.</p>
                     <p>Then to make the thing more plain, they offer to you that this was a Tide-mill, and not as the Defendant pretends an Overshot-mill; and that is notoriously plain it is so, and it is against Sense it should be otherwise. Here was one that wrought at the Mill, and his Father before him Sixty Years: Nay, it appears that to have Water to drive an Overshot-Mill in that Place must drown the whole Level, because it must be raised so much higher than the Wheel; and if so, that stands higer than the place, were it raised never so high, of late called <hi>Foxes lane.</hi> But there were Tides that came within Twenty Foot of it. And you must give me leave to tell you, I understand so much of it, that a Tide-mill is never suffered to have the Water just swim up and back again, but they have Cutts to retain the Water a while that it may go the easier off. And so the great Number and length of the Cutts, and Ponds, and Ditches here, were but only Receptacles, and Basins to receive the Tide, which did not rise (as they tell you it should not) above half the Wheel. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it self speaks against what they would have it to be; and to strengthen the Argument, they have called Five or Six, or more Witnesses that have known it all along so to be: And yet this I apprehend the other side take to be their most material Point to make it Marsh-ground.</p>
                     <p>But the Council for the Plaintiff say this further to you; They have a Survey taken in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Time, which they produced, but were opposed by the Council of the other side, and I must confess I did wonder to hear the Objection, that it was strange this should be surveyed as Dean and Chapters Lands, in a time when there were no Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whereas it was surveyed as that which was so, while there were such things as Deans
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103513:29"/>
and Chapters, and it was in order to be sold as such. And upon my Word, if the Lands of the Dean and Chapters Inheritance were no bigger than the Defendant would have them there was a good round Summ paid to the State for the Mill only, but alas, you have a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that tells you (there being in the Survey mention of one <hi>Craven</hi>) that there was a <hi>Craven</hi> on the East part of the Ground, that had a large Orchard and Garden, and Ground. And upon this Purchase made by <hi>Winterburn,</hi> who was Lessee of the Church, the Plaintiffs Council do raise a very considerable Argument that this was the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: For, say they, Why should <hi>Winterburn</hi> that a Lease in being which would have continued him to be sure in Possession, and that too before all these Houses were built, (for they talk all the fine Houses were built since the King came in) give 9500 <hi>l.</hi> for the Inheritance under the Title of the Dean and Chapter if he knew (as he must if he had the long Lease in his Possession (and so <hi>Knowles</hi> swears he had) it was not theirs, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had a Lease for Thirty Years, to come under a trivial Rent of a Pepper Corn. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially considering that those times sold lumping Penny-worths of other Peoples Lands.</p>
                     <p>But then they come to the last point of Evidence, and that you must very narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and weigh. Say they because you depend so much upon <hi>Carter</hi>'s Lease which takes notice of such and such Boundaries, and also that of <hi>Roper,</hi> which you pretend to be made at such a time, these we say are forged. And for it they give this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                     <p>The first part is a natural legal Evidence and a proper Evidence in things of this Nature, to detect a Forgery; an Evidence that we learn out of our Books of Law; and it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative one. If you produce Deeds made in such a time, when say you such Titles were used, and such Prefaces made to them in their Preambles, when indeed there were no such Titles used at that time, that sheweth your Deeds are counterfeit, and Forged, and not true Deeds. And there is <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> the Finger of God in it, that though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign be laid deep, and the Contrivance sculk, yet Truth and Justice will appear one time or another; and though they may put some Gull upon Justice for a while, yet it will in time be discovered to the Confusion and Shame of the Undertakers. Say they, you have taken wonderful Care to have both Deeds carry the same Flourish at the top of each of them, you call <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and both <hi>Sicilies,</hi> and you put <hi>Burgundy</hi> in the Ducal Style before <hi>Millain,</hi> this is the Language of both Deeds, but that sheweth them not to be true Deeds that carrieth Forgery in the very Face of it; for <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> never came to write themselves King and Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> till <hi>Trinity-Term,</hi> in the Second and Third Years of their Reigns; whereas your Deeds bear Date in <hi>November</hi> before. Till <hi>Trinity-Term Naples</hi> was a Kingdom, and they were but Princes of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> And besides, they used always before that time to put <hi>Millain</hi> among the Dukedoms first before <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Instances and Proofs of this Objection, they shew you the Titles of the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in that Year, in <hi>October, November,</hi> and <hi>December</hi>; they shew you the Fines le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in <hi>Hillary-Term,</hi> and <hi>Easter-Term,</hi> and <hi>Trinity-Term</hi>; till which Term the Records of the Kingdom of Fines and Recoveries bore all the old Style, and so do the Conveyances enrolled and not enrolled of that time. And with great Bravery they challenge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Council to shew any one Conveyance or Record (except those of your own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) that is otherwise. And as a further Evidence they say; we have some Leases entred in our Books, and so not calculated for this purpose, which have no other than the Old Style of the King and Queen.</p>
                     <p>And in truth this is a material Evidence to prove these to be forged Deeds: and it is made the more material by this Circumstance which Mr. Attorney was pleased to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is the Notice they had from Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>'s bragging of this very Objection to their Deeds, and yet they should not come prepared to give it an Answer. And I must deal plainly with you, that very one thing makes it an Objection of very great Weight and Moment.</p>
                     <p>But still, say they, besides all this Evidence we shall go a step further, and evince the likelihood that these Deeds should be forged, for your Client, the Defendant is apt to forge Deeds. And to prove that we produce this Evidence.</p>
                     <p>First of all, Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> gives you an account of a long Story which doth not only reach the Defendant, my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> but it looks very bad upon my Friend <hi>Sutton</hi> too, who, if Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi> swears true, is a very Knave. Now Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel,</hi> though he does not swear he saw her Forge the Mortgage she pretended to from Sir <hi>William Salthill,</hi> yet he gives a shrewd Evidence to make it untowardly suspicious: For he tells you upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103513:29"/>
Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Death, my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> was so far from pretending to any Debt from Sir <hi>William,</hi> that upon Accounts stated between my Lady and her, she was indebted to Sir <hi>William</hi> 96 <hi>l.</hi> which upon her parting from her Husband, and being under great Want, Sir <hi>William</hi> had lent her, besides his relieving her otherways: And, says Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell,</hi> I was present when she took 4 <hi>l.</hi> more of my Lady <hi>Salthill's</hi> Money, and then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged her self to owe my Lady 100 <hi>l.</hi> After this, my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> without the seeking or intreaty of Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell,</hi> comes to him, and, says she, Does not my Lady <hi>Salthill</hi> owe you Money? Yes; said he, she does fourscore Pound; but I live in her House, and can soon eat it out in Rent. But, says my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> she has a mind you should have the House made as a Security to you. Good now how comes my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> to be so concerned for Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi>'s Security, when he was not concerned for himself: Nay, and why should she be so earnest to have him have a Security upon that House, which if it were true, was Mortgaged before to her self. If her Mortgage were a true one, this Practice carrieth no great Face of Honesty or Vertue in it, I must needs say, I crave leave to make that Observation by the way. Ay, but into the Bargain, when Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Importunities, Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> is the Man that must be intrusted to draw the Writing, and to that purpose must see my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Lease, who is the Head Landlord. What needed that? I suppose it was recited in my Lady <hi>Ivy's</hi> Mortgage before: But he must take Notes out of it, forsooth, to make over the Lease and House as a Security to Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> for 80 <hi>l.</hi> And when it is brought as such, knowing no otherwise, Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> takes it, and they two, my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> and <hi>Sutton</hi> are Witnesses to it. What it proved afterwards you hear, an absolute Deed of Sale, and yet all this while, my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> (who as Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> understood it, was indebted an 100 <hi>l.</hi> to Sir <hi>William Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill</hi>) has a Debt of 1500 <hi>l.</hi> owing from Sir <hi>William</hi> by Mortgage to her on the same House.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir. <hi>Charles Cotterell.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>My Lord, I am ready to make it all good.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. C. I.</speaker>
                     <p>First of all, I say, it was not well done if there were such a Security for 1500 <hi>l.</hi> to persuade Sir <hi>Charles</hi> to accept the House as a Security for his Fourscore Pound, without telling him of the Prior Mortgage. Then it is strange she should acknowledge her self indebted 100 <hi>l.</hi> upon her taking the Four Pounds from my Lady <hi>Salthill,</hi> if she had so great a Summ owing her. And what a slovenly Answer is that given by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil for my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> that she and others were called upon for Nine Years Diet? Whereas Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> swears she owned her self upon the Account indebted 100 <hi>l.</hi> and there was no bartering for Diet; but that she had <hi>gratis</hi> for Three Quarters of a Year after Sir <hi>William</hi>'s Death, as she had it several times before.</p>
                     <p>And now, while it is in my Memory, I would remind you of one thing more, before we come to the other Witnesses, there is a thing that to me cramps this Business very home upon my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>: How comes it to pass my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> should be so wonderful kind to my Lady <hi>Salthill's</hi> Daughter, as to part with 1500 <hi>l.</hi> so secured, to have the House setled upon her, without any Consideration in the World that I can hear of? That is such a melting piece of Kindness, that they would do well to find out some Flame to authorize it. It seems upon Sir <hi>Charles Cotterel</hi>'s desire to see this pretended Mortgage, and its being brought him by my Brother <hi>West,</hi> who is now dead, she was wonderful careful that he should not see the Witnesses to it, it was so precious and tender a thing: But, alas, it is all melted down and gone of a sudden without any Consideration at all whatsoever, and she can readily join with Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> to settle this upon Mrs. <hi>Duffett,</hi> the Lady <hi>Salthill</hi>'s Daughter, and enter into Bond not to disturb the Enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Then there comes another Evidence, and that is the Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>Duffett,</hi> who it seems they would have to be a loose sort of Creature, but methinks she has a good round Oath upon her Tongue; for she does directly swear that she was present, and saw Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi> her Husband Forge that very Mortgage Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> speaks of, that my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> directed it, and gave her order to put Saffron in the Ink to make it look old, that she saw him writing in a Parchment, which he told her was <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease, and other things, and all for my Lady <hi>Ivy.</hi> Nay, she tells you my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> was so extraordinary an Artist at the managing of such an Affair, that this Master-Workman, <hi>Duffett,</hi> was not so dextrous at it as she; for he could not write the first great Letters of the Names that were to be put to the Forged Deeds, but she did that her self, and the rest he did. How far she is to be believed, I must leave to you, you hear what is objected against her about the Frog in her Belly, and I do not know what, whither that will take off the Credibility of her Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103513:30"/>
I leave to you. She doth give a very free and large Account how they used to order their Matters to make the Ink look Old (as I said) they put Saffron in it; Then they rub'd the Outsides of the Deeds in Dirty Windows, and after that used to lay them in a Balcony for the Rain to come upon them in the Nights, and to dry them in the Sun, or by the Fire, to shrivel them up. And this she says was their Method and Process they used. All which the Plaintiffs Counsel urge to shew the Probability that these Deeds of theirs are forged.</p>
                     <p>Then they tell you, which is yet somewhat more to strengthen her Evidence, there is a Woman, that tho' she speaks out of Mr. <hi>Duffett</hi>'s Mouth, and that can be no Evidence against my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> yet says, she received from him a Parcel of Letters, which are sworn by Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell</hi> to be all of my Lady <hi>Ivies</hi> own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, which Letters have been read to you, and they shew a great familiarity between my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Duffett,</hi> a great Care and Concern for the promotion of this <hi>Duffett,</hi> the Gentlewomans Husband, and of some Deeds that were likely to be thought New and Suspected: and she tells him at the latter end of one, that she is sollicitous till the trouble be over. But she was resolved to set on foot Sir <hi>William Salthill</hi>'s Mortgage, and if that thing did go well he should have half.</p>
                     <p>That supports the Credibility of the Womans Testimony, but besides that there is another thing that looks very untoward, because Mrs. <hi>Duffett</hi> doth directly swear that out of the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> paid my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> by Sir <hi>Charles Cotterell,</hi> 200 <hi>l.</hi> was paid and given to her Husband, and Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> forsooth had 200 <hi>l.</hi> more: For what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I wonder, must my Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> be so liberal to Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Duffet?</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> shuffle and rouze himself as he pleaseth, it will stick upon him, and I must confess it looks untowardly his getting my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Lease, to pick Notes out of it, and then to have such a Mortgage trumped up in this manner. It is very rank, I assure you.</p>
                     <p>This is the Substance of the Evidence that has been offered by the Plaintiff, to prove and induce you to believe these Deeds forged.</p>
                     <p>Now in Answer to this, they on the other side would offer that Sir <hi>Charles Cotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi>'s Evidence is a surprize upon them; they say they have such a Writing, and such and such Deeds, <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease and <hi>Salthill's</hi> Mortgage, but they are not prepared to give such an Answer as they would have done, had they had notice. Here has been likewise great struggling and striving to have the Verdict read to overthrow Mrs. <hi>Duffetts</hi> Testimony, but that cannot be allowed to be given in Evidence between these parties. Then they would have read her Husbands Oath, he being Dead: but that is no point of Evidence at all neither; for in case the Man were alive, it would not be Evidence what he should have heard his own Wife say. If both of them indeed had been here together, and testified against my Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> it had been good Evidence, or they both might have testified for her. But by the Law the Husband cannot be a Witness against his Wife, nor a Wife against her Husband, to charge them with any thing Criminal, except only in Cases of High Treason. This is so known a Common Rule, that I thought it could never have born any Question or Debate.</p>
                     <p>This is the Substance of the Evidence on both sides, as near as I can recollect it; save only that which indeed I should have mentioned before the Defendant have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an Exemplification of a Verdict obtained the last <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term. To which they for the Plaintiff Answer, We were not prepared to answer your Deeds, which were very new, surprizing and unexpected to us: We have now given new Evidence that we never gave then, and it was a Verdict obtained by surprize: We now shew our Boundaries better than we could then, and so that they make to be the result of the whole matter.</p>
                     <p>Now upon the main, after this very long Evidence, tho' the Case has been darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as ever any Case could endeavoured to be, and tho' the Event of it be a matter of considerable Value, yet the Matter of Fact is as clear as the Sun at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and a plain point of Fact it is, and must depend upon. If we do admit all their Deeds to be good Deeds, without any consideration of the Forgery, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi>; yet if the Mill-Ponds, Ditches, Orchards, Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be taken to be seven Acres, then the Boundaries upon the Mill or Hilly-Bank, which may well be <hi>Foxes-lane,</hi> that will answer both the Deeds of the Plaintiff and of the Defendant. And tho' never so many Houses be built upon it, it will signifie nothing in the Case. And that it is so, whereas the Defendants Surveyor swears, that 130 Acres will not be made up without the Lands in Question; the Plaintiff has brought two Surveyors, that swear there is full
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103513:30"/>
130 Acres and more without them. So you have two Surveyers on the one side, and one on the other, and you your selves have viewed it.</p>
                     <p>After this long Evidence, Gentlemen, you have had as good an account of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, as I can by my Notes and Memory recollect. If any of the Gentlemen that are of the Counsel for the Plaintiff, or for the Defendant, do think I have omitted any thing that is material on either side, they have free liberty to remind the Court of it. you are the Judges of this Fact, whether this Land do of Right belong to the Plaintiff, or to the Defendant: And I leave it to your Consideration.</p>
                     <p>After which the Jury withdrew to consider of their Verdict, and the Court arose. That Evening the Jury gave in a Private Verdict before a Judge, and appearing the next Morning at the Barr, were called over, and demanded if they did abide by the Verdict they had given the Night before, to which they answered, yes; which being declared by the Secondary to be for the Plaintiff, the Jury were discharged.</p>
                     <p>Then a Motion was made by the Plaintiffs Counsel, that several Deeds produced by the Defendant, that were detected of Forgery, might be lest in Court in order to have them pursued, and convicted of the Forgery. The Court upon debate of the Matter; and the Plaintiffs Counsel declaring they would prosecute an Information of Forgery, the Deeds of the 13th of <hi>November,</hi> and the 22th of <hi>December,</hi> 2 and 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> were ordered to be lest with the Clerk of the Crown till further Order, and in the mean time the Plaintiff to have Copies of them from the Clerk; and by Rule of Court a Tryal at Barr is ordered in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term.</p>

                  <p>HAving thought fit some short time before <hi>Easter</hi>-Term, 1687. to cause to be printed and published a Paper, intituled, <hi>An Abstract of the Title to the Lands in</hi> Wapping-<hi>Marsh, and other Places near adjoyning, belonging to the Mannor of</hi> Stepney <hi>or</hi> Stebonheath, <hi>called</hi> Ewell, <hi>alias</hi> Tile-house; thereby making Title in general to more Ground (great part of it built) than the City of <hi>London</hi> stands upon; but particularly to none of the Lands in question.

                  <p>The Creditors of Sir <hi>Anthony Bateman</hi> have thought fit to print so much of their Title as remains on Record, to Ten Acres of Freehold, and Twelve Acres of Copyhold Land, as have also the Heirs of <hi>Rebecca Whichcot,</hi> to above Three, and not exceeding Four Acres, all lying in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh, and desire the Readers to take notice of the Boundaries in the old Deeds by which this Land is described, exactly answered by the Lands in dispute: And that several of the Sales made (on Record) of the Freehold, and Surrenders (also on Record) of the Copyhold, were made during the time that the Estate of the <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinses</hi> did remain in the Crown, and so cannot be reasonably thought to have been any part of that Land.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> The Land now called <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island, (which Name is assuredly took from having been long in possession of one <hi>Pruson,</hi> under <hi>Glover</hi>'s Title) is above Three, and not Four Acres; butted <hi>East</hi> on (a place where there was) a Sluce, <hi>South</hi> on the <hi>Thames, North</hi> on <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh, and <hi>West</hi> on <hi>Bridewel</hi>-Hospital-Land, heretofore a piece of Ground which butted and adjoyned upon <hi>Gravel-Lane</hi>; and was held under <hi>Glover</hi>'s Title by Mrs. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca Whichcot,</hi> till outed by Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> 1679.</p>
                     <p>And if Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> can shew what Land 'tis possible the Ten Acres in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh should be, but the Lands in question, butting <hi>West</hi> on <hi>Gravel-Lane,</hi> and where the Twelve Acres of Copyhold in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh should be, (that was late <hi>Hill</hi>'s in the 10th, and <hi>Glascock</hi>'s the 23d of <hi>Eliz.</hi>) and lying <hi>East</hi> of the last Ten Acres, but the Lands in question, and which have been always enjoyed by those the Creditors claim under, by Copy of Court-Roll, since <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, and where there should be Three, and not exceeding Four A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, that butted <hi>East</hi> on a Sluce, <hi>South</hi> on the <hi>Thames, North</hi> on <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh, and <hi>West</hi> on a piece of Ground that butted on <hi>Gravel-Lane,</hi> unless the Ground now called <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island, which really does so abutt, they will then quit their Claim to these Lands, which they otherwise hope will at some time or other be allowed to be theirs.</p>
                     <p>As to what Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> is pleased to say concerning the several Verdicts she has had for her Title, the Reader is hereby informed, That those Verdicts were got on producing of Deeds, which are not mentioned in her printed Paper, nor yet to be found on Record.</p>
                     <p>And as to what she is pleased to suggest concerning the Conviction of her Adversaries Attorney, one <hi>Iohnson,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> There was one <hi>Duffet,</hi> a notorious common Forger of Deeds, and an intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my Lady's: He first applied himself to Mr. <hi>Iohnson</hi> as a Witness, without <hi>Iohnson</hi>'s seeking to him, and discovering his Treaty with <hi>Iohnson,</hi> drew him into a snare, being, as supposed, employed by somebody else.</p>
                     <p>As for the Records and Deeds, which made up three parts of her Paper, they are most of them such as were never made use of at any Trial, and serve only for a shew, and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement, and when rightly considered, are nothing to the purpose at all.</p>
                     <p>And that the World may also see what Title, both on Record and otherwise, the Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> has yet been pleased to produce for the Lands in question, with what may reasonably be objected against it by Arguments, only deduced from other Deeds on Records, the same is incerted here, and if any Mistake be made in't, it is not wilfully done, and will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Answered by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s Direction, if there be any thing in it untrue, her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship having already appeared twice in Print in these Matters, and thereby given occasion for the Printing of this.</p>

                     <head>The Answer to it.</head>
                     <p>THE Act of Parliament was undoubtedly so <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and only shews there was a Hundred and thirty Acres to be Drained, and that <hi>Richard Hill</hi> having purchased <hi>Vanderdelfe</hi>'s interest, was to have one Moiety of it.</p>
                     <p>This Lease (if really true) only shews that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Hill</hi> had Land there; which it may be he had and probably he or his Son <hi>Iasper</hi> might after sell it to <hi>Iohn Starkey</hi> (under whom it is claimed now) before they sold any to <hi>Stepkins</hi> at all.</p>
                     <p>This (if true) purports a most absolute sale of all the Lands <hi>Richard Hill</hi> had in the County of <hi>Middlesex</hi>; and yet the said <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> the 20<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Oct.</hi> 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. by his last Will and Testament, settles the Lands he bought of <hi>Vanderdelfe</hi> (of which, by the Deed, this appears to be part) on his Son <hi>Iasper Hill,</hi> with several Remainders over in Tail, which 'tis not likely he would have done, had he sold it away before; and as a very good Argument that it was so Entailed by <hi>Richard Hill</hi>'s Will, there appears on Record, a Fine and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery suffered by <hi>Iasper Hill</hi> (<hi>Richard Hill</hi>'s Son) to <hi>Machelin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> of Twenty Acres of Land, and a Hundred Acres of fresh Marsh in <hi>White-Chappel, Stepney,</hi> and <hi>Wapping,</hi> the 3d of <hi>Eliz.</hi> which had been needless had it not been so En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, and is an Argument that <hi>Stepkins</hi> bought nothing of <hi>Hill</hi> till that time: And yet in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term 1684. in a Cause 'twixt the Dean of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>London,</hi> and Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> about <hi>Shadwell</hi> Lands, a Deed was then given in Evidence, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 16 <hi>Apr.</hi> 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. whereby <hi>Richard Hill</hi> sold Twenty four Acres, and all the Lands he had in <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> to <hi>Thomas Stepkins:</hi> But this Deed having had the misfortune to be markt as found, and Sworn to be so, with a long Lease of a Hundred twenty eight years, and other Deeds, among the Writings of the Churches Lessee, it was not believed then, and one of the Witnesses that swore to the so finding those Deeds, was Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd upon't, and stood in the Pillory for it; and some of the said Deeds were then left in Court; by Rule of which, Dated <hi>Iune</hi> 1687. upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation against Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> for it, a Trial is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered next Term.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s <hi>Wapping</hi>-Estate, came intirely into her power to sell and dispose of it in 1655. and when her Ladiship, in 1656. sold Land in <hi>Wapping</hi> to Mr. <hi>Arlibear,</hi> and in 1658. to <hi>Brian Harrison,</hi> Trustee for Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> Copies of this Deed were given them; by which it appears (if they were rightly taken) that Livery and Seisin was Endorsed on the back of that Deed the 20th of <hi>Nov.</hi> in the 5th and 6th year of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and 'tis notoriously known that Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> died the Seventeenth of that Month, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103513:34"/>
that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was proclaimed the same day.</p>
                     <p>This is not denied to be true, and is a great Argument against the Truth of the foregoing Deeds, it being not credible that this Fine was levied in pursuance of either of those Deeds, it being done so long after, and there being also a Deed by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s own shewing, dated the 12th of <hi>May</hi> following, 4 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to convey the Lands in that Fine comprized; but that Deed not naming the Lands in question, was neither produced in <hi>Easter</hi>-Term 1686. nor in <hi>Easter</hi> nor <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term 1687. but was in a Trial in <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term 1684. but 'twas in another cause, and the contents of it took at that time.</p>
                     <p>This Extent was undoubtedly made, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects not at all the Creditors nor <hi>Iolliff</hi>'s Title, for the Ten Acres of Freehold Land that was <hi>Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>'s in right of his Wife, sole Heir of <hi>Iohn Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> in the 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island might have been (we do not say 'twas) <hi>Richard Hill</hi>'s since the 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and yet no part of what was sold to <hi>Stepkins</hi> the 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and for the Twelve Acres of Copyhold, 'tis plain it was <hi>Richard Hill</hi>'s, and by his Son <hi>Iasper</hi> sold to <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> under whom the Creditors, by uninterrupted Surrenders, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long down on Record, do make out their Title to it.</p>
                     <p>It seems to be very much, and in many places razed, and not legible; and is not produced by the hands of the proper Officer.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> as Surety for <hi>Patent,</hi> being in Debt to the Queen, made over his Estate to Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees for her use, and that 'twas after Extended, and not released till 7 <hi>Iac.</hi> is true. But, <hi>Note,</hi> in the Conveyance to the Trustees for the use of the Queen, there is but a very few Acres mentioned as lying in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh; and in the Extent and Lease to <hi>Alice Stepkins,</hi> by the Queen, 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Fifty Acres in <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh only are mentioned, which seems to make out that <hi>Stepkins</hi> had no more there at that time; and among those, none of the Lands now in question are any way named or described: For, as for the Four Acres of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, with a Pond and Island, in the possession, at that time, of <hi>Alice Woodcock,</hi> it may, with much more of reason, be taken to be the Four Acres of Land, with the place where there was then both a Pond and Island, lying <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island; whereof Three Acres was sold to <hi>Brian Harrison,</hi> Trustee for <hi>William Wood,</hi> 1658. and the rest to Mr. <hi>Arlibear</hi> in 1656. both by Deeds enrolled by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> her self. Besides, had these Lands now in question, been then so convey'd to the use of the Queen, and extended, and so remained till 1609. 'tis not to be imagined that they could during that time have been sold, as plain 'tis they were on Record, by <hi>Sleford</hi> to <hi>Tailford,</hi> the 24 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and by <hi>Cross</hi> to <hi>Bennet,</hi> the 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of whom <hi>Richard Glover</hi> bought; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Surrenders were made of the Copyhold Land in that time, and particularly that to <hi>Richard Glover</hi> (under whom the Creditors claim) in 1603. As were also the Sales by <hi>Peter Osborne</hi> to <hi>Woodshaw,</hi> 25 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1583. and by <hi>Iames Woodshaw</hi> to <hi>Richard Glover,</hi> 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 1604. under which <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island was quietly enjoyed till 1679. and under which the Heirs of <hi>Rebecca</hi> now Claim.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103513:35"/>
was examined (being the said Fifty six years Lease) was the same Deed he so found, and on the Suit with <hi>Bateman,</hi> did deliver many Writings and Evidences to Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> and advised her to read them over, and that among them she told him she found this Fifty six years Lease; and in her Answer to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Bill, put in against her, 1675. she also swears she so found the said Lease in <hi>May</hi> 1675. and does acknowledge in that her said Answer, that she did not know of the said Lease, nor of the Rent thereon received.</p>
                     <p>And yet as</p>
                     <p>A farther proof of this Lease (it having been sometime sworn that one <hi>Duffett</hi> said, he was making a Writing he called <hi>Glover</hi>'s Lease about 1671.)</p>
                     <p>Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> to shew 'twas known in 1664. and if so, could not be made in or about 1671. does produce.</p>
                     <p>A Deed wherein the said Lease is recited, being a Conveyance (executed by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ivy</hi> and his Lady, of the Inheritance of five Acres of Land on which <hi>Kingstreet</hi> in <hi>Wapping</hi> is built, to <hi>Edward Burt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee</hi> and <hi>Edward Temple,</hi> in Trust to secure 800 <hi>l.</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy,</hi> by 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, till Principal and Interest paid, with a Covenant to levy a Fine. And to prove this Deed, she produced <hi>Edward Burtbee</hi> himself, who swears very home to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and says, he was Party to it, but the Witnesses are all dead.</p>
                     <p>A Fine was levied to <hi>Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> of Five Acres of Land in <hi>Stepney</hi> and <hi>Middlesex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that under the Lease to <hi>Walthall</hi> and <hi>Woodcock</hi> for Sixty two years, and this Lease thus taken of <hi>John Stepkins</hi> by <hi>Richard Glover</hi> for Fifty six years.</p>
                     <p>All the Possession of such as have claimed all along under him, has been.</p>
                     <p>Several Verdicts, and in favour of the foregoing Title, are by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> produced; and as a very great Argument of the truth of her Deeds, is alledged the very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of making so many, as there must have been made, if any there be in her Case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103513:35"/>If there was such a Lease as <hi>per contra</hi> made by <hi>Iohn Stepkins</hi> to <hi>Walthall</hi> and <hi>Woodcock</hi> for sixty two years, from 1572. and that the same was made over to <hi>Richard Glover</hi> in 1602.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very strange, that the said <hi>Richard Glover,</hi> if he had no other Title but that Lease at that time, should presume to let Leases of Lands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in comprized, as he really did to <hi>Pruson</hi> and <hi>Watts,</hi> for Terms that would not expire till long after that Lease, (an Enjoyment went with them) and much stranger it is that they should accept of such Leases, and consider his Title no better, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Building-ground on which they laid out their Estates. Besides, if <hi>Walthall</hi> and <hi>Woodcock</hi> mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the same to <hi>Richard Glover</hi> in 1602. and that he was in possession of it under that Lease in 1619. as the Surrender made by <hi>Pruson</hi> and him of it, shews he was till that time, how came <hi>Anthony Walthall</hi> and <hi>Thomas Woodcock</hi> to have it to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or release to <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> 1 <hi>Nov.</hi> 1613. which Serjeant <hi>Francis Brampston</hi> swears was the date of that Release? And if <hi>Walthall</hi> and <hi>Woodcock</hi> had it to surrender, and did surrender it in 1613. to <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> how came <hi>Glover</hi> and <hi>Pruson</hi> to have it again to surrender in 1619? This is very strange, if true. <hi>Note,</hi> The Release dated in 1613. was produced when the following Fifty six years Lease first was in 1675. and the other Release not till some years after, when discovered, it was that <hi>Richard Glover</hi> was possest of that Land all the time between 1613. and 1620. so that the first Release was not late enough to justifie the making of the next Lease for fifty six years.</p>
                     <p>Against the probability of the truth of this Lease,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> Likeness of Hands, and payment of Rent, no better proved than <hi>per contra,</hi> without any thing else, is but a slender Testimony to support a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected Deed, which this may deserve to be; for the following Reasons.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not pretended 'twas known to Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> till found by her, when wanted in 1675. and if it had been known,</p>
                     <p>What is said as an excuse why the Rent was not paid, (being reserved to the Lessor, his Executors, and not Heirs) is of no weight; for it might have been helpt in <hi>Chancery.</hi> Besides, had that been the reason why the Rent was not asked nor paid: <hi>Note,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Richard Glover</hi> (who Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> goes about to prove paid the first six years Rent) would never have paid any to her Father <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> he being the Son of that <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> who is supposed to have let this Lease in 1620. and died in 1624. so that way no Rent had been due at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Richard Glover</hi> in 1616. died, and by his Will gave several of his Children 500 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, and particularly <hi>Mary</hi>; and if the Money was not paid accordingly by <hi>Richard Glover</hi> his Son, who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have taken this Lease, he devises his <hi>Wap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
                        <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103513:35"/>
Lands over to his said Children, and <hi>Mary</hi>'s Portion being not paid, <hi>George Almony,</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, enters; and on payment of the said 500 <hi>l.</hi> in 1624. resettles (by Fine and Deed particularly naming these Lands) the same on <hi>Richard Glover</hi> again; whose thus accepting a Fine, had been a forfeiting the Lease, had he held it by one at that time.</p>
                     <p>Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s Father's and Grandfather's Wills, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerating all their Lands to very small parcels, take no notice at all of this Lease, nor of any Land in it comprized, but only as a Boundary to their own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> There was a Lease lett by <hi>Richard Glover</hi> to <hi>Aaron Williams</hi> of the Five Acres, being part of the Twelve Acres of Copyhold Land, on which <hi>Kingstreet</hi> in <hi>Wapping</hi> is built, for Fifty years (with License from the Lord of the Mannor to lett for so long) from 1630. at 20 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Rent; 'twas a building Lease, and such part of it as <hi>Aaron Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> built not himself, he disposed of to others. And as 'tis something hard to imagine that <hi>Richard Glover</hi> (who was a man of repute) if he had but forty six years in it in 1630. should lett it for Fifty years, so 'tis very much harder to believe that <hi>Aaron Williams,</hi> (who was a great Builder in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) and those under him, should accept of a Lease (and build on it) for a longer term than <hi>Richard Glover</hi> could have lett, had he held it by this now produced Lease for Fifty six years from 1620. which if true, could not have been but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known at that time; which very Lease so lett to <hi>Aaron Williams,</hi> as aforesaid, Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased in 1659. and gave about 2000 <hi>l.</hi> for it, and so got the possession of it, as she in her own Answer to Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Bill in 1676. does confess, and is a great Argument she believed it a good Lease; and that 20 <hi>l.</hi> yearly Rent was paid to <hi>Bateman</hi> for it, is plain, if the Answer of one <hi>Michael Oldsworth</hi> (of whom Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> purchased the said Lease) to a Bill put in against him by the Relations of one <hi>William Thomas</hi> (to whom <hi>Oldsworth</hi> was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and so came possest of this Lease) for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Estate of the said <hi>William Thomas,</hi> may be believed, as it must in other cases, (though no Evidence in this, because it being in another Cause, may not in this be read) That in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count says thus; Paid Sir <hi>Anthony Bateman</hi> Arrears of Rent at <hi>Wapping,</hi> 20 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> 150 <hi>l.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the said Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> being so in possession of the Five Acres, on which <hi>Kingstreet</hi> is built, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got <hi>Aaron Williams</hi> his Lease into her own hands, brought an Ejectment about 1675. against the Creditors of Sir <hi>Anthony Bateman,</hi> who then were possest of the other Seventeen Acres, and they claiming under a Bankrupt, who refused to assist them, and knowing not how to defend their Title, and Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> having the good Fortune to make those Deeds against which so much is said in this Paper, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the Fifty six years Lease from 1620. to be believed as true Deeds, she got a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and Judgment then for the said Seventeen Acres about 1676. and held the same till a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was given against her in <hi>Easter</hi>-Term 1686. for the whole Twenty two Acres, upon the now Creditors Title, such Evidence being then given, as made this Fifty six years Lease, and other Deeds, not believed.</p>
                     <p>The Deed dated <hi>February</hi> 1664. setling the Inheritance of the Five Acres of Land, on which <hi>Kingstreet</hi> in <hi>Wapping</hi> is built, on one <hi>Edward Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Edward Temple,</hi> for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing 800 <hi>l.</hi> by 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly to Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy,</hi> in which the 56 years Lease is recited,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103513:36"/>
seems to have been made for the sake of that very Recital, and cannot in reason be true; for, <hi>Note,</hi> Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> having purchased <hi>Aaron Williams</hi> his Lease, as aforesaid, and that being in <hi>December</hi> 1664. mortgaged to <hi>Ioseph Sabberton</hi> and <hi>Edward Simonds</hi> for 800 <hi>l.</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ivy</hi> then offering to lay down that Money, so he might have it secured him out of the said Lease, the same Lease was made over 26 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1664. to <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Iohn Estcourt,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Nevil,</hi> who the 25th of <hi>February</hi> following, assigned the same to Sir <hi>Rob. Killigrew,</hi> Sir <hi>William Salkeild,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Thornburgh,</hi> now Trustees for that purpose: But Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> not receiving the Rents, and his 800 <hi>l.</hi> remaining unpaid, and he differing with his Lady in 1671. put in a Bill against her and Serjeant <hi>Brampston,</hi> about this very business, charging the Serjeant with Confederacy with his Wife; and setting out the whole matter of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity made him of that Lease, complaining of the ill usage he had had, and desires relief, and yet says not one word of the Inheritance now pretended to be made over to <hi>Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> for him, and to which Deed he himself, 'tis pretended, was Party. And Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> in her Answer to the said Bill, takes only notice of the Lease by her purchased, and so mortgaged to <hi>Sabberton</hi> and <hi>Simonds,</hi> as aforesaid, and not one word of this Inheritance-Deed: Nor does a Bill exhibited against Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1669. by Sir <hi>Robert Killigrew,</hi> Sir <hi>William Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kield,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Thornburgh,</hi> the Trustees by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s direction, setting out also this Security thus made of the Lease (therein named to be made by <hi>Richard Glover</hi> to <hi>Aaron Williams</hi> for Fifty years from 1630.) for 800 <hi>l.</hi> by 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly to Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy,</hi> nor Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Ivy</hi>'s Answer to it, (confessing the Security was so made to him of the Lease) say any thing at all of this Inheritance-Deed, nor take any notice of <hi>Edward Burtbee,</hi> but as one only who being authorized by the last named Trustees, and Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> to receive the Rents, did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy one <hi>Edward Temple,</hi> for some time, for that purpose, and that afterwards one <hi>Perrot</hi> was by Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> authorized and employed to receive those Rents. So that 'tis sence to believe that <hi>Edward Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Edward Temple</hi> were no otherwise (with the knowledge of Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy</hi>) concern'd in this matter, but as Rent-gatherers only in manner aforesaid: and nonsence it is to imagine there could be such an Inheritance Deed made and assigned in Trust for Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to <hi>Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> at that time, and no notice in that Controversie be taken of it at all, considering also that that Lease was at that time within Nine years of expiring, and also not worth any thing, had the Fifty six years Lease been true.</p>
                     <p>And farther, to demonstrate that it cannot be with reason believed that the Fifty six years Lease from 1620. could be recited in a Deed made in 1664. that was perused by Serjeant <hi>Brampston,</hi> and he a Witness, and Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> a Party to it: <hi>Note,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Brampston,</hi> when examined for Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> in this Cause in 1675. to perpetuate his Testimony, being in the fourth Interrogatory asked, When and how long it was since he FIRST law the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart of the Lease (explained to be this Fifty six years Lease in the second Interrogatory) and where and among whose Evidences, Papers, and Writings, he did FIRST see the same; in answer deposeth, That having several Boxes and Bags of Writings to him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by his Brother Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that were in the possession of Sir <hi>Iohn Brampston</hi> his Father, at the time of his death, to be by him kept, he was desired by one Sir <hi>Charles Stepkins,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six or seven years since, to search among the said Writings for the Counterpart of a Lease made to one <hi>Bourne</hi>; and that upon this Deponents THEN searching, he did find a Deed with the name <hi>Richard Glover,</hi> as a Party set to it; but saith, he did not THEN read the same, and that these Bags and Boxes of Writings, he after delivered to Lady <hi>Ivy,</hi> and among them she told him she found this Lease.</p>
                     <p>Now if Serjeant <hi>Brampston</hi> swears true, that the FIRST time he found (which in common Speech is as much as to say he knew not of it before) a Deed under <hi>Glover</hi>'s hand, (which might well be the Lease lett by <hi>Richard Glover</hi> to <hi>Aaron Williams,</hi> which Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> had purchased) were but six or seven years before 1675. how then was it possible that it could be (by him) for so <hi>Burtbee</hi> swore 'twas) recited in a Deed made in 1664? And had it been so recited as now 'tis pretended it was, in a Deed made in 1664. to which Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> was Party, it must have been known to her self; which in her Answer to Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotton</hi>'s Bill, she swears it was not, but that it was by her found in <hi>May</hi> 1675. in an old Bag of Writings. And Serjeant <hi>Brampstons</hi> Deposition also says, That she at that time told him that she did find it so; so that it is not hard to believe this Deed (never produced till <hi>Easter</hi>-Term 1686.) was made for the purpose aforesaid, since to support the Truth of this Deed, there is nothing more than barely the Oath of one <hi>Edward Burtbee,</hi> a man well known about Town, and that he has been all along employed by the Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>; and so not unlikely to have been in the Secret.</p>
                     <p>For the Fine, if the Deed of Uses be not true, it may be of any other five Acres: But <hi>Note,</hi> 'twas Levied two years after 1664. Just about the time that Sir <hi>Anthony Bateman</hi> fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> set up to Claim the Inheritance of it, nor is without some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of having been unduly levied (it may be) by passing the Offices without the knowledge of Sir <hi>Tho. Ivy,</hi> and Lord Chief Justice, the Roll where the Caption of it, to which the Lord
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103513:36"/>
Chief Justices Hand should be in the <hi>Custos Brevium</hi> Office, being lost. And if that Fine was really levied by Sir <hi>Thomas Ivy,</hi> which is still to be doubted, for the reason aforesaid, 'tis not however to be wondred at much, considering that he had covenanted to do any Act with the Land in that Lease, his Lady should desire, so it might be no prejudice to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his 800 <hi>l.</hi> as aforesaid. And it may be he was made believe at that time, that it was her Inheritance by being showed the Deed of the 12 <hi>Nov.</hi> 5 and 6 <hi>Ph.</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> which was before that time made, and if any Deed there was made to <hi>Edward Burtbee</hi> and <hi>Edward Temple</hi> to lead the use of this Fine of five Acres, 'tis plain it could not be a Deed dated in <hi>February</hi> 1664. reciting this Fifty six years Lease for the reasons aforesaid; but must have been some other Deed, after that time made, and designed as this Fine seems to have been, in future times to make out some colourable Title to the Inheritance of this five Acres of Land, which Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> held only by <hi>Aaron Williams</hi> his Lease, that expired at <hi>Lady-day</hi> 1681. And that 'twas privately done, is plain: for neither the Fine nor the Deed was ever in any Trial produced, till <hi>Easter</hi>-Term 1686.</p>
                     <p>All that is to be said to the Verdict is, They were given at times when the Creditors Title, and that to <hi>Pruson</hi>'s Island, were not well made understood to the Court and Jury, and when Lady <hi>Ivy</hi>'s Deeds were believed.</p>
                     <p>As for the difficulty of making of Deeds, a great many may as well be imagined to be made, as one single Deed, where the Ingenuity of the Party concerned, and the Nature of the Title and Place afford good Materials for it. And</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Wapping</hi>-Marsh was one Hundred and thirty Acres drowned Land in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's time, and undertook to be Drained by one <hi>Vanderdelfe,</hi> and so setled by Parliament, that when Drained, it should be equally divided 'twixt the Proprietors and <hi>Richard Hill,</hi> who had bought <hi>Vanderdelfe</hi>'s half.

                     <p>That no Division (though undoubtedly one there was (it may be among themselves) made) is now to be found on Record: And <hi>Iasper Hill,</hi> 3 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by Fine and Recovery ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sold to <hi>Macheline</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stepkins,</hi> 20 Acres of Land, and 100 Acres of Marsh in <hi>Stepney</hi> (that being the first Sale on Record.) 'Tis in the power of Lady <hi>Ivy</hi> (as Heir of <hi>Stepkins</hi>) to Claim any part of the Marsh by alledging, 'twas part of what her Ancestors purchased; if to answer the Possession, there can any way a Lease be set up, and by her Ladyship's luck only; in finding old Leases, these long Disputes have been made.

                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> To His Highness the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>HAD it not pleased the Lord to bear up my Fainting Spirit, with more than an ordinary Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the Deliverance of his People was nigh at hand, and that he would put a stop to the Violent Passions of Oppressing Men, I had undoubtedly sunk under those abominable Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and Aspersions, which have been cast, like Dirt about the Streets, upon me, by my Wife and her Abettors.</p>
                  <p>But certainly the Day of our Deliverance is already dawn'd; and we are in some measure assur'd, that <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> is already broke forth, and that the Abominations of the Wicked shall be no more clothed with <hi>Authority</hi>; but whatsoever is a Lie shall be made manifest, and confounded.</p>
                  <p>As our Eyes are therefore on the Lord, as the supreme Fountain of all Goodness, so we trust that the Declaration of his Will shall be made out by Your Highness, being chosen by Himself in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, and by a wonderful Series of Providences, to this very end, to execute Righteousness and Judgment for his People that are oppressed amongst us: And that your Highness will put on Bowels of Compassion for the Afflictions of Men in Misery, who pour out their Complaints and Grievances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
                  <p>With this Confidence I appeal from the Chancery unto your Highness (being unable to endure any longer, either the Expences or Delays of that Court; or indeed the Justice which is there distributed.) For besides the hazarding of that which is better than a precious Ointment, much of my Estate hath been consumed, and great Debts contracted, by reason of my attendance upon these unnatural Differences, (which have been fomented between my self and my seduced Wife) much of it torn away by Violence under a Pretence of <hi>Alimony</hi> for her, to whom I never denied or refused any thing whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>And that which remaineth is daily so molested with Creditors, that I now may most truly take upon me the Expression of <hi>Iob, I once had Riches, but now have none:</hi> And unless it will please your Highness to afford a speedy Redress, I shall hardly enjoy long my Liberty also.</p>
                  <p>I will not say any thing of those sad and dismal Thoughts which have been continually in my Mind, those hideous Temptations, which have been hourly grating and gnawing my very Soul.</p>
                  <p>During this sad Condition, 'tis the Voice of the Lord only can speak Peace unto my Spirit, (whose Name be blessed for those sweet and refreshing Experiences, with which he hath supported me in this fiery Trial) but I shall open unto your Highness, as unto a good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the Wounds of my Body and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>; (and briefly present a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the whole Matter concerning my self, and Wife, and how it hath been transacted in the Chancery) That so I may with the more Confidence expect a Cure proportionable to my Disease; and that your Highness's Judgment may be as well grounded upon Knowledge, as my Suffering upon Experience.</p>
                  <p>Having faithfully discharged the Trust that was reposed in me by the honourable <hi>East-India Company</hi> (as their chief Agent at <hi>Madrassopotan,</hi> where I had not only the Command of the Persons of Thousands of People, but also the Fort of St. <hi>George,</hi> and Town of <hi>Madrassopotan</hi>;) And having made a thorough Reformation of the grand Abuses which had crept into those parts, to the great Injury of the Trade; and erected them a Town by my own Pains and Industry, even out of the Sea it self, for the better Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Security of it, I resolved with my self, (though I was often perswaded by the said Company to continue longer my Charge) to return into my Country, where I had left the near Relation of a Wife behind me: And by how much the more that Reciprocal Happiness (which we enjoyed together) did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, the more enflam'd were my Desires for a Return.</p>
                  <p>But I had no sooner arrived in <hi>England,</hi> but the first News almost that was brought me, was the Death of my Wife, in her very Journey to meet me.</p>
                  <p>This was the first Tryal which the Lord laid upon me: But as he corrected, so he gave me Patience and Submission to his Will in it; neither were Friends wanting to endeavour a Belief in me, that as the Lord had taken one Wife from my Bosom, so he could bestow another.</p>
                  <p>After many several Days and Months thus spent in Melancholy, and willing to inure my self to the Condition I enjoyed when I left <hi>England,</hi> I was perswaded to address my self to one Mrs. <hi>Garret,</hi> a Widow, and Daughter of Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> who was represented unto me to be as beautiful in Mind as in Person; And though her Husband had left her nothing, yet was I not deterr'd by this to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear my Sute, supposing what was wanting in <hi>Fortune,</hi> would be made up in <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Sweetness</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103513:39"/>Hereupon, in short, about <hi>October</hi> 1649. a Marriage was had and concluded between us; and, that I might give the best demonstration what a high value I put upon her, I setled for her Joynture 1000 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> and Covenanted with her Trustees to leave her at the time of my Death 1000 <hi>l.</hi> also in ready money.</p>
                  <p>Her Father (now taking notice of this cordial and affectionate dealing of mine with his Daughter) made in short this Proposition unto me, That if I would give him the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> 1000 <hi>l.</hi> more, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver forthwith unto his said Daughter, as many Jewels as might be worth at least 1200 <hi>l.</hi> that then he would settle his Estate at <hi>Wapping</hi> (being 240 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>) upon me for my life, and after my decease to my Wife; And in case we had Issue, then to them; and in case we had no issue, then to the Heirs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the said <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or such as he the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> should limit and appoint.</p>
                  <p>To which I returned as short an answer, and told him, I would immediately perform his demand. Whereupon I did deposite 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in money, and 1200 <hi>l.</hi> in Jewels, and all the aforesaid agreements and settlements were Indented in Parchment, and legally executed accordingly (as may appear from the Deeds themselves, proved by two Testimonies in Chancery, to which I refer my self.)</p>
                  <p>I make no mention what Presents, nor of what value they were, (though considerable) I sent her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage, (because they were purely Gifts) but the other upon the most real and highest considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Marriage.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it's already evident, that had I now found the affection which I promised my self, it might be very well said to be rather purchased than gained; for although there was 240 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> setled upon the Considerations aforesaid, yet was it a dear bargain unto me, only for my Life, to lay down for it 2200 <hi>l.</hi> Neither was I to enjoy this until the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> should decease; which (if the contingency of his Death, and the Interest of the Money had been considered) 'twas more than ten years purchase for one life.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, had there been a Return but of common Gratitude, (much less of a conjugal Affection) I should scarcely have entertained a Thought of Penitency for so large a Joynture, which I had setled.</p>
                  <p>But certainly the Anger of the Lord began now to be kindled against us, and whether 'twas for her sins as well as mine own, and particularly for being instrumental to the Disheriting of the eldest Son and Heir of the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> (who never had demerited it in the least measure from the Father) I know not, the Lord discover it unto us both in his due time: But certain it is, that she could not long continue her self from discovering, that 'twas rather my <hi>Fortune</hi> than my <hi>Person,</hi> which she had wedded; rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Advantages of expressing Kindness to others, than her Husband.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding many of these inconveniences did I pass over (though 'twas very grievous to be thus used so soon after our Marriage, within less than six months, and still persevere (if with Prudence I may speak it) with more than usual fondness) she could no sooner propose any thing, which my Purse or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry could procure, but 'twas immediately provided; nothing which might be either for Necessity or Ornament (though never so costly) but she had it, though I borrowed money to provide it.</p>
                  <p>I could here tell her Highness in what Plenty I maintained her, with what sums of Money in her Purse, with her Coach and Horses, Saddle-Horses, and rich Furniture, rich Cloaths, Beds, Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that I should discover too much of my Folly in it, as well as her Unworthiness.</p>
                  <p>But I am confident, (and 'tis proved by sufficient Witnesses in Chancery) that in eighteen months after our Marriage, she had spent for her Accommodations above 3000 <hi>l.</hi> whereof 600 <hi>l.</hi> was in Apparel only 500 <hi>l.</hi> in ready money.</p>
                  <p>But all this could not prevail, the Multiplicity of Curtesies and Endearments towards her on my part, was but the encreasing of her Frowns and Slightings towards me; and being unsatisfied with what I voluntarily bestowed upon her, she took all opportunity (in my absence from home) to imbezel what goods soever she could come at; and at one time (when I was at the Court of Aldermen) she took from my House 300 pounds at least of rich <hi>East-India</hi> Stuffs, and Plate.</p>
                  <p>The Company she resorted unto (were no less offensive unto me than her actions) being either Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of very low Condition, or Desperate Fortune, whose Necessities and Debaucheries still prompted her to further Incoveniences.</p>
                  <p>It being now evident unto me, and all our Acquaintance besides, That a sudden Ruine could not but be near to our Estates, and unhappiness to our Persons, I entered upon a serious Resolution to withdraw for a while to my Country-house at <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in <hi>Wiltstire,</hi> and persuaded my Wife to a complyance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; This I did, that I might pay those Debts, which I had contracted by her means, and take her from the Occasions and the Persons which had enticed her to such pernicious courses.</p>
                  <p>But they (finding it their <hi>Diana</hi> should leave <hi>London,</hi> the silver Shrine would be also removed) were too too prevalent with her to retard her Journey; Nay, in conclusion the absolutely refused to go with me.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding I did not forbear all the Arguments, which either Prudence or Necessity could dictate: And that I might not neglect any Motive, which I thought might conduce to this end, I gave 100 <hi>l.</hi> to two of her Familiar Acquaintance (whom I thought most prevalent with her) to persuade her to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me into the Country.</p>
                  <p>But no Charms of Persuations had any Influence, nor Reason (though very urgent and manifest) but was slighted.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless before I went out of Town, I writ this Paper, and left it with her;</p>

                        <p>THE Reasons wherefore I am at present forced to leave <hi>London,</hi> is in regard of the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because my House, Family, Goods and Estate in the Country goeth much to Ruine, for want of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Because my Engagements in <hi>London</hi> are great, <hi>viz.</hi> 1246 l.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because of these great Engagements, my Credit, which hath been of value, (but now through some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragements and Evil Practices,) is lost in <hi>London,</hi> that I cannot borrow any more money to supply yours and my present wants: And now when I thought all things had been forgotten, I heard abroad by my Friends, that by certain Warrants issued out by the States for your self, and others to appear before them, that I am ashamed to walk <hi>London</hi> streets; and I much fear, that if I continue in <hi>London,</hi> you will in short time both ruine your self and me.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You are so transported by the Perswasions, and Practices of your Aunt and others, that I, nor no Friend of yours, can intreat you to leave their Company and Evil Counsel, which daily breeds Debates and Strifes between us, Notwithstanding, they have been by their ill Counsel and evil Actions, the chief Occasion of all, which hath brought us to this sad Condition and Shame that we are now in: So that I may now say with <hi>Job, I had once Riches, but they are now wasted,</hi> and <hi>once I had a Wife, but now she will be no longer mine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. I have no Employment or Calling in <hi>London</hi>; which disgraceful and unquiet Life is hateful unto me, and most disadvantagious; for I find not this Town good for my health, (by reason of my continual trouble) my expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are insupportable: And I protest before the great God of Heaven, my only Ioy and Comfort should have been, and shall be (if I can any way find your Affections reciprocal, and your Compliance equal) to support your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Fortune beyond my Own: But if we continue in <hi>London,</hi> I find all will be quickly confounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>

I should rejoyce to see you and my Father <hi>Stepkins</hi> here; Therefore, Dear Heart, when you have a mind to come unto me, advise me, and I shall wait upon you, to bring you down; And when you are weary of my Company and Entertainment in the Country, (where my self, and all that I have, shall be at your Disposure) I shall (when you please) return again with you to <hi>London,</hi> and ever remain</p>

                  <p>To which (having sought <hi>Patience</hi> from above) I returned this Answer.</p>
                  <p>That 'tis true, he Married the Plaintiff, and hath ever since used her with the Respects of an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Husband to a loving Wife, and neither hath, nor did intend to desert her Company, but much desires it, if he may find respectful carriage from her; and is so far from leaving her destitute of all means, that since his Marriage, which was not then above eighteen Months, he had furnished her with Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Pearl, to the value of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> besides Apparel, which cost him above 200 <hi>l.</hi> All which Pearl and Jewels she had in her Possession in <hi>March</hi> then last past, when the Defendant went to his dwelling-house in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> at which time, he not only sollicited her to go and dwell with him, but promised her (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enjoyment of her in the Country) to resign both himself and his Estate to her Commands and Disposal.</p>
                  <p>That he hath likewise paid her Father 1000 <hi>l.</hi> for which he should have setled upon the Defendant some Estate of Inheritance for her Portion, which is all the <hi>Fortune</hi> he ever expected with her, whereof he hath not received the value of one penny.</p>
                  <p>That he allowed her for Clothes, Mony, and otherwise for her use, above 800 <hi>l.</hi> And during the time he hath lived with her, he hath spent in Housholdstuff, House-rent, and House-keeping, 2870 <hi>l.</hi> so that in eighteen Months, he hath spent with her 6000 <hi>l.</hi> And this he mentions not, as if he repented of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to her, but to evidence to their Lordships that there is no just cause of Complaint against him, for not allowing her maintenance.</p>
                  <p>That he never acted any thing of Danger or Cruelty, or that might occasion any infirmity to her; nor was there ever any Disagreement, or any Cause why she should separate from him; But her desire was to live in <hi>London,</hi> a place neither agreeable to the Defendants health, or Estate; He having already (by reason thereof) contracted many Debts: And confesseth, that having (by consent of her Father and her self) bought an Estate in <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> situate in a healthful air, and a place of much conveniency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and profit; He hath many times by Letters, in Person, and by Friends, earnestly desired her to live with him at his said House in the Country, where she shall want for nothing in his power, for her use and conveniency, and care shall be taken for her accomodation for her Journey, wherein he hopes yet to prevail, that they may mutually enjoy the Comfort of each other, which he much thirsteth after, and is not little grieved there should be any Question of it.</p>
                  <p>That he took such Order (presently after his going into the Country) whereby the Plaintiff was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with monies for her present occasions, and presumes the foul scandals suggested in the Petition; are well known to the Plaintiff to have so little colour of Truth in them, as he hopes the same were put into the Petition, as words of Course, rathen than by her Direction: And he utterly denies the same; and therefore he hopes, he shall not be ordered to make Allowance to the Petitioner, (as in the Petition) she demands.</p>
                  <p>Could ever any Man suspect to be thus dealt withal by a Woman, that had plighted her faith in Marriage to one, who had setled so great a Joynture, given her so many Gifts, so much Mony, Jewels, and all other accommodations whatsoever in the greatest Plenty, for the Consideration of nothing? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly amongst the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves have I not seen so great persidiousness.</p>
                  <p>Now had I just Reason to suspect, 'twas not only the malicious Counsels of her wicked Abettors, was the cause of her inhumanity towards me; but that she had in her own Breast a Principle of Enmity and Dissatisfaction, even to the Relation of being my Wife.</p>
                  <p>Nay seeing the <hi>Scene</hi> appears, 'tis too easie to understand what Plot is laid and concluded; If she can survive me (which she thinks very probable) and hath no issue of our two Bodies (which she is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved never to have) by keeping her self from me, Then will she be a <hi>Fortune</hi> indeed, and her Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood be worth its weight in Gold. And if in the mean time (during my life) she can have from the Lords Commissioners (by way of <hi>Alimony</hi>) 300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> she will think her self in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than her Father, who had but 240 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> both for himself and his whole Family: And to prosecute the Suit, she hath 1200 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Jewels already, and 500 <hi>l.</hi> in ready Cash advanced, and her Husband much in debt, so that peradventure she may outspend him also even at Law.</p>
                  <p>But to obtain this glorious design, many difficulties are to be passed through; And though she her self hath resolved to calumniate vehemently (presuming that somewhat will gain belief amongst many) yet will not this be enough; and therefore <hi>Witnesses</hi> must be prepared of as large <hi>Consciences</hi> as <hi>Foreheads:</hi> And for their better encouragement, They shall participate in the Gain and Advantage: Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103513:40"/>
Expressions and Opportunities to such Persons, whose defamed Lives, and necessitous Fortunes, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them neither in a Capacity to live, or converse with People of any Honesty or Reputation.</p>
                  <p>As for her part, her Suggestions and Insinuations were high indeed; much fear she pretended (for had it been more than a Pretence, all had been accomplished, and my Life lost) left she should participate of the Sins and Punishments of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> And as for her Body, she durst not trust that with me, left (at any time being Morose and Cholerick) I should injure her by Blows; or if kind, I should infect her with unclean Diseases.</p>
                  <p>To enforce these Motives upon the Minds of all People, who now took notice of these Distractions, Never was there a more exquisite Vizard of Modesty put on by a Woman: Never were Expressions of Religion more distorted to an ill end; no Projects and Practices of Obscenity and Murder it self, were wanting to colour these malicious Devices against me: Nay, so grosly infatuated was she in her Scandal, that she represented my Person to be more like to a <hi>Monsters</hi> than a <hi>Mans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Abettors are not wanting in acting their parts also; What she insinuated, they converted into Clamours; neither stuck to depose any thing, what possible could be believed to be sworn by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Having thus prepossessed the Ears of as many Persons of Quality as she could, and framed a Harmony of Testimonies (as well as of Witnesses) with as much Art and Cunning, as her own Wit, or her Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, (or the matter it self could supply) she took out with much eagerness a Commission out of the Court, to make what proof she could of her Petition.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this further Provocation also, my Lips were lock'd up with Silence, as well as my Heart with Sorrow, not retaliating Evil for Evil in the least measure; or so much as intimating unto her, of her first Follies (which if they were published by me) might have raised a great Cloud upon her Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Neither was I content to be totally Passive of what Injuries had passed, but was resolved not to leave any means unattempted to reclaim her from these Extravagancies.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon went unto her in Person, with Mr. <hi>Escot,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Middleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chey</hi>'s House (he himself being present) and with as much Rhetorick as my real Affection to her could dictate, did passionately move her to a Reconciliation, shewing what Scandal and Dishonour would follow such Differences, and promising withal, a perfect Oblivion of whatsoever had been acted against me; And to fortifie my Arguments the better, I desired all those Gentlemen there present, to do the Office of Christian Moderators, and to endeavour to stop the Breaches between us, which were too wide already.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, by how much the more weight she perceived in our Reasons, the more Obstinacy she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in her returns, utterly rejecting any Agreement, upon what Terms soever.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon suspecting in her the apparent Symptoms of a sear'd Conscience; and how that by my silence, the World began to infer a main Guilt of those Aspersions which had been divulged against me, Upon the serious Advice of my Counsel (though I cannot but acknowledge a very great Reluctancy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto) I was perswaded to examine Witnesses also, both to vindicate my own Integrity, and to discover unto the World the Grand Cheat that was contrived to gain my Estate (which could no otherwise be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished) without defaming my Person (and if it were possible) to take away my Life also; which shall evidently appear anon.</p>
                  <p>But before I shall give an Account of the Proofs which were made on my behalf, I shall according to her own Forwardness and Method, give your Highness a short view, what was attested for her.</p>
                  <p>One swore, That he saw me squeeze her (at eleven a Clock) one night, as she was going down stairs.</p>
                  <p>Another that she heard my Wife complain of ill usage (but though she lived in the House with us) never heard me give an ill word to her.</p>
                  <p>Another heard her cry out, Help, Help, Murder, Murder; and saw me take her by the Throat: Though I refer my self to my <hi>Affidavit</hi> on Oath, yet when I shall manifest it, (That this Woman who swore this, was brought in that very night, and next morning conveyed away) I suppose 'twill be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to perswade any one to believe, that this Creature was brought in on purpose to be a Witness against me.</p>
                  <p>The Woman that swore this, was brought in that very night, on purpose to be a Witness, and the next morning went away again.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Measler</hi> (a pretended <hi>French Physician</hi>) swore that she was ill; and that there was a Suspicion of Poyson; but this was five months after she left me; and was commonly reported to have the Pox, (which being a Venomous Disease) the <hi>French-man</hi> might safely Swear (with a mental Reservation, the frequent Practice of his Country-men) there was a Suspicion of Poyson.</p>
                  <p>This is the Substance of what was sworn against me, (and should I name the Persons of the Witnesses,) they were more mean than their Testimonies; The Chief of them was her Aunt Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> of whom I shall say no other, but that her <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> is after the rate of 300 or 400 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> though it be well known, That neither her Husband, nor her self, have any <hi>Profession</hi> to live by, or any visible Estate, nor worth a Penny; but are so nearly Poor, That he or she dares not appear in publick lest they be carried away by <hi>Bayliffs</hi> for the multitude of Debts he owes.</p>
                  <p>This is that ungodly Wretch, who too visibly hath been the Ruin, both of my self and Wife, as will appear from the Depositions themselves.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Person</hi> there was produced on her behalf (whose Name hath a Reputation in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Brampston,</hi>) yet all that he can depose for Her, is nothing which is material, but that he never knew her defam'd, but in this Business, and that she was bred up amongst his Children; and that he often endeavour'd a Reconciliation between us: Whether he did it, or no, I cannot affirm, but when I was told by him lately, and never heretofore, That he had a <hi>Pre-Mortgage</hi> of the Estate of 240 <hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> (made unto him by <hi>Stepkins</hi>) which was settled on me for the Consideration aforesaid, I hope, that I shall not be condemn'd, as too jealous without a ground, That he is fishing for his own Interest in our troubled waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103513:41"/>Were there ought else considerable deposed against me, I should deal so ingenuously as to relate it, being very confident, that at the hearing of my Cause before any in Authority, there will not be wanting <hi>Agents</hi> enough for her, to lay open the worst against me.</p>
                  <p>One thing therefore more (and that which they think most considerable against me, not in order to justifie her Complaint, but to take off a Belief, from what she knew I could prove against her and her said Aunt <hi>Williamson</hi>) was briefly this, That I endeavoured to suborn one <hi>Holdsworth</hi> (a poor Fellow about the Town) to swear point blank, That my Wife was a Whore, and her Aunt <hi>Williamson</hi> a Bawd.</p>
                  <p>That I may be impartial in this <hi>Narration,</hi> I shall cite the very words themselves of this Deposition which are these.</p>
                  <p>That in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> was twelve-month, He (<hi>viz.</hi> this Deponent) came to the Defendant, (<hi>viz.</hi> to my self) for Money for one <hi>Nicholas</hi>; and the Defendant said, He could prove Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> a Bawd, and would have had him sworn it; and offered the Deponent Money to Swear the Plaintiff (meaning Mrs. <hi>Ivie</hi>) was a Whore.</p>
                  <p>That he had made the Commissioners for him; and said, That <hi>Stepkins</hi> and all his <hi>Family</hi> were <hi>Base People,</hi> and often offered him Money to Swear; and said, he had two Witnesses more, if he would make up the third.</p>
                  <p>How much Indiscretion, as well as Falshood, was in this Deponent, and both in them, who imployed this inferior Person, and who too probably practiced that infamous <hi>Act</hi> of Creating Knights of the Post (which seems to appear, even from the Oath it self) For certainly, had I been provided with two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses (as he said I told him) which number the Law admits even in the highest Cases) it had not only been an impertinent losing of my Money, but my Honesty also, to no purpose: Besides there are scarce any so Ignorant, but understand how difficult a thing it is to prove even a Whore, a Whore.</p>
                  <p>'Twas against the Advice of my Council, and my own Inclination also, to examine any Witness of so mean a Quality in such Differences, (as these are between my self and my Wife) left the contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Evidence, might derogate from the Truth of the thing: Most of those (whom I produced to give Testimony on my behalf) were Persons of fair Estates, many hundreds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and such, who for many years past, have been Justices of the Peace in their Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But more (of this <hi>Nature</hi>) I omit: For (without Doubt) <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> are not inconsistent: The most precious Saints of God, are more frequently found cloath'd with Rags, than in a King's House: <hi>Iob</hi> himself was more acceptable to the Lord on the Dunghill, than in his costly Palaces: But withall there must be a Poverty in Spirit, as well as in Estate; otherwise, they will forfeit both their <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and their <hi>Credit</hi> amongst <hi>Men:</hi> For certainly a poor Man (being notoriously Vicious and Scandalous) is to be reputed rather a <hi>Vermin</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> than a Member of <hi>Christian Society,</hi> whose Testimonies stink in their own Nostrils, and their Memory shall perish with them.</p>
                  <p>That your Highness may the more knowingly judge and determine, both of this and other Proofs against me, I humbly beg leave to lay before your Highness the Manifestation of my Answer which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my Wifes Petition, and what Evidences I produced to the clearing of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To the first Charge in the Petition, That I left her destitute of all manner of Livelihood and Subsistence.</p>

                        <p>HAving often with Grief and Anguish of Mind, considered those many Scandals and Aspersions which have been laid upon me by my own Wife, from whom my Soul once expected as much Happiness, as could be hoped for in a Conjugal Estate; and finding how easie the Minds of many Persons, and those of Quality too, have been, not only to give an Ear, but a Faith also, to those abominable Reports, which she and her Abertors have raised and fomented, utterly to abolish (if in their power) my Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either as a Gentleman, or a Christian; both which (I trust) have been honourably preserved with much Constancy and Fidelity amongst thousands of Persons in those places where I have had long abode; lest I might be adjudged guilty in those things, which are only private to our selves, and which cannot admit of any Proof or Witness on either side, her personal and single Affirmation, being the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to induce the World to the belief of so vile and inhumane Actions; I have thought it most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, besides these Proofs which are taken in Chancery, to vindicate my Innocency, not only with a bare Negation, but with such a one as is ratified with the Solemnity of an Oath: This I do the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in these unhappy Cases between the Husband and the Wife, the Answers which are returned to the Petition, are not deposed to, as in other Proceedings in <hi>Chancery,</hi> neither can I content my self to stop here, but am willing to give the highest Satisfaction that a Christian can expect on Earth, and shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore choose such a time as the receiving of the most precious Body and Blood of my Saviour Jesus Christ (of which with all Humility this day, having strictly examined my own Heart, I intend to participate) as to declare my Innocency thereupon to those principal points which are objected unto me by my Wife: Were there any other Waters of Tryal under the Gospel, as there was under the Law, I could most safely adventure the drinking of them to clear my self before the World: But this, I hope, will give a plenary Satisfaction to all Godly and Consciencious Persons, who (if ever) will give Credit to the words of an afflicted Spirit, will now do it, after such a solemn sort.</p>
                        <p>And I do first upon my Oath say and affirm, that I have been so far from Acting and Committing that foul Sin of Sodomy upon her Body, that I never had within my Breast the least inclination or desire to so vile and abominable a thing; neither did I ever attempt to perswade her by fair Words and Inticements, or to move her by Threats, or ever used the least force or struggling with her to compass any such Base or Heathenish Design, as the most falsly and opprobriously charged me with.</p>
                        <p>And moreover, whereas on a certain night she was necessitated, in Preservation of her Life, as she had suggested to the Lords Commissioners, and several others, to leap out of the Bed from me, to cry out, <hi>Murther, Murther</hi>; alleging, that I offered Violence unto her by pinching, beating, and striking: Now I do protest and depose before Almighty God, that this was done without any such Provocation, even in the least measure; Nay at the same time, while she was attempting to leave my House, and running to her Fathers, I used all the friendly and kind Perswasions which I could express to detain her, and only hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her by the Arm, without the least hurt as I believe, I often repeated my hearty Solicitations unto her to remain with me: But I do really believe, upon the consideration of several Circumstances and Passages since that time, that both her Out-cry, and her Subsequent Behaviour was design'd before that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103513:42"/>
night. If any thing at that time might be look'd on as a shadow to justifie her Proceedings, it was this, That a little before she leap'd out of the Bed (amongst other Discourses) I intimated a Dislike of her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which was observed by others, towards one who pretended to be her Physician; This, and this only, was all the Cause and Occasion (if this be any) of her forsaking me at that time. And for all other times whatsoever, I do affirm upon Oath, that I never gave her the least stroak in my Life, or ever did so much as pinch her in Jest, to the best of my remembrance, or did ever directly or indirectly, let fall from my mouth any kinds of Threats whatsoever.</p>
                        <p>And I do further Swear, That until such time as she exhibited that foul and scandalous Petition to the Lords Commissioners, that I lov'd her unfeignedly, respected and esteemed her above all Creatures in the World; and as I laid down my <hi>Fortune</hi> at her feet when I first married her, so would I have laid down my <hi>Life</hi> too, for her Good and Preservation. Nay, I do allege further upon my Oath, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that scandalous and false Petition exhibited against me in pursuance of her malicious Designs, she had examined Witnesses to defame me; yet out of Christian and tender Consideration of the Relation wherein I stood towards her, as a Husband, I was willing from my Heart, and did endeavour (by the several means of Persons of Quality, allied both to my self and her) to compose all Differences, that we might for the future Cohabit together in Peace and Content; and not to regard any Aspersions which she and all her Witnesses, being there examined, had cast upon me, not to retaliate in the least measure, still deferring the Examination of my Witnesses against her, and attending whether it would please the Lord to give her a sight of the Error of her way, and to return her home to her Husband, who was most willing to receive her.</p>
                        <p>As to that Aspersion cast upon me, That I committed Folly with her Servant <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> though I need not say much to it, the Maid her self, and other credible Witnesses, having clear'd me in that point, both in Court, and on her Death-bed; and convinced the World of the horrid and unheard-of Practices of her and her Abertors, in abusing and exposing the Body of the said <hi>Iane</hi> to the View and Search of several Men, and suborning her to give in Testimony against me; yet that the World may know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of my Soul in this also, I do further Swear, That I never entertain'd within me the least thought of corrupting her Chastity, or did ever commit any unlawful or dishonourable Action with her, from the time I knew her to this day.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, Whereas I am charged by my Wife to have suborned several Witnesses against her, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one <hi>Holdsworth</hi>; I call the Lord to bear me Record in this also, and do upon my Oath affirm, That I did never directly or indirectly, procure any Witnesses against her to testifie farther than the truth of the thing, what he or she would knowingly and safely, without breach of Faith or good Conscience, Depose.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that <hi>Holdsworth</hi> being imployed as a Bayliff to arrest me at the Suit of my Wifes Taylor, for a considerable Sum of Money, which she her self was indebted for, and behaving himself civilly towards me, I gave him five Shillings, and for no other end or purpose; And upon my Oath, I protest, that I never had any such Communication or Discourse with the said <hi>Holdsworth,</hi> to any such intent or purpose, as he hath most maliciously deposed against me.</p>

                  <p>This was proved in the upper Bench the Term, before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Roles</hi>; and she was Bound over to the good Behaviour: The Pass was there produced, and is now in my Custody.</p>
                  <p>Besides these short intimations, many foul and horrid stories (could I have produced) of Designs for my Destruction: but because I was not able to make out clear and evident proofs of them, I was unwilling either to trouble the Court, or disturb my own thoughts, with any thing less than Realities and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One History,</hi> or rather a Dismal <hi>Tragedy,</hi> acted by my Wife, Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> and their conspiracy, was with all its Circumstances, so clearly delineated in the Depositions, that I should wrong my Cause, should I not relate this also: and perhaps few <hi>Romance</hi>'s or <hi>Gusman</hi> himself can parallel it.</p>
                  <p>It being resolved at the Feast, (which was held at my house, when I was in the Country) by my Wife, Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> Mrs. <hi>VVheatly,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Nowells</hi> (being the Persons) for whom that Treatment provided; That though the Scandals of <hi>Sodome</hi> were sufficiently high, which had been divulged against me; and would render me odious to the World: Yet seeing 'twas but a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> between us two in private, which could not be proved more, than by her single affirmation; and that her own Midwife (having search'd her for that very purpose) had so streight a Conscience, that she would not swear that my Wife had been injured in those parts; Did thereupon conclude, that some other way must be found out, which might admit of <hi>Testimonies</hi>; otherwise, they suspected, my Wife could hardly obtain <hi>Alimony,</hi> or procure a <hi>separation</hi> from me.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it seems, This Plot was afterwards put in execution upon <hi>Iane Gilbert</hi>: Its proved, <hi>l. C. f.</hi> 115.</p>
                  <p>This Wench they picht upon to be the Instrument of their Design, because she being actually a Servant in my House, it might be thought very easie for me to find an opportunity to lie with her; and being also of a sickly disposition, it would be no difficult thing to raise a suspition, that she might possibly be with Child, especially, being not well recovered of the Dreggs of the Small Pox, which she had had a little before.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> (that she might the better colour her Intention privately) carried this Maids water unto one, whom they call <hi>Trigg,</hi> a Shoo-maker (as I have heard) by Trade, and enquired of him, whether the Party that made this Water, were not with Child?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trigg</hi> (having good Instructions, and doubtless a large Fee) Ordered Mrs. <hi>VVilliamson</hi> to bring the said <hi>Iane Gilbert</hi> unto him, and he would search her.</p>
                  <p>At her return home to my Wife, there was a new consult, how they might carry the Maid to <hi>Trigg,</hi> and make her willing to be searched? leave that to me (said my Wife) and immediately went unto <hi>Iane Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and said, <hi>Ienny,</hi> my Father hath sent for my Aunt <hi>VVilliamson</hi> and me to Breakfast to morrow morning, and hath commanded me to bring thee with us, because he hath provided a Dish of <hi>Milk and Eggs,</hi> that which he knows thou dost dearly love: and the maid little suspecting any mischief, couch'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this pretended Kindness) thank'd her Mistress; but by reason of the many cloaths she had to steel and starch against the Morrow, (being <hi>Sabbath-day</hi>) was willing to be excused: Nay, <hi>Ienny,</hi> replyed my Wife, you must and shall go; for I know my Father will be angry, if we bring you not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103513:43"/>So a Coach being call'd, my Wife, Mrs. <hi>VVilliamson,</hi> and the Maid went to Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> house, but neither found him, nor the <hi>Milk and Eggs</hi>: Ah, quoth Mrs. <hi>VVilliamson,</hi> are we serv'd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o? we'll make a mornings work of it, now we are out; methinks I have a rumbling in my Guts, pray let us go to Doctor <hi>Trigg</hi>; Agreed, said my Wife; and as they were passing from Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> to <hi>Triggs</hi> house, my Wife and Mr. <hi>VVilliamson</hi> (being very frolick) began to jest with the said <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to make <hi>Trigg</hi> believe, she was a new married Woman, and so that would put a Trick upon the Doctor his skill.</p>
                  <p>After they were all arrived in the Doctors presence, Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> made a private address unto him, and pretended to have acquainted him with the pain in her Guts. But having ended her Tale in private, What think you, said she, of yonder new married Wife? <hi>Trigg</hi> (having felt her Pulse, and bid her spit once or twice) told her, she was <hi>Splenetick,</hi> Like enough that, quoth Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi>; But is she not breeding Doctor? Yes, I warrant you, said he; so the wench turning about, and smiling, was bid go out by Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> (that she and her Mistress might have some private Discourse with <hi>Trigg,</hi> about the Drink which they had given her) which she did accordingly, whilst her Mistress, Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> and <hi>Trigg</hi> held a long Conference together; when this <hi>Scene</hi> was over, All returned home.</p>
                  <p>About three or four days after the said <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> having been promised leave by my Wife to go visit her Friends in the Country, for the Recovery of her health, my Wife took her into her Chamber, and said, Ah <hi>Ienny,</hi> But I have somewhat more to tell you, and thereupon shut the Chamber door, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present but them two, and Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi>) 'Tis commonly reported, <hi>Ienny,</hi> quoth my Wife, that you are with Child, and 'tis my desire to have it clear'd: Tush, said Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> if it be so, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you 'tis by the Best in the house; (meaning my self) Let us know it, for we can, and will conceal it, and so dispose things, that it shall never be a discredit, or disgrace unto her; Nay, if she will confess that she was with Child, they would provide for her; But said they, if you will refuse to let us know it, and go into the Country, we will Report, that you are gone to take some Physick to destroy the Child.</p>
                  <p>The Maid now considering what snare they had brought her into, by going to <hi>Trigg,</hi> (as aforesaid) being persuaded to act the part of a new married Woman, was astonished at this Surprizal, and cryed out, the Lord protect me, for I am very innocent from any such thing; and withal my heart, said she, will I do any thing, that may give you satisfaction, or clear my self from this Scandal.</p>
                  <p>Look here, saith my Wife to her, my Father hath sent me a Letter, where he says, That Doctor <hi>Trigg</hi> says that you are certainly with Child; and if you will not confess, you must be whipped in <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they were thus Discoursing, (often intimating that 'twas their Design to make this Maid confess her self with Child by me) in came Mrs. <hi>Sessions,</hi> my Wives Midwife, whom she persuaded to search <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> which she willingly submitted unto; and the Midwife (in her presence) acquitted her from being with Child.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon my Wife commanding some tears from her Eyes, wept passionately (as she seemed) and breaking into great Passion, said, Ah <hi>Ienny,</hi> have I loved and entertained thee thus long, been as kind to thee, and as tender of thy good, as if thou went my own Child, and canst thou conceal any thing from me? Doubtless thou art with Child; and therefore come, put on your mask, for you shall once more to Doctor <hi>Trigg,</hi> who understands these things better than any Midwife; and he will prove you to be with Child: And that you may not think I have any Plot upon you, (that Objection was very strong within her) put on your mask, (that the Doctor may not know your face again) and fetch your Water; and Mrs. <hi>Sessions</hi> shall go with you.</p>
                  <p>The Maid being perplexed in mind, and far from any of her Friends, knew not what to do in this condition: But being urged by her Mistress went again with the Midwife.</p>
                  <p>After the Midwife had given <hi>Trigg</hi> her Water, and discourst with him privately; he called to <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> and bid her go up stairs with him: But the poor Wench (not knowing which to prefer, her <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> or <hi>Innocency</hi>) refused to go with him; until at length (being clamour'd at, and absolutely forced up to his Chamber) she was necessitated to follow him: Where <hi>Trigg</hi> began to acquaint her, that her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress Mrs. <hi>Ivie,</hi> had told him, that she had been too familiar with her Master, and therefore he must search her: And did thereupon (in a most rude and violent manner) force his hands under her Coats, to her naked Body; and did use her in a most abominable way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when he had effected his business, he told the Midwife that she was with Child; though the Maid absolutely and earnestly denyed the same.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon they left <hi>Trigg,</hi> and returned to my Wife, who having heard the Relation from Mrs. <hi>Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> what had been done (being totally unsatisfied) caused her to be carryed to another Physician, Dr. <hi>Hinchley,</hi> and shewed him the Water; and desired him also to search her in like manner: But his <hi>Verdict</hi> was unlike that of the <hi>(Mountebank) Trigg</hi>; for he peremptorily avouch'd she was not with Child.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding all this could not satisfie the aim of my Wife, and Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi>: But once more she must expose her Nakedness to the search of another Doctor, a Man-midwife, Dr. <hi>Hinton,</hi> who in like manner, as Dr. <hi>Hinchley</hi> (notwithstanding Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> and my Wife did earnestly sollicite him to attest that she was with Child) acquitted her from being with Child; and would justifie her to be a Virgin.</p>
                  <p>These two <hi>Testimonies</hi> did no way forward their Design, for by this means, all the pains in Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Persuasions, (to acknowledge her self with Child by me) began to undervalued, by how much the more the said <hi>Iane Gilbert</hi> had been acquitted by the two Doctors and Midwife, and accused on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that <hi>Ignorant Quack Trigg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:103513:44"/>And therefore seeing the Wench was so obstinate that she would not comply with them, (and least at my return she might discover this unto me) a new Project was set on foot, so to terrifie the Wench, that she might leave <hi>London</hi> immediately.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon they came unto her, and told her, that Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> my Wifes Father, would do her a notorious <hi>Mischief</hi> if she would not acknowledge her self with Child: Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> advised the Maid to go for a while into the Country, until Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi>'s anger was over.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account she was sent away to her Father's House in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> where immediately after her arrival, she received a Letter from my Wife, that her Father <hi>Stepkins</hi> was so incensed against her, that he would not suffer her any longer to live with my Wife.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the great love she bore, she would not leave her destitute of a Service, but would provide a convenient Place for her.</p>
                  <p>Scarce eight days had passed, but down comes Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> to her (pretending she had been at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>) and came out of her way on purpose to see her; Though 'twas evident she came directly from <hi>London</hi> to the said <hi>Iane Gilbert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Insomuch that the Maid suspected some farther ill towards her (having been formerly so abused) but parling together about former Passages, The Maid asked Mrs. <hi>Williamson,</hi> what Ill she had deserved from her Mistress, that she should be so disgraced as she had been; and though she found her guiltless, she should now be put away? Well, quoth the Maid, by God's help I will be to morrow in <hi>London,</hi> and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to right my self from these Aspersions.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon she found the end of Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi>'s Journey (was to hinder the Maid from coming to <hi>London</hi>) (because I was the day before arrived out of the Country) lest she should see me, and discover what had been done unto her, in order to make her confess that I lay with her, and that she was with Child by me.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> now perceiving that the said <hi>Iane Gilbert</hi> was resolved to make a stir in this foul Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, returned with all speed to my Wife, and wished her to think of a way how to hinder her from speaking with me.</p>
                  <p>The next day, as soon as the said <hi>Iane Gilbert</hi> came to my House, my Wife met her at the Door, and giving her many good words, perswaded her to take a Lodging near that place, (and change her name) and that she would pay for it.</p>
                  <p>The Maid (very much troubled at this usage) was very pressing to know what Offence she had ever given her: Truly, quoth my Wife, Sweet <hi>Ienny,</hi> I love thee most dearly; But the Truth of all is, my Husband and his Friends give out, that 'tis unfit for me to keep a Gentlewoman to wait upon me, besides common Servants; and that 'twas their Envy towards her, and therefore she must be gone: But withal assur'd her, that she would provide a convenient place for her.</p>
                  <p>My Wife now thought, that she had (by this Trick) made the Maid believe me to be the sole cause of her turning away, and sufficiently exasperated her against me; yet did not despair of a Compliance from her, and therefore said, For my part, I am content you stay this night, (that she might farther try her) and to morrow thou shalt have another Lodging look'd out for thee.</p>
                  <p>But my Wife understanding the next Morning, that I began to parle with the Maid about the passages aforesaid, (which indeed were communicated to me in the Country) knockt very furiously for her to come up into her Chamber; and commanded her immediately to leave the House, and would not suffer her to speak any more to me.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon she went to one Mr. <hi>Price</hi>'s House, a Brother of one of her Fellow-servants, and lay there privately, (as she thought) but 'twas made known to my Wife, who immediately sent a Maid to sound of what Temper she was, and how she stood affected towards her: And it being return'd, that she was full of Disdain and Passion, by reason of the aforesaid Practices against her; and that she would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with send for her Trunks, they were immediately seized upon by my Wife, and locked up in her Closet.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, upon this Report, the Maid did not send, but came her self to demand her Trunks; and I seeing of her in the House, began to ask again, why she went away, and upon what occasion that Searching of her (by Men and Women) were? But her Mistress calling her Queane for acquainting me with it, and threatning to strike her for it, denied her the Trunks, and caused her forthwith to be sent away: And the very next day Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> and my Wife gave out in Speeches, (amongst my Family and Neighbours) that they had broke open the Trunks, and had found that she had been a Baggage, and a notorious Thief, and stollen her Goods.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon (the better to secure the Wench, either for complaining of these Abuses, or telling me the Truth of her Usage) they procured a Warrant from my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Roles</hi> to apprehend the Maid for her Life, (having charged her with Felony.) But finding that the Maid kept in, and that by vertue of the said Warrant, they could not enter any House to take her forth, they entered into a new Project, how the Wench might be secured (both Tongue and Person) and also, that they might seize on her wheresoever she was.</p>
                  <p>To this end Mr. <hi>Pauncefoot</hi> was look'd on as a fit Instrument (having Relation to the Lord President <hi>Bradshaw</hi>) and was desired to procure them a Warrant from the Council of State, upon Pretence that this poor Wench held Correspondency (with the Enemies of the Commonwealth) beyond Seas, and so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended her: By vertue of which Warrant she was seized on accordingly, and kept close Prisoner eighteen days together with great Hardships.</p>
                  <p>During this Imprisonment, a Gentleman came to this Wench from my Wife, advising her to humble her self to her Mistress, and to confess her self Guilty, and much to that purpose, but she (being Innocent) utterly refused any such Acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:103513:44"/>During this Imprisonment, many Petitions (for to be heard at the Council) did she attempt to present, but were still kept off by the means of the said <hi>Pauncefoot,</hi> neither could she ever be heard.</p>
                  <p>At length my Wife and Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> finding nothing could prevail (after Sorrow and Grief (in this lamentable Condition) had almost killed her, they had contrived a meeting for the Wench (by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of her Keeper) in <hi>Moor-fields</hi>; where, as soon as my Wife saw her, she fell into a deep fit of Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Wench, and told her how dearly she loved her, and that she was in perfect Friendship with her, and earnestly desired that all things (which had passed) might be forgotten; promising withal, (that in a very short time) she would abundantly express, how sensible she had been of her late Sufferings.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon my Wife, without ever acquainting or procuring their Order for her Freedom, (only giving the Messenger of the Council of State 20 <hi>l.</hi>) caused the Maid by her own Power (by which it seems she stood committed) to be set at liberty.</p>
                  <p>But very suddenly after Enlargement (her Body being quite spent, and her Mind almost distracted with Grief and Melancholy) she died; and in her Death-bed professed solemnly (that by reason of those Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which had been practised upon her by Mrs. <hi>Williamson</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ivie</hi>; and especially by the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Potion given her by them, (which upon the words of a Dying Woman) she believed to be Poyson) That they had been the cause of her Death; and that she doubted not but that the Almighty God would require her Blood at their hands.</p>
                  <p>After these things were laid open to the Lords Commissioners for the Great Seal; I little expected that Vices should be received for Reasons; that such Abominations should have been thought worthy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, not to say the Encouragement of such eminent Judges; but with Grief of Heart, and empty Purse, may I say, that I found experimentally their Chancery rather a Court of Oppression than good Conscience; nay, I have this peculiar in my Case (that after all Witnesses on both sides were examined) they never afforded me that Favour (which they omitted to none) as to command me and my Wife in Person to attend them, and to endeavour a Reconciliation between us.</p>
                  <p>This I thought hard measure, because I was informed all others had participated of that Civility from them; and the more hard, in regard my Wife had frequent and private Addresses unto them, and I was never admitted any.</p>
                  <p>The Consideration of this not only astonished me, but gave me a strong Alarm also to be very Circumspect, lest I might have as little Justice in their Sentence, as I had savour in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
                  <p>And that on the other side, when I remembred they openly declared before my Council, that nothing should be concluded without sending for both Parties, and also their Parties; and also their Order of the 27 of <hi>October</hi> 1651. that they had denied her any Expences of the Suit, in regard the Merits of the Cause should be speedily heard; I could not conclude within my self, but that I should be dealt withal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Rules, and Practice of all the of <hi>England</hi>; and that a Summons (upon a day of hearing should be first sent) e'er any Sentence pronounced, or Decree made in the Cause.</p>
                  <p>But what I often suspected, and was intimated unto me by others, I had now too much reason to believe.</p>
                  <p>For after eight Months (having all that while never received any command to wait upon their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships) when all my Counsel was out of Town, <hi>Iuly</hi> 24. 1652. (Her Counsel Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> and Lieut. Col. <hi>Zanchey,</hi> her Sollicitor, with a Sword by his side) presented unto the Lords Commissioners, a final Decree ready drawn; (it not being first perused by Counsel of my side, as by the Rules of the Court it ought to have been) for no less than 300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> (a fair Sum, and enough to tempt a good Woman to be bad:) The Draught of the Order is thus.</p>

                  <p>On the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following I did attend in Person, but without any Counsel; all being in the Circuits with the Judges: And if could have found any, it had been almost impossible to have fully instructed them in the Cause, there being so many Depositions, and those of so great Length.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I renewed my humble and earnest Request unto them, with all the Vehemency I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, That they would make no Decree, before they heard the merits of the Cause on both sides.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, I found 'twas their Resolution to sign that Irregular Paper, and to declare before-hand, that they had found just Cause for <hi>Alimony</hi>; The Preamble of the Decree being full of Reflections, and containing several Insinuations against me: All that they thought fit to add, was this Clause, [<hi>Vntil fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order.</hi>] A dear Expression in Chancery, and as costly as the other, [<hi>Vnless he shew Cause.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Now, and not before, was the Order (which they commonly call the Decree, having put the Great Seal unto it) delivered unto the Register to enter, which first ought to have been drawn by him, and then perused by Counsel on both sides.</p>
                  <p>Had any one but heard, what smooth words the Lords Commissioners gave me at this time, telling me, That it should not be prejudicial unto me, and that they would hear my Counsel at any time, come when I would, and that 'twas but a Temporary thing, and that they would deal tenderly with me, in so tender a Case, as between Man and Wife, one would have almost been persuaded, that it had been my duty to have given my consent also: But though there was Honey in their Mouths, yet was there too too much Gall in their Ink, and Wormwood in their Decree.</p>
                  <p>Had they but considered the Deed of Covenant which (they professed) they had perused, 'twould have appeared very evident, that there was no shadow for so great allowance, as 300 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>: When her Father himself, and my Wife also made to me a Proposition, of giving her the liberty of living where she would, and setting out for her fit allowance, they themselves did desire, no more but 120 <hi>l. per Annum Depos. l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides of the Articles (in my custody) which they caused to be drawn to the same Purpose.</p>
                  <p>But I suppose the Lords Commissioners were so far from considering what they signed, that they never read the Deed, which they mention; nay, I think, I may safely say; They did not, or would not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Act it self, for <hi>Alimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103513:45"/>For that Act impowers them, to give only such <hi>Alimony,</hi> as is proportionable to the Fortune which the Woman brought; and that also to be raised out of the Husbands Estate. Whereas the truth is, she hath not (in all her Proofs) proved, that she had been, or in probability could ever be worth a Penny to me.</p>
                  <p>And as for that Estate, which the Lords Commissioners did decree unto her, 'tis true, I had an equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Title unto it; but it really did belong to the Heir, at Law, until such time as I had performed some small Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Insomuch that Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> his Son and Heir, also was injured by these proceedings of the Lords Commissioners; for which he hath often made his Complaint, as well as his just Title in Law, though to little purpose.</p>
                  <p>I know full well, what shadow the Commissioners put on this dealing; but whether it be just and righteous, I submit to your Breast, and that is thus.</p>
                  <p>That although it was Convenanted, between Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> and my <hi>Trustees,</hi> that in case I did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the Covenants (to which I had obliged my self) then was the said Estate of 240 <hi>l.</hi> to go to the use of the right Heirs of the said <hi>Stepkins,</hi> until such time as I should perform. By virtue of this Clause, did young <hi>Stepkins,</hi> lay claim to the said Estate.</p>
                  <p>Yet say the Commissioners, that Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> the Father (Who had reserved unto himself the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the said Limitation, to me and my Wife) made a Will; and by that Will had acquitted me from any further Performance; insomuch that the Estate was now totally belonging unto me.</p>
                  <p>This I believe my Wife told them; and peradventure shewed them such a Will; and this is their Ground: But by their leave, I cannot think, till such a Will be legally proved, That it can be any Ground for them, to give away the Estate in such manner, as they have; upon a bare suggestion of one Party, for whose interest and profit it was.</p>
                  <p>Certainly had they been as conscientions Judges (as they are Judges of Conscience) they would have first caused her to prove the said Will, (which then had clear'd the Estate from the claim of my Brother <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and saved me the expences of some Suits in Chancery, for no other end than to get the Will produced, which to this day, I am not able to do; Notwithstanding I have a Bill of Complaint depending before them for that purpose.)</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless all these discouragements, it pleased the Lord to give me a proportionable measure of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to submit unto his correcting hand; and in the most sore Afflictions (which I have undergone) he hath not with-held his loving kindnesses from me, nor the sweetness of his refreshing Spirit; though many Oppressions and Grievances were daily multipled, and many new Suits at Law were let on foot against me by my Wives means, who now seemed justified by them; and my self vilified and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued.</p>
                  <p>Yet was I not clamorous at their Bar, neither was I ever admitted to any private Speeches with them: or indeed did ever seek it (being confident) that my cause wanted the Protection of Justice only, and not favour; but waited, still expecting when they would put their good Promise in Execution, and send for us, and endeavour a cordial Reconciliation between us.</p>
                  <p>But after two months were expired, and hearing nothing from them to that purpose (though many several Friends of Quality had moved them thereunto) I addressed my self with an humble Petition for a hearing.</p>
                  <p>After it was read, they appointed a day (though it was somewhat far off) yet it did abundantly revive me, hoping that that day would be the end of my trouble; and that then, my Reputation and Estate, might be repaired; my Person freed from the continual molestation of Catchpoles; And my Wife her self (whom I had perfectly forgiven) restored unto my Bosom.</p>
                  <p>The Order which the Lords made in Answer to my Petition, was this.</p>

                  <p>My Hopes and Expectations being now raised from the Dust, I considered with my self, how I might represent the Case between me and my Wife, with the least prejudice to her: For upon some Debatings
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103513:46"/>
about the Witnesses I had examined against her, I found the Breach still made wider, by her Lawyers aggravations, than it was really in it self; what was but a scar, they would tear open into a wound; nay, they preferr'd a seeming <hi>Rhetorick</hi> so far before a <hi>Christianity,</hi> that rather than they would exasperate, they would speak <hi>Point Blank,</hi> to the very Papers they held in their hands.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, to prevent the like Inconveniences, and aiming at a perfect Reconciliation, I drew up all (that Counsel could be instructed in, or could offer at the Bar) into writing, and for each Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had a Paper ready to be presented) as follows.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">

                        <p>WHereas the Daught of an Order was on <hi>Friday August</hi> the 13th made, and presented unto your Honours by the Counsel of the Plaintiff, and Mr. <hi>Zanchie</hi> her Sollicitor, not entred into the Registers Book or drawn up by him from any Notes taken in Court, or was ever perused by the Defendants Counsel before it was signed, according to the Rules of the Court; in which Order it was mentioned, that <hi>300 l. per Annum</hi> should be raised out of the Fathers Estate, which was setled at the Marriage upon Sir <hi>John Brampston</hi> Knight, <hi>Orlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lando Bridgman,</hi>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>Mrs. <hi>Ivie,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Thomas Ivie,</hi> suggesteth by her Petition to the Lords Commissioners, That her Husband hath deserted her, and left her no means to live; That during her Cohabitation with him, she was in danger of her life, and became very weak, and for peril of receiving from him diseases of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence, she cannot Cohabite with him, and prays Relief.</p>
                  <p>The Question is, Whether in this Case she ought to have <hi>Alimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which it will be pertinent, to consider the near conjunction that is between Man and Wife, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of equal Authority, or there be a Superior, and in whom that Superiority resteth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Original female Ancestor was taken out of Man, and by the Marriage-bond were made one flesh, though several Individuals, like the Celestial <hi>Gemini,</hi> that makes but one Constellation; but the Government was placed upon the Man by God himself, who gave the Law in Paradise, saying, Thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire shall be to thy Husband, and he shall rule over thee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 34. and by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle remembred, That Women are commanded to be under obedience; so saith the Law; and that they submit themselves unto their own Husbands, as to the Lord that is supreme, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 22. Thus far for the <hi>Divine Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Common Law says, That a Woman that is married, is not <hi>sui Iuris,</hi> but <hi>sub potestate Viri,</hi> hath no will but her Husbands, though she may have a Stomach; therefore the Civil Acts she does are void in Common Law; she can neither take nor give any thing without her Husbands consent; She can have no reparation for any wrong done unto her Person by her self, without her Husband, and the dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that shall be recovered, shall go to the Husband and not to the Wife; And it is further to be considered the extention of that word <hi>Potestas</hi>; It is of a great latitude, for Soveraign Princes and Governours, though they have rule and power of the People; Yet they cannot beat, wound, or kill the People under them, nor do any thing to their Persons corporally; but according to their Laws, by Sentence or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the Husband hath power of Correction upon the Body of his Wife, and Servant, according to his own Judgment, so as he doth not wound nor kill, and is not prohibited by any Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Civil Law (as I take it) agrees with the Common Law; then it must follow by necessary consequence, that a married Woman without leave cannot depart from her Husband, which she must evidence by proof, no more than a Servant from his Master, a Subject from his Soveraign into forreign parts, who by his Missives is to return upon forfeit of his Estate; which makes good what was said before, that she is not <hi>sui Iuris,</hi> and in some sort expounds and explicates the <hi>potestatem Viri in Vxorem</hi>; for the Master may seize and carry away his Servant, if he find him, or implead him that shall keep him, and recover damages for the time he keeps him; so may the Husband by his Wife; which shews the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety and interest which the Husband hath in his Wife, and for loss of her society and company (though no other harm be done) he shall recover damages against the detainer.</p>
                  <p>Nay the Husband could not repudiate his Wife, but in case of Adultery, for that the Bill of divorce spoken of in the Old Law, was not given by God, but permitted by <hi>Moses,</hi> to prevent a greater mischief; for the <hi>Iews</hi> are cruel Men to their Wives, and to prevent <hi>Vxoricidium,</hi> he gave way to it, <hi>Sed non fuit sic ab initio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Case thus stated upon the impotencies and non-ability of the will of the Wife, and the just Rule and Power of the Husband over her Will and Person; tis considerable, whether by Law or Reason, a Wife departing without leave, shall have allowance to live separate, which is called <hi>Alimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alimony</hi> is a Thing not known at the Common or Civil Law, but indulged, and brought in by the Pope and his Canons, and very much put in Use by the late High Commission and Prerogativive Court of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wherein, upon Sentence of Separation from Bed and Board given by that Court, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was enjoyned to make allowance to the Wife, and the Husband enforced to give security for the payment, and many times imprisoned upon failure of performance; yet in those cases, both of Bonds and Imprisonments, the Husband upon <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> returnable in the upper Bench, where by Judgment of that Court, discharged of both, if the Husband cohabit, because the Law says, <hi>Quos Deus conjunxit, nemo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103513:46"/>
separet.</hi> So as without the Husbands consent no separation could be made, and if no separation, no <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor were personal Infirmities or Diseases contracted after Marriage sufficient cause for such separation, because she may Board though not Bed with such a Husband; but where the temper of her Husband was more severe and violent than discreet, That Court by the wisdom of prevention, which is better than the wisdom of remedies, did use, by way of caution, to take bond for the Husbands orderly usage of his Wife, to prevent the cruelty, whereof they had no Jurisdiction, but only in causes and <hi>salute Animae,</hi> and not <hi>pro reformatione Morum,</hi> which belongs to the Common Law, and where upon complaint by the Wife in that kind, the Common Law will enforce the Husband to give bond to secure both life and member of his Wife from maim and death.</p>
                  <p>And certainly <hi>Reason</hi> is against it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reason</hi> commands obedience to Superiors, generally the Apostle puts it further, for Conscience sake, and disobedience is not cherished by any Reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One end of Marriage is Mutual Society and Comfort, would be avoided by the Act of the Wife, which is not to be admitted upon the petulant Allegation of difference betwixt her and her Husband up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on personal Infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Marriage it self, and all the Laws of the Wifes subjection and capacity by so long time pronounced and received, by this means would be avoided.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If God himself was pleased to say, it was not good for a Man to be alone, then surely we may safely say, it is not good for a Woman to be alone; for though they are the weaker Vessel, and have the lesser Reason, yet they have the stronger Passions, and more violent Desires, and so more subject to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and Sin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the inevitable Danger of illegitimate Bastards, and Clandestine Issues (where the Wife is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) who concealed it till the Husbands death, are yet inheritable to his Land (though never begotten by him;) This Inconvenience sadly weighed, and how Epidemically it may run to all Families of this Nation, is of it self a sufficient convincing Reason, to bridle the rash hot appetite of inconsiderable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and avoid all <hi>Alimony.</hi> But on the other side, if any Husband shall be so unjust to his Wife, and unkind to his own Flesh, whom he is bound by Law to maintain, as to separate from her, and will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite with her, <hi>Nisi propter Adulterium,</hi> or will consent to separate, it is most reasonable he should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her convenient maintenance; else he should take advantage of his own wrong and humour, and Women should be in a worse case and condition than Servants, who, during their contract, must have their Wages, which between Husband and Wife ends not till death. And it is conceived the Act of Parliament, which impowreth the Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal to allow <hi>Alimony,</hi> chiefly and naturally intends Relief, where the Husband doth repudiate, and not the Wife; the words being upon consideration as well of the Portion or Estate that hath been paid, or come to the Husband by such Wife as shall pray Relief.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in this particular Case, it may be very justly insisted, even from the Sence and Letter of the Act; as also that 'twas Mrs. <hi>Ivie</hi> separated her self from her Husband, 'twas not her Husband left her; Nay, after she was gone, he used all affectionated and prudential means to bring her home to Cohabit with him, neither doth he desist in the prosecution of it, but hath several ways attempted it, even until this day, and doth still declare and protest his willingness to receive her, whensoever she will Return, and give security for his well Usage of her.</p>
                  <p>That she wanted nothing before her departure, but was indeed maintained far above her quality, is most clear from the Depositions, and it is clear also from the Depositions, that there was no deserting of her by her Husband, but that her departure was absolutely upon Advice and Consideration design'd by her self and her Abettors, especially if your Lordships please to remember those unhandsome corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies held by her with Gentlemen under feigned names; her frequenting and meeting them in scandalous houses in <hi>Long-Acre</hi> and other places, at unseasonable times of the Night, under the pretence of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from her Husband (being a Bed) to her Devotion; Those horrid and detestable plots upon <hi>Iane Gilbert,</hi> even to the losing of her life; Her charging her Husband with foul diseases, of which he was cleared upon Oath by the President of the College and other learned Physicians; And also her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and Sollicitations to her Brother <hi>Iohn Stepkins</hi> to murder her Husband, which appears by the Oath of the said <hi>Stepkins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover seeing that there is a Caution in the Act, that the allowance to the repudiated Wife ought to be proportionable to the <hi>Fortune</hi> she brought her Husband: May it therefore please your Honours to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he never received any penny Portion as yet, and hath great reasen to doubt whether ever he shall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the Estate of her Father is at the present in the aforesaid Trustees, and not in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, nay it is so setled on them, that unless I can raise and secure 4000 <hi>l.</hi> more besides 7000 <hi>l.</hi> already laid out, they are not obliged, neither will they, nor can they convey it to the Defendant, as appears by the Indenture of Settlement.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In case they should convey and settle on the Defendant the said Estate, 'tis only for his life, and no longer; for which Estate, being only 240 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> He has disbursed and laid out far more money than it is worth; this appears from the Indenture (<hi>viz.</hi>) a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> in ready money, to free the Estate from incumbrances three years since.</p>
                  <p>The Interest whereof comes to 200 <hi>l.</hi> In Jewels, Pearls, Ambergreeze, Bezoar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the value of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> There was also spent in Law to enforce the Trustees, who were kept back and hindred by Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> her Father, to settle the Estate according to the Covenants, and for the Fine and Recovery 200 <hi>l.</hi> more at least, which makes 2600 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103513:47"/>That notwithstanding all the aforesaid Sums of Money have been laid out by the Defendant, the <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees</hi> do still refuse to convey the Estate to the Defendant, and the Plaintiffs Brother (as Heir at Law) hath since the Death of his Father, got the Possession of the Estate, and receives the Rents, Issues and Profits thereof: Insomuch that the Defendant hath been necessitated to expend great Sums of Money to maintain several Sutes at Law, both against the Trustees and Heir at Law, in Preservation of his Estate for Life, which he has so dearly bought as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>That by the Plaintiffs means there has been consumed and wasted of his Estate 4000 <hi>l. (viz.)</hi> 3000 <hi>l.</hi> since Marriage spent on her, 500 <hi>l.</hi> given in Money, 100 <hi>l.</hi> given to Gentlemen of her Familiar Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to perswade her to go into the Country, 300 <hi>l.</hi> taken in Silks and Plate from the Defendant, whilst that he was at the Court of Aldermen: He has also contracted several great Debts to the value of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> besides 1000 <hi>l.</hi> spent in this unhappy Sute, and must therefore necessarily (in case 300 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> be taken from him) be cast into Prison the most part of his Life (he having but 632 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of his own Estate) and that for his Life only, both to pay all his Debts aforesaid, and to live on beside.</p>
                  <p>Excepting the 240 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> which if it be recovered from the Heir of <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and recovered by the Trustees, all which will yield but a scant and bare Maintenance for himself, Wife and Family, to raise out of it 3000 <hi>l.</hi> for the Creditors, and 4000 <hi>l.</hi> more according to the Indenture of Settlement, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Defendant be acquitted and discharged of the said 4000 <hi>l.</hi> by the last Will and Testament of the Plaintiffs Father, in whom the remainder of the Estate was, in case the Defendant should have no Issue, or not perform the Covenants which he stands obliged to perform in the said Deed: And though the Defendant is credibly informed, that the said remainder is disposed of to the said Plaintiff, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is also acquitted from all performance of any Covenants expressed in the said Deed of Settlement; Yet so it is, that the Plaintiff having got Possession of the said Will, and by Combination with Sir <hi>Iohn Brampston</hi> Kr. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Son, the sole Executor of it, still keeps and detains the said Will from being legally proved: Insomuch that the Defendant cannot make any Benefit of the said Estate, nor by Law enforce the Plaintiff to produce the Will (she being his Wife.) That this is not a bare Suggestion, I doubt not but is very evident to your Lordships, she and her Sollicitor <hi>Zanchey</hi> having often avouch'd in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships presence, that both there is such a Will, and that your Lordships have seen it: This is also very well known unto her Council Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who caused to be delivered unto Sir <hi>W. Row</hi> a true Copy of the said Will taken from the Original, which was long in his Custody. But such is the Plaintiffs Malice to the Defendants Person and Estate, that she still suppresses and hinders the proving of it, which is the sole cause of the Continuance of many great Sutes and vast Expences to the Defendant, both with the Heirs at Law, the Executors of the said Will, and the Trustees of the said Estate; That both the Defendant and Plaintiff must necessarily be defeated of all Hopes of ever enjoying the Father's Estate for the future, unless the 4000 <hi>l.</hi> aforesaid be raised and disposed of, according as is limited and appointed in the Deed of Settlement, or the said Will proved, for in Default thereof, the Trusttes are obliged by the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture to settle the said Estate on the Plaintiffs Father, and his Heirs for ever.</p>
                  <p>And the Estate is not as yet recovered by the Defendant, but is still invested in the Trustees, (who are no Parties to these Proceedings) and in the Possession of the Heir at Law; Insomuch that no <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> as the Defendant is advised by his Counsel, can be ordered from hence, because the Ordinance of Parliament impowereth the Lords Commissioners to allow the Maintenance out of the Husband's Estate, not out of any others whatsoever. And the Plaintiff hath or ought to have in her Custody 1200 <hi>l.</hi> worth of Jewels, which were delivered her according to the Indenture of Settlement at the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage: And in case the Defendant survive her, ought to be restored to the Defendant, who hath too great reason to suspect that they are wasted and embezelled; and therefore the Defendant humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth your Lordships, that instead of giving her <hi>Alimony,</hi> you will be pleased to force her to give good Security unto the Defendant, or bring the Jewels into Court, that so he may not be cheated of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> by the Plaintiff and her Abettors; and unless your Honours yield to secure the said Jewels whilst this Cause depends before you, he doth not conceive where or how he can be redressed from any Court of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That about the beginning of these Unhappy Differences, it was proposed both by the Plaintiff and her Father, that in case she might have her liberty to live where she would, that she would accept of 120 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> for her Maintenance, and look on it as a very good Provision; which accordingly was agreed upon, and drawn into Writing, and Engrossed, by and with the Consent of Sir <hi>Iohn Brampstone</hi> her Uncle, and <hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> two of her Trustees; her Father also promising that his Estate should be setled according to the Covenants on the Defendant, without further Sute of Law; but the said Defendant was unwilling to Seal it, being very tender to Act any thing that might separate him from the continual Enjoyment and Society of his Wife; so that 300 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> is more than her self, Father, Trustees and Friends, did think fitting by 180 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Petition it self is both False and Scandalous, and hath been disproved by several Witnesses; nay the contrary also proved by Persons of Quality, that she lived very Plentifully in great abundance, rather beyond, than under her Quality in every respect, as the Defendant hopeth is most visible to your Honours.</p>
                  <p>That notwithstanding such vast Sums have been expended on her by her means, and that the said Defendant is to pay to Creditors 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and to raise 4000 <hi>l.</hi> more to be secured unto the Trustees as aforesaid; And that in case he recover the Plaintiffs Father's Estate, 'twill not, with his own, make above 872 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> out of which all these Moneys must be raised; and in case 300 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> of this shall be taken away out of the Plaintiffs Father's Estate, which he has dearly bought, and purchased; That 'twill be impossible for the Defendant to avoid perpetual Imprisonment, but must be kept in Goal, and the Creditors Defrauded, and must there perish, and himself be cheated also of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> worth of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103513:47"/>
Jewels; yet he is most willing to receive her, and take her, again, and forget all former Passages whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that so they may be for the future lead a peaceable and godly Life together.</p>
                  <p>Counsel also I did retain, very many, and great ones; That in Case the Lords should refuse the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and would not hear the Merits of the Cause in Publick, (in regard I might not be wanting, to lose the opportunity of that Time which they had ordered for me) I drew up also to be rendred at the same time (that (if it had been possible) I might have prevented both Reading and Arguing too) this short Petition following.</p>

                        <p>That he cannot Despair in the infinite Mercy of God, in whose hands are the hearts and desires of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, But that his Wife (notwithstanding such vast sums of Money have been wasted, and such odious aspersions cast on him) may yet return, and take Comfort from her Husband (being passionately desirous to receive her) if all Christian and prudent means, may be applied.</p>
                        <p>That for your Petitioners part, he doth (as in the presence of God) forgive her from the bottom of his Soul, and is most willing to cohabit with her, so long as he liveth on Earth.</p>
                        <p>That he hath often desired to express unto her, and used all the Industry (as Man can imagine) but once to speak with her (even before any of her Friends, to let her know so much) but could never obtain any such meeting from her.</p>
                        <p>In Order hereunto, he very willing that a Godly and Conscientious Divine, (may be received to live in house with your Petitioner and his Wife,) both to exhort and instruct them in their Duties towards God, and one another; and to perform all Gospel, and Family-Duties amongst them: for certainly the Lord will not deny a Blessing on those means which he hath ordained; and which is unfeignedly sought after by a broken and contrite Spirit.

                  <p>When the Day came, and the Counsel began to speak, my hopes were quickly commanded to vanish, and the Counsel to hold their Peace; for they suddenly declared, That they would not hear the Merits of the Cause.</p>
                  <p>With much pressing, Mr. <hi>Lisle</hi> read the Petition; And though they took evident notice of it, yet would they not return any Answer to it; or so much as demand of my Wife, (who stood there laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Presence) whether she would return to me, or no; Only they were pleased to find fault with that word [<hi>Separation,</hi>] And told my Counsel, That they neither had, or could separate our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>These words they had no sooner spoke, but (I confess) I laid hold on; though I had been most hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and severely dealt withal, in the judgment of those that were present.</p>
                  <p>Insomuch, That now I did despair, ever to find amongst them, and indeed, did determine to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my Cause unto God, until (in his due time) he should raise up Judges in our <hi>Israel,</hi> who should exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Righteous Judgment, even upon those Judges themselves.</p>
                  <p>But in the mean time, I was advised (which was very agreeable unto my own Disposition, not to leave any thing unattempted, which might be thought advantagious to a union of Us,) but to go personally to my Wife, and persuade her my self, to leave those Persons who aimed at both our Ruines, And to return to me, (passionately willing to receive her.)</p>
                  <p>And if she should, (notwithstanding) refuse to speak, or go with me, then to demand her of those Persons who received her into their houses.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, (taking two civil Gentlemen) I went to her Lodging, but received a Repulse from her, instead of Compliance; and then, seeing Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> (who kept the house) I required from him the person of my Wife, who refusing her, was sued by me.</p>
                  <p>And upon the Tryal before my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Roles</hi> (a renowned Person) had a Verdict, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Execution of 100 <hi>l.</hi> against the said <hi>Williamson,</hi> for detaining my Wife from me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:103513:48"/>Many Counsels there were to argue the Case; and the Decree in it self (under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) was opened, read and shewed the Jury: But my Lord <hi>Roles</hi> quickly stated the resolution of the Case in my behalf, and the Jury gave me 100 <hi>l.</hi> damages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Williamson</hi> (now finding himself in a great <hi>Dilemma</hi>) either to deliver up my Wife, or himself, to ruine; and my Wife in so bad a condition, (notwithstanding her glorious Decree) that although she had 300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> yet if she could not take the liberty of her old Companions, or any new one (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she should be entertained) for fear of Judgment and Executions; began to take new Counsel, how to free Mr. <hi>Williamson</hi> and her self from this bondage of living under the Roof of a Husbands House; and the truth is, sollicited it to the purpose (amongst her old <hi>Patrons</hi>) the Lords Commissioners.</p>
                  <p>For with all speed, <hi>Williamson</hi> prefers a Bill in Chancery to be relieved against my Execution. And after he had preferred his Bill (though my Answer was so clear, as it could not admit of one excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) moved for an <hi>Injunction</hi> (after Judgment and Execution granted at Law) and to protect him for keeping away my Wife; which was granted in these words, (as fully as he could desire) being ingrossed in Parchment and sealed.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Injunction</hi> (being now Granted, Signed and Sealed, with the Commissioners Hands under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>) is the Accomplishment of all their Designs; and the compleating of my Misery; though the Courts of Law, both could and have (in some measure) relieved me; yet is the power of it restrained by this <hi>Injunction</hi>; which indeed I suppose can be called nothing else, than a perfect <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and <hi>Divorce</hi>: Whether the Chancery (being stiled the High Court) ever receives from any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, such an unlimited power as this; It behoves them to make our unto your Highness.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the Opinion, both of the greatest and honestest Counsel of <hi>England</hi>; That no parallel for this Case, no President of the like Nature, is to be found on Record; Nay, they are not backward to aver, That it is as contrary to the Word of God, the Law of the Nations, the Civil Law, the Law of our own Country, as well as the Practice of the Chancery it self.</p>
                  <p>Once did that Court (by its own Authority) issue out a Sequestration upon a Gentlemans Estate, and it was by very many Persons admired, and murmur'd at; but never could I hear, that they ever seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred Women from their Husbands.</p>
                  <p>Were there not a superiour Jurisdiction over this Court, (whose Determinations seems too too Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,) being gounded solely upon the Opinions (not to say the Passions or Affections) of two or three Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men, what a miserable Bondage and Slavery were this Nation in? What Benefit could we expect from all the good Laws of former Ages, if their power may be quell'd, or supprest at the pleasure of the Chancery? They might have (for ought I know) made an Injunction also, that I should never complain; and if I had attempted to have made known my Case, to have laid me by the heels.</p>
                  <p>But blessed be the Name of our God <hi>Iehovah,</hi> whose extraordinary Providence hath been visible in this Land, that he hath raised up and setled your Highness to be next under himself the Supreme Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of Justice and Righteousness to these Nations, which the Lord has happily placed under your Highness Government. By which means we have a just confidence to be assur'd, having had many Experiences already of your Highnesses singular piety and justice in those several Stations where the Lord has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed you. That there shall be no more complainings made, either in our Streets, or in the very Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our Country, but shall be heard, and relieved, even against the Great Ones amongst us.</p>
                  <p>'Tis your Highness Power therefore which I implore; 'tis only your Power can free me from those Fetters which are laid upon me by the Lords Commissioners; only your Power that can repair me for the Injuries done, (both to my Person and Estate, which I have undergone) by Reason of my seduced Wife; 'Tis you alone, that can restore me the Benefit of the Law, against those that have been Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries and Abettors of these unnatural differences between us: That so my Reputation (which hath been a long time clouded) may be made clear; my Person (which hath continually be molested with Carchpoles by my Wives means) may be at length free; And that I may be in a condition to satisfie my Creditors (their just Debts) whose Purses have supported me; and that a final end may be put to these unnatural differences, concerning my Wife, as in Justice and Conscience shall seem meet unto your Highness.</p>

                        <p>THat your Petitioners Wife very suddenly after her Intermarriage with him, having got from him a Ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>1000 l. per Annum,</hi> with <hi>1000 l.</hi> in ready money to be left her at the time of his death, and <hi>1200 l.</hi> in Iewels, <hi>600 l.</hi> worth of Cloaths, <hi>500 l.</hi> in ready money, and accommodation to the value of <hi>3000 l.</hi> in less than in <hi>18</hi> months time, (and all this without one Penny Portion with her) hath not only deserted his Company, but hath preferr'd a Scandalous Petition to the Lords Commissioners for the Great Seal against him, yet nothing material proved.</p>
                        <p>That by these unnatural Courses, she hath caused him to spend <hi>3000 l.</hi> in this and Twelve other Suits at Law; by which means aforesaid, your Petitioner is become indebted at this present time <hi>3000 l.</hi> more at least.</p>
                        <p>That he hath often tendred unto the said Commissioners his Willingness to receive her, and to give any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which they can require, to use her with all loving Respects becoming a good Husband.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the said Commissioners have allowed her <hi>300 l. per Annum</hi> Alimony; and refused to hear the Merits of the Cause, though they had ordered it under their hands; and have also granted an Injunction to protect such (who keep the Person of his Wife from him) contrary to Law.</p>

                        <head>To the Parliament for the Common-wealth of <hi>England.</hi> The State of the Case of <hi>Thomas Ivie,</hi> Esquire.</head>
                        <p>THat Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> about <hi>October</hi> 1649. took to Wife <hi>Theodosia Garret,</hi> Widow, Daughter of <hi>Iohn Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> 
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> on whom, by reason of the great affection, which he bore unto her, he setled 1000 <hi>l. per Annum, Ioynture,</hi> and gave also security to leave 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in ready money at the time of his death, and this without any consideration of a Portion from her Father, or any Estate left her by her former Husband, who not only left her without a Joynture, but in debt also.</p>
                        <p>That the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> perceiving how really Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> stood affected to his said Daughter, and with what chearfulness and willingness he was resolved to settle all his Estate for the good and preferment of his said Daughter; was content, that if Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> would free his the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> Estate, which was 240 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> then encumbred with several Debts, or pay a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> towards the same, and deliver into the hands of the said Daughter 1200 <hi>l.</hi> in Jewels, that then it should be setled on Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> for his Life, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the use of his Daughter for her Life; And in case, he had no Issue by her, then to the Heirs general of the said <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or such as the said <hi>Stepkins</hi> should limit and appoint.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> did deliver unto the said <hi>Theodosia,</hi> rich Jewels, to the value of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> in ready mony to the said <hi>Stepkins,</hi> to free his Estate accordingly.</p>
                        <p>That Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> then expected a reciprocal return of his affection, which he had so cordially demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But when the said 1000 <hi>l.</hi> was paid, and a firm and legal settlement of the Joynture made, and the Jewels delivered to his said Wife, He found great reason to suspect, that 'twas rather his Fortune than himself, which she had wedded: For she not only sought all means to avoid his Company, but chose out those as she thought might be most offensive to him, and such (whom by reason of the scandal they lay under) he had prohibited her to converse with.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding, seeing it was the pleasure of the Lord to unite them in so near a union; Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> was resolved not to leave any fair and honest motives (either of Purse or Persuasion) unattempted, which might encline her affection towards him; and in order hereunto (there was nothing which she ever proposed, which might be for her content) that he did deny unto her: And in less than fourteen Months, she expended in Apparel, 600 <hi>l.</hi> in ready mony 500 <hi>l.</hi> and for other Accommodations about 2800 <hi>l.</hi> besides the 1200 <hi>l.</hi> in Jewels, and 1000 <hi>l.</hi> in mony aforesaid; which amounts to 6100 <hi>l.</hi> Nay, the Gifts were so great he bestowed on her, That he supposeth, she was even ashamed to request any more from him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:103513:49"/>Nevertheless she, by the evil Counsel of her Confederates (while he was at the Court of Aldermen) did convey out of his House, Plate, and rich East-india Stuffs, to the value of 300 <hi>l.</hi> and divers other goods, which were by her and her Confederates carried away and imbezeled.</p>
                        <p>That Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> now finding his own Estate, as well as his Wives Affection, too too visibly declining; and that nothing could attend such an unhappy condition, but Ruine and Dishonour; to prevent both, persuaded his said Wife to retire with him for a while to his Estate in the Country; thinking thereby to to take her off from the Temptations of those seducing Persons, who engaged her in such pernicious courses.</p>
                        <p>But instead of a compliance, he found a greater Obstinacy than ever; neither could her own Friends, (who then persuaded her to leave the City for a while) prevail with her. And that there might be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry wanting to persuade her, he gave 100 <hi>l.</hi> to two persons of her familiar Acquaintance, to be urgent and sollicitous to endeavour the Accomplishment of his desire.</p>
                        <p>But by the Practises of the said Confederates, she was seduced to the preferring of a vile, scandalous, and false Petition to the Lords Commissioners against Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> for obtaining <hi>Alimony</hi>; but not one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of her suggestions proved against him: Nay, the contrary proved by Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> by the several Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of many Persons of good Quality and Reputation, as appears by the Depositions themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his own Oath, which he made in answer to the scandalous aspersions cast upon him.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this Vindication, after two years dependance in the Chancery, and the Expences of almost 3000 <hi>l.</hi> in this unnatural, and twelve other Suits at Law, (which were commenc'd against him, by the means of this Suit) she obtained from the Lords Commissioners an Order in private for 300 <hi>l. per Ann. Alimony.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(Notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> was always ready to receive her, and use her in all Respects according to her Quality neither, Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi>) nor his Counsel being present. Notwithstanding they declared, That they would send for Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> before they would give Judgment in the Case; But never as yet did, nor ever yet heard the Merits of the Cause; which (in respect of the proceedings) was contrary to the Rules of the Court; and in respect of the Allowance (in case Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> had been guilty of the Complaint) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Act of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>Having thus Affliction added to Affliction, and being in Debt by the means of his said Wife above 3000 <hi>l.</hi> And having not wherewithal to sell to pay his Creditors, (And in regard the Reversion of his Estate is setled on his said Wife) he attended almost a year upon the Lords Commissioners for his Relief, that they would be pleased but to grant him a fair hearing upon the Merits of the Cause, in the presence of both parties, with their Counsel; which was by their Order accordingly granted, and a Day by them appointed.</p>
                        <p>But when the Day came, and Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> had retained to his great charge, many great Counsel, the Lords Commissioners absolutely refused to hear the said Cause; which hath exposed the said Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> and his Wife to all manner of Temptations, and their Persons and Estates to utter Ruine.</p>
                        <p>And although at the same time Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> did Request the said Lords Commissioners to recommend any godly Minister, whom they themselves should choose to live in house with him and his Wife (as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to a Peace and Reconciliation between them) for which he obliged himself to allow any such Minister 50 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> besides all other fitting Accommodations whatsoever; yet was this Proposal slighted by them, and laughed at by his said Wife, even in the presence of their Lordships.</p>
                        <p>And since that time Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> having sued those (who received her, and denyed her unto him) and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by just proceedings in Law, a Judgment and Execution against such Persons, the Lords Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners have notwithstanding granted their <hi>Injunction</hi> for their <hi>Protection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Insomuch, that they have now effected an absolute Separation; which is contrary to the Law of the Nation, and the Act of Parliament for <hi>Alimony</hi> it self; which was declared by my Lord Chief Justice <hi>Roles</hi> upon Reading the Decree for <hi>Alimony.</hi>
