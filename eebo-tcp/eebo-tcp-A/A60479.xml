         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere have been ſo many <hi>Wolves</hi> in ſheeps-cloathing, and ſo many <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi> by the reviling tongues of their Enemies, robbing them of their good names as well as of their good eſtates, made <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> in this our worſe than <hi>iron age,</hi> that I know not what <hi>Epithite</hi> to give thee; If thou art an Honeſt man, <hi>Rara avis in terris,</hi> I invoke thee to be my Patron; If thou art not, <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> But ſince St. <hi>Austin,</hi> once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as zealous a Reprobate as thy ſelf, was converted by looking on the Bible by chance, I will not prohibit thee from eating of this fruit: Though, I believe, to think that thy view of my Book will work the like converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on thee, is to have a better opinion of thee and the Book, than both will deſerve: For, though an Angel ſhould come from heaven, or a man ariſe from the dead, yet could he not perſwade our <hi>hot-headed Zealots,</hi> but that they did God good ſervice, even when they rebell

againſt his own <hi>Ordinance,</hi> tranſgreſs his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> murther their <hi>Father,</hi> the KING, and pollute their once flouriſhing <hi>Mother,</hi> the CHURCH. Before this prodigious off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, like <hi>Vipers,</hi> deſtroyed the <hi>Mother</hi> by their birth; The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed murthered the Lord of life, becauſe they did not know him, and therefore thought it was pleaſing to God. But wo be to them, who did not only with <hi>Ham,</hi> ſee their Fathers nakedneſs, and reproach him, but commit <hi>Paricide,</hi> ſee his heart, naked, and call the multitude to laugh at it, — <hi>En quo diſcordia Cives produxit miſeros?</hi> O the miſerable effects of ſeditious men! Who ſhall now cure the <hi>Kings evil?</hi> Or who ſhall cure the evil of the People? O purblind <hi>City,</hi> how long will you enſlave yourſelves to ravenous woolves? who by their often changing of their feigned Governments, do but change the thief, and ſtill your Store-houſes muſt be the Magazine, to furniſh them with plunder. You muſt never look to enjoy your lives, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, or Gods bleſſing, with the fruition of your Wives, and Children, before your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King and Soveraign <hi>CHARLS</hi> the II. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly baniſhed by Rebells, be reſtored to his Crown and Kingdom; For what Comfort
<pb facs="tcp:108856:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can any honeſt or conſcientious man take, in any thing, ſo long as he ſeeth his own native Prince, like King <hi>David,</hi> driven from his own natural inheritance, by the unjuſt force of a multitude of Traytors, both to God and their King? Who <hi>Judas</hi>-like, acknowledging his Maſter with a kiſs, ſo they ſwore with their mouthes, that King CHARLS the I. was their only lawfull King and Soveraign, and had the Supreme power over them all, and then deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to the Sword-men, who came out with Clubbs and Staves againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, as againſt a Thief: and as the Jews did the Lord our Saviour, whom they did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be their King, otherwiſe they would not have done it; Theſe men murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their dread Soveraign, whom they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and vowed to be their only King; Excelling the Jewes only in wickedneſſe. Therefore, ſince by the Laws of the Land, there can be no Parliament without the King, what difference is there between a Protector, and one of their Parliaments, but only num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? For their Protectors are but the head thieves, and their Parliaments but a headleſs multitude of thieves: For ſo long as the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Progenie of CHARLS the I. (which God

long preſerve) remain alive, all other our Governours beſides them, will be but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells, Traytors, and Tyrants, let them call themſelves a <hi>Free State,</hi> or by what names they pleaſe, &amp; continue until the worlds end.

But there are thoſe amongſt us, who have turned the <hi>Suppoſition</hi> into a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and confidently by their practice affirm, that it is lawfull to forſwear one ſelf for <hi>any thing,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108856:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and moſt ſacred to be <hi>forſworn,</hi> if by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury a Kingdom may be gained. But I will not touch the Soars which lye raw before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans eyes, only this will I ſay, which every one knoweth to be true, that no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the World was ſo happy both for peace and plenty, law and religion, and all other good things, as our Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was, whileſt due obedience was lawfully paid to our Soveraign Lord the King, but now the King being murthered and all goodneſs with him, no Nation under the Sun is more miſerable, and ſo it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue untill <hi>King Charles</hi> the ſecond be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Crown. The Sword of Gods word ought only to fight for Religion; the Iron ſword of Rebels did never eſtabliſh Chriſtian Religion, nor ever will ſet up Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, eſpecially if it be unſheathed againſt Kings by their Subjects. And to ſatisfie all Objections whatſoever againſt my writing, I anſwer, <hi>Si natura negat facit indignatio verſum</hi>: It was not to ſhew my ſelf to the world (for as in Tempeſts, ſo in our daies, he is beſt who is ſeen leaſt abroad,) But it was to ſhew and prefer the Truth, which hath been laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep by the Charmes of our Sins: For <hi>to

and frivolous, becauſe the ſupreme power being but one, muſt be placed in one ſort of Governors, either only in <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or only in <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or only in <hi>Democracy</hi>; Our Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver until now claimed either <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi>; Therefore, as hitherto it hath been granted, ſo the Government muſt of neceſſity ſtill be <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical</hi>: And the gracious Conceſſions of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, not to make Laws without a Parliament, do not make the Parliament ſharer, or his equal in the Soveraignty, becauſe, as I ſhewed before, the Parliament hath no power but what is derived from the King.

               <hi>MOnarchy</hi> is either <hi>Lordly,</hi> or <hi>Royal; Lordly</hi> is where the <hi>Monarch</hi> by the Law of Arms, in a lawfull war becometh <hi>Lord</hi> of the goods and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Conquered, governing them, as the Maſter of a family doth his ſlaves, how he pleaſeth; And it is concluded by all that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the firſt <hi>Lordly Monarch.</hi>

            <p>But ſince our age is given to nothing but vain imaginations, there be ſome who do Imagine, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108856:56"/>
will object that <hi>Adam</hi> was no King, becauſe he is not ſtiled ſo in Scripture. I anſwer (though this frivolous objection doth not deſerve an anſwer) that neither do you find <hi>Adam</hi> ſtiled in Scripture, my Father, or thy Father, yet <hi>Adam</hi> was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all fleſh; <hi>Si res apparet, Cur de nomine certas?</hi> He that hath the ſupreme power is a King; But <hi>Adam</hi> had the ſupreme power, <hi>Ergo, Adam</hi> was a King. <hi>Rex</hi> cometh from <hi>Regere</hi> to rule, and <hi>Adam</hi> was ſole Lord, Ruler, and King, and ſo continued untill he died. <hi>Adam</hi> was created by God, the Monarch of the World, before he had any ſubjects, And by right of Nature it was due to <hi>Adam</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his poſterity, even before his ſubjects were born: So that, though not in <hi>act,</hi> yet in <hi>habit Adam</hi> was a king from his creation; Neither could <hi>Eve,</hi> nor her Children ever limit <hi>Adams</hi> power. It was God that gave the power, therefore no Mortals could ever diminiſh or increaſe it. For, <hi>Quid Jove majus habetur?</hi> They muſt be above all that which is called godlineſſe, who go about to put aſunder, that which the Almighty hath joyned together. This Paternal power continued Monarchical, to the Floud, and after the Floud, to the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> at which time God ſcattered the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad from thence, upon the face of the whole earth, as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10, &amp; 11. Yet they went out by Colonies of whole families, over which the prime Fathers had the Soveraignty, and were kings, deriving their Fatherly and Regal power from <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe Sons or Grand-children they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108856:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were all. And although I think there are but few Kings in the world, who can prove their title to their Crown hereditary, ever ſince <hi>Noahs</hi> Floud, or the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> yet it is as true, that there is a Regal right, continuing in the Father-hood, even untill this day, and that the next heir to <hi>Adam</hi> ought to have the Supreme power, as it is true, that the father hath right, &amp; ought to govern his Children, or as that it is a rule, <hi>Qui prior est tempore potior eſt jure</hi>; He that is eldeſt, by Law ought to rule: For God told <hi>Cain</hi> the eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. That unto him ſhould be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his youngeſt brother, and that he ſhould rule over him, which continueth a Law until this preſent time: But though we know not which is the next heir to <hi>Adam</hi> in any convention of the people, (which is the fault of our ignorance, not of <hi>nature</hi>) yet ſince God hath told us in his Holy Word, that he only diſpoſeth of Crowns, as he pleaſeth; Therefore they can not go out of the right line, ſo long as he directeth and guideth them, though the right in the Father-hood lye dormant. Every King is a Father, therefore every ſubject muſt be obedient to his fatherly power, otherwiſe he will break Gods Commandment, <hi>viz. Honour thy Father,</hi> &amp;c. God only had right to give, and take away Crowns, and thereby to adopt ſubjects into the allegiance of another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly power.</p>
            <p>Therefore no leſs falſe than execrable is their opinion, who promulge that all men whereby na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>But ſuppoſe all men were born free by nature, and that the people originally by nature had power to chuſe a King? after what manner, or how is it poſſible for them to make their choice? it muſt be by the joint conſent of every reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Male and Female, Old and Young, Babes and Antient men, Sick and Lame, all at one time <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Contradicente</hi>: for if natural freedom be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all, the <hi>Major</hi> part of the whole people in the world, or the <hi>Major</hi> part of the people of a Kingdom, have no power to binde the leſſer part to their conſent, and agreement; Every one being as free by birth, and having as much power as any other: For the <hi>Major</hi> part never bindeth, but where men at firſt either agree to be ſo bound, or where a higher power ſo commands: Now there being no higher power than Nature, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where neither Nature nor God appoints the <hi>Major</hi> part to binde, The conſent of the <hi>Major</hi> part is not binding to any, but only to themſelves who conſent; Thoſe who are born afterwards (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenets of natural freedome) are not

ſo there is a difference of powers amongſt men, the power of a King, inferior to no power on earth but only Gods, the power of the Subjects inferior to the power of the King; the power of a Father over his Children; and the power of a Husband over his Wife; and ſo every power limitted by God; and as one Star doth excel another in brightneſſe, ſo one power doth excel another in dignity and glory. There is nothing more plain and evidently aſſerted in the Scripture, than that Kingly power is the moſt Sacred, Divine, and glorious of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, immediately from God, peculiarly owned by him, as a power wherin his Nature and Majeſty is moſt manifeſted; and as I have already ſhewed, hath a ſhadow of all Divine Excellencies.

            <p>In the ſecond ſenſe, Soveraignty is conferred on kings immediatly from God, though ſome created act, as Election, Succeſſion, Conqueſt, or any other ordinary act intervene; For the interpoſed act containeth not in it power to confer Soveraignty, but that power cometh formally and virtually from God, and ſo relateth to him as the proper Donor, and immediate Author; As when a king giveth power to a <hi>favourite,</hi> to make a <hi>Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Baron,</hi> yet who is ſo ſtupid as to averr that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a <hi>Lord,</hi> or a <hi>Baron,</hi> cometh immediatly from the <hi>favourite,</hi> and not from the king?

his Title was not only by birthright, but alſo the people would have made him King, and if thoſe people had had as much power as the people of <hi>England</hi> pretend to have, <hi>Adonijah</hi> would have wanted no other title than their power; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> are not afraid to ſay like Gods, <hi>By us Kings reign, we throw down Kings &amp; ſet them up again, there is no power but what comes from us, they provide themſelves Kings, they have ſpoken once, yea twice have I heard this, that Power belongeth unto them, and that their Kings are only Derivatives from them, O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum, horrendum, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.</hi> Did ever the world produce ſuch blind prodigious Monſters?

The Laws are the reigns with which the King governeth and guideth the people; how can the Charioter rule his horſes, if he hath not the free uſe, and power over the reigns? and by what means can the King rule, and direct his people, if he hath not the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Laws? with which he is to guide them, not they him.</p>
            <p>If the Law be equal in power with the king, then why doth the king pardon thoſe, whom the Law condemneth, alter the old Laws, and make new
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108856:82"/>
Laws? For <hi>par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> every boy can tell that a man hath no power to command his equal; but ſuppoſe the Laws ſhould be equal or above the king, who ſhould put theſe Laws in execution? The people cannot, becauſe (as I have already ſhewen) they are Inferior to the king, and <hi>Contra rationem eſt contraque naturam, ſuperiorem ab inferiore judicari,</hi> ſaith <hi>Barclay,</hi> It is againſt reaſon and nature, that the Superiour ſhould be judged by the Inferiour. Therefore though nothing can be ſo true and plain, but that ſubtle Sophiſters, by Siniſter and falſe interpretations, and gloſſes, will make it obſcure; yet it is an inviolable truth, that the king is above the Law, and therefore <hi>Rex non poteſt facere injuriam,</hi> the king can do no wrong, for <hi>ubi non eſt Lex, ibi non eſt tranſgreſſio, quo ad mundum,</hi> where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſſion, as to the world. <hi>Quiſquis ſummum obtinet imperium, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve is ſit unus Rex, ſive pauci nobiles, vel ipſe populus uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus, ſupra omnes leges ſunt, Ratio haec est, quod nemo ſibi feret legem, ſed ſubditis ſuis, ſe legibus nemo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Saravia,</hi> de Imperand. autor. li. 2. c. 3. Every Governour, let the Government be Monarchie, Ariſtocracie, or Democracie, is above all the Laws; for no man can impoſe Laws on himſelf, but on his ſubjects, and no man can bind himſelf to keep his own Laws, becauſe as <hi>Barclay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quod neque ſuis legibus teneri poſſit, cum nemo ſit ſeipſo ſuperior, nemo a ſeipſo cogiposſit, &amp; Leges a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periore tantum ſciſcantur, denturque inferioribus</hi>; No man can be bound by the Laws he makes himſelf,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108856:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe no man is above himſelf; neither can any man be compelled of himſelf; and Laws are only made by ſuperiours, and given to inferiours. <hi>Cujus est inſtituere ejus eſt abrogare,</hi> He which maketh any Law may abrogate it when he pleaſeth. It is not poſſible for any Government to be without arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power; moſt men of a late edition allow it in Ariſtocracy, and Democracy, Why then not in Monarchy? If it be Tyranny for one man to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern according to his will? Why ſhould it not be far greater Tyranny for a multitude of men to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, how they pleaſe, without being accountable, or reſtrained by Law? But though <hi>ſilent leges inter arma,</hi> Yet <hi>Rex est viva Lex,</hi> as our books ſay, The king is a living Law, <hi>Indigna digna habenda ſunt, Rex quae facit,</hi> Thoſe things which are unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the ſubject, are lawfull for the king to do. <hi>Imperatorem non eſſe ſubjectum legibus qui habet in pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate alias leges ferre,</hi> ſaith B. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> The king cannot be ſubject to the Laws, becauſe he hath power to make other Laws. What then? after he hath eſtabliſhed a Law, That his ſubjects ſhall quietly injoy their eſtates, may the king legally without offending God, take away their eſtates, and break that Law; Becauſe his will is a Law? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he may. But <hi>diſtinguenda ſunt tempora &amp; cauſae.</hi> The King hath a Conſcience aſwell as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, which muſt be ruled according to Gods Law and Equity; otherwiſe God to whom venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only belongeth, will judge him. It is lawful for the king <hi>ad ſupplendam reipub. neceſſitatem, &amp;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108856:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſupportandam regiam majestatem,</hi> to ſupply the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of State, and to ſupport his Royal Majeſty, notwithſtanding any former Law, to take away the eſtates of his ſubjects, without their leave, and that legally too, becauſe in that caſe his will makes a Law. And therefore doth the common Law of <hi>England</hi> allow him many prerogatives, which to explain would require a volume of it ſelf, and are very copiouſly in our Law books demonſtrated. But the ſumme of them is, The king upon juſt cauſe may do what he pleaſe, both with his ſubjects, and their eſtates, and no body is to be judge, whether that cauſe be juſt or no, and take vengeance, but only God &amp; his own conſcience, If it be unjuſt, <hi>Habet Deum Judicem Conſcientiae, &amp; ultorem injuſtitiae,</hi> He hath God the Judge of his conſcience, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of his injuſtice. And <hi>ſatis ſufficit ei ad pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, quod Dominum expectet ultorem,</hi> It is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough for him to think that God will take vengeance on him, ſaith <hi>Bracton</hi>; doth <hi>Bracton</hi> ſay ſo? Why there are ſome <hi>a</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us,<note rend="inter">a Bradſhaw, when he tempted the King <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> at the Kings tryal, but rather his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> who make <hi>Bracton</hi> the only inſtrument, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to kill kings. But to vindicate the Law, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Bracton</hi>; I will make bold to tell them (for <hi>veritas audentes facit,</hi> truth makes a man bold) that they belye <hi>Bracton,</hi> and ſcandal the Law, and their profeſſion; And that it may appear, it is not my opinion only, I will recite that warrant out of <hi>Braston,</hi> li. 2. c. 16. fol. 34. which they build upon,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108856:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the anſwer to it of the <hi>Lord Biſhop of Oſory,</hi> a man worthy of eternal renown, both for his Law, Learning, and Religion; for ſaith he, Yet becauſe this point is of ſuch great concernment, and the chiefeſt Argument they have out of <hi>Bracton,</hi> is that he ſaith, <hi>Rex habet ſuperiorem, legem, curiam ſuam, Comites, Barones, quia Comites Dicuntur, quaſi ſocii Regis, &amp; qui habet ſocium habet Magiſtrum; &amp; ideo ſi Rex fuerit ſine fraeno, id eſt, ſine lege, debent ei fraenum ponere, niſi ipſimet fuerunt cum rege ſine fraeno,</hi> And all this makes juſt nothing in the World for them, if they had the honeſty, or the learning to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it right. For what is above the King? the Law, and the Court of Earls and Barons; But how are they above him? as the <hi>Preacher</hi> is above the King, when he Preacheth unto him, or the <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> when he gives him <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or the Pilot, when he ſayleth by Sea, that is <hi>quo ad rationem conſulendi, non cogendi,</hi> they have <hi>ſuperioritatem directivam, non coactivam.</hi> For ſo the teacher is above him that is taught, and the Counſeller above him that is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, that is, by way of advice, but not by way of command, And to ſhew you that this is <hi>Bractons</hi> true meaning, I pray you conſider his words; <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites dicuntur quaſi ſocii,</hi> they are as fellows or Peers, not ſimply, but <hi>quaſi</hi>; And if they were ſimply ſo, yet they are but <hi>Socii,</hi> not <hi>ſuperiours</hi>; And what can <hi>Socii</hi> do? not command; For <hi>par in parem non habet potestatem,</hi> that is <hi>praecipiendi</hi>; otherwiſe you muſt confeſs, <hi>habet poteſtatem conſulendi</hi>; Therefore <hi>Bracton</hi> adds, <hi>qui habet Socium habet Magiſtrum,</hi> that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108856:84"/>
is a Teacher, not a Commander; and to make this yet more plain, he adds, <hi>ſi Rex fuerit ſine ſraeno, id est ſine lege,</hi> If the King be without a bridle, that is, ſaith he, (leſt you ſhould miſtake what he means by the bridle, and think he means force and arms) the Law, they ought to put this bridle unto him, that is to preſs him with this Law, and ſtill to ſhew him his duty, even as we do both to King and people, ſaying, this is the Law, this ſhould bridle you; but here is not a word of commanding, much leſs of forcing the King; not a word of ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor yet ſimply of equality; And therefore I muſt ſay, <hi>hoc argumentum nihil ad rhombum:</hi> And theſe do abuſe every Author.</p>
            <p>So much the Biſhop, and I think this anſwer will ſatisfy every reaſonable man; And I add further, that it would be very ſtrange that <hi>Bracton</hi> ſhould ſay in this place that the King hath a <hi>Superiour,</hi> when he denyes it in ſeveral other places of his book, and preſſeth it with arguments that he hath not, ſaying, <hi>Omnis quidem ſub eo, &amp; ipſe ſub nullo niſi tantum ſub Deo,</hi> All are under the King, and the King under none but God. <hi>Rex non habet ſuperiorem niſi Deum,</hi> The King hath no ſuperiour but God, <hi>Nemo quidem de factis ſuis praeſumat diſputare, multo fortius contra factum ſuum venire,</hi> Let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to diſpute againſt the Kings actions, much leſs withſtand his actions with force and arms, and rebel againſt him, fol. 6. <hi>Ipſe autem Rex non debet eſſe ſub homine, ſed ſub Deo,</hi> The King is under none but God, <hi>Exercere Rex debet potestatem ſicut Dei vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius

in terra &amp; Miniſter, quia ea potestas ſolius Dei est,</hi> The King ought to exerciſe power, as the Vicar and Miniſter of God, becauſe he receiveth his power from God only. Therefore they who would fain have <hi>Bracton</hi> ſay that the Law and the people are the Kings Superiours, would make him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as themſelves, and do very much abuſe that venerable Author; and no man can finde ſo much as <hi>ſcintilla legis,</hi> a ſpark of Law in all the Law books, that ever the People or Law were above the king, ſo as to puniſh him; and doubtleſs if there had been any ſuch thing, the learned Lawyers would have reported it to poſterity; And <hi>A non uſu valet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi> But they all unanimouſly reſolve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the contrary.</p>

            <p>I Would not have thee imagine, as ſome men through malice, or ignorance, do moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſert, that when we ſay, The King is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and above the Law, that thereby is intended, that the King is freed from, and hath power to act againſt Gods Laws, when he pleaſeth. No, this is but their falſe gloſſe and interpretation, For, <hi>non eſt potentia niſi ad bonum,</hi> hability and power, is not but to good; There is no power but what is from God, and therefore no mortal man can have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to act againſt God; To ſin, and break Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, is impotency, and weakneſs, no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; For the Angels which are eſtabliſhed in glory,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108856:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do far excel men in power, yet they cannot ſin. The Law of God is above the King, and he is bound to God to keep it; yet nevertheleſſe he is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute King over men, becauſe God hath given him the Supreme power over them, and hath given no power to men to correct him, if he tranſgreſſe: But God only whoſe Law only he can tranſgreſſe, can call the King to an account. <hi>Hoc unum Rex po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test facere, quod non potest injuſte agere,</hi> the King only is able, not to do unjuſtly, is a rule in Commonlaw, and the reaſon is, becauſe the people do not give Laws to the King, but the King only giveth Laws to the people, as all our Statutes, and Perpetual experience hath taught us. Therefore how can the King offend againſt the Laws of the people, or be obnoxious to them, when they never gave him any Laws to keep, or tranſgreſſe? and then how can the people puniſh him, who never offended their Laws? Therefore the King muſt needs be abſolute over the people, and only bound to God, not to the people, to keep thoſe Laws, which God, not the people gave him; and as God is above the Laws, and may alter them at his pleaſure, which he gave and ſet over the king, ſo is the King, above, and may alter at his pleaſure, thoſe laws which at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he gave &amp; ſet over the people; ſtill obſerving that he is free from all Laws, <hi>quo ad coactionem,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any coaction from the people, but not <hi>quo ad obligationem,</hi> in reſpect of obedience to God, by his obligation. Therfore well might <hi>Solomon</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel us to keep the Kings commandement, ſaying,

Yet he was a King, and therefore none muſt call him in queſtion but God, who only was his Superiour. But when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, did not his Soveraignty fall with him? No, <hi>Adam</hi> was a King after his fall, and had his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty confirmed to him by God for ever. For Gen. 3.16. <hi>And thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee,</hi> ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his ſuperiority. But was not this Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſonally fixed in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo dyed with him? No, God did declare it tranſmiſſible from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the firſt born.

            <p>So that from <hi>Adam</hi> it doth appear, 1. That Kings are ordained by God, not by the people. 2. That God gave them their regal power. 3. That that power is above the laws. 4. That they have no Superiours but God. And 5. That God only hath power to call them in queſtion, and puniſh them if they offend.

            <p>I think it is received by all for a truth, That the King is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the Father of his Country, <hi>Maritus Reip:</hi> the Husband of the Commonwealth, and <hi>Dominus Subditorum,</hi> the Maſter of his Subjects.

it doth not flow from God and Nature? I have already made it clear, that his power doth not depend on their will and conſent, but is inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God and Nature. If ſo? then I ask this Queſtion, Whether the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> have any power either from God or Nature, violently to reſiſt and oppoſe the King their Father? Which Queſtion, I conceive, may be as truly reſolved, that they have not. For firſt, there is nothing ſo fairly written, and ſo deeply impreſs'd in Nature, as Obedience: You may ſee it in every creature; every brute beaſt will teach you the obedience due from children to their parents, and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the parents over their children. <hi>Vipers</hi> indeed will deſtroy their parent; but it is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Nature, and therefore not imitable by any, but thoſe of a <hi>viperous brood.</hi> Behold the natural love and obedience of the pious <hi>Storks</hi> towards their parents, who feed their feeble and impotent parents, when they are old, as they fed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young: And leſt Obedience ſhould loſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is ſo well known to every one who knoweth any thing, how the Heathens did honour their Kings as Gods, not onely when they were dead, but alſo whilſt they were living, that it would not only be
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108856:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
loſſe of inke and paper, but alſo expence of time, which is better, to relate the particulars. But (<hi>pudet heu</hi>) their obedience and allegiance may ſhame, aſwell as be a pattern to the Chriſtians of our age, who wander ſo far from the path their Lord and Maſter went in. And if any one be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know how God hath alwayes eſteemed of Kings, and with what reverence Gods people have alwayes obeyed them, I refer him to the Bible; Where (I may with confidenee ſpeak it) there is no duty more commanded, and preſt upon the people, than obedience, and no ſin ſo much puniſhed as Treaſon and Rebellion. And the chiefeſt end of their obedience to the King, is not only for God his glory, and the Kings honour, but alſo for their own good, praiſe, and profit. For, for this cauſe did the Apoſtle exhort the people, to pray for Kings, and all that are in authority, <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, for this is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2. <hi>O Melilaee, Deus nobis haec otia fecit. Virgil</hi> could tell that the welfare of the King brought Tranquillity, and Peace upon the Land, and therefore he calleth him a God; Nay, he will therefore honour him as a God, <hi>Namque erit ille mihi ſemper Deus,</hi> ſaith he; And I fear his allegiance and due obedience will riſe in Judgement, to condemn many who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, yet by their actions are worſe than Infidels, who <hi>Judas</hi> like pretend loyalty to their Soveraign, whileſt they plot and contrive with a <hi>kiſſe</hi> to betray him; But <hi>Judas</hi> hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108856:94"/>
and if theſe men do not hang themſelves, It is a great mercy beyond their deſerts, if ſome body elſe do not do it for them, before they live out half their dayes. For in the fifth Commandment, which as Divines hold is moſt obliging, We are commanded <hi>to honour our Father and Mother</hi> (by which words are meant Kings, Princes, and other Magiſtrates,) <hi>That our dayes may be long upon the Land which the Lord our God giveth us,</hi> which is the <hi>firſt Commandment with promiſe,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi> obſerves, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2. But this promiſe is not abſolute, lt is upon this condition, that we honour and obey our Soveraign, and if we do not perform our parts, God is not tyed to perform his. If we break his Commandments, he may well break his promiſe, which was made only on that condition that we ſhould obey, and <hi>if we had loved him we ſhould have kept his Commandments</hi>; But <hi>whoſoever breaketh one one of them, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Therefore he who getteth a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the breach of Gods Commandements, hath no cauſe to bragg of his gettings; <hi>For what will it profit a man to loſe his own ſoul, and to gain the whole world?</hi>

I anſwer, That ye ought to obey God, rather than man; Yet may you not with violence reſiſt your King. We muſt not do evil, that good might come thereon. God hath in many places commanded us to obey, and pray even for the worſt of Kings. Yet you cannot finde ſo much as a ſpark of warranty, for any ſubject, either Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or private man, to riſe againſt his Soveraign, in the whole Bible, or to call him to an account for any of his actions; God hath reſerved that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as his own peculiar prerogative, <hi>Magiſtratus de privatis, Principes de Magiſtratibus, Deum de Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus judicare,</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Aurelius,</hi> Magiſtrates are to judge private men, Kings are to judge Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but none are to judge Kings but God. The only means which ſubjects have to reform King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is that which the Apoſtle preſcribeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Let prayers,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſupplications be made for Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a Godly life.</hi> Prayers muſt be the only weapons of Subjects againſt their Kings; Let them look into their own breaſts, and reform their own hearts,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108856:95"/>
which many times are the only cauſes of a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Nation; Let them amend their own lives, and with fervent ſupplications implore him, (who hath the Kings heart in his hand, and turneth it whitherſoever he will) to reform the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſire. <hi>Chriſtiani hominis eſſe patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ferre potius, quicquid injuriarum ac moleſtiarum infertur, quam ut adigi ſe ſinat ad peccandum contra Deum,</hi> It is the part of a Chriſtian, rather to ſuffer patiently what injury or perſecution ſoever is laid upon him, than to offend God, ſaith <hi>Stephanus Szegedinus, Interea tamen non eſse illicitum, ſi quis vim injuſtam, vel avertere, vel fugere, vel aliquouſque miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare poſſit, modo id fiat rationibus haud illicitis; Quod ſi id fieri non poteſt, Cavebit Chriſtianus, ne illatam vim contrariâ violentiâ retundere conetur, ſed tolerabit poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us omnia, nec de vindicando ſe cogitanit, ſed vindictam j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to ſee the Civil Law, and the Divine Law go hand in hand, harmoniouſly agreeing, and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to lead a loyal ſubject into due obedience, and allegiance to his Soveraign, is no leſs delightful to the <hi>Royalist,</hi> than envyed by the <hi>Rebels,</hi> which <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> doth out of the beſt Civil Lawyers, ſum up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>cap.</hi> 14. ſaying, <hi>Principem ex certa ſcientia, ſupra jus, extra jus, &amp; contra jus, omnia poſſe.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108856:102"/>
by the Law of the Land, by the example of all Saints, by the rule of Honeſty, and by all equitable conſiderations, It is not lawful for his Subjects, nor any man, or any degree, or ſort of men within his Dominions, upon this pretence of Tyranny, to rebel againſt their Soveraign. For if any cauſe ſhould be allowed to be juſt for the Subjects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, then that cauſe would alwayes be alleged by the Rebels, though in truth they had no ſuch cauſe at all; For whom one man and his Company did eſteem a good, Pious, and Religious Prince, another party would proclaim him wicked, Tyrannical, and Idolatrous; And who ſhall be judge between them, but the ſword? and then <hi>Exceſſit medicina modum,</hi> The remedy would be worſe than the diſeaſe. For it is an undoubted truth, that Subjects did never deſpoſe their Prince, although he was a Tyrant, But that a multitude of Tyrants, far worſe than they pretended their Prince to be, did riſe up in his room. By the cutting off the head of one ſnake, twenty ſnakes grow in the ſame place; Therefore it is not profitable aſwell as not lawfull for ſubjects to reſiſt their King. For hear what <hi>Bodine</hi> ſaith, <hi>O how many Tyrants ſhould there be,</hi> If it ſhould be lawfull for ſubjects to kill their Soveraigns though Tyrants? How many good and innocent Princes ſhould as Tyrants periſh, by the conſpiracy of their ſubjects againſt them; he that ſhould of his ſubjects exact ſubſidies, ſhould be then (as the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple account him) a Tyrant. He that ſhould rule and command contrary to the good liking of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108856:103"/>
people ſhould be a Tyrant. He that ſhould keep ſtrong guards and garriſons, for the ſafety of his perſon, ſhould be Tyrant. He that ſhould put to death Traytors and Conſpirators againſt his State, ſhould be alſo counted a Tyrant; And indeed how ſhould good Princes be aſſured of their lives, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of Tyranny they might be ſlain of their ſubjects by whom they ought to be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Then what madneſs is that Nation intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, who throw down a pious, good, and religious Prince, to promote a multitude of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Tyrants, whoſe little finger is heavier than the whole loynes of their Lawful native So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign?</p>
            <p>The King, as I ſaid, is the <hi>Husband</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; and the Wife is not greater than her Husband, becauſe ſhe had once power to chuſe whom ſhe would, and becauſe the man could not have been her Husband, without her conſent. It is no argument that ſhe hath power to turn away her Husband, becauſe ſhe made him her Husband. No, it is God who giveth the Marital power; he gave her the Husband, and gave him power over her, ſo that ſhe cannot t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rn him from her, though he prove never ſo wicked. So though the people chuſe them a King, and are the cauſe, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> yet it is God who is the author of his royal power; And the people can no more dethrone him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect another, than the wife can her Husband. And it is as good an argument, to hold that the wife hath power to put away her Husband, and chuſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108856:103"/>
another, becauſe ſhe made him her Husband; As it is that the people may caſt off their obedience to their Soveraign, and ſet up another, becauſe they made him their King. The <hi>Cardinals</hi> make the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Clerks</hi> the <hi>Biſhop</hi>; but it would be a ſtrange thing to them, if one ſhould tell them, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Clerks</hi> might degrade them, when they pleaſed. Suppoſe the <hi>Souldiers</hi> ſhould chuſe them a <hi>General,</hi> would not the <hi>General</hi> think it ſtrange Logick, to argue, that therefore the <hi>Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> might turn him out of his office when they pleaſed? Indeed, where the ſuperior makes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior officer, he may deject him at his pleaſure. As in a <hi>Prineipality</hi> (which is nothing elſe but an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy or Democracy) where the people create a Magiſtrate to rule ſo long as they pleaſe, they may turn him out at their will, becauſe they alwaies tetain a power of Conſtituting, and rejecting him when they think fit. So the King may turn out Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments when he will, becauſe they depend upon him, and their power is inferior to his. But when the woman hath taken a Husband, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is married and ſubjected to a King, then the Commonwealth hath no power, but all her power is ttanſmitted to her Husband the King. For, <hi>Omnia quae ſunt uxoris ſunt ipſius viri, non habet uxor potestatem ſui, ſed vir,</hi> All that the wife hath is the husbands, and the wife hath not power over her ſelf, but the husband. The people by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, denude themſelves of all their power, and transfer it to the King, ſo that he is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108856:104"/>
from whence they draw every drop of power they have. As when <hi>Valentinian</hi> was deſired of his people to admit of a conſort in his Empire, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, <hi>In eorum fuiſſe poteſtate priuſquam eum ad imperium vocarent, id non facere, jam vero vocato imperatore eos non poſſe, nec ab eo impetrare quod nefas crederet illis concedere,</hi> That before they had elected him, it was in their power, either to elect him, or another, but now he being elected, they had no ſuch power, neither ought they for to ask that, which he thought not fit to grant them. It is a prejudice to a royal mind, to be compelled to any thing, compulſion diminiſheth the worth of a voluntary goodneſs. It is againſt the nature of <hi>Royalty</hi> to be reſtrained, which makes Kings ſay, <hi>Licet Legibus ſoluti ſumus, attamen legibus vivimus,</hi> Though no man hath power to compel us to live according to the Laws, Yet we will. For <hi>Decet tantae Majeſtati eas ſervare leges quibus ipſe ſolutus eſſe videtur,</hi> It is the part of a royal Prince, nay very decent and becoming ſo great Majeſty, voluntarily to obſerve thoſe Laws from which he is free.</p>

him our King, though he be never ſo wicked; For we are his Servants; Nay, his Servants by birth, and therefore enjoyned by a command to ſerve him, 1 Pet. 2.18. <hi>Servants be ſubject to your Masters, with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, But alſo to the froward.

If a Thief ſhould ſet upon you, or any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to rob him, It is lawful for the honeſt man to draw his ſword, and kill him if he can: How dare you then with violence ſet upon your King to rob him, not only of his goods, but alſo of his life, yet becauſe he defended himſelf, and ſo ſome of the Rebels ſlain, Therefore you impeach him of high Treaſon and murther? <hi>O monſtrous,</hi> did you ever hear of any Law in the whole world, that ever the King could commit high Treaſon? <hi>Be dumb,</hi> for you did not.</p>
            <p>The Laws of <hi>England</hi> are divided into three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Common Law, which is the moſt antient Law of the Realm, 2. Particular Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, 3. Statutes or Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>There is no offence puniſhable by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs it be againſt one of theſe Laws. He that doth not offend againſt the Law, is no ſinner, for where there is no Law, there can be no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <hi>I had not known ſin,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, but by the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.7.</p>
            <p>Then cannot the King be guilty of Treaſon to the people, or of any other offence puniſhable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he offend againſt one of theſe three Laws: And that he did not offend againſt any of them, nor
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108856:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was guilty of thoſe offences laid to his charge, by any one, or all of thoſe Laws, is as clear as the Sun, and a Maxim with all honeſt men. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Common Law is nothing elſe but the general cuſtome, and common uſage of the Realm. <hi>Finch.</hi> 77. <hi>Plowdens Com.</hi> 195. Therefore the King cannot be an offender, or guilty by the common Law, nor the people have power to call him in queſtion for any of his actions; becauſe it is ſo far from being the general cuſtome, and common uſage of <hi>England,</hi> for the King to be puniſhed by the people, that before this firſt, and laſt, great, and monſtrous, diſtractive and deſtructive, wicked and abominable murther, of the laſt moſt gracious and merciful King, ſuch a thing was ſcarce ever heard of, or entred into the thoughts of any Engliſh man. Therefore the Rebels are caſt by common Law, and the Chancery will never give relief againſt the common Law. <hi>li.</hi> 4.124. D. and St. So that take them which may you will, this <hi>Dilemma</hi> will hang them. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Cuſtomary Law, is where a particular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome grounded upon reaſon, differeth from the general uſage, and common cuſtome of the Realm. Now to prove, that the King is not an Offender againſt this Law, would be a thing altogether fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and ridiculous, it being known to every one that he cannot.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Statute Law, is a Law poſitive made by the King, with the aſſent of the Parliament: And there is no Statute or Act of Parliament in <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:108856:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which maketh any offence in the King high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or that giveth the people power to call the King to an account, accuſe or condemn him. But there are many offences committed by the people, made high Treaſon againſt the King by ſeveral Acts of Parliament: But that the King could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon againſt the people, is ſuch a <hi>novelty,</hi> that Heaven nor Earth never heard of before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious <hi>England</hi> hatcht it.</p>
            <p>But ſince our age is much given to fictions, Let us for once feign with our falſe <hi>Republicans,</hi> That by the antient fundamental Laws of the Realm, The King might commit Treaſon againſt the people and be a Traytor to the Common-wealth, for which the people might lawfully queſtion him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet ſince, <hi>(Leges poſteriores, priores contrarias abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,</hi> The Statute Law may alter and abridge the common Law,) The King cannot now commit Treaſon againſt the people, nor be a Traytor to the Commonwealth; Becauſe by the Statute made 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4.10. and ſeveral others, It is enacted by authority of Parliament, (who as the common people think may do any thing, vote Heaven Hell or, Hell Heaven) That in no time to come any Treaſon be Judged <hi>otherwiſe,</hi> than it was ordained by the Statute of 25 E. 3.2. In which Statute I am ſure there is no mention made of any Treaſon, but only againſt the King, as any one may read at large which Statute, being it was made by <hi>Benedictum Parliamentum,</hi> a bleſſed Parliament, (for ſo it was called <hi>Co. Inſt.</hi> 3.2.) I commend it to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108856:110"/>
of every Engliſh man, as the beſt leſſon he can learn, by which he will ſee the error of the times, and what changes the wicked have wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſince ſeveral Parliaments have made Statutes, That the King can commit no Treaſon, nor no Treaſon be committed but againſt the King, <hi>Ex ore tuo te Judicabo,</hi> we may conclude from their own mouths, that by no Law, but againſt all Laws, they murthered their King, the meekeſt and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all men.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>whoſoever committeth ſin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law, for ſin is the trangreſsion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4. Then how could the King ſin, when there was no Law for him to tranſgreſs? By the common Law (as I have already ſhewed) he could not be an offender; neither could he by any Statutes; For at that very time, when the Parliament (the peoples <hi>repreſentatives</hi>) charged the King with Treaſon, they had made many Statutes, That thoſe things which they themſelves acted againſt the King, ſhould be high Treaſon againſt the King; But they had made no Law, whereby the King might become a Traytor againſt them. Therefore the King could not offend againſt that Law which was not. <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned in eating the forhid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, had he not been firſt forbidden; Neither had St. Paul <hi>known lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.7. And for the King to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon, when there is no Law which maketh any offence in the King whatſoever Treaſon, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108856:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all laws both Common and Statute, both Divine and Humane reſolve the contrary, is ſuch a <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> which paſſeth the underſtanding of every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature. But forſooth, our new upſtart pragmatical <hi>Lawyers</hi> (as they call them) ſuch as <hi>Cook</hi> was, witneſs his <hi>King Charls his caſe,</hi> fol. 22. (A <hi>Cook,</hi> (but rather a <hi>Scullion</hi>) I am ſure of no affinity in judgement, nor comparable in learning, with our great Maſter and Oracle of the law <hi>Sir Edward Cook</hi>) do ſay and profeſs, that they have a Law written in their <hi>hearts,</hi> whereby they are enabled and authorized to kill the King, if he offend; But I wonder holy <hi>David</hi> had not this Law written in his heart to kill wicked King <hi>Saul,</hi> when it lay in his power ſo to do? The queſtion is eaſily anſwered, for God ſaid, <hi>that David was a man after Gods own heart,</hi> and therefore could not do ſo great a villany; But I am ſure, if the Scripture be true, Neither God nor man will ſay, that theſe men, are men, either after Gods <hi>heart,</hi> or any honeſt mans <hi>heart</hi>; And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Kingdom, and you will finde a thouſand for one, in whoſe <hi>hearts</hi> this law was never written; Therefore if it be written in ſome few mens <hi>hearts,</hi> yet ſince it is not written in the <hi>hearts</hi> of the <hi>Major part,</hi> according to their own tenets, that law is not binding. You may read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.6. and <hi>cap.</hi> 26.11. That it was in <hi>Davids</hi> power, and he was admoniſhed to kill his enemy wicked King <hi>Saul,</hi> once in the Cave, where he cut off the Kings skirt indeed, but his heart ſmote him, as if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> high Treaſon againſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108856:111"/>
the King; And then in the Trench where <hi>Saul</hi> lay ſleeping, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.7. <hi>So</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Abiſhai <hi>came to the people by night, and behold,</hi> Saul <hi>lay ſleeping within the Trench, and his Spear ſtook in the ground at his Bolster; But</hi> Abner <hi>and the people lay round about him. Then ſaid</hi> Abiſhai <hi>to</hi> David, <hi>God hath delivered thine Enemy into thine hand this day: Now therefore let me ſmite him, I pray thee, with the Spear even to the earth at once, and I will not ſmite him the ſecond time; And</hi> David <hi>ſaid to</hi> Abiſhai, <hi>Destroy him not. For who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> David <hi>ſaid furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord ſhall ſmite him, or his day ſhall come to dye, or he ſhall deſcend into battel and periſh: The Lord forbid that I ſhould ſtretch forth mine hand againſt the Lords anointed: but I pray thee take thou now the Spear that is at his bolſter, and the Cruſe of Water, and let us go.</hi> Here you may ſee how greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a thing it is to lay hands upon the King, though he be wicked, and perſecute you. For by holy <hi>Davids</hi> own confeſſion, no man can do it, without committing an high and wofull offence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better it is for all men with King <hi>David</hi> to commit the puniſhment of their King to God, (who moſt aſſuredly will puniſh the King, aſwell as the Beggar for his offences,) and not violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or ſtretch forth their hands againſt him, for none can do that, and be guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>It is true the law of <hi>England</hi> in many particulars is <hi>lex non ſcripta,</hi> and when our law books are ſilent, we muſt repair to the law of Nature, and Reaſon;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108856:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But when a law is eſtabliſhed by the law of God, declared by many Statutes, and reported by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of reverend Judges in their Reports, as it is, that the King can commit no offence ſo great, as to be puniſhed by the people, Then <hi>ſit liber Judex,</hi> We muſt Judge according to the written Law, though it do not agree with our own private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; If the King before the deſcent of the Crown be attainted of Treaſon, felony, or any other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet by the deſcent of the Crown, The At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder <hi>eo instante</hi> is void, as it fell out in the caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, 1 H. 7.4. Jnſt. 1.16. Then if the <hi>Coronation</hi> of the King prohibiteth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe offences which he committed before he was King, only becauſe he is King, and ſo not puniſhable by any earthly power, how can he commit any offence after his Coronation, for which the people may call him in queſtion? It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Maxim in Law, That the <hi>King can do no wrong,</hi> that is, no wrong for which the people may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him; And to ſay that the King is an Officer of truſt placed by the people, is a meer foppery, and againſt the expreſs letter of a principle in Law, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the King is not capable of an office to uſe, but to grant,</hi> Co. Jnſt. 1.3. But why ſhould I ſpeak of Law, to thoſe who God and all the World knows Act all things againſt law? For is there any Law which maketh it high Treaſon in the King, if he commit ſuch or ſuch an offence? or is there any law to enable the people to call their King to an account? I appeal to the whole World, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108856:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
even to the Conſciences of our wicked <hi>Folarchical upſtarts,</hi> Whether they ever read any ſuch Law in the old or new Teſtament, in the Statutes or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the laws of our Realm? or whether they ever heard of any ſuch law in any Kingdom or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Sun? No they did not, The Devil brought it (if any there be) out of the <hi>infernal pit,</hi> whither it will bring them all, unleſs God moſt high prevent not; can a <hi>poſteriour Law</hi> make that an offence, which was lawful at the Commitment? without doubt it cannot; But theſe men with their practice moſt wickedly affirm it.

See 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Com.</hi> 238. <hi>Parliament.</hi> B. 37. and 105.</p>

If the King be but an Officer of truſt, deputed by the people, and receiveth his power from them, Why was not the King (in this caſe) freed from his offence by the people? What would they entruſt a perſon attainted of ſo great an offence as high Treaſon, with the higheſt place in the Common-wealth, And yet not permit others guilty and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of the ſame offence, not ſo much as to fit, and Act as Members of the Parliament, without they were firſt purged of their offence? It doth not ſtand with reaſon, that the higheſt Offender ſhould exerciſe the higheſt office; And doubtleſs if the people had had power, the Parliament would

multitudes of Examples. For who was it that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the King? Was it the people? Every man knoweth that it was neither the people nor the Parliament, But a Company of Jeſuitical treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rebels, and damnable Uſurpers, Who flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people in the mouth with a tale, that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power was in the people, made uſe of this power themſelves, againſt the wills of the people, as an Engine to perform and bring to paſſe all their wicked and horrible deſigns.</p>

Neither are the Commons in Parliament the repreſentative body of the whole Kingdom or people; For they do not repreſent the King, who is the head, nor the Lords, who are the nobler and higher part of the body of the Realm; the Commons only repreſent the Inferior and lower ſort of the people: but if they did, as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108856:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they do not, repreſent the whole body, yet did not the people ever give them any power, to cut off their Kings head. For the Lords voted it unlawful, all the honeſt Commons forſook the Houſe, and the people were all diſpleaſed (except a few of their own hatching up) and every one elſe murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. The Nobility mourned, The Gentry were amazed, The Common people wept, and men women and Children did cry, The Heavens cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in black, And the Sun hid his face.

fears all men, an enemy to every honeſt man, and every honeſt man an enemy to him, a monſter more hideous, than ever the Poets could feign, and more noyſome and deſtructive to humane kind than any beaſt the world ever bred, a Devil in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape. If you do not yet conceive his nature, I will give you a further deſcription of him. A Tyrant <hi>without a Title</hi> (who indeed is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called a Tyrant) is he who levieth war againſt his King, killeth him, and takes the Government upon himſelf, or who of his own authority againſt the will of the people, without election, or right of ſucceſſion, neither by lot, by will, by gift, by juſt war, nor ſpeciall calling of God, doth take upon him the Soveraignty. <hi>Take notice, Reader, by he way, That the Subject can have no just war againſt his King.</hi> A forein Prince may have a juſt cauſe to levy war, and if he conquer, his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is good and juſt by the Law of Conqueſt. So if ones own natural Prince be kept out of his Country by the Rebellion of his Subjects, and he afterwards come with a forein Army, nay with <hi>fire and ſword</hi> (as we ſay) that is, putting all to the ſword who reſiſted him, and burning up all that they have, yet if he ſubdue the Traytors, he is no Tyrant. But if any man without any right or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſurpeth the Government and aſpireth unto the Soveraignty, though afterwards he ſquareth his life according to the rules of moral honeſty, and liveth (as one may ſay) according to the Lawes, Yet notwithſtanding he is a Tyrant for all this. A
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108856:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thief when he hath taken a mans purſe from him, will in company ſtand upon his Terms of honeſty, as much, if not more than an honeſter man. Yet this after <hi>ſanctity</hi> will not purge a Tyrant from his former ſin. He muſt reſtore home that which he wrongfully and unjuſtly keepeth, before he can be a true penitent, and nothing but true Repentance can waſh away the guilt of former ſins. Therefore <hi>Equo ne credite Teucri,</hi> truſt him no further than you can ſee him, before he hath caſt off the unlawfull robes of Soveraignty, and put on the honeſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a true Subject, Eor <hi>Latet anguis in berba,</hi> Let his outſide be never ſo Religious, he is a knave in his heart, his pretentions and his intentions are ſeldome of affinity.</p>
            <p>But may any private hand ſtick this wild boar? may any publick or private man ſtab, or otherwiſe deſtroy this Tyrant before he be tried according to the Common courſe of the Law? Grounding upon the Law of God, the Law of Nations, the Law of Nature, and the Common Law of the Realm, I give judgement againſt him, that as a ſtroyer of humane kind and ſociety, every man may lay violent hands on him and execute him, For which according to the Laws and writings of antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he deſerveth perpetual honour, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every one who ſhould kill ſuch a Tyrant moſt ample rewards, <hi>viz.</hi> honourable Titles of Nobility and proweſſe, arms, ſtatues, Crowns, and the goods of the Tyrant, as to the true deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of his Countrey. By the Law of God,

               <hi>Whoſoeuer ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed,</hi> Gen. 9.6. And what Tyrant ever was there who did not ſhed mans blood? Nay by the Law of God, <hi>That man who will do preſumptuouſly and not hearken to the law, is to be cut off, that the evil may be put away from the Land,</hi> Deut. 17.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.14. All the Civil Lawyers do unanimouſly give judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him, and eſteem that man as one, who doth God and his Countrey good ſervice, who ſhall rid the world of this <hi>viper.</hi> By the law of nature every man is obliged to preſerve himſelf, And what better means can he uſe for his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to deſtroy this <hi>elf,</hi> this <hi>Wolf</hi> amongſt men. For who can ſay any thing is his own? who can ſay his life, his goods or eſtate is ſecure, ſo long as a Tyrant reigneth? By the Common Law of the Realm, if any one ſet upon me to rob or take anie thing away from me, I may lawfullie piſtol him, ſtab him, or otherwiſe deſtroy him. and by the ſame reaſon and law; for <hi>ubi eadem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, ibi idem jus,</hi> I may deſtroy a Tyrant; for the onely difference betwixt a common highway man, or Burglar, and he is their ſtrength and might, the one is a little thief, the other a great one.

called an Emperor. If I had as great and ſtrong a companie of robbers with me as thou haſt, and thou waſt alone, and a Captive, as I am, then thou wouldeſt be the thief, and I the Emperor. So may every common thief, high-way man, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe, or Burglar ſay to the Tyrant when he is brought before him, For <hi>mutato nomine Fahula de te narratur.</hi> When the Tyrant murthereth any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man and taketh away his eſtate, he pretends it is for the ſafety and good of the Common-wealth, calling him Traytor to the State. So it is for the ſafety of a thief to kill the man he intendeth to rob. But the Tyrant he dazles mens eyes with new invented names; for his <hi>magna latrocinia,</hi> his great thefts having nothing honeſt in them, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry names. For when he exerciſeth his robberies, and ſendeth ſome of his meſſengers (who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no better than thieves) to rob men, that he calleth Exciſe. So when he ſetteth upon the whole Nation, he compelleth them to make a purſe for him, that he calleth Taxes. And this kind of thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is ſo much the more remarkable, becauſe he maketh the owners like fools gather the monies for him themſelves. Nay ſuch is the ſtupidity of theſe <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> that if they have ſcarce monie enough to buy themſelves bread, or to pay their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord his juſt Rents, yet they will trot about to gather monies for this Tyrant; their common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, before they will lift up a hand againſt him. They will let their Churches drop down for want of repair, and Law and Religion and all fall
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108856:119"/>
to the ground, before they will let the Tyrant miſſe of a farthing of his demands—<hi>Tanta eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſania mundi.</hi> So great is the madneſſe of men.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon why the Law alloweth every man to kill a Tyrant, and take that vengeance which in other caſes is reſerved to God and the Magiſtrate, is, becauſe there is no other remedy, and Gods Lawes cannot be otherwiſe executed; for the Tyrant maketh himſelf above all law, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf of all Forts, ſtrong Holds, Gariſons, and the Magazine of all Armour, ſo that by the greatneſſe of his villanies he is ſecured from the power of the Magiſtrates, and ſo conſequently cannot be puniſhed by the ordinarie Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

that the burthen of exciſe ſhould not be laid on the ſhoulders of his Subjects, but the Rebels with their intollerable and monſtrous Exciſes, new found impoſitions, and other unſpeakable grievances, have beggered the Subjects, and undone the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome both in their Eſtates and Reputation; To be ſhort, whatſoever they voted unlawfull for the King to do, they have done that, and ten thouſand times worſe: ſo that though we want not bodies to feel the miſeries, which they have brought upon us, yet we want tongues to expreſſe the wofulneſſe of our Condition, and the incomparable wickedneſs of theſe Traytors.</p>

That the People of <hi>England</hi> &amp;c. were the Subjects of the King, <hi>viz.</hi> their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign liege Lord King <hi>James.</hi> 2. That Ligeance, or obedience of the Subject to the Soveraign, is due by the Law of Nature. 3. That this Law of Nature is part of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> 4. That the Law of Nature was before any judicial or municipal Law in the world. 5. That the Law of Nature is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and cannot be changed. From which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we may conclude, that the Subjects of the King of <hi>England</hi> (unleſſe they like God Almighty could alter the Law of Nature,) They could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their obedience and ſubjection to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord King <hi>Charles.</hi> For if by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108856:136"/>
obedience from them was due to the natural body (as I ſhall further prove) of King <hi>Charles</hi>; and if the Law of Nature is immutable, (as moſt certainly it is, <hi>Bracton lib.</hi> 1 <hi>ca.</hi> 5. <hi>D.</hi> &amp; <hi>Stu. ca.</hi> 5. &amp; 6.) then could not they have any cauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, (as altering their Religion, baniſhing, or killing of them) a ſufficient ground for them to take up arms againſt him, and put him to death. For by this they go about to change the Law of Nature, which is impoſſible for mortals to do: But ſay ſome, by the Law of Nature we may defend our ſelves, and therefore leavy war againſt the King for our own defence; I anſwer, that by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are bound to defend our ſelves, yet muſt we uſe no unlawfull means for our defence; for the Subjects to levy war againſt their Soveraign, is forbidden both by the Laws of God and Nature. Therefore vain and fooliſh is that excuſe, as well as all others which the Rebels make uſe of to defend their Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Ligeance is a true and faithfull obedience of the Subject due to his Soveraign, It is an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Subjects to take part with their Liege Lord againſt all men living, to aid and aſſiſt him with their bodies, and minds, with their advice and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; not toft li up their arms againſt him, nor to ſupport in any way thoſe who oppoſe him. This ligeance and obedience is an incident inſeparable to every. Subject of <hi>England</hi>; and in our Law-books, and many Acts of Parliament, as in 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi>

Every Subject of <hi>England</hi> taketh the Oath of ligeance, which is only due unto the King, yet doth not the ligeance of the Subject to the King begin at the taking of this Oath at the Leet; For (as it was reſolved in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe) ſo ſoon as the Subject is born, he oweth by birth-right ligeance and obedience to his Soveraign Lord the King. Becauſe ligeance, faith and obedience of the Subject to the Soveraign, was by the Law of Nature written with the Finger of God in the Heart of Man, before any municipal, or judicial Laws were made: 1. For that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt Reporter or writer of Law in the World, yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and ſubjection was long before <hi>Moſes.</hi> 2. For that it had been in vain to have preſcribed laws to any, but to ſuch as ought obedience, faith and ligeance before, in reſpect whereof they were bound to obey and obſerve them, <hi>Fruſtra enim feruntur leges, niſi ſubditis, &amp; obedientibus.</hi> You may read likewiſe in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, That the King of <hi>England</hi> hath his title to the Crown by inherent birth-right, by deſcent from the blood royal, from God, Nature, and the Law, and therefore not by way of truſt from the two Houſes of Parliament, or from the People; Neither is his Coronation any part of his Title, but only an ornament, and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation of the royal deſcent; For it was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the title of King <hi>James</hi> was by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

and that by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death, the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> deſcended to his Majeſty, and he was fully and abſolutely thereby King, without any eſſential ceremony, or act to be done <hi>Ex poſt facto.</hi> So in the firſt year of the ſame Kings reign, before his Majeſties Coronation, <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> ſeminary Prieſts, and others, were of opinion, that his Majeſty was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and abſolute King before his Coronation, but that Coronation did adde perfection to the deſcent, and therefore (obſerve ſaith my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> their damnable and damned conſequent) that they by ſtrength and power might before his Coronation take him and his royal Iſſue into their poſſeſſion, keep him priſoner in the Tower, remove ſuch Counſellors, and great Officers as pleaſed them, and conſtitute others in their places, &amp;c. and that theſe, and others of like nature, could not be treaſon againſt his Majeſty, before he was crowned King. But it was clearly reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> that preſently, by the deſcent, his Majeſty was compleatly and abſolutely King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eſſential ceremony or act to be done <hi>Ex poſt facto,</hi> and that Coronation was but a royal ornament, and outward ſolemniation of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent. And this evidently appeareth by infinite Preſidents and book caſes, where ſuch execrable opinions have been no ſooner hatched, than deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if the Judges of our age had been ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as to have cropped in the bud ſuch like opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the foaming flouds, which running down the lofty Hills, demoliſheth and carrieth away all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in its roaring Streams; or as the violent fury of a Maſterleſs, headſtrong multitude, who hew down Kings, as well as Royal Subjects, in their tempeſtuous fury: ſo theſe men ſet upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſtretch every Text of Scripture to their own meaning, although there is as great a diſtance between their meaning, and the Scripture, as there was betwixt the Glutton in Hell, and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſom in Heaven, elſe ſhould I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how they could ſeem to make the very Letter of the Law ſpeak againſt the very Letter, and like the Philoſophers ſtone, which turneth all things into Gold, ſo the tongues of theſe men turn the ſenſe of all the Lawbooks into their golden mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cite thoſe books as authorities on their ſides, which are ſo contrary, and oppoſite againſt them, as if they had been purpoſely prepared to encounter and confute them; For where is the Kings Soveraignty more fully demonſtrated, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced, than in Reverend <hi>Bracton</hi>? and what book ſo much abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed as his?

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Willian Prynne</hi> of <hi>Lincolns-Inne</hi> is the man, who with his Hand and Pen (I cannot ſay Heart) hath promulged this falſe Doctrine to the World, in his Book called <hi>The Soveraign Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Kingdoms</hi>: Wherein (according to Mr. <hi>Sanderſons</hi> expreſſion, in his Hiſtory of King <hi>Charls</hi> the 1ſt. <hi>fo.</hi> 117.) <hi>Prynne</hi> pretends to overthrow all Scripture proofs againſt killing Kings and Princes. For my part I bear not the leaſt grudge or animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the mans perſon; But his book is ſuch a rapſody of nonſenſe, a bundle of Rebellion, and Treaſon, a Pamplet ſo Seditious, Pernicious, Sophiſtical, Jeſuitical, Trayterous, and Scurrulous, that I want Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> Epithites, to give his own book, its deſerved Odium; Wherein (as Mr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> in his Church Hiſtory, <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 152. well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth) he delighteth more to be numerous with many, than ponderous with ſelect <hi>quotations,</hi> which maketh his Books to ſwell with the loſſe of tentimes of the <hi>Reader,</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Printer,</hi> and his pen generally querulous, hath more of the <hi>Plantiff</hi> than of the <hi>Defendant</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>I mention Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and his book here, only to put him in mind of the wrong which he hath done both to our Soveraign the King, and the whole Kingdom; He being the greateſt, (if not the only Champion,) who rook upon him, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108856:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and applaud, thoſe treacherous, damnable, and rebellious proceedings, and unchriſtian, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and unnatural Warr againſt the King, of that Monſter, called the Long Parliament, whom, now he laboureth as much to vilifye, as he did then to promote. O Trayterous Offſpring, which killeth his Mother only, becauſe ſhe will not give him, ſuck! If he repent, why doth he not write a book of retractations? <hi>If he looketh upon his book intitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led, The lawfulneſſe of the Parliaments neceſſary defenſive War, both in point of Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> I am ſure, he will have cauſe enough to repent of his writing, if he hath any <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in him.</hi> And he hath no way better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his credit, than by a publique Confeſſion. God may pardon him, and the King may pardon him, if he repenteth; But without repentance, he muſt expect nothing but a Traytors reward in this World; I leave him to Gods mercy in the World to come.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is the manner of Worldlings to ſet the beſt ſide formoſt, the pureſt grain commonly lyeth in the mouth of the Sack, and a fair Apple many times hath a rotten coar; Therefore behold the ſpecious Title of Mr. <hi>Prynnes</hi> book, and the cunning Sophiſtry, in his Mental Reſervation, by which he hath deceived the common people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooled himſelf, <hi>and undone the whole Kingdom; the Title of his book is, The Parliament and Kingdom are the Soveraign power.</hi> Any man would think,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108856:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that by the word, <hi>Parliament,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> meant the King, the Houſe of Lords, and the Houſe of Commons, becauſe by the Law of the Land, there can be no Parliament without the King, neither can the two Houſes by Law act any thing without him, and then if he means ſo, no man will deny, but that the Parliament hath the <hi>Soveraign power</hi>; But alas he hath no ſuch thoughts, he means (as by the ſtuff of his book is manifeſt) that the two Houſes, or the major part of them, have the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power, and that they may enact any thing without the King, as well as with him: Thus by lifting up the Legs and Feet too high, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Head a fall, and battered the whole Body into pieces, O unhappy <hi>Member,</hi> who would have the Heels execute the Office of the Brains, and maintain the Warr of the inferiour Members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Superiour, to be legal, and conſciencious! In his Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whom he calleth, Eternally Renowned Senators, and moſt cordial Philopaters (he will not now tell you, they were eternal) Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> termeth all contrary opinions to his (though they be the opinions of Biſhops, and farr better Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than himſelf) to be but the vain, empty, brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, lying fancies of a few illiterate, impolitick Court Chaplains, Lawyers, Sycophants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How irreverently, and diſcourteouſly, he hath dealt with his Gracious Soveraign, Lord, and Maſter the King, let his book judge, where he can ſcarce ſpeak of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108856:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the King at any time, without taxing him with perjury, lying, popery and murther.</p>
            <p>He raileth againſt the treachery and diſloyalty of Popiſh Parliaments, Prelates, Lords, and Subjects to their Soveraign, and ſo concludeth, that they have made greater innovations, and encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Crown, and in an higher degree, than ever did the long Parliament, which he hopes will for ever ſilence the clamorous tongues of all ill Counſellers, Courtiers, Royaliſts, Malignants, Papiſts and Cavalliers, againſt the proceedings of that Parliament, (ſee the 1. part of his Book, fol. 33.) as if the exceſſive abundance of other mens ſinnes, would juſtifie the ſinnes of the long Parliament. And indeed, the moſt of his arguments are <hi>à facto ad jus,</hi> which (eſpecially in the Kings caſe) is no argument at all. The books of the Royaliſts to maintain the Kings juſt prerogatives, he calleth anti-Parliamentary Pamphlets, and the Authors of them he calleth Malignant, Popiſh Vipets, illiterate, ignorant, injudicious Court Doctors and Lawyers, and Anti-parliamental <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſſes</hi>: But is not Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> the Anti-parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Momus</hi> and viper? who ſetteth the body above the head, maintaineth that the two Houſes, or the major part, have the Soveraign power, may act without the King, levy warre againſt him, and kill him too, by defending themſelves; which as he telleth you, he will juſtifie both in point of law and conſcience. O unhappy law! O the no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience!
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108856:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which teacheth men to kill Kings, and the Subjects to levy warre againſt their Soveraign; <hi>David,</hi> the Lords anointed, cryed, The Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that he ſhould do this thing: But Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> a Presbyterian, cryeth, The Lord forbid that it ſhould not be done. Oh, the difference between a <hi>holy David,</hi> and a rigid Presbyterian!</p>
            <p>He maketh the ignorance (as he termeth it) of other men, the greateſt ground of his arguments; He calleth all Divines and Lawyers, a company of ſeemingly ſcient,<note rend="inter">Vid. Epiſt. 2 part of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power.</note> though really inſcient, ſelf-conceited, Court Doctors, Prieſts and Lawyers; <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum genus indoctiſſimorum hominum, vix ad Doroberniam uſque docti</hi>; who hold an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion contrary to his, (truely ſo named, by himſelf Vid. Epiſt. 1. part of Soveraign power, &amp;c.) <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Paradoxes, and upſtart Enthuſiaſmes.</hi> He endeavoureth to make us, all our Anceſtors, and all Kingdomes fooles, himſelf the only omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient. He revileth the King and all his royal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the names of Murtherers, Popiſh cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats, ignorant <hi>Momuſſes,</hi> and an unnatural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of popiſh and malignant vipers; But, To his ever honoured, noble, kind friends, the right Honourable Lord, <hi>Ferdinando Fairfax,</hi> the right worſhipfull Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Bruerton,</hi> Knights, Commanders in Chief of the Parliaments forces, (which is the ſuperſcription to his Epiſtle of the 3d. part of the Sovereign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108856:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp;c.) Theſe he calleth in the Vocative caſe, <hi>Deſervedly renowned worthies.</hi> So that, as none but <hi>Homer</hi> could expreſſe the praiſes due to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> ſo none but Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> can expreſſe the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath caſt upon his Maſter, the King, and his betters, the loyal Royaliſts; for who can come after Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in railing, where he letteth his pen flye out?</p>
            <p>You muſt take his own interpretations for true Maxims, and his own meaning both of Scripture and Law-books, muſt go for current Doctrine; otherwiſe you ſpoil his whole building; and that which he recites for him, will be moſt againſt him. Nay, his averments muſt paſſe for undoubted axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms. But you will ask me then, How can Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> be clear from the guilt of blaſphemy? who in his 3d. part of the Soveraign power of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, fol. 6. declareth himſelf in theſe words, viz. <hi>I dare confidently averre, it was never the thought, nor intention of</hi> Paul, <hi>or of the Holy Ghoſt, to inhibit Subjects by defenſive armes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Kings themſelves, under pain of damnation.</hi> For my part I will not invectively cenſure Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> as guilty of Blaſphemy, nor ſcold at him as a Subverter of Scripture, Paraſite, &amp;c. as he hath done at others who are contrary to him in opinion, but let me tell him, that if he had averred, that it was never the thought, nor intention of St. <hi>Paul</hi> or the Holy-Ghoſt to inhibit Subjects, by offenſive arms, to reſiſt Kings themſelves, under pain of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108856:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſhould have as ſoon believed him, for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 13.1, 2. <hi>Let every Soul be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the higher Powers, for there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> Now if St. <hi>Pauls</hi> thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not according to his words, then Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> confident averrment, perhaps may be true; but if St. <hi>Paules</hi> thoughts and intention be according to his words (as moſt certainly they are) then Mr. <hi>Prinns</hi> averrment, is but a falſe allegation, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Holy-Ghoſt; for by Saint <hi>Paules</hi> Doctrine, he which is not ſubject too, but reſiſteth the power, ſhall receive damnation; but whoſoever with defenſive arms reſiſteth the King, is not ſubject to, but doth reſiſt the power; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he which with defenſive arms reſiſteth the King, ſhall receive damnation, The <hi>Major</hi> no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the <hi>Minor</hi> is inviolable, and the Concluſion is perfect, and ſound. There be thoſe indeed who do confidently averr (and have written a book too,) that there were men before <hi>Adam,</hi> but I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any Scripture, but their own interpretations and meanings to warrant their averments. And untill Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> can produce Texts of Scripture, to warrant, and maintain his confident averment, he muſt excuſe me, if I ſtill hold St. <hi>Paules</hi> Doctrine Canonical, and his averment meer Apocripha. For ſuppoſe the King ſubverteth both Law and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108856:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet doth not that take away his ſupreme power, he is ſtill a King, and Gods ordinance; <hi>Saul</hi> was a King, though an impious ſinner, and there have been wicked Kings as well as wicked Subjects; to do evil (ſaith one,) is no power, but impotency, therefore if the King command me to murther my ſelf, my Father, to deſtroy my Country, or to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wicked act, I will not do it, but obey God, not him, becauſe it is his corruption, not any power he hath, from whence his commandment proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and therefore I am not obliged to obey him, becauſe I muſt be a Subject to his power, not to his ſins; yet if he ſhould run after me with a naked Sword to kill me, my Father, my Mother, ruine my Country, Laws, and Religion, Yet would not I with defenſive arms, lift up my hands againſt him, to reſiſt, hurt, and deſtroy him, becauſe he is ſtill my King, and hath ſtill that ſupreme power, which God placed in him, although he doth not then execute it, and therefore if I ſhould with defenſive Arms lift up my hands to reſiſt, hurt, and deſtroy him, I ſhould with defenſive Arms lift up my hands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, hurt, and deſtroy the Ordinance of God, and ſo receive damnation for my reward; Not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Kings command, is a reſiſtance, although we ſuffer death; Therefore if it be the Kings power and not his wicked will which commandeth me to do an evil thing, if I did not perform his evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, I ſhould reſiſt his power and ſo be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to damnation, although I patiently and meekly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:108856:145"/>
ſuffered death. But doubtleſſe the Kings power cannot command me to do any evil, but it muſt proceed from his ſinfull will, for God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any unrighteouſneſſe, and there is no power but what God is the Author of; therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> the Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>Non eſt cupiditas niſi a Deo, eſt enim mala cupiditas quae non eſt a deo, nocendi autem voluntas poteſt eſſe a ſuo quo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> animo pravo.</hi> That there is no concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence but what is of God, for there is an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, which is not from God, and the evil will of ſinning proceedeth from our own depraved mindes; therefore if the King command me to do an evil thing, I ought to obey God, not his wicked will, but rather than to lift up my hands againſt him, though in my defence, I ought cheerfully and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer a thouſand deaths, for by dying unjuſtly here, I ſhall live eternally in Heaven; and ſince the Glory of a Chriſtian is the Croſſe, by ſuffering and dying a Martyr, I ſhall obtain everlaſting Glory, and by my thus doing well, I ſhall get praiſe even of the Power, which the Kings wicked will made uſe of to deſtroy me; but defence againſt the power of a King is offence, therefore if with defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive arms, I ſhould fight againſt him, I ſhould reſiſt Gods Ordinance, and ſo receive damnation, for by Gods Ordinance the King hath the power over all, and his Actions ought not to be queſtioned or reſiſted by any but the Almighty.</p>
            <p>But for my part, I hold clearly, that when the

King executeth Tyranny, taketh away the Lives, or Eſtates of his Subjects unjuſtly, that he doth it not only by reaſon of his wicked will (according to the precedent diſtinction) but by force, and virtue of his power, which God hath given him, and that this is the power, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to be ſubject unto, which if we reſiſt, we ſhall receive damnation, and that for ſeveral reaſons.</p>

deareſt children, both in their bodies, and eſtates; yet cannot unrighteouſneſſe be imputed unto God; becauſe he doth it for their good: but the wicked wills of Kings, which uſe the power which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them, ſo unjuſtly, are unrighteous, and ſhall by the Almighty be puniſhed, according to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Bede, <hi>Injuſtum enim non eſt ut improbis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipientibus nocendi poteſtatem bonorum patientia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur, &amp; malorum iniquitas puniatur.</hi> It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in God, that the patience of the good be proved, and the ſins of the wicked puniſhed, by the power which is given the wicked to offend; for by the power given to the Devil, <hi>Job</hi> was tried, and appeared to be juſt; St. <hi>Peter</hi> was tempted, that he ſhould not preſume too much upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and <hi>Judas</hi> was condemned, that he hanged himſelf.

Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> knoweth, that it is a Maxim in Law, that the King never dyeth: But admit the King ſhould dye without heir, and that then the people had power to make Lawes; yet groſſe it were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the members of the two Houſes might ſo do, becauſe they are diſſolved, and are extinct when the King dyeth. Therefore with more reaſon (as a Royaliſt obſerves) the King might argue thus; All the lands in <hi>England</hi> are holden mediatly or immediately of the King,<note rend="inter">Co.

King: For whereas by the Laws of the Land, our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King alwayes made the Judges of the Land, Arbitrators between his Subjects and himſelf in all caſes, from the loweſt offence, and treſpaſs, to the higheſt offence, <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> High Treaſon; This Amalekite the Houſe of Commons, made part of themſelves the Judges of the King, who had committed the greateſt Treaſon againſt the King, and by the Laws of the Land deſerved rather to hang at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> than ſit in the Chair of Juſtice; likewiſe they made the Souldiers his Judges, who profeſſed themſelves to be the Kings inveterate Enemies, by their Remonſtrances, and Speeches, and that they deſired nothing more than his Blood and Life, fought againſt him with their Guns and Swords. Yet forſooth of this Hotchpotch of Traytors, was their high Court of Juſtice made up; Moſt of them being Collonels of the Army, and other Souldiers who fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him abroad, and others Parliament men, who conſpired his ruine at home. By the Laws of the Land, it is a juſt exception to any Jury man, who is to try the baſeſt or pooreſt Felon, and a legal challenge for which he muſt be withdrawn, That he is a profeſſed Enemy, and Proſecutor, who ſeeks his life, and therefore no lawful nor indifferent tryer of him for it; yet theſe bloody Butchers, who profeſſed themſelves to be the Kings greateſt Enemies, and Proſecutors, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after nothing ſo eagerly as the Kings life, were
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:108856:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both the Judges and Jury-men too, to try the King: Perjured <hi>O. Cromwell</hi> (who then intended, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards effected to have the ſupreme power over theſe three Kingdoms,) was one of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to judge whether the King, or himſelf with the reſt of his brethren in iniquity deſerved death, and whether the King and his Royal Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ought not to be diſtroyed, and <hi>Oliver</hi> and his ſtinking ſtock take poſſeſſion; O unparraleld lump of impiouſneſs! <hi>Aliquis non debet eſſe Judex in propria cauſà,</hi> It is a Maxim in Law, that no man ought to be Judge in his own cauſe; Yet theſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains made themſelves the only Judge whether they committed Treaſon againſt the King, or the King againſt them: <hi>Nemo tenetur prodere ſeipſum,</hi> No man is bound to accuſe himſelf, and it would have been a wonder indeed, if theſe Rebels ſhould have ſpoke the truth, and ſaid that they had committed high Treaſon againſt the King; Therefore for fear the Law ſhould puniſh them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, they thought good to prevent that miſchief, &amp; puniſh the King as they pleaſed according to their luſts: And that they might make themſelves the greateſt Tyrants, and the people the baſeſt Slaves in the world, they took upon them the Governing power, which by Law only belongeth to the King. 2. The Legiſlative power, which likewiſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the King with the concurrence of the upper and Lower Houſe. And 3. The Judicative power, which belongeth to the Judges, who are known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:108856:161"/>
and Diſpencers of Law and Juſtice in all Cauſes brought before them; So that theſe Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Tyrants by their boundleſs and arbitrary wills, put us to death when they pleaſe, for what cauſe they pleaſe, and take away our Eſtates when they ſee occaſion; And yet they have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to tell us, and many the ſottiſhneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Parliament having the Supreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, doth all theſe villanies by Law; O Abominable! How theſe Tyrants mock the people with the name of a Parliament; the Parliament conſiſteth of the King the head, and about 600 of his Subjects, and there were not above 50 or 60 of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who cauſed the King to be murthered, and ruined his people, yet theſe Schiſmaticks call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Parliament, and ſo having nothing good but their name, Tyrannize over us. They may as well ſay that the parings of the nailes of the toes are the whole man and have the power of all the other members, as ſay that they are the Parliament, or have any lawfull power, they being nothing but the dregs and lees of the inferiour Houſe, from whom we muſt never expect any thing pleaſing to any honeſt mans palate; If the Parliament had power to depoſe the King, yet what power can theſe few Gaol-Birds have, who are ſcarce the tenth part of the Parliament, and no Repreſentatives of the People, but only of their own Deviliſh ambitions? By what authority do theſe <hi>Ignes fatui</hi> aboliſh Kingſhip, and the Houſe of Lords as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerous

As for the oath of Supremary, Vows, Proteſtations, and Covenants, which they made in the preſence of God, with hands lift up to heaven for vengeance if they did not perform them, and all other oathes of Homage, Fealty, and Allegiance, which the People took to be true and faithfull to the King, Theſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves, and the People of, by an Act of Parliament, as if theſe Caterpillers could diſcharge debts due to the Almighty; But to make God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, they paſſed another Act, that the People ſhould ſwear to be true and faithfull unto them.

what we have. We muſt (with them) account vice vertue, and vertue vice: we muſt hold their words more canonical than Gods word, and ſay that is law, which they ſay is law, though it be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law, truth, nor reaſon. Unlawfull wars ſet them up, and we ſhall alwayes have wars, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of wars amongſt us, untill they are pulled down. To be ſhort, we muſt reſolve to forſake God, and ſerve the Devil, if we intend to keep any thing ſafe, ſo long as this <hi>Phalaris,</hi> the Tail of the Houſe of Commons domineereth over us; For <hi>the Children of this world being in their Generation wiſer than the Children of Light,</hi> Luke 16.8. Theſe Worldlings are ſo wiſe and ſubtil to do miſchief, that when they commit the moſt deadly ſin, They make it paſſe to the world, as the beſt ſervice done to God; and when they themſelves make plots to murther honeſt Royaliſts, then they get ſome of their hirelings to diſcover it, and ſwear that the Royaliſts invented the plot againſt them; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently (forſooth) they vote and command, that their three Kingdomes give God thanks for their great deliverance; aſcribing that which was done by their own providence, to the Providence of the Almighty. Nay, they have their <hi>Lillies,</hi> and other lying Aſtrologers, whom they conſult with, before they commit any great wickedneſſe, and make them publiſh to the world, that the Heavens ruled, and voted what theſe Beagles pleaſe to perform.</p>
            <p>It is as natural for their Judges to judge unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:108856:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if it be for the profit, or pleaſure of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as it is for them to live: For how many innocent Gentlemen have they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death, for doing their duty in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King from unjuſt violence? which we are all bound to do by the law of God, Nature, and of the Realm.</p>
            <p>They have their <hi>Balaam</hi> Prophets and Prieſts too, almoſt in every pariſh, and pulpit, which they make the Organs to ſound forth their own praiſes; ſo that the ignorant country multitudes, who ſcarce know that there is a God, but that they heard their Miniſter tell them ſo, thinking that he doth God the beſt ſervice and credit, who hath the fineſt ribbond on his hat, or that weareth the beſt cloaths on his back at Church: theſe <hi>Momuſſes</hi> believe that the Saints at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> are the only ſupreme power on Earth; and that no men in the world, (for ſome of them think that the ſea ſide is the end of the world) are to be compared to them, either for wiſdome, learning or honeſty: and the only reaſon of their thoughts is, <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> their Miniſter ſaid ſo but laſt Sunday. And this was the chiefeſt reaſon, wherefore the countrey Peaſants flocked in ſo faſt, to the Armies of thoſe <hi>Neroes</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> raiſed againſt the King; who alwayes made the ignorance of the people, their greateſt Champion.

How theſe godly Villains ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at ſtrawes, and leap over blocks! They prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit innocent recreations on the Sabbath day, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely becauſe they would have the people eſteem them zealous in Religion, and ſtricter obſervers of Gods Commandments, than the King. But in truth, they ſerv'd God, only to ſerve themſelves; <hi>In nomine Domini, incipit omne malum</hi>; acting all their wickedneſſe in the name of the Lord. For when they have got a good name amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they think under that ſhadow, to act any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and yet to the world ſeem ſaints; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their King too, and yet be accounted good Chriſtians; nay, Reformers of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:108856:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had a triple title to this Kingdome, to wit, by Donation, Conqueſt, and by the Conſent of the people: for (as it is well known) when <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor lived in <hi>Normandy,</hi> he gave this Kingdom, after his deceaſe, to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as he was his kinſman, &amp; near of bloud ſo that the Conquerour was heir of the Crown to the Confeſſor by adoption. Which title, if it was invalid, you muſt know he was a Conquerour; and no man will deny that Conqueſt maketh a legal title,<note rend="inter">Bodin li. 2. ca. 5.</note>

            <p>It would make a man cry, and it would make a man laugh, to ſee what fools theſe fellowes make of us: Royal Government by Kings, hath been uſed here, time out of mind, and approved by all our Anceſtors, to be the beſt of Governments, and moſt natural, and profitable for us; yet theſe few ſtinking Members at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> made an Act (<hi>March</hi> 17. 1648. contrary even to their own Oaths and Proteſtations) to aboliſh the Kingly Government, as <hi>unneceſſary</hi> (I uſe their own words) <hi>burthenſome, and dangerous to the people:</hi> as if this ſmall company, conſiſting of fifty, or ſixty at the moſt, of the Scum, and tail of the people, were wiſer, and knew what was better for us, than all our Anceſtors, both noble and ignoble, in all ages. But what was their reaſon to aboliſh Kingſhip? To make each of themſelves Kings, nay Tyrannical Kings over us.

while theſe Tyrants deſtroy our fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Government, Lawes, Religion, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Liberties, making of us abſolute ſlaves &amp; villains, only to ſatiate their luſt and pleaſure; yet even then they ſtile themſelves <hi>The Keepers of the Liberty of England, by Authority of Parliament.</hi> Cloſe, and truſty keepers of our liberty, indeed, for we can come at none of it, they keep it from us, not for us: ſo Wolves may call themſelves keepers of the Lambs which they have caught; or by the ſame law, may a Cut-purſe be called the keeper of the purſe, and be ſaid to have the ſame care of it: for they are heepers of our liberty, only to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For by what authority was this <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am vagum,</hi> the Keepers, erected? By what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? why they will tell you by authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Cunning Curres! How they take the people with this word Parliament! when God knows, they themſelves were all the Parliament by whoſe authority the thing called Keepers (I know not what they be, for I never yet heard them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) were invented. So may Adulterers vote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves keepers of Chaſtity; or ſo may I murther a man againſt his will, and then call my ſelf keeper of his life, by his authority.

of the people, (as I ſhewed before;) but a company of Ungracious Tyrants, acting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wills of the people. Yet, forſooth, they tell us, that the people have the ſupreme power, and that they act for the people, being their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.

So theſe Foxes cozen the people with nonſenſical cheats; and in all things, are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the Devil, not of the People: for they all well know, and ſome of them have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo, that if the people might chuſe their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, thoſe Repreſentatives would reſtore the King to his own again, which theſe moſt unjuſtly keep from him. We cannot ſerve God and Mammon, both at one time, Good and evil cannot ſtand both together. If the King come in and rule, theſe men muſt fall; If we ſerve the King as we ought, we cannot ſerve theſe at all; If God re-eſtabliſheth his Anointed, <hi>Lucifer</hi> muſt call down his Children; wickedneſſe muſt be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when righteouſneſſe takes place; therefore the Gaolers of the Liberty of <hi>England</hi> muſt down, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, our only lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, is reſtored to his Crown, and Kingdome. Which they very well know, therefore they would

fain keep as long as they can, their Empire, which coſt them their Souls, and Reputation. But let us return to our King.</p>
            <p>When the Conquerour came in He got by right of Conqueſt all the Land of the Realm into his own hands, the whole Kingdom was his direct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inheritance in demeaſn, ſo that no man can at this day make any greater title than from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to any Lands in <hi>England,</hi> for the King being owner and ſole Lord of the whole Land and the People therein, did (as he lawfully might) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Land, and people, according to his will and pleaſure; he gave out of his hands what Lands he pleaſed, to what perſons he pleaſed, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what tenures and ſervices he pleaſed. So that in the Law of <hi>England</hi> we have not properly <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> that is, any Subjects Land that is not holden.<note rend="inter">Co. Lit. 1.</note> We all hold our Lands mediately or immediately of the Crown, neither have we any right to our Lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer than we are faithfull, and loyal to the King, who firſt gave us them upon that condition; for by the Laws of the Realm, if we take up arms againſt the King, imagine his death, or commit any other offence, which is high Treaſon, we forfeit our eſtates to the King, ſo that they return from whence they were firſt derived; the greateſt and higheſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or property which a Subject hath to his Lands, is <hi>Quod talisſeiſitus fuit in dominico; ſuo ut de feodo.</hi> Now though this word <hi>Feodum</hi> doth (as <hi>Littleton</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:108856:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
teacheth) legally ſignify inheritance, and ſo <hi>Feodum Simplex,</hi> ſignifieth a lawfull or pure inheritance, yet it is apparently manifeſt, that <hi>Feodum</hi> is a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved right, and doth import with it a truſt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which truſt broken forfeiteth the Eſtate to the King, who only hath (as <hi>Camden</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) <hi>Directum imperium, cujus nullus eſt Author niſi Deus.</hi> For all the Lands within this Realm, were originally derived from the Crown, and therefore the King is Soveraign Lord, or Lord Paramount, either mediate or immediate, of all and every parcel of Land within the Realm, 18 E. 3.35.44 E. 3.5. 48 E, 3.9.8 H. 7.12. Therefore though in other places he which findeth a piece of Land, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſeth, or hath title unto, &amp; entreth into it, gaineth a property by his entry; yet in <hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to Land cannot be gained any ſuch way, for the Subject can have no property, but what was firſt by the Kings grant; therefore thoſe Lands are ſtill appropriated to the Crown, which the King did not give away to his Subjects; as if Land be left by the Sea, this Land belongeth to the King, and not to him that hath the Lands next adjoyning, or to any other but the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caelum Caeli Domino, terram autem dedit filiis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> All the whole Heavens are the Lords, the Earth hath he given to the Children of men, for which he only reſerved their ſervice, as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his bounteous liberality: ſo the whole Kingdom is the Kings, but the Land therein
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:108856:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he hath given to his Children the people, for which he only reſerved their allegiance and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as a remembrance, and recognition, of his Royal bounty; in which reſervation, the King (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> writeth) had four inſtitutions, exceeding politick and ſuitable to the State of a Conquerour.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Seeing his people to be part <hi>Normans,</hi> and part <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Normans</hi> he brought with him, the <hi>Saxons</hi> he found here, he bent himſelf to conjoyn them by Mariages in Amity, and for that purpoſe ordains, that if thoſe of his Nobles, Knights, and Gentlemen, to whom he gave great rewards of lands, ſhould dye, leaving their Heir within Age, a Male within 21, and a Female within 14 years, and unmaryed, then the King ſhould have the beſtowing of ſuch Heirs in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in ſuch a Family, and to ſuch perſons as he ſhould think meet, which intereſt of Mariage, went ſtill imployed, and doth at this day in every Tenure called Knights ſervice.</p>
            <p>The Second was, to the end that his people ſhould be ſtill conſerved in Warlik exerciſes, and able for his defence, when therefore he gave any good portion of Lands that might make the party of Abilities, or ſtrength, he withall reſerved this ſervice, That that party and his Heirs,<note rend="inter">Who then ought to have the Militia but the King?</note> having ſuch lands, ſhould keep a Horſe of ſervice continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſerve upon him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:108856:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when the King went to Warrs, or elſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving impediment to excuſe his own perſon, ſhould find another to ſerve in his place, which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, of Horſe, and Man, is a part of that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure called Knights ſervice at this day.</p>
            <p>But if the Tenant himſelf be an Infant, the King is to hold this land himſelf, untill he come to full Age, finding him Meat, Drink, Apparel, and other neceſſaries; and finding a Horſe and a Man with the overplus, to ſerve in the Warrs, as the Tenant himſelf ſhould do if he were at full Age.</p>
            <p>But if this Inheritance deſcend upon a Woman that cannot ſerve by her Sex, then the King is not to have the Lands, ſhe being 14. years of Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is then able to have an Husband that may do the ſervice in perſon.</p>
            <p>The Third inſtitution, that upon every gift of Land, the King reſerved a Vow, and an Oath, to bind the party to his Faith, and Loyalty; that Vow was called Homage; the Oath, of Fealty; Homage is to be done kneeling, holding his hands between the knees of the Lord, ſaying in the French tongue, <hi>I become your Man of Life and Limb, and of earthly honour.</hi> Fealty is to take an Oath upon a Book, that he will be a faithful Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the King, and do his ſervice, and pay his Rents according to his Tenure.</p>
            <p>The Fourth inſtitution was, that for Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Kings bounty, by every Heir ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:108856:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  </gap>mer ſeiſin</hi> of the lands, which is one years profit of the lands, and untill this be paid, the King is to have poſſeſſion of the land, and then to reſtore it to the Heir, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at this day in uſe, and is the very cauſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing livery, and that as well where the Heir hath been in ward, as otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Many other Tenures with ſervices did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour inſtitute, as Grand Serjeanty, Petit Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeanty, Tenure in Burgage, Soccage, Eſcuage <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being holden of the King, are called Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures <hi>in capite,</hi> which is as much to ſay, as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures <hi>de perſona Regis,</hi> becauſe the head is the principal part of the body, and the King is the head of the body of the Commonwealth; Which Tenures brought many profits,<note place="margin">Co. Lit. 108.</note> and commodities to the Crown (which would be too tedious here to particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize) and are a clear teſtimony of the Kings Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. For no man can alien thoſe lands which he holdeth <hi>in Capite,</hi> without the Kings Licence, if they doe, the King is to have a fine for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and may ſeiſe the land, and retain it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the fine be paid.</p>
            <p>By example, and in imitation of the King (For <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis</hi>) Did the Nobles, and Gentry, of this Nation (to whom the King had given large portions of land) grant out parcells of their land to their Servants, and under-Tenants,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:108856:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſerving ſuch ſervices; and appointing ſuch like Tenures, as the King did to them, as <hi>Homage, Fealty, &amp;c.</hi> whereof you may read plentifully in <hi>Littletons</hi> Tenures; But their Tenants in doing Homage and Fealty to them, did alwayes except the Faith which they did owe unto the King; As in their making Homage appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, viz.<note rend="inter">Co.

due unto the Lord our King; therefore we muſt not be oppoſite to, or armed againſt him, but both our lives and members muſt be ready for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, becauſe he is Soveraign Lord over all. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 65.</p>
            <p>As the Conquerour did make all his Subjects Feudaries to him, ſo likewiſe did he change our Lawes and Cuſtomes at his pleaſure, and brought in his own Country faſhions, which is the Common uſe of Conquerours. He cauſed all Lawes to be written in his language, and made what Lawes he thought meet, <hi>Quod Principi placuerit, legis habet vigorem,</hi> whatſoever the King willed, was the only law; His <hi>fiat,</hi> was as binding, as an Act of Parliament; and what he voted, no man, no not the whole Kingdome, had power to diſpute. There was no queſtion then made, but that the King ought to have the <hi>Militia,</hi> neither did any one think of, much leſſe, deny him a Negative voice. The Commons then thought it an high honour, to look upon the Kings Majeſty a farre off; To ſit, and rule their families at home, was all the Juriſdiction which they had, or claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; They had not power to condemn one of their ſervants to death, much leſſe their Soveraign Lord the King, from whom they then, and we now, have our being. The King had not then made them ſo much as the Lower Houſe, nor ever did admit them to his Counſel; The Lords, their Maſters, were only deemed wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did never admit the Commoners into their Counſels, much leſſe, intruſt them with the Legiſlative po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tes only made the Parliament, or Common Council of the Realm, whom the King convoked by his Royal Summons, when he pleaſed. Neither did the Council ſo convened, conſiſt of any certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but of what number, and of what perſons the King vouchſafed. Nay clear it is, by the Lawes made in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, (which was above two hundred yeares after the conqueſt) that there was no certain perſons, or formed body, whoſe conſent was requiſite to joyn with the King in making an act of Parliament; but when the King conceived it fit to make a Law, he called ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108856:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as he thought moſt proper to be conſulted with. Indeed, at the Coronation of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, all the People of <hi>England</hi> were called by the King, and Laws were then made, but it was <hi>per Commune Concilium Baronum.</hi> And that King and his Succeſſours, did not uſually call the Commons, but made Laws with the advice of which of their Subjects they pleaſed; and as Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> and others write, the Commons with their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> had but baſtard births, being begotten by Uſurpers, and foſtered by Rebellion, for King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the firſt did but uſurp the Kingdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſecure himſelf the better againſt <hi>Robert</hi> his eldeſt brother, he Courted the Commons, and granted them that <hi>Great Charter,</hi> with <hi>Charta de foreſta,</hi> which King <hi>John</hi> confirmed upon the ſame grounds, for he was alſo an Uſurper, <hi>Arthur</hi> Duke of <hi>Brittain</hi> being the undoubted heir of the Crown,<note rend="inter">

            </p>
            <p>But it maters not which of the Kings firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Houſe of Commons, certain it is, that long after the Conquerour, its name was not ſo much as heard of in <hi>England,</hi> but (as it is apparent) one of his Succeſſours did form them, and grant, not to make Laws without their conſent, and by a Statute made 7 H. 4. the Writ of Summons now uſed was formed, and by an other Act made 1 H. 5. direction

            </p>
            <p>Now would it not ſtrike a man with admiration, and make his hair ſtand an end, to hear, that the Houſe of Commons ſhould claim the Legiſlative power, and proteſt to the world, that they were greater in authority and Majeſty than the King, who raiſed them from nothing? ſurely 'tis but a dream, which troubled the head a while, with ſtrange Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeras, and then vaniſh'd; it is but a Phantaſm, which fanatick diſtempers raiſed in lunatick brains, and ſo periſh'd; after ages will account it but an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Metamorphoſis,</hi> or as a Fable, told more, for mirth, and novelty, than for any truth or reality; for why? are the pots greater than the Potter? or doth he who ought for to obey, give Laws to him whoſe right it is to command? The King ſayeth to the Houſe of Commons, come, and they come, and he ſayeth to them go, and they go, whatſoever the King commands, that they cannot chuſe by Law but do; Nay the Lords their Maſters, are but the Kings Servants, the King is the head, and they are but the ſervile Members; it is the property of the

Thus they joyn hand in hand, and oath to oath, but it is but to do wickedneſs, for like King <hi>Davids</hi> Rebels, they make a Covenant againſt their King, and would murther him, as they did his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they could catch him: but <hi>nulla pax malis,</hi> the wicked cannot hold together long, though they unite their forces into one intire body, yet it is but like <hi>Samſons</hi> Foxes, by the tailes, only to ſet the world on fire.</p>
            <p>When the Commons have taken the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and met together in a body collective,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:108856:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the houſe, they have not ſo much power as a Steward in his Leet, or a Sheriff in his Tourn, for they cannot miniſter an oath, impriſon any body but themſelves, nor try any offence whatſoever, (much leſs try their King, and aſſume the Legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;) At a conference the Commons are always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſtand when the Lords ſit, (ſurely theſe are no marks of Soveraignity) They indeed chuſe their Speaker, but after their choice the King may refuſe him at his pleaſure,<note rend="inter">4 Inſt. 8.</note> and make them chuſe another, and <hi>Lenthal</hi> himſelf (as all other Speakers do) did, when he was preſented to the King, diſable himſelf as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unworthy to ſpeak before the King; yet now he is ſtyled the Father of our Country. (How the world is turned up-ſide down!) Theſe Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers heretofore were wont to be arreſted by any common Perſon, and lyable to all Sutes, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as other men, untill the King graciouſly paſſed an Act for their indemnity, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ea.</hi> 8. So that they are nothing but what the King made them, nor have nothing but by his grant; and all that the King did make them, appeareth by the Writ, which is to do and conſent to ſuch things as the King with his Common-Counſell ſhould ordain.</p>
            <p>Then ſtay Reader, and behold, ſtand ſtill, with thy head and hands lift up to the heavens, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, with what impudence, and oppreſſion, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and uſurpation, the long Parliamentiers are
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:108856:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fraught with, who never had any other legal power than by the Kings Writ, and have loſt that by the Kings death; yet tyrannize over three kingdoms, calling themſelves the Repreſentatives of the whole Kingdom, and that they were intruſted by the People, with the Supreme and Legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which God and all the world knoweth is as falſe as the Almighty is true. For firſt they do not repreſent the King the head, nor the Peers who are the higher and nobler part of the kingdom,<note rend="inter">4 Inſt. 2.</note> therefore they are not the Repreſentatives of the whole kingdom, neither were they ever entruſted by the People with the Supreme and Legiſlative power, Nay, the people did never confer any power on them at all, for by their Election the people did but deſign the perſon, all the power the Commons have, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the King, which is contained in the Writ, by which they were called. As Free-holders worth forty ſhillings a year, and free-men of Cities, and Borroughs, would make very unfit Electors of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates, ſo never did they, they cannot make any Election of their Commons, untill the King commandeth, and giveth them power, they have no power ſo to do of their own, much leſs to authorize ſupreme Legiſlators. The King giveth liberty to Towns and Cities, to make choice of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, which had no ſuch power before the Kings grant, ſo that all the power which the Commons have floweth from the King, not a drop of it from the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:108856:180"/>Therefore, if the Commons exceed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to wit, the power given them by the Kings Writ, it is illegal, and their actings void in Law; and ſince the power given them by the Writ, is extinguiſhed by the Kings death, the Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by Law diſſolved, and all the power which they take upon them ſince, is uſurped, illegal, and Tyrannical, and contrary to the Lawes both of God and man. And to make their Tyranny the greateſt under the Heavens, they proteſt to the world, that the Repreſentatives of the people, ought to have the Legiſlative power; yet they give Lawes (as they call them) to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not having ſo much as one Member from both Kingdomes, in their repreſentative body; nor the eighth part of the Repreſentatives choſen by the Counties, Cities, and Burroughs in <hi>England.</hi> So that no Tyrants ſince the Creation of the world, did ever equallize theſe, either in cruelty or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, wickedneſſe or fooliſhneſſe: yet forſooth, in 1649, they made an Act, that it ſhould be High Treaſon, for any one to affirm the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be Tyrannical, Uſurped or Unlawfull; or that theſe Commons are not the ſupreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Nation. So thieves may murther the Father, and take away the inheritance from his Children, and then make a Law, that it ſhall be high Treaſon for any one to call them thieves or uſurpers, or to ſay, they had not the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Thus they defend Tyranny with Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:108856:180"/>
and one ſin with another. <hi>Unumquodque conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatur, eodem modo quo fit.</hi> Things impiouſly got, muſt be impiouſly kept. They got their authority by blood, and by blood it muſt be kept; they juggled themſelves by lyes into the ſupreme ſelf-created authority, and we muſt lye, and ſay they are the ſupreme authority, only becauſe they do, otherwiſe we ſhall be executed for high Treaſon, againſt this infamous conventicle; So that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity we muſt diſpleaſe God, if we pleaſe them, and live no longer, than we ſin, for they have made it a capital offence to ſpeak truth. I muſt confeſſe, moſt men amongſt us, are frighted with this ſcarr-Crow, not only to lye, and affirm the long called Parliament to be the legal ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but alſo with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> forſwear, and deny their perſecuted Lord and Maſter the King, accounting no weather ill, ſo they be by their warm fire ſides, and eſteeming all men indiſcreet, who publickly own their King, and therby incurr the diſpleaſure of theſe domineering Tyrants. But for my part, I had rather be a Servant to God, and my King, than a Maſter amongſt the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; I am a Member of the body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and therefore cannot ſee my head the King cut off, without crying,<note rend="inter">They are dead Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who do not.</note> 
               <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> It is the duty of all his Subjects both with pens and hands, to help their King out of the mire, into which theſe Rebels have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:108856:181"/>
caſt him; not only the law of God, but the law of the land injoyneth us thereto: And I cannot ſee our Laws and Religion rooted up, without groans and ſighs; It is no time to be ſilent, when the fabrick wherein our whole treaſure and happineſ conſiſteth, is ſet on fire: Neither can ſilence, or innocence, protect one from the unjuſt violence of theſe Wolves; Sleeping, or waking, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes their prey: Some of us they murther for our Eſtates, ſome for their pleaſure, but all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wicked wills, not law. Therefore God knows whether I may be the next who muſt come to their pot; Howſoever, I had rather be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, doing God, my King, and my Country ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than in a drowſie Lethargy: I commit my Soul and Body, to the protection of the Almighty, who dorh not let a ſparrow fall to the ground without his divine providence, therefore will not let me fall into the power of their luſt, without his permiſſion. The King fell, and why ſhould not I? The Lords will be done, who when he hath corrected his Children, will burn the rod. They can deſtroy only my Body: him only will I fear, who can deſtroy both Body and Soul. Give <hi>Cerberus</hi> a ſop cryes ſome men, and ſpeak fairly to the Monſter now in power: But it is but to go into Hell; Therefore I will neither flatter, nor diſſemble with them.</p>
            <p>Not to ſpeak of the Modeſty of the Houſe of Commons in former Ages, ſcarce adventuring to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:108856:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe what they might, for fear they ſhould arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate too much; As in 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. When their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was required concerning the proſecution of a Warr with <hi>France,</hi> They anſwered, <hi>That their humble deſire of the King was, that he would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed therein by the Lords, being of more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence than themſelves in ſuch affairs.</hi> The like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of their Modeſty may you find in the 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and in the 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. They diſclaimed to have Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance of ſuch matters, <hi>as the Guarding of the Seas, and Marches of the Kingdom.</hi> We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that unleſſe it be the property of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to command, and the Maſter to obey, or of the Souldiers to march before their Captain, that the King hath the ſupreme power, and is the ſole Legiſlator, not the Houſe of Commons: For the King repreſenteth God, the Commons only the ignoble People. As for both Houſes joyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they are no Court at all; therefore can have no thoughts of having the Legiſlative power. And as the two Houſes have no power but what the King beſtoweth on them, ſo neither have they any title of honour and dignity, but by the Kings gift. For as all the lands in <hi>England,</hi> and all power and authority, is derived from the Crown; So by the laws of <hi>England,</hi> all the degrees of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, and Honour, are derived from the King, the Fountain of Honour, and Majeſty it ſelf, 4. <hi>Inſt.</hi> 363. What then? have the two Houſes joyntly, or the Houſe of Commons ſingly, the Soveraign
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:108856:182"/>
power, becauſe they have none but what the King giveth them? Have they the Majeſty, becauſe they have no honour or dignity but by the Kings gift? Surely this is all the reaſon: The King made the Lords, not the Lords the King: a Peaſant to day may be a Lord to morrow, if the King pleaſeth; and is the Peſant therefore the Kings maſter? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no, it is the King who createth Barons, and ſo maketh them capable to ſit in the Houſe of Peers; but they are made but Peers, not Kings; nay they are but Peers of the Realm, not of the King: They are under, not above the King; For <hi>ſunt &amp; alii Potentes ſub Rege qui dicuntur Barones, hoc eſt, robur belli,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bracton</hi> l. 1. c. 8. Though they are <hi>Potentes,</hi> yet they are <hi>ſub rege.</hi> As for the Houſe of Commons, they are ſo far from being our keepers, or the maſters of our King and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that there is not a Noble man amongſt them; They receive their being from the breath of the Kings Writ, and having their being in a collective body, they are but the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> whoſe name importeth ſubjection. But if the Commons when they ſit in the Houſe have the Soveraign power, where was it before their Seſſions? and where is it when they are diſſolved? What doth it hang in the Clouds, and drop on them when they ſit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve like the Snow with the VVinter, when the King diſſolveth them? <hi>Soveraignty</hi> is <hi>permanent,</hi> and always continueth waking: The Houſe of Commons are, and they are not, according to the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:108856:182"/>
Kings pleaſure, he aſſembles and diſſolves them at his will. And what? doth the Soveraign power ſleep or die, during their <hi>interregnum</hi>? one would think it belonged to the King, becauſe he never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. O ridiculous Commons! I am weary of their abſurdity in claiming the Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>But as once it was demanded of an Oraaor; ſpeaking very much in the commendation of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Quis vituperavit</hi>? So it may be demanded of me, treating of the Kings Soveraignty, who hath brought arguments againſt it? Truly for my part, I never ſaw any reaſonable argument againſt it; many cavils, but no reaſons. Evaſions are the beſt proofs uſed by the Anti-Royaliſts: And when they ſhift a Queſtion with forein matter, or a forein meaning, They think they have not only made a good anſwer, but alſo proved the point in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be on their ſide: As when our Books ſay, Every man in the kingdom is under the <hi>King,</hi> but the King is under none but God, They anſwer, the meaning of the book is, That every ſingle man in the kingdom is under the King, but not the whole people collectively, for they are above the King. Juſt as if the Book ſhould ſay, every man in the world is under the Heavens, but the Heavens are under none but God: And they ſhould anſwer to evade it, The meaning of the Book is, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſingle man is under the Heavens, but not the whole body of the people; for they are above the Heavens. O miſerable invention! ſuch abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108856:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are moſt of their Arguments. Therefore we may conclude, that ſince Club-Law ſet them above reaſon, it muſt be Club-Law which muſt pull them down. Let the Sword argue them out of the Kings poſſeſſions, which they have gotten by Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it will be eaſie then to convince them, that Rebellion againſt the King is unlawful. Had the King had no Revenues, he had ſtill injoyed his Crown. It is the profit which maketh King-killing honeſt; And it is the ſweetneſſe of the Biſhops Lands, which makes the Office of a Biſhop ſo bitter, and odious, to our new States-men; The Law would have them ejected from their ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Fortune and Eſtates; therefore they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Law, as their utter Enemy, And ſay, that they will have it no more coached in the City of <hi>London,</hi> but carted in the Country amongſt the Swains; But they muſt likewiſe ſend the City with it into the Country, otherwiſe the Body will dye when the Soul departeth, and the City will periſh, when the Law and its Retinue bid it fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            <p>As Hiſtories both forein and domeſtique, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern, and the whole Accademy of the Common Law, ſo it is apparent by many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and Judgements in Parliament: And both the Lords and Commons, in divers Acts of Parliament,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Davis</hi> Iriſh Rep. ſo. 90.</note> through many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Ages, have declared that the King of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Monarcha &amp;

Imperator in regno ſuo,</hi> a Monarch and Emperour in his Realm, above all the people in his kingdom, and inferiour to none on Earth, but only the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, holding his Crown and Royal dignity, immediately of God, and of none elſe.</p>
            <p>By the Statute of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ca.</hi> 2. enacted in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it is declared, that the Kings of <hi>England are Lawful Kings and Emperours of the ſaid Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and of this Land of</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>So by the Act of 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 5. It is declared, <hi>That the Crown of</hi> England <hi>hath been ſo free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly ſubjection, but immediately ſubject to God in all things touching the Regality of the ſame Crown, and to none other.</hi> And what is the Houſe of Commons, a God? if they are but men, the Crown is not ſubject to them, for the Statute telleth you it is in no Earthly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. But perhaps they are Devils; neither will that ſerve their turn, for as it appeareth by the <hi>Act,</hi> The Crown is immediately ſubject to God, and to none other.</p>
            <p>So by the Statute of 24 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Where by divers ſundry old authentick Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and Chronicles, it is manifeſtly declared, and expreſſed, That this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>is an Empire, and ſo hath been accepted in the World, Governed by one Supreme Head and King, having the Dignity and Royal Eſtate of the imperial Crown of the ſame, unto whom a body politick compact of all ſorts, and degrees of people, divided in terms, and

And although Kings ought not to be Miniſters of the Chutch, ſo as to diſpenſe the word and Sacraments, For <hi>No man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron, Hebrews 5.4. Yet ſince they are called of God to be Kings, as his Vicegerents, they have power to look to, and have a care of the Church, that the word be preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred, by fit perſons, and in a right manner, elſe how ſhould Kings be Nurſing Fathers to the Church,<note rend="inter">Iſa. 49.23.</note> had they not a Fatherly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over it? Therefore many Acts of Parliament, in ſeveral Kings Reigns, and the whole Current of Law Books, reſolve and affirm the King to be head, and have Supreme Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes. In the firſt year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, a Statute was made, <hi>That all Authority and Juriſdiction both Spiritual and Temporal, is derived from the King.</hi> So in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, was this Law, ca. 17. <hi>The King, who is the Vicar of the higheſt King, is ordained to this end, that he ſhould Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and Rule the Kingdom, and People of the Land, and above all things the Holy Church, and that he defend the ſame from wrong doers, and deſtroy, and root out workers of miſchief.</hi> But ſince Reverend <hi>Coke</hi> in the fifth part of his Reports, <hi>De jure Regis Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> hath with lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent examples, and impregnable lawes, made it
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:108856:188"/>
ſo clear, (that no man can gainſay it) that the King ought, and the Kings of <hi>England</hi> ever ſince before the Conqueſt, until the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (at which time he writ) have had the ſupreme power and juriſdiction, in all Spiritual, and Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, I referre you to his Book, only reciting part of his concluſion, <hi>viz. Thus hath it appeared, as well by the antient Common Lawes of this Realm, by the Reſolutions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Judges, and Sages of the Lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in all ſucceſſion of ages, as by authority of many Acts of Parliament, antient, and of later times, that the Kingdome of</hi> England <hi>is an abſolute Monarchy, and that the King is the only ſupreme Governour, as well over Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, as temporal, within this Realm.</hi> And in another places, <hi>fo.</hi> 8. he ſaith, <hi>And therefore by the antient Lawes of this Realm, this Kingdome of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is an abſolute Empire, and Monarchy, conſiſting of one head, which is the King; and of a body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, compact and compounded of many, and almoſt infinite ſeveral, and yet well agreeing Members. All which the law divideth into two ſeveral parts, that is to ſay, the Clergy, and the Laity; both of them next, and immediately under God, ſubject, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the head. Alſo, the Kingly head of this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick body, is inſtituted, and furniſhed with plenary, and intire power, prerogative, and juriſdiction, to render juſtice and right, to every part and member of this body, of what eſtate, degree, or calling ſoever, in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:108856:189"/>
all cauſes, Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, otherwiſe he ſhould not be a head of the whole body.</hi> Now he that looketh upon theſe Authorities, and yet ſaith, that the King is not above both Parliament and people, nor hath ſoveraign power over them, will likewiſe look upon the ſun in the Heavens, and yet ſay, that it is not above, but below the earth; and when he is in the midſt of the ſea, ſay, that there are no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world. If then the King hath the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power over Parliament and people, (as moſt certainly he hath) how then could the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament or people, (much leſſe, ſixty of them) queſtion, or judge their King? For no man can deny, but that the greater power ought to correct, and judge the leſſer, not the leſſer, the greater. How could they, did I ſay? Why, <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> by violence and injury, not by law. So may I go and murther the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the King of <hi>France,</hi> and then tell them, that their people have the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power over them. The caſe is all one, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe Rebels murthered their natural Father, and King, to whom nature, and the Lawes of God and man, had made them ſubjects; but I ſhould murther a forein King, whom I ought not to touch, he being the Lords annointed.</p>

The only reaſon why they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Militia of the King, and ſaid that it only belonged to them, was not, becauſe the King ought not to have it, for they well knew, that by the Law of all Ages, it did only belong to him,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:108856:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not to them; But how then could they carry on, and accompliſh, their wicked deſign of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering him, if they ſtill let his Sword hang by his ſide? Therefore they firſt laid hold on that, and wreſted the Militia out of his hands, arguing that it did not belong to the King, but to them. So Murtherers may ſay, that the Sword of him whom they intend to murther, doth not belong to the owner, but to them, to the end, they may with the more eaſe and ſafeguard, perpetrate their wickedneſs. And that they might have a ſhadow to hide all their filthyneſſe; They firſt got ſeveral Counties to Petition for the Militia, which they afterwards took by violence, nay they themſelves did firſt Petition the King for it. So ſturdy Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars firſt beg for an Almes, and by and by knock their Benefactor on the head, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of what they before entreated for: And indeed the moſt part of their Villanies did commence with Petitions, for in driving on their wicked deſigns, they alwayes got the Raſcal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the People, to heap in Petitions, for what they themſelves ſet them upon, as if theſe Godly Villains did nothing, but what they were driven to through commiſeration of the people, when God knows, they did nothing, but what was for the ſatisfaction of their own wicked Luſts, and Ambition. For when the Souldiers, and other baſer ſort of the people, cryed out for Juſtice and Privilege of the Parliament; Even then was the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:108856:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Injuſtice of theſe Rebels moſt promoted, and the Parliament did not then only loſe its privileges, but its very life and being. Thus Barbers may cut off the Head, when they pretend to trim the Hair, and ſo may Phyſicians deſtroy and kill the Body, when they pretend to apply Medicines. For, as now it appeareth even to the blind, their pious pretences, were but a Colour, for their wicked intentions, to deſtroy both King and Parliament, and root up all our Laws and Religion, when they ſeemed to act moſt to preſerve them.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the power of Warr only belongeth unto the King, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that the King hath power to levy Taxes, and impoſe Subſidies on his people to maintain the Warr, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it would be in vain to think of waging Warr: for all Souldiers muſt have <hi>(Vectigalia)</hi> Food, Apparel, and Arms, and where ſhould the King have this but in his own Kingdom? To be ſhort, it is a duty laid upon the Conſciences of all Subjects, to ſupply their King with all neceſſaries, both in time of Warr, and Peace; And a thing commanded both by our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, <hi>Render unto</hi> Caeſar, <hi>the things which are</hi> Caeſars. And 13 Rom. <hi>Render therefore to all their due, Tribute, to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom, to whom Cuſtom, Fear, to whom Fear, Honour, to whom Honour.</hi> But our <hi>Antipodes</hi> ſubverting all Scripture, render to no man their dues, and that they may act contrary to the very words and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of every Text, They do not render Tribute, Cuſtom, Fear, and Honour, to the King, to whom it is only due, but forſooth to themſelves, to whom it is not due. So may the Servant mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Maſter, and take all his Revenues, and Honour as due only to himſelf. He which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the King hath not right to chuſe his Privy Counſellors, Great Officers, and Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will likewiſe ſay, that the Maſter hath not right to chuſe his Servants, it being the practice of all Kingdoms, as well as of <hi>England,</hi> and due to him by the Law of Nature; <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of the People able Men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the 70. grand Senators of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim of the Jews were to be choſen; By which you ſee, the great Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be choſen out of, and not by the people, but by the King.

or elſewhere, is murthered, and all the Judgments, acts and proceedings of thoſe nominal Judges, or Commiſſioners are void, as things done <hi>Coram non judice.</hi> So that it conſequently followeth, that theſe lawleſs Judges are principals in every mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo committed.

But if any private man, or the whole people take upon them to make themſelves their own Carvers taking what recompence they think fit, either againſt the King or any of their fellow Subjects, in this caſe they make themſelves their own Revengers, and rob God of his rights, for vengeance belongeth to him, not to them. Therefore if any man, though in a way of publick Juſtice, take upon him to condemn and execute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, without authority and power from the King, he is a Murtherer, and malicious Revenger, upon whom the vengeance of God (whom he endeavoureth to cheat and rob) will fall. Oh then admire, and bewail the Infandous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Murtherers of our age, wherein the good are deſtroyed for performing their duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and their King, and the wicked flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,

only becauſe they are ſinfull, for whoſoever will not be a Rebel, muſt not be a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-man amongſt theſe new Republicans. Yet forſooth they have ſuch a form of Godlineſſe amongſt them, that whoſoever doth not approve of their wickedneſſe, but ſpeaketh of their actions according to their deſerts, they call ſuch men the ungodly, and flatter themſelves, ſaying, the Saints of all ages have been ſpoken evil of by the wicked, holy <hi>David,</hi> nay our Saviour and his Diſciples were reviled by the Reprobate, therfore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the Malignant Cavaleers do reproach, and vilifie our piouſneſs, and brotherly love and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one towards the other.

O pious Rebels!</p>
            <p>So far are our Laws of <hi>England</hi> from allowing Subjects to take up arms againſt the King, or to condemn &amp; execute him, that it is high treaſon for any one,<note rend="inter">25 E. 3.2.</note> or all of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but to imagine the Kings death, which the wiſdom and Religion of our Realm hath from age to age ſo much hated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, that an offender therin, by the Laws of the Land, ſhall be hanged, and cut down alive, his bowels ſhall be cut off, and burned in his ſight, his head ſhall be ſevered from his body, his quarters ſhall be divided aſunder, and diſpoſed at the Kings pleaſure, and made food for the birds of the air, or the beaſts of the Field, and his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be thruſt out of his houſe, and livings, his ſeed and blood ſhall be corrupted, his Lands and goods ſhall be confiſcated, and (as by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 29 H. 6.1. It is ordained of the Traytor <hi>John Cade)</hi> hee ſhall be called a falſe Traytor for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:108856:195"/>
ever. But the Traytors againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr have prevented this puniſhment (moſt due to them) by the greatneſſe of their villanies. Yet though they are got out of the reach of Juſtice, and trample our Laws and King under their feet, let them remember that God is above Earth, and will give them their reward, if not in this world, yet in the world to come.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. (as you may read in <hi>Pulton de pace Regis, &amp; Regni,</hi> fo. 108.) doth confirm it to be high treaſon, for any perſon to compaſſe, or imagine the death of our Soveraign Lord the King, the Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which words, it doth approve what a great regard, and reverend reſpect, the Common Law hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had to the perſon of the King, which it hath endeavoured religiouſly, and carefully to preſerve, as a thing conſecrated by Almighty God, and by him ordained, to be the head, health, and wealth of the Kingdom, and therefore it hath ingrafted a deep, and ſettled fear in the hearts of all ſorts of Subjects, to offer violence, or force unto it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of High Treaſon:<note rend="inter">Leges Auredi. ca. 4.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:108856:196"/>
what he did, neither had he malice prepenſed, not a felonious intent. And this law doth not only reſtrain all perſons from laying violent hands upon the perſon of the King, but alſo by prevention, it doth inhibit them ſo much as to compaſſe, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or to deviſe, or think in their hearts, to cut off, by violent, or untimely death, the life of the King, Queen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the only compaſſing, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, without bringing it to effect, is High Treaſon, becauſe that compaſſing, and imagination doth proceed from falſe and traiterous hearts, and out of cruel, bloudy, and murdering minds.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee with what reverence our Lawes do adore his ſacred Majeſty our King, deteſting nothing more, than the violence, or dammage offered to him: yet forſooth, the Rebels affirm, they killed the King by the Common Law, and why by the Common Law? what, becauſe the Commons made it? ſurely that is all the reaſon, for there is no law under the Heavens, which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth Subjects to kill their King: but all lawes both humane, and divine command the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Many are the publick oaths, (as you may read in Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s <hi>Concordia diſcors)</hi> proteſtations, leagues, covenants, which all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, (eſpecially Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Mayors, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Lawyers, Graduates, Members of the Houſe of Commons, and all publick officers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) by the Lawes, and Statutes of the land, have formerly taken, to their lawful hereditary

Kings, their heirs, and ſucceſſors, to bind their ſouls and conſciences, to bear conſtant faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, obedience, and dutiful ſubjection to them, and to defend their Perſons, Crowns, and juſt royal Prerogatives, with their lives, members, and fortunes, againſt all attempts, conſpiracies, and innovations whatſoever. But ſince, all thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oaths have been trayterouſly violated, and broken by the Rebels againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. I will only preſent you with the effect of the Oath of Allegiance, which every one is to take when he is of the age of twelve years, and this oath was inſtituted in the time of King <hi>Arthur. Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, fo. 7. <hi>Co.

So help you Almighty God.</hi> The ſubſtance and effect of this oath (as it is reſolved, and proved in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s caſe) is due to the King, by the law of Nature, and is called <hi>Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antia naturalis,</hi> being an incident inſeparable to every Subject; for ſo ſoon as he is born, he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by birth-right ligeance and obedience to his Soveraign, and therefore the King is called in his Statutes our natural liege Lord, and his people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liege Subjects. But <hi>Ligeantia legalis,</hi> is ſo called becauſe the Municipal Laws of this Realm
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:108856:197"/>
have preſcribed the order and form of it. None can deny but that obedience is due from the Son to the Father by the Law of Nature, yet may the Municipal Laws of the Realm preſcribe formality and order to it, not diminiſhing the ſubſtance. So likewiſe may they to the Allegiance due by nature to the King.</p>
            <p>Thus have you ſeen how the Engliſh Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Rebells, contrary to all the Laws of God, the Law of Nature, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Laws of our Realm, and againſt the foundation of Chriſtian Religion, have by an unheard of example, moſt wickedly murthered, &amp; as a common Thief, and vile vaſſal of the people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their gracious King, whoſe name from the very beginning of the world hath ever been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt all Nations great and holy; whom the Prophets and Apoſtles, nay our Saviour himſelf, and all the Primitive Chriſtians, both with their lives, death, examples, and Doctrine have taught, and commanded us to reverence and pray for, and to be ſubject to, not violently to reſiſt him though he violently perſecute us; whom God himſelf in his old and new Teſtament hath declared to be conſtituted by him, and reign by him, (not by the People,) and particularly whom our fore-Fathers of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> have always accounted ſacred, and ever found by experience Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be moſt glorious, and profitable for them, yet theſe forty or fifty Tyrannical Rebels,

            <p>I have ſufficiently proved, that it is unlawfull for Subjects to rebel againſt evil Kings: How much more then is it unlawfull to rebel againſt a pious, and mercifull Soveraign, which addeth to the bulk of the ſins of our Engliſh Rebels? For the whole world knoweth, that <hi>Charls</hi> the Martyr (whom they ſo trayter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly murthered,<note rend="inter">Read his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Book, which will make thee weep for our loſs, but rejoice and admire at his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</note>) was the beſt of Kings, and meekeſt of men: He was <hi>Charls le bon, &amp; Charls le grand,</hi> good in his greatneſſe, and great in his goodneſſe. Some have ſaid, that a good King cannot be a good Chriſtian, but it is proved manifeſtly falſe in him, for to the admiration of the whole Earth, he was the beſt of Chriſtians, and no leſs to be admired as a good King: So that his misfortune in his Government did not proceed from his deficiency in the art of Governing, but from the exceſſe of the Rebels ſins, who tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Traytors ſince the creation of the world, in ſin, and treachery, as far as Hell is diſtant from the Earth. Wherefore we may moſt truly ſay, that he was murthered, only becauſe he was good:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:108856:198"/>
For every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to deſolation,<note rend="inter">Luk. 11.18.</note> if Satan alſo be divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall his Kingdom ſtand? Therfore if the King had been evil, theſe evil Traytors would never have caſt him out, but ſeeing he was a pious and Religious King, (and ſo an evil Member to their evil Common-wealth,<note rend="inter">See their charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note>) They all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their hearts and hands to cut him off, and lay to his charge all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Murthers, Rapines, Burnings, Spoils, Deſolations, Damage and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to this Nation, which they themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. So Thieves and Murtherers may ſpoil, burn, and make deſolate all places, and Maſſacre, and kill many Noble, and truſty Servants, to the end they might take their Maſter and kill him, and then having taken him, lay all to his charge, and execute him as the only Author of all thoſe villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which they themſelves acted and occaſioned.

Yet cannot their malice but marvel at the virtues, and patience of their King, whom they ſo much wrong: And it grieves them to ſee that royal progeny (whoſe ruine they ſo greedily hunt after) flouriſh with ſuch glorious ſplendour amongſt the Kings, and Princes of the Earth, growing in favour both with God and Man; Whilſt they (odious to all but themſelves) by their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Rebellion, incurr the diſpleaſure both of Heaven and Earth, and become a Ridiculous Rump, The object of the ſcorn and deriſion, both of Old and Young, Rich and Poor. And had not theſe infatuated Rebels, braſen faces to deny what their own Conſcience telleth them is true, They would preſently declare, that the only way to ſettle our diſtractions, and reſtore our Nation to its priſtin happineſſe, and glory, were to call in the King, and re-eſtabliſh him in his own, which they unjuſtly pocket from him: For ſo long as there is one of the race of the <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts</hi> (which God long preſerve) and any forein King, or People, remain alive, we muſt never look for peace, or plenty, but (as publick Thieves) alwayes live in a poſture of Warr, and ever expect forein Nations to come in, and ſwallow us up, Who account it (as indeed it is) the greateſt piece of Juſtice under the Sun, to revenge (with our bloods, and utter deſtruction) the bloody Murther of <hi>Charls</hi> the firſt, and the unnatural Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Charls</hi> the ſecond, our only lawful

our great Sins. Therefore to reſolve this doubt, I went up into the City, where inſtead of Tears (as formerly) I had like to have been drowned with the Streams of joy, and rejoycing; The Bell rung merrily, the Streets were paved with mirth and every houſe reſounded with joyful acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            <p>Oh therefore let our diſtracted <hi>England</hi> be a warnin-gpiece to all Nations, that they never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to Try and Judge their King, for what cauſe ſoever; And let all Traytors and Tyrants in the World learn by the example of our Engliſh Rebels, that their Proſperity and Dominion (though it ſeemeth never ſo perpetual) is but momentary, and as the wind which no man ſeeth; For who ſo much applauded, and look'd upon, as the Long Parliament, when they firſt took upon then to correct and queſtion the King? and who now ſo Ridiculous, and Scorned?

            <p>And that theſe Rebels may ſtill have <hi>freedom</hi> to perſevere in their villanies, they cry up a <hi>free-State,</hi> as the beſt of all Governments, yet (mark the nature of the beaſt,) a free-State (ſay they) is moſt beneficial for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet not ſo <hi>free,</hi>

All the reaſon which they can give againſt Monarchy, is, becauſe (ſay they) many of the people would loſe their intereſts in their new purchaſed eſtates; and we ſhould be turned out of our poſſeſſions, and perhaps loſe

So thieves and murtherers may argue againſt the Seſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then perhaps they ſhould loſe their ſtollen goods, and be hanged for their murthers and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries.

Dig and delve they may, yet they will never ſet it in ſo faſt, but that (if the right heir do not, which God grant he ſoon may) the wind and ambition of ſome one of their own ſect and faction, will quickly blow it down: as did <hi>Oliver</hi> the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Thus when we have received our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, from his long unnatural baniſhment, what then can the Lord do more for us, that he hath not done? Wherefore when he looketh that we ſhould bring forth good grapes, let us take heed that we do not bring forth wild grapes, let us fear God and honour the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change, as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, for if we refuſe and rebel, we ſhall be devoured with the Sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, and ſo our laſt rebellion will be worſe for us then the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>General Monk</hi> hath amply repaired his honour which he loſt by pulling down the City Gates and Perculiſſes, and in ſtead of proving a Keeper to the Trayterous Keepers, he hath approved himſelf a glorious D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ender of our Liberties, for which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:108856:214"/>
Trophies of honour ſhall be erected to his eternal renown; neither will our King ſpare heaping of rewards, upon his ſo memorable merits, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his own houſe, which the General hath ſwept for him, and turned out them who made it aden of thieves.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday the 21. day of <hi>February,</hi> 1659. (a day which deſerveth more ſolemnization, than Gunpowder Treaſon day; for then we were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from thoſe who only intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy King and Parliament, but now we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from thoſe, who actually did deſtroy both King and Parliament, and ſo conſequently the whole Kingdome) General <hi>Monk</hi> (our famous Patron) conducted the ſecluded Members to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note rend="inter">You may gueſſe with what a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the Rump looked upon them.</note> where (according to their former agreement with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral) they voted themſelves in a ſhort time to be diſſolved, and a free Parliament to be elected. Now I hope no man will preſume to conceive the General ſo inſipid, as to think there can be a free Parliament, without the King, and Houſe of Lords. No, it is ridiculous to think ſo; for a free Parliament without the King, would be but like ſalt which hath loſt his favour, thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt out, and to be troden under foot of men. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.13. It would be but a Rump fatned, and grow bigger. For we
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:108856:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are all ſick of the Kings Evil, therefore nothing but the touch of his Sacred Majeſties hands can cure us. And I may with confidence, and truth affirm, that every one of that infinite number of people, which ſo much rejoyced at the deſtruction of the Rump, and at the voice of a free Parliament, would mourn, and cry at their ſitting, if they do not bring with them the good tidings of reſtoring their King, the hopes whereof only made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. And indeed, they would have more cauſe to bewail a free Parliaments ſitting, without the King, than the ſitting of the Rump; for this we may be ſure of, that the King will come in either by fair means, or by ſoul; if by ſoul, that is by war; then the war will be greater with a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (and ſo conſequently more grievous to the people) than with the Rump; becauſe a free Parliament will have greater force, and power to levy a war, than the Rump, and ſo the combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter being more, the flame will be the higher. But it is Atheiſm, to think that a free Parliament will withſtand the King: therefore I will not taint my Paper with ſuch deteſtable words.</p>
            <p>I let fall a blot of ink, upon Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Power of Parliaments and Kingdomes,</hi> a Book which I am ſure deſerves a greater blurre. But Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath ſince repaired his credit, and got the applauſe of the people, by writing for the King, and againſt the Rump, and other ſectaries. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:108856:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to give him his deſerts, there is no man in the Nation, hath ſo much merited as himſelf, in pulling down the many Tyrannies over us, ſince the murther of <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. He hath been our Champion, whoſe pen hath fought againſt the ſcriblings, and actings of the Traytors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; for which I ſhall ever love and honour him, and without doubt, our Gracious King will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently reward him, if he continueth conſtant in his loyalty; which God grant he may.</p>
            <p>And although the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> held the head of <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr to the block, by his hair, whilſt the <hi>Independent</hi> cut it off; yet now I hope the many evils which we have ſuſtained by that royal fall, (for which he ſhewed the firſt play) will teach the rigid <hi>Presbyter</hi> moderation; and make him confeſſe (notwithſtanding his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Covenant againſt that Apoſtolical conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Biſhops,) that Epiſcopacy is the beſt form of Church Government, and the only way to extirpate and keep down thoſe infinite number of ſ31y'sects and factions, which have taken root, and budded, ſince Epiſcopacy was rooted up and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. <hi>No Biſhop, No King,</hi> was the Symbole of our <hi>Solomon,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> who I think was as wiſe, and as much a Chriſtian, as any of our Lay-Elders; therefore in vain do the Presbytery think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Monarchy, unleſſe they firſt reſolve to lay aſide all their ſchiſmatical Tenets, and ſtick to Epiſcopacy: For (as the ſame King ſayes) <hi>A
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:108856:216"/>
Scottiſh Presbitery, and Monarchy, agree as God and the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Soveraign <hi>Charls</hi> the Martyr in his ſacred writings, hath ſo clearly approved, and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Epiſcopacy from the falſe aſperſions of the Presbiterian faction, and alſo laid open the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of Presbitery ſo fully, that it would be arrogance in me to ſay any thing after him, and not only ignorance, but impudence, in any man to look upon his writings, and ſtill remain a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterian. Therefore O Heavenly Father aſſwage the pride, and open the Eyes of theſe rigid Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, that in ſeeing, they may ſee, and in hearing, they may hear, and underſtand; and not profeſſe themſelves wiſer than our Saviour, that great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and his Apoſtles which were Biſhops, and appointed ſucceſſive Biſhops, as you may read in the Epiſtles of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus &amp;c.</hi> And the Government of Biſhops hath been the univerſal and conſtant practice of the Church, ſo that (as <hi>Charls</hi> the Martyr writeth) ever ſince the firſt age, for 1500 years not one example can be produced of any ſetled Church, wherein were many Miniſters and Congregations, which had not ſome Biſhop above them, under whoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and Government they were. Therefore let not the aſpiring, curriſh Presbiterian (who would pull down a Biſhop in every Dioceſſe, but ſet up a Pope in every Pariſh) no longer ſpet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom againſt the Reverend Biſhops; And truly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:108856:216"/>
I think their grounds are ſo ſlender againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, that if the King would but make them Biſhops, they would then be as violent for Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, as they are now againſt it: Therefore reſt content Presbiter, for though not thy deſerts, yet State Policy, may in time make thee a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</p>
            <p>The Antipodes indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Long called Parliament, who acted all things contrary to all Law and Religion, voted that Biſhops ſhould never more vote as Peers in Parliament; But why? was it not becauſe the Religious Biſhops ſhould not withſtand their Irreligious and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous proceedings, in Murthering the King, Deſtroying the Church, and all our Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with them? Surely no man can deny but that was the only reaſon. <hi>Que enim eſt reſpubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ubi Eccleſiaſtici primum non habeant locum in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiis, &amp; publicis de ſalute Reipub: Deliberationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus?</hi> For which is that Commonwealth, where the Eccleſiaſtical perſons had not the firſt place in all meetings, and publique conſultations, about the Welfare of the Commonwealth? Surely none but the Utopian Commonwealth of theſe Rebels; For it is the practice of all Nations, nay the Rebels themſelves, who voted it unlawful for Biſhops, and other grave Prelates of the Church, to meddle the leaſt in Civil Affairs, could approve it in their new inſpired Prophets, whom they admitted to have the chiefeſt voyce in
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:108856:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their meetings, and conſultations, concerning Warr or Peace. Pope <hi>John</hi> in his Chair, never thought himſelf ſo bigg, as a Cymical Presbiter amongſt his Lay-Elders, or as an Independant in a Committee of Tryers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither did Pope <hi>Joan</hi> in her State, ever think ſo well of her ſelf, as a Sanctified Presbiterians Wife, dreſt up in her beſt Attire. The Lords Prayer, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, is held prophane by theſe Saints becauſe Chriſt (not they) taught and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us when we pray, to pray thus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And becauſe the Common Prayer is for the moſt part Texts of Scripture, which learneth us to pray for Kings and Biſhops, more than for their Presbiterian faction; The Reverend Biſhops forſooth muſt have no voice in Parliament, that Taylers, Tinkers, and Coblers, might have a full cry in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pulpit; The Clergy muſt not meddle with Civil Affairs, but every Tradeſman, nay thoſe who were ſcarce their Crafts-maſter in their own Trade, might handle Spiritual matters as the beſt proficients; But from ſuch Sacrilege, and Blaſphemy, good Lord deliver us. Let us therefore pray for the riſing of the <hi>Son</hi> in our <hi>Lebanon,</hi> whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Rayes of his Sacred Majeſty, will ſoon diſpell theſe foggy vapours of miſty factions. It was the Presbyterians who firſt Clouded? our <hi>Sun</hi> already ſet, And it is
