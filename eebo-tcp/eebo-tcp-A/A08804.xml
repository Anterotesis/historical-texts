            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>legis.</hi> This ſhewethus the danger of all our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>They put us out of the way: for our way is the way of Gods commandments: all other are called falſe wayes.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Uia legis,</hi> the way of the Law, which guideth our thoughts, words, and actions.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Via veritatis,</hi> the way of truth, which guideth our underſtandings, and judgements.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>via pacis,</hi> the way of peace, which guideth our heart, and the affections thereof. Sinne putteth us out of all theſe wayes. Into thoſe falſe wayes which <hi>David</hi> doth utterly abhorre. Yet he is fallen into them by a ſtrong tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
               <p>It is our wiſedome to know and conſider the nature of ſinne, that every ſinne is tranſgreſſion of Gods Law.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Joſeph</hi> anſwered his wanton Miſtreſſe: <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt God?</hi> And now <hi>David</hi> hath bethought him, he ſaith to <hi>Nathan:</hi> I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>We muſt not think, that any of our ſinnes do hurt God, or take from him any thing to empaire him. For when we live in his obedience, we give him occaſion to exerciſe his holineſſe in our ſanctification: his goodneſſe in our conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: his bounty in donation of all good to us. But if we tranſgreſſe, he exerciſeth his wiſedome in his detection of us: his holineſſe in abhorring of us: his juſtice in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:14122:4"/>So that the going out of our way which he hath ſet us in, his Law, is the hinderance of our owne journey, and the danger of our own ſouls and bodies.</p>
               <p>It is our great blindneſſe of judgement, and hardneſſe of heart, that we ſhould delight in ſinne againſt the Law of God.</p>
               <p>The Law of God is an undefiled law. The Law is holy,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and the commandment holy, juſt, and good.</p>
               <p>This was ordained of God to be a bridle to reſtraine ſinne: yet our corruption hath made it a ſpurre to provoke and put on ſinne. So the Apoſtle found it. For ſinne, that<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> it might appeare ſinne, working death in us by that which is good, that ſinne by the commandment might be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfull.</p>
               <p>For corrupt nature is impatient of reſtraint: and no fruit ſeemes ſo faire to the eye, or taſte ſo ſweet to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as the forbidden fruit doth. Every man above all things in the world affecteth his own will, and deſireth libertie to do what ſeemeth good in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>The Law doth reſtrain us of this: and it is,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Holy, in directing us a way wherein we may w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>David</hi> hath profeſſed great love to this Law; great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, all his Pſalmes over. He hath confeſſed great benefits received from it: yet here he confeſſeth tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and iniquitie, and ſinne: he hath not kept this Law and hath ſinned againſt God.</p>
               <p>Now we ſee in this example, how heavy ſinne is, when the conſcience groweth ſenſible of it. Nothing ſo pleaſant as our ſinne, for the time: but <hi>Citò praeterit, quod delectat:</hi> It ſoone paſſes away, which delighteth: now <hi>David</hi> gronesunder the burthen of it: he hath the whole weight of the law upon him for it; and he hath found that he hath walked contrary to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>

               <p>There is no reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſinne.

               <p>
                  <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> very judiciouſly looketh beyond <hi>David</hi> in this Pſalme, and maketh the whole Pſalme the complaint of Chriſt. Who though he were free from the infection of ſinne, yet was he over-laden with the burthen thereof, for God layed on him the iniquities of us all.</p>
               <p>So the point is more preſt to the conſcience of a ſinner: for if my ſinnes could make the ſoul of Chriſt heavy to death: if my ſinnes could make him ſweat water and

               <p>For theſe iniquities do move God to anger: and <hi>it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of God</hi> in his diſpleaſure: for even our <hi>God is a conſuming fire.</hi> Now we ſee in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> example, how comberſome a few ſinnes are, and what feare, what agony of heart, what griefe, what ſhame they bring. We have cauſe to lay this to our hearts: for when we ſhall ſee our many crying, bold, preſumptuous ſinnes together in order before us: when our conſcience ſhall tell us, not onely that we have received the grace of God in vain; but that we have turned the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and have abuſed his beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We have cauſe to think upon it now, if our Land after ſo great bleſſings of God, ſwarme at this day with impious ſinnes, if Religion hath ſuffered ſymonie and oppreſſion, pride and drunkenneſſe.

our gold, that it will ask an hot fire to refine us. God in favour yet forbeareth us, expecting our repentance: and there is no hope of his love but in that way.</p>
               <p>To faſt and mourne for a day, to ask God forgiveneſſe, to promiſe amendment, is no more then <hi>Ahab</hi> may do, and it may ſpinne out the time, and put off judgement for a while. But <hi>plangere commiſſa,</hi> to bewail ſinnes committed, is but a part of repentance, and it hath loſt the labour, and our tears ſhall never be put into the bottle: if after we do <hi>committere plangenda,</hi> commit ſinnes to be bewailed.</p>
               <p>Tranſgreſſions, iniquities, ſinnes; theſe are our diſeaſe, and that which threatneth it mortall, is our dangerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie.</p>

                  <hi>Mercie:</hi> this is the ſoveraigne remedy: this heals all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: but ſome few drops of this balme will not do it here. <hi>David</hi> knows that God hath ſundry veſſels of this wine, ſome ſtronger then other: he deſireth to draw of the ſtrongeſt, and for quantity he deſireth the multitude, a great meaſure, and that running over: for qualitie, his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt and deareſt compaſſions. Thoſe that are extracted and diſtilled to the height of ſtrength, ſinnes of ignorance, ſinnes of infirmitie and weakneſſe: ſinnes committed with reluctation and reſiſtance, the Fathers have called veniall, becauſe a ſmall meaſure of Gods mercy will remove them and their puniſhment: but ſtudied ſinnes acted after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and practiſed upon adviſe, and uſed to hide and ſhelter other ſinnes, have a more provoking qualitie in them to kindle the wrath of God, a worſe deſerving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to draw that wrath upon us. <hi>David</hi> needs the moſt, the beſt and ſtrongeſt of theſe mercies for his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.

as a father takes pity: Chriſt hath given us a full example of ſuch a Father in the parable of the prodigall. Look how high the heaven is above the earth, ſo high is the mercie of God to them that feare him: that is nothing in compariſon: for mercie cannot be numbred. This is that which boundeth the waters of the Sea, that they do not return to drown the earth. This keepeth his fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone bound up, that it falleth not upon our Cities and Towns, our perſons, and cattell, to conſume them. This locketh up the earth underneath us, that it doth not open the mouth to ſwallow us up quick. This keepeth the key of his treaſures of judgements, that they cannot come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to deſtroy and conſume the world, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Lam 3. 22.</note> It is of the Lords mercies, that we are not conſumed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his compaſſions faile not.

They that love lying vanities, forſake their own mercy.</p>
               <p>The mercy of God is called our mercy, for God hath no occaſion to uſe his mercy any where elſe but among the ſonnes of men. The Angels that ſinned are not capable of it. The Angels that ſtand in their firſt eſtate never came to miſerie, and they ſtand by the providence and love of God. But ſinfull man maketh God called mercifull, and he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him to his multitude of tender compaſſions. This is the rock of our refuge, our ſtrong Citie of refuge againſt the purſuer, it is our hiding place. In nothing doth God comfort us more. Therefore be ye merciful with this <hi>ſicut: Sicut pater veſter coeleſtis:</hi> as your heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that flattereth ſinne more, and that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it growth and vegetation amongſt us, then the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening of this mercie. Every wicked man can ſay, God hath multitude of tender compaſſions: and his mercies are more then my ſinnes: it is true. But what intereſt ſuch a one may have in thoſe mercies, he little conſidereth. For with the Lord is mercie, that he may be feared: and that a

ſinner may apply himſelf not to continue in his finne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon it, but for ſake it beleeving it: for he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and for ſaketh his ſinne ſhall have this mercie.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore begin with <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Confitebor contra me,</hi> I will confeſſe againſt my ſelf, and ſay: <hi>Peccavi contra Dominum,</hi> I have ſinned againſt the Lord: with a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our ſinnes, and a ſenſe both of the pollution of them within our ſelues, and of the provocation of Gods due diſpleaſure againſt us for them. Then it will be in ſeaſon to call for mercie.</p>
               <p>But if we over-weene our own integritie, as ſome juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries do: <hi>Sani non egent medico:</hi> the whole need no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian: or if we ſinne on in confidence of mercy at laſt: We ſhall finde that God ſitteth in his throne, and judgeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly; and that the ungodly ſhall not ſtand in judgement, nor ſinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the juſt: but the way of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſhall periſh.</p>

to all that is regiſtred in that book whether it be good or evill. He is ſaid to blot us out of that book, when our true repentance, and his free pardon hath removed our iniquity from us. Two Doctrines ariſe from hence.</p>

               </list>
               <p>1. Doctr. Knowing the terrour of the Lord, we muſt be wariehow we ſinne againſt him; for though we love ſinne, he hateth it. He is a God that loveth not wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither ſhall any evill dwell with him. Though we ſleight ſinne, and paſſe it over gainſomely and pleaſantly; yet he taketh it to heart, and recordeth it, that he may be able to ſet all our ſinnes in order before us, when time comes. This is a black book, and it will be a fearfull and ſhamefull thing to behold all our ſinnes inventoried toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>All our idle words, vain, laſcivious, malitious, falſe, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous ſpeeches: all our looſe thoughts; all our vaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull deſires, all our ungodly works done; all the good duties omitted; all the evils we would have done; all the imaginations of the thoughts of our hearts: are not all theſe things written in his book? We may conceive it by this. <hi>David</hi> hath the honourable memory of walking in all the wayes of God alwayes, ſave onely in the matter of <hi>Uriah</hi> the Hittite.</p>
               <p>That matter is recorded in this living book of holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: ſo are many of the infirmities of his holy ones: chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for terrour of his children, that they might feare to ſinne againſt him, who keepeth ſo exact a ſcore of all our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
               <p>Theſe are called debts, and God our creditour keeps his debt-book very perfect. The Steward in the parable called his Maſters debtors: they could tell every man what he owed: but who knoweth how often he hath offended? We have no hope to pay theſe debts: and therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire mercy to blot them out of the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:14122:8"/>And if we look back upon the tranſgreſſions of our whole life, we ſhall ſee need not onely of the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lord; but of the multitude of his tendereſt compaſſions.</p>
               <p>2. Another book is the book of our Conſcience: this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo keepeth a record againſt us. It was called of old, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit; for though our appetite and witbe ſo corrupt that the deceivable luſts of the fleſh do often tranſport us to Gods offence: yet our underſtanding, and reaſon, and memorie, informe our conſcience of our ſinnes, and that booketh them.

               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> ſueth to have his tranſgreſſions blotted out of both theſe books.

               <p>We beleeve a day of judgement deſigned and ordained of God for a ſevere audit of all our ſinnes. We are in that day judged by both theſe books of Gods remembrance, and of our own conſcience. For ſo we ſhall be our own judges: and there can be no hope for ſuch as have theſe books opened againſt them. God cannot forget. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot but accuſe, ſo that we are all children of wrath, and in a ſtate of condemnation. The judge may ſay, <hi>Quid opus eſt teſtibus?</hi> What need of witneſſes? for the leaſt, one of theſe legions of ſinnes that we are guilty of hath weight enough to weigh us down to the bottome of hell. All theſe will make the pit ſhut her mouth upon us.</p>
               <p>2. But againſt this <hi>David</hi> doth ſhew comfort, when he prayeth to have his tranſgreſſions blotted out of Gods book. For this ſheweth that there is a way out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the vengeance to come. The book wherein all our debts are recorded may be croſt, and the offences may be blotted out. The way is,</p>
               <p>1. The juſtice of God muſt be ſatisfied, our debt paied: for God can neither falſifie his truth, who hath threatned ſinne with vengeance: nor ſatisfie and ſilence his juſtice without it. So that we muſt finde Ieſus Chriſt in this prayer, without whom there is no acceptance to God for a ſinner: for our life is hid with God in Chriſt; we appeare in our ſelves no other but dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. But Chriſt is our life: and the loving kindneſſe that <hi>David</hi> prayeth for here, is that wherewith God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that we

might not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>And the tender mercies which he craveth, are thoſe of which <hi>Zachary</hi> doth ſpeak: <hi>Through the tender mercie of our God, whereby the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us. To give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death: and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</hi>

               <p>Here is <hi>Via lactea,</hi> the milkie way, the very way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for the tender mercies of God give not onely light of comfort to cheare our hearts; but light of direction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to guide our wayes, and that is the blotting away our repented ſinnes.</p>

               <p>It is true, that God ſeeth no iniquitie in his elect, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them for it: for there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.

But if any of the elect turn out of the way for a time to walk after the fleſh, as <hi>David</hi> here did: he ſeeth that ſinne, he hateth it, he puniſheth them for it, and till he hath waſht them from it, they remain defiled with it.

in his Church in the new Teſtament with the Prieſts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whoſoever ſinnes you remit, they are remitted unto them: abſolution is not rightly adminiſtred, but upon a faire evidence of a true and ſerious repentance; Which muſt begin at confeſſion: and therefore the power of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution doth ſuppoſe a duty of confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The abuſe of confeſſion in the Church of Rome hath gotten it an ill name, ſome of them having many times corrupted it to their own ends to ranſack the conſciences of men, and to romage the hearts of men to finde how they may ſerve their turns.</p>
               <p>Yet was it an holy inſtitution in the intendment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that a man ſhould often ſurvey all his thoughts, and words, and actions. Cenſure them with griefe; tremble at them with fear; confeſſe them with ſhame; cure them with good counſell; expiate them with ſome revenge; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them with full purpoſe of amendment of life: and eſtabliſh their hearts with ſome healing comforts from the holy Word of God, adminiſtred as cordials from our ſouls Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>But as Auricular Confeſſion hath been ſometimes pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, it is a kinde of encouragement to ſinne: for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as ſome do, that their confeſſion, and penance, and abſolution doth waſh them throughly from all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and cleanſe them from all ſinne: They ſpare not to commit all kindes of ſinne in truſt of this remedie, making the remedie of ſinne a provocation to ſinne. Like thoſe mountebanks, that in ſight will wound themſelves, to ſhew the vertue of their ſalve, and drink poyſon in confidence of their antidote.</p>
               <p>Penances alſo have been ſometimes ſo eaſie and perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, as they may make a ſport at ſinne, ſtudy it with deliberation, practiſe it with delight, and expiate it at ſhort warning. But ſuch pardons were not afoot in <hi>Davids</hi> time, he confeſſeth to <hi>Nathan,</hi> and undergoeth a ſore pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance after <hi>Nathan</hi> had abſolved him.</p>
               <p>Good uſe might be made of this in the Church. If a true
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14122:14"/>
Penitent revealing his wounded conſcience to ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly Phyſitian of his ſoul, and declaring his true griefe did eſtabliſh his repentant heart with the comfort of the Word, and receive the benefit of Gods gracious pardon in the way of Gods holy ordinance.</p>
               <p>In buſineſſes of our eſtate we may heare wiſe men ſpeak out of experience, and reading, and obſervation: but it is ſafeſt to truſt ſuch whoſe profeſſion and practiſe in the laws may give us more full ſatisfaction in all our doubts.</p>
               <p>In diſeaſes of the body, reading, experience, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may accommodate men unprofeſſed to ſpeak ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and to adviſe wiſely: but health is a deare commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie; they do moſt ſafely that conſult the learned, ſtudied, and practiſed Phyſitian: he is the likelieſt to direct for our good.</p>
               <p>In the occaſions of the ſoul, although many great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars have profited to ability to informe the judgement in the truth, to convince errour, to inſtruct and comfort: yet ſeeing God hath ordained ſome in his Church to do this <hi>ex officio:</hi> and hath ſent them to teach, to baptiſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the prayers of the Church to him, to abſolve peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: our uſing of their miniſtery in theſe things is ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with warrant: and in this caſe, <hi>Nathans</hi> abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as good as on Angels.</p>
               <p>2 We finde <hi>David</hi> confeſſing here to God his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Nathan</hi> hath uſed all the good and diſcreet wayes that may be to bring <hi>David</hi> to a ſight and ſenſe of his ſinne.</p>
               <p>1 He ſhewed him his ſinne in a parable, borrowing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon to repreſent to him his ſinne.</p>
               <p>2 He ſhewed it in the commemoration of Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold favours to him, which cannot but ſhew, that God had better deſerved of him then to be anſwered with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his commandments. For he might plead, Do you thus unkindly requite my love!</p>
               <p>2 He came to the point, and opened his wounds, and ſhewed him the rottenneſſe and ſtench of them in an <hi>hoc</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14122:14"/>
                  <hi>feciſti;</hi> Thus haſt thou done, and I held my peace all this while.</p>
               <p>3 He revealeth to him the purpoſe of God for his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by a ſevere puniſhment of his faults divers wayes, as you have heard. This made him cry God mercie, and crave aid of Gods tender compaſſions to waſh him.</p>
               <q>For I acknowledge my wickedneſſe.</q>
               <p>Which teacheth; That true repentance ariſeth from a knowing, and beginneth at confeſſing our ſinne.</p>
               <p>They pray but faintly and weakly for mercy to waſh them, that do not well diſcerne and confeſſe their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The woman of Canaan that came to Chriſt for her daughter, cries loud for his help, the diſciples cannot ſtill her. Blinde <hi>Bartimeus</hi> runnes hard, and cryes lowd for his ſight.

All that feele need of help from God, and know it no where elſe to be had, will ply him heartily, and give him no reſt. So forceable is the knowledge of our ſinnes to put us upon God in importunate e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lagitations of mercy. Such know that there is no ſtate here on earth ſo unhappy, as the ſtate of a ſinner. Let us never hope for peace in our conſcience or favour with God, till we come to ſee and confeſſe our wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Oh that there were ſuch an heart of piety and holy zeale as to ſearch and try our own wayes, and to detect our own ſinnes, as we have hearts of malice and curiouſitie to dive into the tranſgreſſions of others. I would we could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our own beams as clearly, as we ſee the motes in our brothers eye. I acknowledge my wickedneſſe, I ſearch no further.</p>
               <p>Let me now turn your eyes upon your own hearts, and put you to the ſearch of them to the bottome, that you may confeſſe your wickedneſſe to God betweene you and him alone. For wounds muſt be ſearched before they can be

cured. And then ſhall you be prepared to heare the ſtory of Chriſts bitter paſſions, that he ſuſteined for you, which ſhall ſhortly be recounted to you out of the Goſpell by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Church. There you ſhall ſee the loving kindnes of God, and the multitude of his tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: you ſhal ſee what need your wounds had of his ſtripes; what need your voluptuous lives had of his dolorous throws and pangs: what need your crown of pride had of his crown of thornes: what need your crying ſinnes had of his ſtrong prayers and ſupplications: what need your deſerved curſe had of his undeſerved croſſe. If all tears were wiped from our eyes for our ſelves, and that our mouthes were filled with laughter, and our tongues with joy; yet if we did conſider in what liquour we were waſht, the precious bloud of a Lambe without ſpot: <hi>Pilates Ecce homo,</hi> Behold the man, ſhewing us our Redeemer newly come from his cruell whipping, his pretious body, the glory of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ploughed up with ſcourges into deep furrows to ſave our skinnes whole: <hi>Uox ſanguinis,</hi> the voyce of bloud, ſpeaking better things then the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> crying for our purification: and his dying plea even for his enemies; <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and a thouſand more conſiderable paſſages in his dolorous paſſion were enough, to turn all our harps into mourning, and all our organs into the voice of them that weep; to make our heads fountains of tears, to melt us into paſſion, to diſtill us into ſpirit of compaſſion, for him that payed ſo deare for our ſouls. <hi>Sic Deus dilexit mundum, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit filium ſuum, dedit unigenitum,</hi> as <hi>Auguſt, dedit unicum, ut non eſſet unicus:</hi> So God loved the world. He ſent his Sonne. He gave his onely begotten Sonne. He gave his onely Sonne, that he might not be his onely Sonne. And in the manner of giving, <hi>Non pepercit filio ſuo:</hi> he ſpared not his ſonne: he layd upon him the iniquitie of us all. Will you finde the cauſe of all this? the roote of bitterneſſe, the gall and wormwood that made his potion ſo corroding? Search your heart for ſinne, and waſh the bloudy wounds of your

               <p>That which undoes Religion, and deſtroyes the fear and ſervice of God, and hindereth our repentance, and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all our acts of piety: that which maketh the word to us a dead letter, that which weakeneth the power of our Baptiſme, and maketh the Lords Supper an eating and drinking of judgement; that which maketh all our praiſes of God a ſacrifice of fooles; that which turneth all our prayers into ſinne, and transformeth the grace of God into wantonneſſe, is;</p>
               <p>We either hide our ſinne out of ſight <hi>cautè</hi> cloſely,<note place="margin">1</note> wherein we may deceive the world: but we cannot ſhut up the eye of God, or benight the light of our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

               <p>Or we put on ſome honeſt names upon our diſhoneſt<note place="margin">3</note> carriages, calling wantonneſſe recreation; and proſecution of revenge, a ſtanding upon our credit, and a maintenance of honour.</p>
               <p>Or we face out our ſinnes with ſocietie, as drunkards plead they do no other then is done in Court, in City, in Countrey, and amongſt all ſorts and degrees of men theſe times; adde women too, for many will not ſit out in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. And if we reprove ſuch, they regeſt that ſome of our ſelves are good fellows too. Here the proverbe failes, The more the merrier: when they go in the wayes of death.</p>
               <p>Or we devolue our fault upon others, as <hi>Adam, Mulier</hi>

If the names of theſe ſinnes be ſhamefull, make conſcience of the ſinnes themſelves.</p>
               <p>For it was ever in faſhion in the world, and will be; that they which do wickedly and fooliſhly, ſhall be called wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and fooliſh perſons. I conclude with <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Achan: My ſonne, give I pray thee glorie to the Lord</hi>

               <p>3 We may adde, for the evils that he doth.</p>
               <p>For is there any evill or puniſhment which he ſendeth not? He is <hi>velox ultor,</hi> a ſwift revenger; and his right hand doth finde out all his enemies. We would not willingly anger a perſon that hath power to do us hurt, though we have no hope that he will ever do us good. But our God is a father as well as a judge, and with him is <hi>mercy that he may be feared,</hi> that we may not runne our ſelves upon the edge of his ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:14122:22"/>Let us conſider how all things elſe ſerve him but we onely, and the Angels that ſinned. They unhappied their eſtates by ſinning againſt God, and of glorious Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unclean devils: there is no part of the work of Gods hands ſo eternally caſt away, reſerved in chains of darkneſſe for the judgement of the laſt day. We had a way opened to us, a new and living way.</p>
               <p>2 He therefore reſumeth this, <hi>againſt thee,</hi> either doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the conſideration of his ſinne; or doubling the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the party offended by it: both which ſhews, that he had laid it to heart, and that lay heavy upon his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he had throughly conſidered againſt whom he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. We cannot think too much of it, we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it too often, we cannot deplore it too bitterly, that we have ſinned againſt God. For many are the preſſures of this life; but they are all comforted with a ſure refuge to God. He is our help in trouble: <hi>Vana ſalus hominis,</hi> the help of man is vaine.</p>
               <p>But when we ſinne againſt God, we lop the tree that ſhould ſhelter us from a ſtorme. We undermine the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of our dwelling. Whither ſhall we go for our healing when we are wounded? Whoſe counſell ſhall we aske when we are ſick? Who ſhall feed our hunger? &amp;c. Who ſhall then have pitie upon thee, O Ieruſalem? or who<note place="margin">Ier. 15. 5.</note> ſhall be moane thee, or who ſhall go aſide to aske how thou doeſt? Thou haſt forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, thou art gone backwards, therefore will I ſtretch out my hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and deſtroy thee, I am weary with repenting. Whatſoever we do againſt God, we do it againſt our ſelves. Whatſoever we do evill is againſt God: it oppoſeth his will, it reſiſteth his word and commandment: it valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the pleaſure of ſinne more then his favour, and exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth God for a vain delight. Is not this an high offence?</p>
               <p>3 He putteth it home, <hi>Tibi ſoli peccavi:</hi> againſt thee alone have I ſinned.</p>
               <p>Some queſtion is made, how <hi>David</hi> can ſay, <hi>Soli,</hi> Thee alone. Did not he offend <hi>Vriah</hi> in defiling his bed? in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14122:23"/>
for him to colour his adultery? in taking him home, under a pretence of entertainment, to make him drunk. After all to procure his death, did he not ſinne againſt <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to defile her? Did he not ſinne againſt <hi>Joab,</hi> to make him a murtherer? Did he not ſinne againſt his own body, to deſtroy the temple of the Lord, and to defile a veſſell of holineſſe with uncleanneſſe? Did he not treſpaſſe the Church which was aſhamed, and grieved at his aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Did he not treſpaſſe his double unction of King and Prophet? how then doth he ſay; <hi>Tibi ſoli,</hi> againſt thee alone? Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> doth two wayes anſwer this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
               <p>1 That he had done this ſinfull act ſecretly, and ſo had<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> none to make his peace withall, but God: who onely knew the offence. This doth not help: for <hi>Joab</hi> knew that he was an inſtrument of <hi>Davids</hi> injuſtice: he knew he had defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his own body: ſhe knew. And no queſtion but it was reſented of many. But this Pſalme was made for the uſe of the Church, after all was out againſt him.</p>
               <p>2 That he denyeth not the full extent of his fault; but<note place="margin">2</note> making his confeſſion to God, he declareth what did moſt cruciate and diſquiet his conſcience; onely this, that he had ſinned againſt God, and provoked his anger againſt him. This may paſſe for a good ſolution of the queſtion, for the ſinne againſt God extendeth to both Tables of the Law: and when we treſpaſſe our own ſelves, or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, we ſinne mainly againſt God in both.</p>
               <p>The full extent of our ſinne is onely againſt God. Every ſinne hath a branching and diſperſion, like ſo many brooks running into one maine ſtreame, all empty themſelves into the Sea, all finally wrong, God.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> addeth his own judgement, <hi>Tibi ſoli,</hi> againſt<note place="margin">3</note> thee alone.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, the ſecrecie of my ſinfull acts may keep it out of ſight from ſome: and the flatterie of others may caſt excuſes or defences upon it: and the charity of others may like <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> caſt a garment upon it to hide it: may

               <p>He addeth; that he nameth God onely, becauſe God onely hath the vengeance in his hand, and he is in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger but of him. For who on earth hath power to chaſten Kings for ſinne, but God onely? There was no Pope above Kings in <hi>David's</hi> time. The high Prieſt, a type of Chriſt, was nothing ſo great a man as the Pope, the Vicar of Chriſt. But the truth is, when Chriſt came to reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then began Sathan firſt to lay claime to all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth, and the power to diſpoſe of them: and he made Chriſt a great offer, to give them all to him.

               <p>It was my ſinning againſt thee in the contempt of thy word, that hath undone me, and made me a prey to Sathan. He that in the Serpent found that way to undo the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, by drawing him away from the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ever ſince hath tried that concluſion with all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and hath much advanced his kingdome by it: he tryed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14122:24"/>
the ſame way with Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, but he kept him to the word; <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it is written. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tryed him; by the word, and urged <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it is written, to him, hoping by the word to have recovered him from the word. And ever ſince his great agents, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, are great Textmen. This clearing of the words of <hi>David</hi> pointeth us to the beginning of all ſinne in us, which is at ſwarving from the word of God. <hi>David</hi> found it ſo dangerous, that the whole 119. Pſalme is aymed at that ſinne. Verſ. 1. and 2. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth them bleſſed that walk in this way, and keep his teſtimonies. Verſ. 3. They do no iniquitie, &amp;c. Verſ. 4. he urgeth Gods commandment for this to keep his precepts diligently. Verſ. 5. O that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatutes! 8. I will keep thy ſtatutes, O forſake me not utterly.</p>
               <p>His deſire to the word, his comfort from the word, his joy in the word, his eſtimation of the word, his love to the word: all the Pſalme is full of theſe holy meditations. We may all confeſſe in this reſpect with <hi>David,</hi> that we have ſinned againſt God onely, for having the word in that plentie, and ſo many helps by hearing and reading to take benefit of it.</p>
               <p>Our ungodly lives teſtifie, that we depart from it. Which of our ſinnes doth the word of God favour, which doth it not threaten with loſſe of the kingdome of heaven, as the Angels that ſinned loſt their habitation, and <hi>Adam</hi> his paradiſe for departing from that word?</p>
               <p>Iſrael Gods darling people loſt their Canaan, and firſt ten Tribes were lopt from the Church, then cut off from the ſtate, and carried away and never heard of.

               </list>
               <p>1 Of the perſon.</p>
               <p>It is againe preſt and may not be omitted in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For let every one conſider his own perſon in all his delinquences, and he ſhall finde ſo much more quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell againſt himſelf for it. Perſonall conſiderations do much aggravate or extenuate ſinnes. Sinnes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons are nothing, ſo defiling them and provoking God, as ſinnes of knowledge. Sinnes of yonger perſons, in whom the paſſions of youth are more unruly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and reaſon as yet but in the blade, offend not ſo much as ſinnes of aged perſons, whom time and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould both informe and confirme in better wayes: they have felt more comfort of the favour of God, and ſeen more examples of the juſtice of God; and have been longer taught in the word of God, and where God ſoweth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, he expecteth to reape plentifully.</p>
               <p>Sinnes in poore perſons who have received little at the hands of God, diſpleaſe him not ſo much as theirs whoſe cup doth overflow: whoſe pathes are anointed with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their bellies filled with the treaſures of his plenty. Sinnes in inferiour perſons not ſo offenſive as in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Princes, and eminent perſons: whoſe examples may prove infectious to corrupt many.</p>
               <p>Generally the ſame ſinnes in the people are leſſe then in the Miniſter: <hi>Cujus in ore verbum vitae, cujus in more</hi> ſhould be <hi>vitaverbi:</hi> In whoſe mouth is the Word of life, in whoſe converſation the life of the word. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> remembred his own perſon a King, and an holy Prophet, ſo much beholding to God for his high favours, his heart did the more ſmite him for his treſpaſſe.</p>
               <p>And thus ſhould the example work with us upon any temptation to ſinne; to conſider with <hi>Joſeph, How ſhould I</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:14122:25"/>
                  <hi>do this great wickedneſſe:</hi> and there take occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the favours of God to us: the fruits of the earth, the fruits of the wombe: of our cattel, our peace, our health, our daily bread, our friends, and all the comforts of life: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thus. God hath deſerved better at my hands, then ſo, that I ſhould give way to this temptation, and ſo ſinne againſt him, whoſe loving kindneſſe hath followed me all the daies of my life. Should I blaſpheme his Name by ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in whoſe name is my help? Should I prophane his Sabbath, who hath allowed me ſix dayes for my work, and this one for my reſt, and relaxation of all cares of life to attend his ſervice? Should I offend my neighbour, whom God made in his own image, for whom Chriſt ſhed his pretious bloud, and for whom he taketh care as he doth for me, that he may live in peace by me?</p>
               <p>And as this in early conſideration may prevent ſinne: ſo in a later conſideration it may ſerve to haſten our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to make it more ſerious, when not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many reaſons againſt it, I have yeelded to a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and committed a ſinne. The more cauſe I had not to do it, the more muſt my repentance be.</p>
               <p>2 The Commiſſion, <hi>Have done evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinnes of omiſſion wherein God is neglected, or our neighbour in duties of pietie or charitie give great offence. You may ſee it in the ſentence: I was hungrie, <hi>Et non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſtis me. Ite maledicti:</hi> and ye fed me not. Go you curſed.</p>
               <p>Sinnes of deſire, though not effected and perpetrated, do more offend: for as our good deſires do ſtand for acts, and receive rewards; ſo our evill and unlawfull deſires ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the malignity of our corrupt diſpoſitions, and merit juſt vengeance.</p>
               <p>Sathan doth corrupt the heart firſt, and then out of the foule treaſure of the heart proceed all kinds of evils. <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum animae,</hi> the ſinne of the ſoul, is the pollution of the ſoul, and God ſeeth it. <hi>David</hi> was an adulterer, when his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was firſt enflamed with luſt: but now it is done; <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife is defiled: <hi>Uriah</hi> is ſlain: here is a ſinne of commiſſion.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14122:25"/>
Sinnes of this kinde which corrupt us, and do hurt abroad cannot be recalled: ſo long as ſinne is but in deſire, it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at home onely; but when it comes abroad into action, it is a complete and full unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore in repentance we muſt eſpecially have care of ſuch evils as are done by us, which we cannot recall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them heartily, and to waſh them clean from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: for they cleavefaſt to us, they ſcatter their poyſon abroad. And if ſinnes of omiſſion do ſmart ſo upon offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſinnes of deſire; how deep is the ſcarlet dye of ſinnes of commiſſion?</p>
               <p>3 The treſpaſſe: <hi>I have done evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Evill,</hi> is a creation of our own: for all that God made was exceeding good. This we can do of our ſelves, yet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than puts us on by his temptations. Yet not under the name or ſhew of evill: the delight and pleaſure of the fleſh ſeemed in the temptation like the forbidden fruit, faire to the eye, and pleaſant in taſte.</p>
               <p>The evill we commit, if we think of, it will ſoon appeare like it ſelf to our underſtanding and reaſon, but eſpecially to the Spirit of God in us. But our appetite hath not the leaſure to adviſe with theſe: in general delight is good, &amp; pleaſure is the gift of God. But if this be not regulated by the Canon of manners, which is the holy law of God: there may be a latent evill which we are loath to ſee for feare of depriving our ſelves of our deſired delight. But when luſt hath conceived, we ſee the birth of ſinne quickly ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then the pleaſure is gone and nothing remaineth, but the evill, the guilt of ſinne, and the burthen of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. That is done, and there remaineth behinde the ſting of it anguiſhing the conſcience: or the cuſtome of it ſearing the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Every evill we do is an injury to God, and a contempt of his Law. If God ſhould for his pleaſure ſcourge, and torment us, and make it his ſport to heare our groanings, and to ſee our teares: who could challenge him for uſing his own creatures, according to his own will: but as a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14122:26"/>
father he loveth us: our paine his ſmart. How is it then that we take pleaſure in evill, which God hateth, and which ſo offendeth him, that his ſoul abhorreth all them that work wickedneſſe?</p>
               <p>It is a better way to be before hand with <hi>quid faciemus,</hi> What ſhall we do? good Maſter, what good thing may I do to obtain everlaſting life? then to cry, <hi>Quid feci?</hi> what have I done? Oh what evill have I done to deſerve death? Or as <hi>Job, Peccavi, quid faciam tibi?</hi> I have ſinned: what ſhall I do unto thee? The name of evill ſhould loath us, it is ſo foule; and it ſhould feare us, it is ſo dangerous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all temptations to it, it will be our wiſedome and holineſſe to abſtract the pleaſure of evill from the evill: To part them, and weigh them by themſelves. We ſhall finde the pleaſures of ſinne in weight lighter then vanity: and in ſuch firme conjunction with vexation of the ſpirit: and for their laſting, ſo ſhort lived, and ſo ſoone gone, and leaving ſuch a bitterneſſe in the ſoul behinde them, that the very thought thereof in ſad conſideration will call ſuch mirth madneſſe, and ſay to ſuch pleaſure, What meaneſt thou?</p>
               <p>Again, evill weighed by it ſelf will prove the burthen of the conſcience, the feare of a deadly blow, the trembling of our hearts, the ſhame of our faces, the diſquieting of the whole man. This ſheweth us what a body of ſinne we beare about us: for as the proverbe is, Wickedneſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the wicked: this calleth the heart uncleane, and the conſcience defiled. Ceaſe therefore to do evill, and learne to do well. This is the way of life, to eſcape the paths of death.</p>
               <p>Evils are a ſhamed of themſelves, and Sathan dare not be ſo open in his temptations, as to tender them to us bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced; but he putteth either ſome matter of vertue upon them, to hide them out of ſight; or ſome pretence of great pleaſure or profit to ſweeten them, that they may go down with us without diſtaſte. Let us but take ſo much leaſure as to take off this diſguiſe, and behold evill in it own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14122:26"/>
colours, and we ſhall ſee ſuch a loathed deformitie, we ſhall feele ſuch an abhorred complection of ſtench and commiſtion of filthineſſe, as will diſcourage us from it. We ſhall diſcerne danger in the touch of it, and death in the committing of it. <hi>Libera nos à malo:</hi> Deliver us from evill.</p>
               <p>4 The particularity: This ſinne.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Davids</hi> repentance doth come home to his preſent diſeaſe: this great exemplarie teeming and pregnant; this parturient ſinne which brought forth ſo many, ſo horrible ſinnes.</p>

               <p>We ſay of ſome man, he is a very true hearted honeſt man: but he will ſometimes over-drink; or he will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſweare in his paſſion: or he will over-ſhoot himſelf in his anger: or he is ſomewhat covetous, or prodigall, or wanton, &amp;c.

               <p>Opportunitie doth often tempt and prevaile againſt a great meaſure of knowledge and grace: and God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaveth us to our ſelves, to try our ſtrength how we can reſiſt Sathan.

               <p>It is our wiſedome to diſcerne this difference of our ſinnes, and conſider which be dyed in crimſin, which in ſcarlet, and to bring them to the waſhing eſpecially. So ſhall we be purged from our great offence.</p>

               <p>He had conveied this ſinne as cloſely and warily as he could: God took notice of that alſo. Thou diddeſt it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly: <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was ſecretly ſent for, and entiſed, and defiled: <hi>Vriah</hi> dyed in a juſt warre. But now <hi>David</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that all this was done in the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, he ſeeth what the hand doth, and what heart ſetteth it awork. <hi>David</hi> could not be ignorant of this: but we willingly embrace temptations to evill, which we can keep out of the worlds eye.</p>
               <p>The ſearching eye of God cannot be benighted: it is over all the world, and diſcerneth both good and evill. Will any man ſteale, whileſt the owner looketh on? Dare any man treſpaſſe a King, when his eye is upon him? A king ſitting on the throne of judgement driveth away all evill with his eye.

                  <hi>yea let God be true, but every man a ly ar: as it is written. That thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt overcome when thou art judged.</hi> The Apoſtle urgeth theſe words to this purpoſe, to ſhew that the ſinnes of thoſe who return by repentance, can no way hinder, but do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance the juſtice of God. God declareth this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in two things.</p>
               <p>1 In accompliſhing his threatnings of puniſhment to correct them with the roddes of men; and ſo theſe words of <hi>David</hi> have reference to that threatning of <hi>Nathan: Now therefore the ſword ſhall never depart from thine houſe.</hi> He confeſſeth, that God is by his open and offenſive ſinne, juſt in thoſe his words of commination, and all the world may ſee, that God is no favourer of ſinne in any of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, but he hath ready rods to chaſten it, to which juſtice he ſubmitteth. God hath occaſion given him by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14122:29"/>
feſſion of his ſinne, to declare his juſtice in the well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved puniſhment of it, ſo farre that when he ſhall execute that judgement upon him and his houſe, he ſhall be found cleare from any crueltie.</p>
               <p>2 But this is not all: for <hi>David</hi> had received many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of mercie from God to his own perſon and government, and to his poſteritie. And there might be a feare that this crying ſinne of <hi>David</hi> might reverſe theſe promiſes, and call in thoſe favours of God from him. Here <hi>David</hi> openly confeſſeth his ſinne, and declareth his ſtrong faith in thoſe ſure promiſes of God, beleeving that though he have ſinned againſt him, and <hi>done this great evill in his ſight,</hi> yet he will gratiouſly accept of his true repentance, and pardon him his ſinne, and make good his former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to him: So ſhall he be declared <hi>juſt in his ſayings,</hi> and promiſes of mercie, and ſhall be <hi>cleare when he judgeth</hi> him of violating his truth. Whereby it appeares, that the elect of God, when they fall into any grievous ſinne, do put God to it to declare his juſtice both wayes: for it is juſtice in God,</p>

taught us what we ſhould truſt to, in the fall of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. For when they had ſinned in the forbidden fruit, he left them awhile to the mercie of their own accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and to the ſcourge of ſhame, and the ſcorpions of their own feares to cruciate and anguiſh them. Then in the coole of the day he came himſelf and convented the offenders, and in a judiciall ſeſſion he examined the parties by the evidence of fact. And finding them guiltie, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them a ſentence of mortalitie, he accurſed the earth under them, he adjudged the man to labour and ſweating for his bread: The woman to ſubjection to her husband, and to great anguiſh in her child-birth. That all poſteritie might by their example feare the juſtice of God, and refraine from ſinne which brought ſo much evill upon the committer thereof. Yet we doubt not of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> was drunk once, and lay uncovered in his tent: his own ſonne diſcovered his ſhame: <hi>Noah</hi> deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but his ſonne ſhould not have puniſhed him: but God uſed the unnaturall evill affection of his ſonne, as his rod to puniſh the ſinne of the father.</p>
               <p>I could be full in examples for this proofe, that God doth not leave ſinne in his Saints unpuniſhed. I onely produce theſe two great examples.</p>

And the rather for the condemnation of their ſinnes which now are afoot in the world, and are ſcarcely confeſt to be ſinne.</p>
               <p>1 The forbidden fruit is deſired before any fruit of the garden: ſtolne bread is ſweet. The name of God which by a ſpeciall law muſt not be taken in vaine, what name ſo blaſphemed? Is it not a ſhame to Religion, that after
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14122:30"/>
the word had beene freely preached about 60. yeares in the free libertie of the Goſpell, and the Law of God in Pulpits and in print ſo learnedly expounded, that there ſhould be need of a ſpeciall ſtatute law for conſervation of this name from prophanation, and to ſet a corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a pecuniarie mulct upon ſwearers. But neither Gods Law, nor Acts of Parliament can ſave that name of God harmleſſe.</p>
               <p>I will preſſe no further inſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tell me by this taſte, whether the forbidden fruit be not moſt deſired?</p>
               <p>2 For <hi>Noahs</hi> ſinne, it was but once drunkenneſſe: and God left it not unpuniſhed with foule ſhame.</p>
               <p>In the Apoſtles time, it was a modeſt ſinne, he ſaith, <hi>They that are drunke, are drunke in the night.</hi> Now day<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5. 7.</note> and night are both guilty of it: it is a ſinne in faſhion: meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of purpoſe called and intended for it. The farewels of friends parting, the welcomes of friends returning, the celebration of great Feſtivals, as if <hi>Bacchus</hi> had waſht us in the bloud of the grape from our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But God will be <hi>juſtified in his ſayings:</hi> he will declare his juſtice in his ſevere puniſhment of this ſinne here: and if it be not ſincerely repented, he hath told us home what he will do: No drunkard ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven. I ſhould lay your ſinne to my own charge, if I ſhould not let you know the terrour of the Lord in this caſe. The defence of it by the ſocietie of ſinners aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſinne: God hateth it ſo much the more. <hi>Malum quo communius:</hi> Sinne the more common, the worſe.</p>
               <p>2 He declareth his juſtice in the performance of his mercie to his elect. For even in theſe examples in my text alledged;</p>
               <p>1 To <hi>Adam</hi> he ſhewed mercy, who ſinned having onely a Law for his obedience, with a penalty threatned in caſe of diſobedience; but there was no promiſe a foot, if he ſhould treſpaſſe that Commandment. And that made <hi>Adam</hi> when he had ſinned, hide himſelf from the preſence of God, aſhamed and afraid to come in ſight. But God in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14122:30"/>
free favour did ſeek him out, and before he called him to his anſwer for his ſinne, he reveiled mercie in the promiſed ſeed. When he laid his curſe upon the Serpent that tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and therefore ever ſince his time ſinners have a way of grace opened in that promiſe, and no ſinnes if ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for, can evacuate the force of that promiſe, it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to all that truly and ſincerely repent. So as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith: <hi>In judgement he remembreth mercie.</hi> There he did ſo in the very ſentence of judgement upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was the firſt revelation of mercie to man. He had no Obligation of a former promiſe to binde him to it, but it was a free and voluntarie tender of favour growing out of his own perfect and abſolute goodneſſe. In the tender whereof he hath given us ſtrong aſſurance that if in free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he would do ſo much, much rather when he had put us in ſecuritie thereof by promiſe.</p>
               <p>2 The example of favour to <hi>Noah</hi> doth juſtifie God in his ſayings: for he ſhewed him much favour after his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction of his fault.</p>
               <p>1 In verifying his bleſſing upon his two ſonnes. <hi>Sem</hi> of whom <hi>Abraham</hi> came, and the twelve Patriarches, and <hi>David;</hi> and Chriſt Ieſus. And to whoſe tents in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time he invited <hi>Japhet</hi> and brought in the fulneſſe of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>2 In accompliſhing his curſe upon his yongeſt ſonne many yeares after, by giving away their Land from them, and rooting them out with a violent deſtruction. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the repentance of <hi>Noah;</hi> which thought it be not in expreſſe and full termes ſet forth in the ſtorie; yet we may take it ſo ſignified, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; <hi>And Noah</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>awoke from his wine,</hi> that is, not onely recovered after ſleep to ſober judgement, but to a penitent recognition of his ſinne. And by the ſpirit of prophecie he was enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to looke into times to come, and to foreſee the future eſtate of his poſteritie: and by the ſpirit of ſupplication to deſire God for his eldeſt ſonne: and by the ſpirit of faith to beleeve in the reſolved goodneſſe of God to his ſecond
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14122:31"/>
ſonne. And in all the ſtory of holy Scripture we finde, that the ſinnes of repentant men though chaſtened with ſome temporall roddes of affliction, yet never failing of mercie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> children that tranſgreſſed were threatned with the roddes of men, but with reſervation of favour: not to take his mercie utterly from them, as from <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 We ſhall now ſee how <hi>David</hi> did beare himſelf in the wiſe conſideration of theſe two things.</p>
               <p>1 When he confeſt his ſinne, whereby God was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his threatnings of judgement. He declareth his own humble patience, ſubmitting himſelf to the holy hand of God: q. d. I confeſſe all my ſinnes, this my horrible and crying ſinne; that the world may ſee thy juſtice in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me, and my patience in bearing it. Stripes were ordained of purpoſe, for the backs of fools; I am one of them, and I put my ſelf under thy puniſhing hand. He is content, that as he hath made himſelf an example of a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinner: ſo God ſhould declare in and upon him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his ſevere juſtice, and ſo be <hi>justified in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>

               <p>If God did forbeare all other puniſhments of our ſinne in our own perſons, in our houſe and familie, in our goods, in the neceſſaries of life, in which kindes he ordinarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth himſelf upon offenders; yet if the ſinner ſhall but truly repent him of his ſinne, repentance it ſelf is a greater puniſhment then all theſe.</p>
               <p>There is more in it: when it is ſaid of <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>he went forth and wept bitterly,</hi> then in the diſciples, <hi>Reliquimus omnia,</hi> We have left all. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> felt more ſmart in the thorne in his fleſh, and the Angell of the Lord buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of him, then in all his dangers by Sea and Land; his ſtripes, ſhipwracke, impriſonment. When our own conſciences are upon torture, our ſouls upon the rack, when we judge and take vengeance upon our ſelves, it is judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy: We ever feare we underdo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſcience of his ſinne doth beare witneſſe to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14122:31"/>
juſtice of God, and he findeth no fault with his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Surely murmurers that repine at the puniſhing hand of God, and think much of his judgements, enflame the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God more by their reſiſting his right hand which hath found them out. If they went in <hi>Davids</hi> way to take a juſt dimenſion of their ſinne, and did confeſſe it contrite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, they would be content that he ſhould declare his juſtice in their puniſhment, and they would ſee that he would overcome if he came to be judged. Speak thy conſcience: when thou abuſeſt thy drink to drunkenneſſe, if God puniſh thee with thirſt, haſt not thou well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it? If thy meat to ſurfet; if thy ſtrength to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 He ſheweth faith. For notwithſtanding theſe many, and this foule great ſinne, he beleeveth that God will be juſtified in his ſayings, that is, declared juſt in his gracious promiſes of mercie.</p>
               <p>The ſinnes of the elect cannot outgrow the mercies of God; nor our offences make his truth faile. <hi>David</hi> is ſo full of this faith, that as he ſpendeth part of this Pſalme in a deploration of his ſinnes: ſo he beſtoweth alſo part of it in ſupplications, whereby he declareth his faith.</p>

               <p>That we were all in <hi>Adam</hi> in the day of his creation, needeth no proofe, for out of him was the woman created, and of them made one fleſh by marriage, was all mankinde propagated. So that theſe firſt parents of our fleſh did ſtand or fall to the benefit or loſſe of all their poſteritie. But man ſtood but a while in honour, and by his fall he not onely corrupted his own perſon, but his nature; whereby there remained an infection of ſinne to the pollution of the whole nature of mankinde. This the Apoſtle hath affirmed diſertly. In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> all dye, that is, all are ſubject to the law of mortality: and all are under the curſe of the law for the ſecond death.

impotencie in nature, to know and do the duties of the Law of God. But they deny it to be ſinne. Their reaſon is. <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the earth: we were made of <hi>Adam: Adam</hi> was made of the earth onely, in reſpect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The body was free from ſinne, the ſoul a ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance infuſed by God was alſo free from ſinne: ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was created without ſinne. But we were no otherwiſe made of <hi>Adam,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> was made of the earth: and we were no more in <hi>Adam</hi> when he ſinned, then <hi>Adam</hi> was in the earth before his creation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, according to the body, <hi>Adam</hi> had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment given him, till he had underſtanding to embrace it, and will to receive or refuſe it. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned not till he departed from the commandment. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hence, that we receiving nothing but our fleſh from <hi>Adam,</hi> cannot ſinne, till we have underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know what is commanded us: <hi>ergo,</hi> no originall ſinne.</p>
               <p>To all which we anſwer. That the fleſh which <hi>Adam</hi> took from the earth, was pure; for ſo was the earth. But the fleſh that we take from <hi>Adam</hi> is tainted with ſinne. And true it is that no actuall ſinne can be committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law. But we may be guilty of originall impuritie without prevarication of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> had onely the matter of his body from the earth, we derive more from <hi>Adam.</hi> For whereas as God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed into the body of <hi>Adam</hi> all at once the breath of lives: We live three lives. The life of plants in our vegetative: The life of bruits in our ſenſitive: The life of Angels in our rationall ſoul. Philoſophers and Phiſitians, and the learned Scholars of nature do reſolve, that we traduce two of theſe lives from our parents: the third is immediately both crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and infuſed by God.</p>
               <p>The proper ſeat of originall ſinne is in the ſenſitive part of man, and that corrupteth our reaſon; and as it groweth faſter then our rationall doth, ſo it over-groweth it, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14122:33"/>
keepeth it down; untill our new birth doth cut it and keep it ſhort, and the good Spirit of God give us ſtrength to reſiſt it, and to ſubdue it. This God himſelf hath in both Teſtaments fully detected in two holy Sacraments: firſt Circumciſion. This was to be adminiſtred ſo ſoone as an infant was capable of it, even after the firſt criticall day, and that part of the body was choſen for this Sacrament, which might beſt ſhew our generation unclean: it was a Sacrament of purgation the impuritie of our naturall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

                  </gap>eſtament the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was inſtituted to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And where our Anabaptiſts do charge us, that by our doctrine of originall ſinne we bring upon infants a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eternall death, and thereby we revive that wicked Proverbe, The fathers have eaten fowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge. We regeſt this calumny upon them in juſt imputation. For when they confeſſe that we traduce from our parents vanity, corruption, and death: theſe are the puniſhments of ſinne, and if we have no ſinne of our own, it is our parents ſinne, and ſo our teeth are on edge for their ſowre grapes.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of originall ſinne was ever taught in the Church; and when Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did meet with the Pelagian hereſie denying it, he oppoſed it ſtrongly: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the adverſary urged the faith and doctrine of certaine Hereticks denying originall ſinne; S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> produceth the conſtant contrary aſſeverations of the moſt orthodoxe Fathers of the Church in their own words.

The ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> did not diſcommand marriage, nor reverſe the bleſſing of encreaſe. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this Pſalme doth anſwer. <hi>Opus hoc caſtum in conjuge non habet culpam: ſed origo peccati trahit ſecum debitam poenam.

               <p>God provided a remedy, the ſeed of the woman againſt ſinne, and ſuffered humane infirmity to paſſe on, that he might ſhew mercie where he pleaſed.

               <p>Our Anabaptiſts anſwer, That it is a queſtion, whether his confeſſion here intend himſelf, or his mother. It was a poore ſhift to buſie our thoughts about ſuch a queſtion: for why ſhould <hi>David</hi> confeſſe any thing here concerning his mother? If any, why not both parents? This confeſſion muſt have coherence, and correſpondence with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. <hi>I acknowledge my wickedneſſe: my ſinne is ever before me.</hi> But what if it concerne him?

duſt: weak fleſh, unable to reſiſt the tempter when the Law came unto him, through which weakneſſe he was overcome.</p>
               <p>This is that which we call originall ſinne, this <hi>Carentis juſtitiae,</hi> wanting of righteouſneſſe; this impotencie to all good acts: this ſeed of corruption, which is the teeming and pregnant ſpawne of all ſinnes. But they would have it; that as Chriſt becauſe he had our fleſh, and was made ſinne, yet was no ſinner: So <hi>David,</hi> though confeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conceived in ſinne, was not by conception and birth a tranſgreſſour.</p>
               <p>To which we anſwer.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That the compariſon is blaſphemous between Chriſt and <hi>David:</hi> for Chriſt was conceived by the holy Ghoſt: <hi>David</hi> in the ordinary way of fleſh.</item>
                  <item>2 That we call not originall ſinne tranſgreſſion of the Law in <hi>origine:</hi> for that is the definition of actuall ſinne.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For originall ſinne is defined:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Eſt corruptio naturae à prima perfectione:</hi> It is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature from the firſt perfection.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>Est corruptio naturae hominis quae efficit ne vere obedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus legi Dei, nec ſimus ſine peccato:</hi> It is the corruption of humane nature, which makes us unable to obey Gods Law, that we cannot be without ſinne.</item>
                  <item>3 <hi>Eſt ignorantia inmente, &amp; concupiſcentia in carne:</hi> It is ignorance in the minde, and concupiſcence in the fleſh.</item>
                  <item>4 But the fulleſt is this. It is an hereditarie corruption of nature which bringeth forth in us the works of the fleſh, and proneth us to all evils, and thereby doth faſten upon us a guiltineſſe, whereby we are in deſert and danger of the wrath of God. And this is the ſinne which <hi>David</hi> here confeſſeth, which began with him in his very conception.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But they alledge, that the words of <hi>David</hi> may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not to himſelf, but to his mother. Then we muſt underſtand him thus: that <hi>David</hi> doth not confeſſe ſinne as a fault, but as a puniſhment, and ſo it hath regard to curſe: I will multiply the ſorrows of thy conceptions. So
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14122:35"/>
he onely meaneth his mothers puniſhment for the fall, and his weakneſſe through the fall. That weakneſſe we call originall ſinne.</p>
               <p>But why <hi>David</hi> in his repentance, ſhould repent his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers puniſhment we cannot ſo well diſcerne: for true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hath reſpect not to the puniſhment deſerved, but to the ſinne deſerving it. Therefore theſe poore flaſhes, of humane wiſedome which is carnall, ſenſuall, and diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, cannot elude the evidence of truth, that <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing his ſinne doth repaire to the root of it in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, confeſſing the firſt ſeminarie of this weakneſſe to begin there.</p>
               <p>But our Anabaptiſts urge further, that if the matter of which <hi>David</hi> was made was tainted with ſinne: Then was alſo the matter of which Chriſt was made tainted with ſinne: for he was conceived in the wombe of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>We reply, That he was conceived by the holy Ghoſt, and it was an holy thing, that was born in his mother: ſo the Angel ſaith to her.</p>
               <p>They reply, that then Chriſt was not true man, for he was not born of the ſubſtance of his mother.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, That Chriſt was born of the very ſubſtance of <hi>Mary,</hi> and that in his miraculous generation by the holy Ghoſt, the ſubſtance was not changed, but the qualitie of it.</p>
               <p>For when <hi>David</hi> prayeth after for a new heart, he doth not deſire to have the ſubſtance of his heart changed, but the qualitie thereof: that of a ſinfull and unclean heart it may be made a pure and holy heart: a fit Temple for the holy Ghoſt to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Thus, I hope, I have to any ſober judgement cleared both our received doctrine of originall ſinne, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of my Text againſt theſe old and new Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſo the confeſſion of <hi>David</hi> ſtandeth good; that beſide his actuall tranſgreſſions of the Law, he ſtandeth guilty before God of originall uncleanneſſe; from which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14122:35"/>
corrupt fountain all his ſtreames of actuall iniquities do derive.</p>

the primitive and originall maſſe of corruption which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſoneth our nature: which cancreth our manners, and in time gangreneth our whole converſation mortally, to the very dominion of ſinne. <hi>David</hi> doth ſo, for here he looketh back ſo farre, as to his firſt conception, and diggeth ſo deep as the root of his ſinne. For he chargeth all his tranſgreſſions upon this beginning of ſinne, which indeed in all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> is not onely a naturall pollution defiling us, but it is a corrupt ſeed ſhooting out in time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a blade, and bearing a full eare of actuall prevarications. Therefore no man knoweth his own heart, and let no man be ſo bold of his own ſtrength, to promiſe reſiſtance to ſuch temptations as have corrupted others.

Then entred Sathan into <hi>Judas Iſcariot:</hi> And<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 3.</note> he went his way, and communed with the chiefe Prieſts and Captains, how he might betray him unto them. Moſt memorable is the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> whom Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned<note place="margin">Ver. 31. &amp;c.</note> of his denyall of him. A thing ſo farre from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> heart, that he took it ill to be ſo charged, he proteſted againſt it, and vowed to dye with him or for him, rather then he would deny him. Yet being in the high Prieſts Hall, when Chriſt was ill uſed there, for feare of his own skinne he denyed, and forſwore him thrice. This body of ſinne we do all alwayes beare about us, and therefore we paſſe the time of our ſo journing here with feare: for which of us may not be thus ſurpriſed? For there is no kinde of ſinne which our heart abhorreth moſt, but we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it by reaſon of our naturall corruption: wherefore Chriſt taught us to pray: <hi>Et ne nos inducas in tentationem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And leade us not into temptation. Therefore, a wiſe man feareth and departeth from evill: but a foole rageth and is<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16.</note> confident. Folly is raſh, and goeth on inconſiderately, and truſteth to his own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>We live in perpetuall danger, by reaſon of this naturall corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Spirit hath his eclipſe, and often upon our grieving him, leaveth us in our own wayes, that we may ſee our naturall impotencie to that which the Law requireth of us, and be ſo much the more warie how we walk in the way of that roaring Lyon, which goeth about continually ſeeking whom he may devoure. But here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a great ſcruple: Was not <hi>David</hi> circumciſed? and hath not that Sacrament according to the intention of Gods holy ordinance this proper effect to remove and purge originall ſinne? And now in the time of the Goſpell, is not Baptiſme the laver of our new birth? doth it not waſh away originall ſinne? Why then doth <hi>David</hi> yet complaine of it? or why do we who are baptiſed ſtand daily yet in jeopardie of it?</p>
               <p>To cleare this point, we reſolve, that ſince the fall of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14122:37"/>
man, his infirmitie hath ever beene ſuch, as all the meanes of grace ordained by God have fallen ſhort of working their full and perfect effect upon us in this life: The word teacheth us; and yet ſo long as we live here, we know but in part: The word begetteth faith; yet ſo weak, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect is our faith, that Chriſt biddeth us to pray to God to encreaſe our faith. The word of the Goſpell is the power of God to ſalvation: yet he doth magnifie his power in our weakneſſe. Our hope is imperfect, for it is mingled with feare. Our joy is not complete: for we rejoyce in trembling. The Sacraments of Circumciſion and Baptiſme were ordained againſt originall ſinne, yet for want not of efficacie in the gift, but of capacity in the receivers thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they fall ſhort of the full effect here.</p>
               <p>It is therefore farre from us to limit God by his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to binde him to paſſe his graces no way but by them. As farre is it from us to extend the force of his ordinance to that latitude, that which way ſo ever his outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance goeth, his grace muſt neceſſarily follow the ſame. We go in a middle way betweene theſe two extremes, affirming that according to the good pleaſure of his will, ſo the Sacraments of our regeneration do work their effect more or leſſe in his Church.</p>
               <p>For my own judgement, I have beleeved and taught, that Baptiſme doth ſo purge away original ſinne, as it doth regenerate us. It worketh the ſame work at once, the killing of ſinne, and the life of Chriſt in us. As we perceive our regeneration imperfect, ſo we muſt confeſſe our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification imperfect. Therefore after Baptiſme there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of our originall ſinne, becauſe Chriſt hath not the intire poſſeſſion of us. And yet there is a ſeed of grace, becauſe Chriſt dwelleth in us. Both theſe ſeeds grow in us till the harveſt. Yet as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> they ſtrive in the ſame wombe: for the fleſh luſteth; the ſpirit ſigheth, and groaneth: the fleſh ſtriveth againſt the ſpirit, the ſpirit is contrary to the fleſh. From the ſeed of the fleſh which we call originall ſinne, all our evill thoughts,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14122:38"/>
words, and works do proceed. From the ſeed of the ſpirit ariſe all good motions whereby we reſiſt the fleſh. And if any of Gods people be overtaken with offence, he is not ſtraitway as a limbe cut off from the body, but as a bone out of joynt for the time. It is not a laxation from the bodie, but a laxation in the body. It is the Apoſtles word: you that are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a one, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, put him in joynt againe. So we denie not the grace of Circumciſion or Baptiſme, we do not weaken the power of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but we allow it the efficacie of congruitie with the ſubject. For it filleth <hi>ſecundum capacitatem vaſis,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the capability of the veſſell; when God enlargeth our heart, we ſhall receive his gifts more fully.</p>
               <p>You now ſee how much cauſe <hi>David</hi> had to complain of his originall ſinne, as the ſeed remaining in him, from whence theſe great offences grow.</p>
               <p>I conceive the proper uſe of this point to be this: To<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> ſtirre us up by <hi>Davids</hi> example upon all occaſions by our fallings into any ſinne, to look back upon this root of ſinne in us, that we may put the ſtrength of our meaſure of grace to it, to grubbe it. It is ſuch, as that if there remain but a threed of it in our ground, by the ſent of water it will take in ſap, and gather ſtrength, and put forth, and grow up as a plant, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith. Therefore we know our ſpirituall growth in grace by the withering of this old man, and the vegetation of the new man in us.</p>

               <p>I deny not, but that it was ſinne at firſt in the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but <hi>David</hi> doth not ſay, <hi>Formatus ſum iniquus:</hi> or <hi>Conceptus iniquus:</hi> but, <hi>In iniquitate,</hi> I am not formed or conceived wicked, but <hi>in wickedneſſe.</hi> The matter that I was made of was unſound, and unholy: for <hi>David</hi> was not <hi>David,</hi> till his reaſonable ſoul was infuſed; then was he ſinfull.</p>
               <p>So that I conceive this <hi>behold</hi> urged to God, to move compaſſion in him, that ſeeing he could not help it that he was ſo framed (and ſurely God is mercifull to that ſinne in us) therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith of him; <hi>Like as a father pittieth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 103. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that feare him. For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are duſt.</hi> Therefore this <hi>Ecce,</hi> behold, to God, doth move him to compaſſion of his moſt miſerable condition in regard of the corruption and frailty of his frame and compoſition. But our fault is, that we do not husband our talent of Gods grace, and of Chriſts merits, to our amendment of nature,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14122:39"/>
and to the expurgation of our ſinne. Yet for Infants that have no ſinne, but that to anſwer for, in the ordinary way of Gods favour; I make no queſtion of their ſalvation by Baptiſme: for ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Baptiſme ſaveth us.</hi> Yet the want of the outward Sacrament which cannot be charged upon little Infants, doth not deprive them of the favour of God, becauſe the covenant is not limited by the ſigne of it. The promiſe which is the ſoul and life of the Sacrament, is paſt to you and to your children.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denyeth unbaptiſed infants a place in heaven, and they have built them a <hi>Limbus,</hi> an upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome above hell, where they place them: but they cannot agree upon their eſtate there: Some of their learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of the fruition of heaven, but allowing them life everlaſting without paine, and with ſome meaſure of happineſſe. Others allow them an earthly paradiſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall felicity for ever. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and others, that they are deprived of the ſight of God, and have no <hi>poenam ſenſus,</hi> paine of ſenſe, inward or outward. <hi>Driedo</hi> and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, both <hi>poenam damni &amp; ſenſus,</hi> paine of loſſe and ſenſe. But Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, he could never reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of more then two places; heaven for the ſaved, and hell from that diſtanced very farre off, for the damned, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum tertium non reperio,</hi> I finde no third place.</p>
               <p>We confeſſe, that originall ſinne without Chriſt is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; but Chriſt became man, and was born of a Virgin, and became an Infant, for Infants, to preſerve them from hell, and we beleeve charitably and comfortably of them, that he receiveth ſuch to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of this point is, that ſeeing we are thus born <hi>filii ira,</hi> the children of wrath, we ſhould make it the exerciſe of our whole life to ſtrive againſt this naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to weaken the force of the fleſh all we can, by mortifying the deeds thereof, and to grow daily in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and knowledge, and faith, and obedience, perfect, throughly perfect to all good works, making our election

               <p>
                  <hi>This people honoureth me with their lippes, but their heart, &amp;c.</hi> By <hi>Davids</hi> rule it muſt be ſo, he that formed the eye, ſhould not he ſee? he that made the eare, ſhould not hee heare? he that framed the heart, ſhould not he ſearch the heart? Such as our hearts are, ſuch is our ſervice, and ſo accepted.</p>
               <p>2 He requireth in this heart, <hi>truth:</hi> for onely ſuch hearts are like a field which the Lord hath bleſſed, they are onely the good ground for the ſeed of the word, who receive it into an honeſt and good heart.</p>
               <p>There is not a more fooliſh ſinne in the world, than that

of hypocriſie, for it ſerves our turnes onely with a ſhew of goodneſſe. Which convinceth the conſcience, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si bonum eſt bonum ad parere, melius eſt bonum eſſe:</hi> If i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It ſerveth our turn onely with men, ſuch as daily are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">2</note> away from us, and we dye from amongſt them, but God remaineth ever with us to behold all our waies. And when we goe hence, we remove to the judgement ſeate of God. So the benefit of hypocriſie is ſoone loſt, the joy of hypocrites periſheth, but the guilt and puniſhment thereof abideth for ever.</p>
               <p>The laſt reward of hypocriſie is deadly, for all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">3</note> are threatned to have their portion with hypocrites. The phraſe is varied thus, with the divell and his Angels.</p>
               <p>There was a divination in uſe amongſt the Romans, by opening of beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and looking upon their inwards. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſpices,</hi> Soothſayers. God hath ever uſed that kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, to diſtinguiſh ſeeming from being his ſervants. And therefore we knowing how patent our hearts and waies are to the all-ſeeing eyes of God, ought to purge our conſciences from dead workes, to ſerve the living God. Our inwards are that Temple of the holy Ghoſt, there Chriſt ſtandeth at the dore, and knocketh, and would faine come in to abide with us. Let not Gods houſe of praier be made <hi>ſpelunca latronum,</hi> a den of theeves.</p>
               <p>We confeſſe that we have not in our ſelves either wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or goodneſſe ſufficient to plant truth within us, and to purge this temple. Chriſt muſt make the whip, and ſcourge out the defilers thereof. But ſeeing God delighteth in truth and ſincerity, this I dare ſay, there is not a ſinne to which our free-will may extend, and againſt which our owne naturall ſtrength may ſerve us better then againſt hypocriſie. For though it be not in the power of my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to embrace truth, yet I may chooſe whether I will be an hypocrite, I may appeare as I am. This maketh the ſinne of hypocriſie ſo damnable, becauſe I may eſchew it if I wil. And knowing how contrary it is to the pure and holy
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14122:42"/>
divine nature, how unworthy of GODS creature, how provoking to GOD; our ſinne is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>It is our wiſedome to obſerve what God deſireth, and to apply our ſelves wholy to the fulfilling thereof. Wee would have him deale ſo with us, and when we doe onely affect his favours in deſire, before wee come to be petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to him, <hi>He heareth the deſires of the poore.</hi> Alas, what benefit is the truth of our inward parts to him? he deſireth it for us, that we may be holy, and ſo we ſhall come to ſee the face of God: for <hi>without holineſſe, no man ſhall ſee God. I have ſet God alwaies before me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> that is the way of true holineſſe. For comparing our ſelves with him, we ſhall ſee our owne impurity the better. <hi>Iob</hi> did ſo: I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now<note place="margin">Iob 41. 5. 6. &amp;c.</note> mine eye ſeeth thee; therefore I abhorre my ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> now in the way of repentance taketh God into his ſight, and conſidereth what hee requireth, and findeth his ſinne ſo much the greater, by how much he hath failed of that which God deſireth. If we come not to this of our ſelves, God ſendeth his Prophets to us to tell us of it, and to put it home to us, as he did to his owne people. For ye diſſembled in your hearts when you ſent mee to Almighty<note place="margin">Jer. 42. 20.</note> God, ſaying, Pray for us unto the Lord our God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, ſo declare unto us, and we will doe it. And now I have this day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voyce of the Lord your God, nor any thing for the which the Lord hath ſent me unto you. Now therefore know certainely that ye ſhall dye, &amp;c. They bee great loſers by it at laſt, for they live in feare of being detected and layd open, whereas he that liveth uprightly, walketh boldly: <hi>The righteous is bold as a Lyon.</hi> And they dye damnably, for when they are ſtript out of their borrowings, and appeare naked in the ſight of Gods pure eyes, they have the reward of hypocrites. Yet they abuſe this Text, who becauſe God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14122:42"/>
deſireth truth in the inward parts, care not how they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly carry themſelves. Some ſuch there have beene, who becauſe <hi>Nicodemus</hi> came to Chriſt by night, and yet went in the common way of the Prieſts and Scribes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen converſation, have therefore reſolved, that if they bee true to God, and his religion, in their inward parts, it is no matter though they joyne with all people where they come in outward duties of the religion of the place where they live.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the tenants of Gods holy Tabernacle, they are<note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 2.</note> reckoned who ſpeake truth in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>: here is truth, and as the heart is the feat of it, ſo the tongue voyceth it; here is but one truth in both, for there is a double confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity required in ſpeaking of truth.</p>
               <p>1 Of the ſpeech with the minde, to ſpeake as we thinke.</p>
               <p>2 Of the minde with the thing it ſelfe: that wee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace truth in our minde, as the thing is.

And it is an unfained deſire in the ſervants of God, to approve themſelves ſuch as they ſeeme.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:14122:44"/>To relieve man after his fall, Chriſt was ſent, who was made to us of God, <hi>wiſedome,</hi> and he is that <hi>wiſedome</hi> which in <hi>Salomons Proverbs</hi> lifteth up her voyce, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to inſtruct all the fooles of the earth in knowledge to righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, but the faith of <hi>David</hi> did here looke ſo farre as to this <hi>wiſedome,</hi> the holy ſonne of God: for hee ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt make me to know wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Thou ſhalt make me to know my Redeemer, whoſe <hi>wiſedome</hi> ſhall both open me a way out of the danger I am now in, &amp; ſhall direct me in a courſe of repentance of what is paſt, and amendment of life for the time to come. <hi>For this is life eternall, to know thee, and him thou haſt ſent.</hi> So we muſt underſtand <hi>David</hi> here, for <hi>non eſt aliud nomen,</hi> there is no other name, there is no other wiſedome in the world that can recover us from the folly and frenzie of ſinne, but Chriſt Ieſus onely.</p>
               <p>It is our way, when we have fallen by any tranſgreſſion, to adviſe with this wiſedome, and to reſt therein: for hee that is our wiſedome to ſhew us the right way, and to guide us in it, is alſo our righteouſneſſe whereby wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare juſt in the ſight of God, ſo that nothing can be laid to our charge: and he is alſo our ſanctification, by which we are holy in our ſelves, and doe ſo appeare before men: he is alſo our redemption, whereby wee are cleared both from the guilt of ſinne, and the deſerved puniſhment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So that in repentance we muſt looke unto this Ieſus, the author and finiſher of our faith. Know him, for hee muſt beare all our iniquities, and in his name onely muſt the horne of our ſalvation be exalted.</p>
               <p>2 The ſeate of this wiſedome, <hi>in the hidden part.</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> readeth this otherwiſe, <hi>occulta ſapientiae tuae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtaſti mihi,</hi> thou haſt ſhewne me the ſecrets of thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and he hath a comfortable obſervation upon it.

offenders, yet God revealeth to them the ſecrets of his wiſedome: when he letteth them know that he can make their crimſin and ſcarlet ſinnes as white as wooll and ſnow.

But I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our owne reading, and finde the ſeat of this wiſedome prepared <hi>in the hidden part. David</hi> meaneth here the ſame place where he had hid his ſin, and that is <hi>in proſundo cordis,</hi> in the depth of his heart. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth this ſeate,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. 3. 4.</note> The hid man of the heart. Here <hi>David</hi> hid the word of God, that he might not ſinne againſt God. And when hee reſigned this ſecret place to luſt and uncleane deſires, and baniſhed this wiſedome thence, he fell downe right. This is the place before mentioned, where God <hi>deſireth truth in the inward parts.</hi> Theſe are ſecret parts.</p>
               <p>1. To the eye, and ſearch of the world without us, for that cannot ranſacke and romage the conſcience. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures may be made thereof: we ſay, <hi>ex vultu virum,</hi> we know a man by his face, and <hi>vultus index animi,</hi> the face ſhewes the minde: trees be knowne by their fruits: our words, our workes, our geſtures, our pennes, do give ſome teſtimony of the heart, our company alſo. But God hath reſerved the inquiſition and judicature of the heart, by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall appropriation to his owne prerogative royall. Deepe is the heart of man, and no man can ſound it.</p>
               <p>2 This is called a <hi>ſecret part,</hi> in reſpect of our ſelves, for no man knoweth the depth of his owne heart, wherein there is cloſely couched, as you have heard, a ſeed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, our remaine of originall ſinne, which ſpaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and iſſueth many tranſgreſſions: yet there may be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there alſo a ſeed of grace, which may put forth in time and bring forth fruit to life.</p>
               <p>2 Great examples of the ſecrecie of theſe parts to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>1 In <hi>Iudas</hi> one of the holy College of the twelve, for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14122:45"/>
neither was he ſuſpected by others, neither did he in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diſcerne that ſeed of evill, which lay long concealed in his hidden and ſecret part, which after brought forth treaſon.</p>
               <p>2 Another in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who living long a cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Church, when Chriſt was once revealed in him, he became both a veſſell to carry pretious treaſure into the Church, and a patient ſufferer for that truth which before he had perſecuted. Here is the hope of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhall now obtaine wiſedome of God in this ſecret of his heart. And this accompliſheth repentance, when we ſet our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts to rights: for the corruption of theſe is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of all kindes of ſinnes. Wiſedome asketh this ſeat of us, <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart,</hi> and if we keepe it for wiſedome, it is fortified againſt all temptations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>heart</hi> of man is the little Citie, and Sathan is the great king that beſiegeth it, and buildeth bulwarkes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. <hi>wiſedome</hi> is that poore man that ſaveth this City, and removeth, yea deſtroyeth the enemy of it. Wiſedome when it doth no more but ſwimme in the fancy, and float in the braine, rather ſwelleth then fatteneth us: but when it poſſeſſeth the heart, which is the ſeat of affections, it then commandeth all; for then the eye, the eare, the tongue, the hand, be all ſet aworke, and all thoſe parts which were before the weapons of unrighteouſneſſe to commit unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, turne their ſervice another way, to the worke of truth to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>It is the happineſſe of Gods Saints to ſtore this wiſedome in this hold of the heart. This is that <hi>bonus theſaurus cordis,</hi> good treaſure of the heart that Chriſt ſpeakes of. And when <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>omni cuſtodia cuſtodicor tuum, keep thy heart diligently,</hi> he meaneth that we ſhould freight it with this wiſedome. For our adverſary, beſides his profeſt hoſtility wherin he proclaims open war againſt the Church of God, hath his ſecret inſinuations by which he windeth himſelfe into the hearts of men. So he entred into the heart of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Thy heart is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14122:46"/>

               <p>This ſetteth us a worke to furniſh our ſecret part with wiſedome, for ſo it will be a fortification againſt open warre, and a privy coat againſt a ſudden ſtabbe of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The greateſt hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to good converſation, to good workes, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of our evill waies, is the unſoundneſſe and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe of our ſecret part: that is,</p>
               <p>1 Vanity in our underſtanding, when wee buſie our thoughts, and exerciſe our wits, either onely in the things which concerne this life, what we ſhall eat, what we ſhall drinke, where with we ſhall be cloathed, for which the heathens take care, who know no God to take that care for them: or when we ſpend our braines in impertinent diſquiſitions, ſtudying genealogies, and intricating our thoughts in vaine queſtions, which are not worthy our ſtudy.</p>
               <p>2 Our inward part is mortally diſeasſed by corruption of our will, when wee live in a perpetuall purſuit of our owne deſires, and goe in the way that ſeemeth good in our owne eyes: for ſo the ſtrength of ſinne is the law, and the

Surely <hi>Dauid</hi> had reſpect onely to the bloud of Chriſt for his purification from ſinne: for all the lotions and purgings of the old law did looke that way, and were repreſentations and types of that full purgation which was to be accompliſhed by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt: for though <hi>temporava iataſunt,</hi> the times are changed, yet <hi>fides una,</hi> faith is one and the ſame.

Both wayes the bloud of Chriſt is the liquor of our purification: and <hi>David</hi> ſo many yeares before the fulneſſe of time, in which he came actually to performe the worke of our redemption by the ſaerifice of his bloud, did by faith apprehend both this remedy and the full effect of it: for it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14122:49"/>
was ever the way of our cleanneſſe ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore Chriſt is called <hi>agnus occiſus ab origine mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> the Lamb ſlaine from the beginning of the world. The grace of the holy Ghoſt inwardly purging the conſcience from ſinne, by the application of the bloud of Chriſt was not perceptible by the ſenſe and reaſon of man. Therefore it pleaſed God in the law to relieve their weakeneſſe with externall types, figures, and repreſentations, &amp; Sacraments of ſtrong ſignification, to make theſe things more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable. The body of theſe is Chriſt, and it is his onely bloud by which we are waſhed from all ſinne both originall and actuall.</p>
               <p>A Sacrament of that purgation wee have in Baptiſme, which we receive once for all our life, though it bee not barely the externall act that cleanſeth us, but the anſwer of a good conſcience to God. To this is added another Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of nutrition, by which we are invited to a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feaſt of the body and bloud of Chriſt. To which our preparation muſt be a putting on of holineſſe.

I herefore for our better preparation to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body and bloud of Chriſt, let me commend to you the holy example of <hi>David.</hi> Let us beginne at a ſearch and ſurvey of our hearts for ſinne, even ſo deepe as our birth-ſinne, and originall uncleanneſſe. Let us compare what we are in our inward parts, with that which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, and the folly that poſſeſſeth us with the wiſedome which God will give us, if we aske it of him: then ſhall we ſee what favour God hath done us in his holy Sacrament, to offer us the benefit of his paſſion, and the ſprinkling of his bloud, to keepe the deſtroying Angell from our houſes. This full example tendreth us all the ingredients in an holy preparation for Gods Table.</p>

Chriſt hath limited our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for daily bread, that is, the neceſſaries of this life. The Apoſtle biddeth, if we have food and raiment, to be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content: but in the ſpirituall and eternall favours of God, a greedineſſe, an ambition, a covetouſnes for the moſt and beſt, &amp; higheſt of them, doth beſt of all.

By bones, the ſtrength of the body, the inward ſtrength and vigour of the ſoule is meant.

               <p>The reaſon is, as in ſinne, the fault, he that breaketh the leaſt Commandement, and repaireth not himſelfe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is guilty of the whole law; ſo in tranſgreſſions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14122:52"/>
he that repenteth of all the ſinnes he hath done, and hath his pardon under ſeale, by the next offence is lyable to all the evidence againe of his former ſinnes, he cancelleth and forfeiteth his pardon, for pardon ever bindeth to good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.

               <p>2 The author of this, <hi>Thou haſt broken.</hi> God in favour to his children, doth afflict them for ſinne, and the very phraſe of breaking his bones, though it expreſſe extremity of miſery and paine, yet it hath hope in it: for broken bones by acunning hand may be ſet againe, and returne to their former uſe and ſtrength, ſo that a conſcience diſtreſt for ſinnes, is not out of hope: yet upon that hope no wiſe man will adventure upon ſinne, ſaying: though I am wounded, yet I may be healed againe, though I am broken, I may be repaired: for let him conſider;</p>

paine and great extremity to the Patient. Repentance ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all our broken pained bones, it recovereth the ſoule from the anguiſh thereof; but hee that once feeleth the ſmart of a true repentance, will ſay, the pleaſures of ſinne which are but for a ſeaſon, are as hard a bargaine as ever he made, and as deare bought: they coſt teares, which are, <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis vulner aticordis,</hi> the bloud of a wounded heart: they coſt ſighes and grones which cannot be expreſt: they coſt watching, faſting, taming of the body to bring it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, even to the crucifying of the fleſh, with the luſts thereof.

This is the ſword of the ſpirit, and though our doctrine drop as the raine, gently and eaſily, if we drinke it in, and become fruitfull by it: yet when our ſinnes doe overgrow, we ſhall finde it a ſharpe Conlter to rend the fallow grounds of our hearts: we ſhall finde it a rod of iron to breake our ſoules in pieces, and this word runneth very ſwiftly: it is <hi>gladius verſatilis,</hi> a ſword that turneth every way.</p>
               <p>2 But it is a dead letter, and draweth no bloud, till it come to the conſcience: for ſo long as it beateth the eare and ayre onely, and worketh no further than the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, there is no great cumber with it: as wee ſee in thoſe who daily heare their ſwearing and drunkenneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the houſe of God, and threatned with loſſe and deprivation of the kingdome of God, it worketh not upon them, but when <hi>Nathan</hi> comes home to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>tu es homo,</hi> thou art the man, God hath ſent mee to thee to charge thee with this ſinne, and to tell thee hee is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14122:53"/>
angry, and is whetting his ſword to cut thee off for it; this breaketh and ſhattereth the bones, and though our publike miniſtery doe not deſcend to ſuch particulars as <hi>tu es homo,</hi> thou art the man, and our private reproofes are ſubject to ill conſtructiou, yet a plaine dealing death bed will roare it in our eares of our inward man. <hi>Tu es homo,</hi> thou art the man, thou haſt lived a blaſphemer of the name of God, a glutton, a drunkard, &amp;c. This fils the ſoules of many dying perſons with ſo much bitterneſſe, that when the ſorrowes of death are upon them, and the judgement of their whole life in ſight, the conſcience of their ſinnes doth make their ſoules much ſicker then their bodies. One of theſe in this diſtreſſe can tell you, whether this be not a breaking of their bones. Let the Word therefore work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and let every hearer, when he heareth his ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, take the reproofe to him, and prevent an accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>tu es homo,</hi> thou art the man; with a confeſſion, <hi>Me, me, ad ſum qui feci,</hi> I, I have done it. So breaking our bones with remorſe and contrition, wee ſhall ſave them from his breaking, we ſhall reſerve them to his healing and binding up.

               <p>2 He deſireth more of this comfort, more joy, and more gladneſſe. The joy of ſinne, and delight of ſenſe, doth much hinder repentance: the joy of the holy Ghoſt, doth crown repentance.</p>

But he putteth them into this Pſalme, and commendeth this Pſalme to the Maſter of Muſicke, and ſo depoſiteth the record of it in the perpetuall uſe of the Church: ſo the greatneſſe of the fault is kept in freſh memory of all ages.

               <p>From the whole petition we gather one ſubſtance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which is, that God would forgive him all his ſinnes: which petition is grounded upon an Article of faith, the tenth in our Apoſtles Creed: Forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.

               <p>It is as great an honour to God to be a forgiver, as to be a giver. Amongſt our ſelves we know that it is one of the hardeſt taskes of our religion, to forgive an injurie. Our hearts riſe againſt them that doe it, our bloud boyles, our countenance falleth: it is much more eaſie to winne us to give gifts to our brethren, then to forgive injuries: yet we are never out of that Petition to God, and in our daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as we aske bread for the day, ſo we aske forgiveneſſe, becauſe our ſoule needeth pardon, as much as our body needeth food.</p>
               <p>I may ſay much more, for wee may goe in the ſtrength of one meale ſome houres, but there is no moment of our life, which doth not need to cry God mercy, and to aske his pardon for our ſinne.

You call upon all that viſite you, to comfort you with their prayers, you ſend to Church to crave ayde of the congregation, you give God no reſt. How is it that in your ſinnes, the mortall diſeaſes of your ſoules, you are not thus earneſt with God for his pardon, which is the onely phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke for a diſeaſed ſoule? <hi>David</hi> ſaith, God healeth all our infirmities, and he ſheweth how, hee pardoneth all our ſinnes: therefore the way of cure in all griefes of the body, is to heale the ſoule firſt: ſo <hi>David, Sana animam meam, &amp;c.</hi> Heale my ſoule, &amp;c.

ſo much endangereth this life, and that which is to come, as ſinne. This I thinke no man will refuſe to put for granted. Then I ſay, there is no way to be found out of this danger of our ſinne, but by Gods pardon.</p>

The fault is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall, here is no eſcape from the juſtice of the Law, but by the Kings gratious pardon.</p>
               <p>In our Eccleſiaſticall Courts we have power in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Iudge in cauſes criminall, <hi>commutare poenam,</hi> to change the puniſhment, to let offendors buy out a ſhame of publique diſgrace with ſome pecuniary mulct to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>in pios uſus,</hi> in religious uſes. If in cauſes capitall there have beene <hi>Commutatio paenae,</hi> change of puniſhment, and that the purſe hath ſaved the life, yet that is but the price of interceſſion. But the Kings pardon onely ſaveth life. It is ſo in the ſtate of our ſoules: ſinne is a capitall fault, and the wages of it death, and no way of eſcape from this juſt judgement, but by Gods gratious and free pardon. We cannot purchaſe a mediation at any rate to availe us without true and unfained repentance, and then we have but one Mediatour to the Father, and he muſt purchaſe our pardon with his bloud: he muſt be wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and we muſt be healed by his ſtripes, and hee muſt dye for us, that we may live in and by him.</p>
               <p>Let Papiſts ſeeke heaven by their righteouſneſſe at their owne perill. For my ſelfe, I am ſo farre from truſting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merits of our owne workes, that I dare reſolve, that if the ſalvation of all mankinde had beene put to the plunge that <hi>Sodome</hi> was at, with the other Cities, to finde tenne

righteous, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the laſt man that ſhall ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth; all mankinde muſt have periſhed for want of tenne ſuch. I dare adventure further in reſolution, that if the bringing one good worke before God, done in all the generations of men, performed without any taſt or taint of ſinne, might ſave all mankinde: I except none but Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. I doe beleeve that he that ſearched <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with candle and lanterne, even his ſeven eyes which tunne to and fro through the whole earth, cannot finde out one ſuch good and perfect worke: the caske diſtaſteth the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour: who is he that doth good and ſinneth not? who doth good and ſinneth not in the very good he hath done? To make a worke perfectly holy is one thing, to make it meritorious is another. If no good work we doe can come from us holy, it is not poſſible it ſhould aske wages.

               <p>1 It is required that we be able to doe it of our ſelves, for no thankes to us for any good we doe, if he land us the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and abilities of doing it.</p>
               <p>2 It is required, that hee which deſerveth, ſhould doe ſomething for the benefit of him of whom he deſerveth: but our well-doing extendeth not to God.</p>
               <p>3 It is required, that hee which meriteth, doe his good worke out of his owne free will, <hi>ex mero motu, non ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito,</hi> meerely by his owne mooving, not as of due debt. For what we doe of duty, we pay, we doe not give.</p>
               <p>4 It is required that the reward bee proportionable to the worke, for elſe whatſoever is more, is gift, not wages. They that wrought all day, deſerved their penny, they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14122:59"/>
that came late had more gift then wages; eternall life is too much reward for any ſervice wee doe. This putteth workes of ſupererogation quite out of countenance: to name them is to ſhame them. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6. Where withall ſhall I come before the Lord? burnt offerings, Calves of a yeare old? Will the Lord bee pleaſed with thouſands of rammes, or with tenne thouſand rivers of oyle? ſhall I give my firſt borne for my tranſgreſſions, the fruit of my body for the ſinne of my ſoule? Hee hath ſhewed thee &amp;c. To doe juſtly, to love mercy, to walke humbly before thy God. The way of repentance and crying God mercy, is the way of humility: we cannot pay our debt, we cannot buy out our fault, we have nothing to give: our plea is, <hi>miſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> have mercy: we can finde no way out of our ſinnes, but by Gods gratious and free pardon. This is not ſo eaſie a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour obtained, as many thinke, for ſuppoſe the pardon were obtained and ſealed for, God have mercy, yet there is no moment of our life in which we doe not forfeit it, and therefore we muſt renew it continually. When you pray, ſay, <hi>Pater noſter dimitte nobis,</hi> Our Father, forgive us, and <hi>ſemper orate,</hi> pray alwayes, Be ſure to renew your pardon by repentance and prayer continually, eſpecially at ſuch times when we come to the houſe of God, to the Table of God: now waſh us throughly O Lord, now O Lord have mercy upon us: now purge us with hyſope, <hi>now hide thy face from our ſinnes, and blot ont all our iniquities:</hi> Now make us heare joy and gladneſſe, which thou imparteſt to us in the Sacrament of thy ſons paſſion. Our Church ſervice is holily accommodated to this: for we beginne at the words wherein God maketh us heare of joy: and we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves to God in a contrite deploration of our ſins: O Lord heare us from heaven, and when thou heareſt, ſhew mercy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There be two faculties in the ſoule of man, firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſecondly, will. The underſtanding in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man may be darkened for a time, and he falling into ſinne, may be beſide himſelfe, for ſinne is a kinde of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the worſt kinde.

Sometimes the underſtanding breakes forth like lightening, and diſcerneth the fault to convince the will of ſinne. This wee call the conſcience, which is awaked of purpoſe to detect and chide our ſinfull aberrations. But when God hath ſufficiently expreſſed to us our weakeneſſe, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The petitions of <hi>David</hi> for holineſſe of life, thus opened:</p>
               <p>1 We obſerve the manner how <hi>David</hi> deſireth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, being by ſinne ſo ruined.</p>

               <p>The haughty policy of <hi>Rome</hi> to keep her children darke, doth hinder both the finding of the good way, and the going on in it: ſo our ingreſſion and progreſſion both hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we ſeek heaven darkelings. God hath ſent wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome abroad to utter her voyce, to call an audience, to inſtruct men in the waies of life, to eſcape the pathes of

death. <hi>Chriſt is made to us of God wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 He deſireth of God the pardon of his ſinnes, which is no other but juſtification before him. This is the waſhing and purging, and blotting out of iniquities by him deſired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for wiſedome to know our ſinnes without juſtification by faith, which apprehendeth the pardon of them, were the broad way to deſpaire; but being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, and peace alſo in our owne conſciences. Chriſt is made unto us juſtification. <hi>David</hi> leaves not here, but,</p>
               <p>3 He deſireth in this text the ſpirit of ſanctification, by which he may be renewed to holineſſe, to all pleaſing of God. And this is Chriſt alſo made to us, for whom God juſtifieth, them he ſanctifieth. Some have confounded theſe two graces of juſtification and ſanctification, and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medled them, as if they were all one and the ſame grace. For the clearing whereof, and to declare the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, underſtand,</p>
               <p>1 We are ſinners, and by faith in Chriſt we are juſtified, and ſo the debt of our ſinne diſcharged: this is by the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to us, and it is the proper worke of the ſecond perſon.</p>
               <p>2 By the holy Ghoſt applying this righteouſneſſe to us, we are ſanctified to rewneſſe of life. The firſt ſaveth us from hell, the ſecond ſeaſoneth us for heaven. <hi>David</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore addeth this ſuit for ſanctification, that being cleanſed throughly from ſinne, he may become a new creature. I may abridge all our learning in the ſchoole of Chriſt to this one leſſon, and comprehend <hi>totum hominis,</hi> the whole of man, in this ſhort compend of dutie, as the Apoſtle doth. Circumciſion profiteth nothing, uncircumciſion hindereth nothing, all that God requireth of us, is, that wee be new creatures, leaving off and laying aſide the old man, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>in ſpiritu mentis,</hi> in the ſpirit of our mindes: wee are never complete penitents till we have this ſpirit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in ſome meaſure. It is the hardeſt worke that is accompliſhed in us, becauſe our naturall corruption and the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14122:63"/>
manifold temptations amongſt which we live, and the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall delight which we take in ſinne, doe ſow our hearts all over with tares, and leave no roome for better ſeed. To root out theſe is one labour, to proſeminate grace is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yet we neglect the labour of our ſanctification, as if it were a worke which we could doe at a very ſhort war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and too many doe leave it to their death beds. And another impediment is, that many upon ſome good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſpirit, ſome flaſhes of piety and ſcintillations of zeale doe overweene their poſſeſſion of this ſpirit. Me thinkes if they did examine their hearts by this text, here is enough in it to reveale any man to himſelfe, and to tell him <hi>ſi habeat hunc ſpiritum,</hi> if he hath this ſpirit.</p>
               <p>1 Let him examine his heart and ſpirit within him, to ſee if there be truth there &amp; wiſedom: for many faire ſeemings and outſides of godlineſſe are put on, whereby we deceive others, and flatter our ſelves, quite out of the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore try if all be ſound and ſincere within.</p>
               <p>2 Let him enquire of this heart, <hi>ſi cor novum,</hi> if it bee a new heart; we may ſoone know that, <hi>ſi canticum novum, ſi novitas vitae,</hi> if there be a new ſong, if newneſſe of life. It is not a new dreſting and trimming up of the old heart in a new faſhion that will ſerve, it muſt be all new, and that may be diſcerned in our thoughts, in our words, in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3 If it be a conſtant ſpirit that holdeth out to the end cheerefully and unweariedly, we may conclude comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that our old heart is gone, and we have a new in place thereof.</p>

So in a better minde the Church ſaid, I will goe and return to my firſt love, for then it was better with me than now. The truth is, there is no ſuch joy here as in the favour of our God, and the faith of our ſalvation with him. <hi>David</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart more then in</hi>

But the Apoſtle would have it the maine care and buſineſſe of our whole life, to worke out our ſalvation with feare, and to make our election ſure. As the Sea-man regardeth ſo the buſineſſe within boord, as alwaies obſerving the way of his ſhip, and alſo looking to his Chart and Compaſſe for the accompliſhing of his voyage.</p>
               <p>In the comforts and joyes of life in things temporall, we ever hope that to morrow will be better than to day, and when that comes, we fall ſhort ſtill. <hi>Deterior ſemper poſterior dies,</hi> ſeldome comes a better. But for the joy of our ſalvation, the more we taſte of it, the more we thirſt after it, and as we grow in grace, we increaſe in ſpirituall joy; and as our taſt, ſo our deſire of eternall life doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, that we thinke long till we appeare before our God in Sion.</p>
               <p>2 Sinne depriveth us of this joy: for when our conſcience<note place="margin">2 Note.</note> accuſeth us of having done that which diſpleaſeth our God, how can we hope that he who is not the God of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14122:66"/>
ſhould be the God of our ſalvation? Sinne is a thing ſo hatefull to God, that his ſoule abhorreth it. <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt ſinner hid himſelfe: <hi>Caine</hi> beleeved himſelfe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht from the preſence of the Lord. The ſpirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Saul:</hi> ſinne turneth our prayers into it ſelfe: If I regard wickedneſſe in my heart, <hi>Dominus non exaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et me,</hi> the Lord will not heare me: ſinne turnes our praiſes of God into the ſacrifice of fooles. There can be no peace to the ſinner: ſo long as we continue in a ſtate of ſinne without ſearch of Gods gratious pardon, wee are in the deepe pit: if we then deſpaire, the pit ſhutteth its mouth upon us: if yet we hope, there is no health in our bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our ſinne, till God hath ſealed our pardon, and that his ſpirit doe witneſſe with ours, that wee are in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Doe not our owne corruptions, and the evill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the ungodly, and the temptations of Sathan, worke ſtrongly upon us, when they prevaile againſt the joy of our ſalvation? We under value that joy very baſely, when we change it for any other that holds out in number, weight, and meaſure: that filleth the meaſure full, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it downe, and maketh it runne over. <hi>Dic animae meae, ſalus tua ſum,</hi> ſay to my ſoule, I am thy ſalvation: let mee have thy word for that, and then as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>hic ure, hic ſeca,</hi> here burne, here cut me: we ſhall not feare them that kill the body: for if wee had all the joyes of the world, we could hold them but during this life, this joy ſurvives our death. Satietie of other joyes breeds ſurfet: of this, thirſt: <hi>beati qui eſuriunt, &amp;c.</hi> bleſſed are they that hunger, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>David</hi> deſireth to be reſtored to this joy, we<note place="margin">3 Note.</note> ſee our evill condition, we cannot tell when we be well: when we have joy, the beſt and trueſt joy that can be, we part with it for vanitie of vanities, and when we feele the want of it we complaine. It is the weakeneſſe of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we cannot value good things ſo priceably in the poſſeſſion of them, as in the ſubduction. <hi>Carendo magis quàm fruendo,</hi> by wanting, more then enjoying, is an old
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14122:67"/>
rule of our imperfect reaſon. Godlineſſe ſhould ever be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with contentedneſſe, and our deſires ſhould be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our enjoyings, when wee affect any thing beyond Gods allowance, we are often abated in the allowance: and our vaſt and unlawfull deſires are corrected by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from us the good that we poſſeſſe. When proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pricketh us, the way to checke our wantonneſſe is, to ſet us a while at a leane manger, and to take from us the good which we cannot tell well how to value at the true price. It was the ſinne firſt of the Angels, then of man, they kept not their firſt eſtate, neither were content with the joy of their creation. The Angels affected to be like God in omnipotencie, and became divels. Man affected to be like God in his omniſcience, and turned ſinner: they loſt heaven by it, he Paradiſe. When they bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is no queſtion but they would have beene both glad to have beene where they were, and would then have beene content with it.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Iob</hi> in his extreame affliction, remembring times paſt, and complaining in the bitterneſſe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved ſoule. O that I were as in moneths paſt, in the<note place="margin">Iob 29.</note> daies when God preſerved me. When his candle ſhined<note place="margin">2 3 6</note> upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkeneſſe: When I waſhed my ſteppes with butter, and the rocke poured me out rivers of water. It were great wiſedome in us to know when we are well, and keepe us ſo.</p>
               <p>4 This petition putteth us in comfort, that though by<note place="margin">4 Note.</note> our folly wee have provoked God to take away our joy from us in his juſt judgement, yet it is not ſo loſt, but there is hope left of reſtoring it againe to us, for elſe <hi>Davids</hi> ſuit were cold. And truely God is ſo full of compaſſion, ſo free from paſſion, ſo open handed to give, ſo loth to take away, ſo ready to forgive, and ſo eaſily perſwaded to reſtore what we have forfeited into his hands by our ſinne, that wee may comfort our ſoules with hope even when our joy is gone, that he will not continue long in his anger, but will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14122:67"/>
returne to us and viſite us with his favour. That is it which maketh the divels ſo ſpightfull and malitious to man, ſo rebellious to God, they have no hope nor meanes left to reſtore them to the joy that they have loſt, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in fulneſſe of grace and intellectuall light, did corrupt themſelves, and were their owne tempters. But man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overtaken with the ſurprize of a ſudden temptation, when being good he ſuſpected no evill, fell from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but not from the pitty of God: he fell from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but not from the reſtitution of his joy.</p>
               <p>The time of our life is called <hi>ſpatium poenitendi,</hi> a ſeaſon for us to worke our repaire. A lamentable change it is that ſinne hath wrought in us, that man created in the image of God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, ſhould now ſpend all the dayes of his appointed time here, in recovering ſome meaſure of that joy of his creation, and when he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to it inſome degree, may loſe it by ſinne, and be to beginue againe. The way to recover it is here opened in this example, repentance, faith and prayer: Repentance to remove ſinne, faith to apprehend mercy and grace, prayer to obtaine theſe of God, and to ſanctifie them to us. In this way <hi>David</hi> ſought the recovery of the joy of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

And we ſee great examples of men falling into ſinnes, which their hearts have abhorred to thinke of, being by ſurprize overtaken: as adulterie, murther, theft, and ſuch like, opportunity the pandor of ſinne inviting thereto. And what ſinne have we ever committed and be wailed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, but we may relapſe into the ſame, and double the tranſgreſſion and the anger of God thereby?</p>
               <p>This petition of <hi>David</hi> doth declare that wee have no ſtrength of our ſelves either to abſtaine from new ſinnes, or to keepe us from relapſe into our former ſinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the holy Ghoſt: whoſe office is,</p>

Therefore ſeeing God calleth to the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to judge betweene him and his Vineyard: I thinke we may boldly ſit upon this cauſe, and heare it indifferently. God pleaded, what could have beene done more? clearing himſelfe from all defectiveneſſe or failing on his part toward his creature. Man replyeth, one thing wanted, even this ſpirit that <hi>David</hi> here deſired.</p>
               <p>I anſwer for God againſt all the world, that that ſpirit<note place="margin">Sol. 2.</note> was alſo given to Angels and to man. And to make them complete creatures, images of himſelfe, he gave them free will to continue their own happy condition for their own good, or to forſake it to their ruine. They both by their owne fault forfeited their preſent eſtate, and by affecting more of the glory of God than hee had communicated them, loſt that which they had, and ſo this good ſpirit did forſake them.</p>
               <p>But it is replyed, if they had this good ſpirit, why did it<note place="margin">Quer.</note> not confirme them in their eſtate that they might not fall?</p>

               <p>Man was not content with the ſtate of his creation, the Angels were not content, they reſiſted, they grieved this ſpirit. The Angels therefore having ſinned, never found a Mediatour to relieve them, becauſe it is plaine that their treſpaſſe was againſt the holy Ghoſt.

For the burthen of ſinne, it lay ſo heavy upon him, that he deſireth to be made to heare of joy and gladneſſe, for his ſinne and the feare of Gods judgements had broken his bones. For the departure of God from him, he was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, that he prayeth the ſpirit of God not to depart from him. For his former ſinnes, they all lay upon his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed conſcience, that he remembred them from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth: and he ſaw the danger of temptations, and therefore deſireth the confirming ſpirit of God to keep him from falling into new, or relapſing into old ſinnes.</p>
               <p>2 A true Convert knoweth the bitterneſſe of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: he that hath kept an ill dyet, and thereby loſt his health, and is put to it to ſweate, to purge, to bleed, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14122:72"/>
from all toothſome and pleaſing eates, and is kept to a dyet, and enforced to live <hi>medicé, miſeré,</hi> in phyſicke, in miſery, for the time till his health be repaired: ſuch a one will give warning to others, to abſtaine from ſuch things as hazard our health. He can tell how deare it doth coſt the purſe, how much it reſtraineth a mans liberty, what paines he ſuffereth in his body, how much his minde is diſquieted in his bodily diſtemperatures, and all to repaire what ſome ill dyet hath corrupted in his body. So is it with the true Convert, he can relate the bitterneſſe of repentance, which is the ſoules phyſicke for ſinne: there is nothing in the world ſo ſmarting and a king as true repentance is. In the generality of men, the moſt preſume upon this remedy: they ſinne on, and flatter themſelves that a <hi>miſerere,</hi> have mercy, at laſt, will ſet all to rights. It is true, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth amend all, it purgeth us, and reſtoreth us to the favour of God, but they conſider not the bitterneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the ſoules of the penitent are heavy within them, even to death, their eyes runne rivers of waters, their throats are hoarſe with roring and crying for mercy, their teares are their drinke day and night, they have ſighes and grones which cannot be expreſt. The ſorrowes of hell, ſo <hi>David</hi> doth call them, doe compaſſe them round about: they call upon God, and he will not heare them: they doe ſeeke him, and he will not preſently be found: like Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a ſtorme, their cunning is gone, they are at their wits end. Sometimes they cry, <hi>quid feci?</hi> what have I done? and remember all their ſinnes; Sathan then comes in to helpe their memory, upbrayding them with thoſe very ſinnes to which he enticed them, with a <hi>non eſt ſalus ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 3.</note> for what refuge hath a ſinner, but God, and what comfort can a ſorrowfull ſoule have but in him? yet ſinne is ſo contrary to him, that a guilty ſoule cannot thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him but as an enemy. You ſee it in the firſt ſinners, the firſt thing they did after they had ſinned, was to flye away from the preſence of God. Let a true Convert tell ſinners all this, and ſee what joy they can take in ſinne, when it is like to coſt them all this, breaking of the heart, confuſion of face, confeſſion of mouth, confeſſion of ſoule. A true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent muſt keepe a ſeſſion within himſelfe, he muſt give in evidence againſt himſelfe, his conſcience muſt accuſe him, his memory muſt beare witneſſe againſt him, he muſt judge himſelfe, that he be not judged of the Lord: he muſt after ſentence be avenged on himſelfe by a voluntary penance, afflicting his ſoule, chaſtening his body, reſtraining it from

pleaſures, humbling it with faſting, wearying it with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, weakening it with watching, and by all means bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Beloved, ſit downe, and caſt up the coſt and paine of this ſpirituall phyſicke for a ſinne-ſicke ſoule, and if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you that hath paſt this courſe of phyſicke, and kept you to it without ſhrinking or ſhifting from it: I dare ſay ſuch a one can ſay, <hi>Nocet empta dolore voluptas,</hi> Pleaſure hurts that's bought with pain, and <hi>docet</hi> teaches too: he will ſcarce eate of the forbidden fruit, it is faire to the eye, it is delicious in taſte. But it is the deareſt bargaine that ever we bought, a momentany ſhort delight, with many weary dayes &amp; nights of penitential remorſe &amp; anguiſh of ſoule.</p>
               <p>3 None ſo fit as true Converts, to teach tranſgreſſors the ſweet benefit of reconciliation to God, the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, and the peace of conſcience. Such perceive the difference betweene the bondage of ſinne, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the ſpirit. They know what it is to loſe the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light of Gods gratious countenance: they can ſay that in his favour is life, light, and delight. As their longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was great to come and appeare before God, and as they thirſted after the full river of his pleaſures, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that joy, over-joyeth them.</p>
               <p>When thou turnedſt againe the captivity of <hi>Sion,</hi> wee were like thoſe that dreame. Our mouthes were filled with laughter, and our tongues with joy. Then they ſaid, the Lord hath done great things for us, the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoyce.</p>
               <p>As God is deſcribed in the ſhepheard who recovered his loſt ſheep, and in the woman who found her loſt groat, and in the father who recovered and received his prodigall ſonne, with more joy than the ſhepheard had in his 99. than the woman had in the reſt of her money, than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had in his eldeſt ſonne that had alwaies beene with him: So a converted ſinner, delighteth more in God after his converſion, then he did before. <hi>Ibo &amp; revertar ad pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trens moum,</hi> I will goe and returne to my father. I will
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14122:74"/>
goe and returne to my firſt husband, for then it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me than it is now.</p>
               <p>A Convert can tell tranſgreſſors how his father eſpied him a far off, how he met him upon the way, how he fell on his necke and kiſſed him, and bade him welcome, how he brought firſt <hi>ſtolam primam,</hi> the chiefe garment to cover him: how he killed <hi>vitulum illum,</hi> that calfe, and had mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke and dancing for joy for his returne. One of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt feares of a ſinner who hath ſold God for ſome vaine pleaſure, is, that God will never be recovered to favour him againe, and that is one of the Scorpions wherewith the very Saints of God are ſcourged. Sathan abetteth that feare in them, with terrible overtures of the impartiall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and it is the voyce of the wicked of the earth; Tuſh, God hath forſaken him, and there is none to helpe him. <hi>David</hi> was heart-ſicke of this diſeaſe. Many there be that ſay to my ſoule, there is no helpe for thee in thy God. A true penitent reconciled to God, can tell ſuch that they belye the holy one of <hi>Iſraell;</hi> with the Lord there is mercy that he may be feared. He giveth pardon for ſinnes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth all thine iniquities. He continueth but a while in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: if a ſinner wil not come to him, he wil whet his ſword, he will make ready his bow, and prepare his arrowes for execution: But if a ſinner will forſake his evill wayes, and returne to him, he will behold him a farre off, and meete him upon the way, and embrace him with his ſavour. This is the chiefe errand that we have from God to his Church, to carry to them the word of reconciliation, to preach peace to them that are neare, and to them that are farre off, liberty to the impriſoned, and to ſuch as are oppreſt, the taking off of the yoke.</p>
               <p>He that hath beene ſcorched with the flames of hell, who hath felt the ſting of a cruciating conſcience, who hath beene ſhaken and ſhattered with the terror of the Lord, and hath found joy and comfort upon his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he can teſtifie for God, that he is gratious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, that he may be entreated: ſo <hi>David,</hi> Come hearken
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14122:74"/>
to me all ye that feare God, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoule. There is a Pſalme of purpoſe for<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.</note> it, wherein the Prophet magnifieth both his owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and Gods ſingular mercy, with a <hi>probatum eſt,</hi> ſo it is: <hi>experto crede,</hi> beleeve him that hath found it by experience: he tels what he hath comfortably found, and the Church hath joy of it.</p>
               <p>Seeing a convert is ſo fit for this ſervice, let all ſinners<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> labour to haſten and accompliſh their converſion, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to doe God this good ſervice in teaching others. This would multiply teachers in the Church, and turne us all into miniſters of reconciliation. Every one ſhould teach his neighbour the feare of the Lord.

Be they Eccleſiaſticall or Lay, be they ſuch as doe it <hi>ex officio,</hi> out of duty, by vertue of a ſpeciall calling, or <hi>ex charitate,</hi> from the love they beare to God and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Their reward is with God, and they ſhall eate the fruit of their labours from the tree of life in the middeſt of the garden. It is the nature of goodneſſe, for, <hi>Bonum eſt communicativum ſui,</hi> Good is of a ſpreading nature: <hi>bonus malum bonum eſſe vult, ut ſit ſui ſimilis,</hi> the good would have the evill to be good, that he may be like himſelfe. We cannot more holily, more charitably expreſſe our converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, than by teaching tranſgreſſors his waies. We cannot want ſchollers: for <hi>totus mundus eſt in maligno poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the whole world is ſet upon evill: what if ſome ſay, <hi>Nolumus ſcientiam viarum tuarum,</hi> wee deſire not the knowledge of thy waies, and hate to be reformed: yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will hearken, and even they may by the favour of God be ſoftened to an impreſſion.</p>
               <p>In our evill converſation we were forward enough to draw in others to the ſocietie of our evils to corrupt and pervert good manners. So theeves that ſay, we will all have one purſe: and immoderate drinkers ſit together, till ſtrong drinke inflame them.</p>
               <p>

I may ſay to a Convert, doe but the ſame diligence in converting thy brother, that thou haſt done and uſed in corrupting him, and it will paſſe currant: let thy counſell and example looke that way, and thinke thy converſion effected for this. <hi>The father of mercies, and God</hi>

                  <hi>of all comfort, comforteth us in all our tribulation, that wee may be able to comfort them which bee in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> The rule holdeth throughout, as in conſolation, ſo in inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in reprehenſion, and in conviction of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. As every one hath received any meaſure of grace from God, ſo let him communicate his knowledge and his grace to others in love, remembring that we are members one of another. This is the way to advance the building up of the Church of God, and to demoliſh the power of Sathans kingdome.</p>
               <p>None can pleade exemption from this duty, for when <hi>David</hi> the King offereth his ſervice this way, who can ſit out! The more eminent the perſon is, the more effectuall is his teaching, and the ſooner will tranſgreſſors give eare to him.</p>
               <p>See here the wiſedome and goodneſſe of God, how he<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> hath wrought good out of evill: for he hath ſtooped the Majeſtie of a King, to the ſervice of a teacher, and hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified the perſon of a tranſgreſſor, to the converſion of tranſgreſſors. The corrupter of his owne waies becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a guide to others. This alſo doth encourage our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for our converſion, becauſe it is a new making to us. The proofe of it we haue in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who no ſooner was himſelfe converted, but he laboured the illumination of ſuch as were in darkeneſſe, the confirmation of the weake, and the converſion of all that were in their owne crooked waies to the waies of God. I deny not but Scribes and Phariſes in <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire may teach well who live ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being unconverted themſelves, may be inſtruments
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14122:75"/>
of the converſion of others. But this is done by no vertue or grace in them, but by the power of Gods ordinance in their calling: for grace followeth the calling ſometimes, where it forſaketh the perſon.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we ſee the way to recover tranſgreſſors, which<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> is by teaching them the waies of God. Tranſgreſſors are ſuch as goe out of the way, <hi>ambulant in via non bona,</hi> they walke in the way which is not good, and nature is no good guide: for corrupt nature is like to the earth under the curſe, it bringeth forth nothing but brambles and thornes: teaching is the culture of it. The reproofe of ſinne from the law, breaketh up the ground, doctrine ſoweth the good ſeed, exhortation and continuall inculcation in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and out of ſeaſon, doth water it: the ſonne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhineth on it, and giveth it vegetation. Therefore ſo many as have any deſire to know the waies of God, let them hearken to teaching. The word is given to profit withall, and it is a ſingular bleſſing of God to that place where teaching of the waies of God is plenteous, and where the way of obedience and ſalvation is declared: elſe, all we like ſheepe ſhall goe aſtray, and walke in croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked pathes. God in wiſedome knowing how uſefull this would be in his Church, to have ſome to inſtruct and teach others his waies, began himſelfe to furniſh the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world with abilities for this purpoſe: for the ſtate of innocency needed no other than its owne light to ſhew it the right way. After the fall, yet the remaines of intellectuall light, holpen with ſpeciall grace in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſerved for bookes, and lawes, and rules of good life, all the firſt age of the world. Then the Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſurvived to ſee and begin a new world, his ſonne <hi>Sem,</hi> of likelihood that <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> King of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> ſo famous for a King and Prieſt to <hi>Abraham.

ſo the name of ſinner doth containe,</p>
               <p>1 A totall corruption of nature deſerving.</p>
               <p>2 A neceſſary obligation, <hi>ad poenam,</hi> to puniſhment. In the one there is <hi>pudor maleficii</hi> the ſhame of evill doing: in the other is <hi>terror judicii,</hi> the terror of judgement. Take a ſinner as he is in himſelfe, without grace ſanctifying him, and mercy pardoning him, he is the vileſt and unworthieſt of all the creatures that God made, in whom the image of God is blemiſhed, and almoſt utterly defaced. The Angels that ſtand in integrity, are as they were made, and they doe his will who made them. The celeſtiall bodies keepe their places, and doe the ſervice for which they are made. The Sunne knowes his riſing, and the Moone her going down. The Sunne goeth forth as a Bridegroome, and as a Gyant to his race; as if theſe heavenly bodies had reaſon to doe their makers will; ſo are they guided evermore by the law of their creation. The earth and the bruit creatures in their kinde, follow the rule of that firſt law, onely divels and men reſiſt it, and goe their owne waies, to Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and their owne hurt. The divels in malice to God, and in envy to man, ever labouring to pervert the waies of God. Sinners goe in their owne crooked waies, yea, they runne violently in them, as an hot and fierce horſe into the battell.</p>
               <p>Such are we all naturally, conceived in ſinne, and borne in iniquity, and after drawing ſinne to us with the cords of vanity. For our naturall corruption firſt defiling us, and the example of evill infecting us, and the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than inſtigating us, and the ſweetneſſe of the pleaſure of ſinne enticing us, and the cuſtome of ſinne hardening us, we become abhominable, and to every good worke repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

Onely the ſinner, whoſe ſoule is diveſted of grace, habited in ſinne, in hazard of hell, neither feeleth the want, nor feareth the danger: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther complaineth of what it is, nor ſeeketh remedy. <hi>David</hi> himſelfe who had taſted and drunke deepe of the ſpirituall favours of God, lyeth tenne moneths together wallowing in the mire of uncleanneſſe, ſleeping in the deep and dead ſleepe of ſinne, and not thinking upon a recoverie. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner during the time of his impenitencie, ſtands ſuſpended from the holy temple of God, which is <hi>excommunicatio minor,</hi> the leſſer excommunication. The faithfull cry, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me ye tranſgreſſors, and God himſelfe hideth his face from him.</p>

There are not amongſt the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures of the earth, not the leaſt of the winged flies in the ayre, or the creeping wormes on earth, which the unheedy foot of man or beaſt compoundeth with the earth it goes on; but it hath more of God in it than a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath, during his impenitencie.

All other creatures ſtand to health in their owne natures: man is diſeaſed: <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus eſt,</hi> he is all diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>It is worth the noting, that God corrupted not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any creature to puniſh the ſinne of man; he would not loſe the glory of <hi>omnia bene fecit,</hi> he did make all well. In wrath he remembred mercy, for thoſe creatures that are the curſe of the earth, brambles, thiſtles, and thornes, are alſo of ſingular vertue and uſe for the good of man:

               <p>3 The object; to the Lord.</p>
               <p>This may ſeeme to import very ſmall comfort for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors to turne to the Lord: for he hath declared himſelfe a jealous God, and a conſuming fire, he hath digged a pit for ſinners, his wiſedome cannot but ſee his lawes broken; his holineſſe can doe no leſſe than abhorre it, his juſtice cannot but puniſh it. To turne ſinners to God, is to bring ſtubble to the fire: but marke the ſequence of my text: Firſt he will teach ſinners Gods waies, and then there can be no danger of their turning to God. For <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had turned from God by diſobedience, it was no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he turned not to God by repentance, but fled from his preſence and hid himſelfe, becauſe the way to God was ſhutup, till God himſelfe opened it in the promiſed ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet there is no record of his turning kept.</p>
               <p>This point affordeth the moſt comfortable doctrine that we can preach, or you heare, That a ſinner may turne to God, and be welcome to him: it is the oyle of gladneſſe, it is the bread that ſtrengtheneth mans heart, <hi>Manna recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum,</hi> the hidden Manna. It is a flagon of wine from the Lords Cellar. It is the fulneſſe and fatneſſe, and marrow of Gods houſe. It is the living water drawne from the rivers of Gods pleaſure, which refreſh the City <hi>magni regis,</hi> of the great King. It is the very extraction and diſtilment of the two Teſtaments of the Law and of the Goſpell. Let a ſinner upon ſurvey of his conſcience, and the detection of his ſinne, whileſt his iniquities are in number, and are ſet in order before him, even then in the cold fit of feare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Lord, and caſt himſelfe at his feet, and ſeeke his face.

               <p>The firſt ſinners were Angels, they fell not all, and thoſe that fell did corrupt onely themſelves, there was no propagation of that creature.

And howſoever we finde no way of ſalvation without the Church, nor meanes of grace without Ieſus Chriſt, yet let me tell you, I dare not ſay, that all thoſe morall heathen who lived in the light of nature onely, yet by the law written in their hearts, did conſcionably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which that law did command, were certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned.

And many of us are ſo caught, ere we were aware, in ſinnes, which our chriſtian and religious hearts doe abhorre.

               <p>4 I but perchance <hi>Ioſeph</hi> might thanke his owne ſtout heart for their cruell uſage of him: for many times our own untemperate carriage in afflictions, brings fewell to the fire that ſcorcheth us, and blowes more breath into the tempeſt of winde that beſtormeth us. But <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren have not this excuſe, they confeſſe their brother reſiſted them not, but with humble entreaties they confeſſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought us.</p>
               <p>The petition of a ſoule in anguiſh faire-ſpoken and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hath pierced hard hearts, and relented cruell intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of evill: but it wrought not here: for,</p>

               <p>I have preſt this example the more, to declare how troubles awake the conſcience from a dead ſleepe, and turn our eyes into our owne boſomes, that if there lye a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore it is wiſedome, by confeſſion, by repentance and prayer, to quit our conſciences ſo ſoone as we can of ſuch ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Here is a ſinne of bloud, almoſt a full yeare old, and though <hi>Nathan</hi> hath pronounced Gods pardon of it, the conſcience of <hi>David</hi> is not yet at reſt, his thoughts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and his prayers be concerning it.</p>
               <p>2 Another of Sathans ſeaſons to call ſuch ſpeciall ſinnes to remembrance is, when we are neare our end; that is a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherein many of the faithfull ſervants of God have dangerous and fearefull conflicts with Sathan.</p>

There is his advantage againſt us, when any ſpeciall ſinnes lye upon the conſcience unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then he hath ſomething of his in us. This makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an aking heart upon death-beds, for then judgement is at hand, and the old flatterie of ſinne, <hi>Dominus tardabit,</hi> the Lord will delay, is removed by the ſenſible decay of the body, and the evident ſymptomes of approaching death.

And in this Inventorie, if there be any capitall ſinne texted and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the conſcience, in great and capitall letters, not yet blotted out by our repentance and Gods gracious pardon, how will that ſin preſent it ſelfe to preſent remembrance? how will it cruciate and torment the inward man, even the hid man of the heart? <hi>Judas</hi> his laſt words guſhed out the bowels of his deſpaire, as his laſt paſſion did the bowels of his body.

And he ſaid unto Ieſus: <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> which was anſwered with <hi>bodie mecum cris,</hi> to day thou ſhalt be with me.</p>
               <p>It is worthy our obſerving, that Ieſus Chriſt did inſtitute the holy Sacrament of his Paſſion, the evening before his ſuffering, as it were acting his death in viſible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he under-went it.

               <p>And from hence it is, that the holy Church hath not only offered this Sacrament as the bread of our ſpirituall life to nouriſh it, but hath commended it alſo to ſicke perſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their death beds, as <hi>viaticum animae,</hi> the proviſion of the ſoule, ſo the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> calleth it.

               <p>And in this holy action, our ſearch of our hearts will ſoone finde out any eminent and notorious ſinne to confeſſe and repent it, that the conſcience may be disburthened, and that the ſoule of man may be <hi>domus pacis,</hi> the houſe of peace: for otherwiſe we receive that Sacrament unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our condemnation. Our Saviour is preciſe in this: If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, More, if God have ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift: Goe and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled: <hi>et offer,</hi> and then bring it. This is a Sacrament from God to us, it is a ſacrifice from us to God.</p>
               <p>If any great extraordinary ſinne lye upon the conſcience, we had beſt exonerate us thereof: for we and our gift will elſe be unacceptable to him. If God receive our gift, he will not refuſe us, for he looketh firſt upon <hi>Abel,</hi> then on his ſacrifice: we make our offering acceptable, not that us.

Some of our owne brethren at home have quarrelled this as popiſh, not well adviſed of the ordinance and inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſt our Maſter, by whoſe commiſſion we performe this, as the cleare Text doth warrant.</p>

               <p>Adultery increaſeth the world, though with an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate iſſue: murder depriveth the world of a legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.

               <p>4 Sins are much weighed according to the meaſure of<note place="margin">Sol. 4.</note> comfort given to them, and therfore ſuch ſins as are done upon a ſodain temptation, be commonly no other then ſins of infirmity; Satans ſurprizes, and our overtakings. Such was <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, for he was idle, he walked on the roof of his houſe: <hi>Vidit, concupivit, accerſivit, convenit, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaw, deſired, ſent for her, confers, &amp;c. <hi>caetera quis neſcit?</hi> the reſt who knows not? But his other ſin, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate act of ſtudy, a premeditated miſchief, ſeen and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.

               <p>Sins on the by are often more hainous then the maine ſin. As here the making <hi>Uriah</hi> drunke, and killing him, worſe then the adultery.</p>

               <p>Adultery ſhould have beene declined; but being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it ſhould have been preſently repented: but when in ſtead hereof ſin is added to ſinne, that over-meaſure of iniquity is more then the firſt tranſgreſſion.

For whatſoever their outward calamities are, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten waſh their faces with their teares, they have upright hearts to God, <hi>My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is in every one of the Elect an outward man, which negotiateth in outward things, and hee hath his hande full. There is alſo an inward man, and he is willing, but weak. The calamities of life, the diſhonours done to Gods name and glory by others, the failings on our own part in duty, our fallings from it, doall work our grief, and turn our organs into the voice of them that weep. Yet in the midſt of theſe ſorrowes, wee may rejoyce in the Lord, like Muſique in the cabin, when the ſhip is in a ſtorm. <hi>My ſong ſhall be alwayes of the loving kindneſſe of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt all the favours of God none taſteth ſtronger of his divine nature, none happieth us more in the peace of conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, then his pardon of our ſin, and deliverance from it. <hi>Fils dimittuntur tibi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata tua,</hi> Sonne, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee, anſwereth <hi>Davids</hi> ſuite, <hi>Sana animam meam,</hi> heale my ſoule: for donation, the Lord doth not magnifie himſelf ſo much in it, ſeeing he hath power over all. But to pardon ſinnes, which do ſo violate his Majeſty, and are ſo contrary to his holineſſe, and doe ſo abuſe his bounty and free favour: this may make us ſing.</p>
               <p>I never read that any thing which God gave away grieved him; but the ſins of men grieve him at the heart, and make him repent his making of them. Therefore no ſuch provocation to ſing, as deliverance from ſin by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

               <p>For as exchange of gifts doth much maintaine friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here betweene man and man, which importeth a communion of goods between friends: So no queſtion but it confirmeth the mutuall love betweene God and his children, and faithfull people, when God openeth the Heavens, and powreth down bleſſings upon them, and when they againe in firſt-fruits, tithes, and ſacrifices, and oblations in charitable almes, benevolences, gifts, and holy legacies, living and dying, remember to honour God with their ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Let me commend this holy example of forward zeale in <hi>David</hi> to our imitation, that wee would be willing to give God any thing that we have, and think nothing too much, too good for his ſervice. For we were the children of death, and he bought us with a price, the hardeſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and deareſt peniworth that was ever bought, the hotteſt perquiſite. <hi>For we were not redeemed with things corruptible, as gold, and ſilver, but with the bloud of his Sonne, as of a Lambe without ſpot, the Sonne of his boſome in whom he was well pleaſed, he ſpared not that Sonne, but gave him: gave him to death, the death of the croſſe: gave him for us who were his enemies, who ſought no ſalvation, and asked none of him,</hi> but rather fled away in our firſt parents from his preſence, and hid our ſelves from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſought us out in the cool of the day, and offered us his Sonne, the ſeed of the woman to bruiſe the head of the Serpent, that we may ſay, His glory is great in our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Sonne hath made ſo eaſie and open a way to the throne of grace, and hath opened the hand of the Father ſo wide to us, that if wee open our moutnes wide, he will fill them. <hi>And whatſoever we aske the Father in his name, he will give it.</hi>

               <p>For the antiquity of Sacrifices, wee read firſt of them in the ſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> For ſo ſoon as we reade of their birth in the two firſt Verſes of the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the third and fourth Verſes report their Sacrifice, which doth not conclude, as ſome would have it, that this was a wil-worſhip of their owne deviſing, approved by God, &amp; by him after made into a law.

The uſe of them for ſacrifice was convenient for thoſe times, and God was gracious in his accepting of them to that uſe, though he needed them not.</p>
               <p>It is no improbable opinion of them who think that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God had given his judgement upon our firſt parents, and reveiled Chriſt to them, that they offered to him a ſacrifice of cleane beaſts in token of their thankfulneſſe, and in purpoſe, and with vow and promiſe of future obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and that God clothed their nakedneſſe with the skins of their ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>In the whole time before the floud, the Comandement was eaſie for ſacrifices, becauſe there was little other uſe of the bodies of theſe creatures.</p>
               <p>But when the law of Ceremonies was eſtabliſhed in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; the cattle of the people were a great part of their wealth, and then it grew very coſtly to ſerve the Lord ſo.</p>
               <p>There were ſacrifices of courſe, as the <hi>Juge ſacrificium,</hi> which ſpent two Lambes a day conſtantly: one in the morning, the other in the evening.</p>
               <p>There were burnt offerings which were all conſumed by fire upon the Altar: <hi>adreverentiam majeſtatis,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Gods majeſty.</p>
               <p>There were ſin-offerings for propitiation.</p>
               <p>There were peace-offerings for reconciliation and thankſgiving.</p>

                  <hi>David</hi> in reſpect of his duty to God and offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God, ſhould have offered all theſe ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and hee proteſteth a willingneſſe to give them. <hi>Elſe would I have given thee:</hi> Eſpecially now at laſt having obtained peace with God, hee ought to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt his thankfull duty to God in a peace-offering: which he was willing to have done.</p>
               <p>Let me onely obſerve in this paſſage, how coſtly the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14122:105"/>
Religion of thoſe times was under the Law. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charge of the Sanctuary: the maintenance of the houſe of God, with all things neceſſary for Gods ſervice. The maintenance of the perſons employed in the ſpeciall miniſtery in holy things.</p>
               <p>The coſt of ſacrifices of all ſorts: the labour and coſt of journey to the ſolemne Feaſts. Every private perſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſacrifices and oblations upon particular occaſions, amount to a very great charge, which yet was impoſed by God, and born by the people.</p>
               <p>We live in times of much more outward eaſe of body, much leſſe charge of the purſe.</p>
               <p>Wee have houſes of our God ready built to our hands, the ſupportation of them is eſteemed a burthen. Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſet out competent maintenance for the Miniſterie, our brethren have weighed it and found it too heavy for us. It is the viciſſitude of times, one age gathered ſtones together, another ſcattered them. The Church was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to devoure the Common-wealth. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth hath made it ſelfe amends. Wee have no cauſe to complaine of the coſt of our Religion. But ſuch as are faithfull in it are of <hi>Davids</hi> minde: that if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their goods, their labours, their bloud, their lives in ſacrifice, they would give all, to him who is all in all. You ſee the aime of my obſervation from <hi>Davids</hi> words. <hi>If thou deſiredſt it, I would give it thee:</hi> to perſwade you to hold nothing you have too precious or deare for God.</p>
               <p>Superſtition might over-do in the menaging this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; but true judgement, and truth it ſelfe have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed it. When the willing hearts of the people brought<note place="margin">Exod. 36. 6.</note> more then was needfull to the Sanctuary of God, curious ſuperſtition could have found vent for it all in coſtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornments.</p>

               <p>In the firſt ſacrifices that we read of in the Bible, <hi>Cain</hi> was refuſed, <hi>Abel</hi> was accepted. For God looked not, <hi>quid in manu:</hi> what in the hand, but <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When theſe are parted, it is not religion, but formall and ceremoniall profeſſion onely. The outward ſervice of God is but the body and carcaſſe of the ſervice: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is the ſoule; and as a body without a ſoule is dead, ſo is the outward without the inward.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were very peccant in this kinde, and placed their Religion much in theſe outward Ceremonies.

               <p>God often worketh upon the hearts of ſinners this way. And <hi>David</hi> found this phyſick very healthfull to him. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray: but now I keep thy Word.

                  <hi>and to break my heart?</hi> The heart of man is eaſily broken with griefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> grew weary of his life. So did <hi>Jonah,</hi> both deſire of God that they may die. <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> had their hearts ſo broken with ſorrows that they abhorred life, and never did any more earneſtly deſire to live, then they did to be cut off from the land of the living. Many of theſe fits and ſharpe agonies come upon us: wee find the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> ſtories full of examples of thoſe whom the outward croſſes of life have ſo wearied, that they have preferred to die by their own hand, rather then to live out the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſault of temporall diſgrace or pain. Wee have loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in our goods, grief for our friends, heavineſſe for the loſſe of children, or their unthriving courſes in the world, manifold ſickneſſes, moleſtation by ſuites, and ſuch like grievances ſtore.</p>
               <p>God is pleaſed to uſe theſe as meanes to breake our hearts, and they doe worke with ſome: for in the day of their affliction they will ſeeke God diligently.</p>
               <p>And when the judgements of God are upon the earth, the inhabiters of the world will learne righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:14122:114"/>But an heart thus broken onely with outward tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is not alwayes a ſacrifice for ſinne. For murmurers, and male-contents, and envious perſons, becauſe they cannot have their will, doe not onely ſicken and diſeaſe all the joyes of life: but choake and ſtrangle them, with immoderate vexation.</p>
               <p>If hearts ſo broken were a ſacrifice to God: <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Lamech,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Abſolon,</hi> might plead for their acceptance with God: for in <hi>Cains</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, in <hi>Lamechs</hi> words, in <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> lookes, in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus</hi> teares, In <hi>Abſolons</hi> flight, wee may diſcerne what hearts they had: no queſtion, much ſhaken, and broken with ſeverall vexations, becauſe they could not have their will.</p>

               <p>But remember the neceſſity of this Sacrifice of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpirit and a contrite heart: For theſe are Sacrifices to God, ſuch as God exacteth of all, and without which there is no appearing in his preſence. Let no man appeare before me empty, is his Law: and we have no fulneſſe but in this Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>How unkindly doe wee take it at the hands of God when we cry unto him, and he heareth us not, at leaſt as one that did not vouchſafe us the hearing, hee doth not grant our requeſts? Yet hee may ſay of every one of us, of ſome twenty, of ſome forty, of others ſixty yeers long and more have I been grieved with this generation. That is the ſhame, and it threatneth to be the ſorrow of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull Land. God hath not his due amongſt us, though he give us rain and fruitfull ſeaſons, Corne and Wine and Oile, all the neceſſaries of life. Wee give him not the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of our broken ſpirits, and contrite hearts, which are the ſacrifices of God.</p>
               <p>We come off liberally to men to purchaſe their favour and mediation in our ſuits, and bribes given to men have robbed God of the Sacrifices due to him. Let us lay it to heart.</p>
               <p>I reade of the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> a people effeminate and vaine in their ſenſuall delights, that they had a prophecy, that their City ſhould ſubſiſt till their gods were in leſſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

then men. It fell out that a ſlave obtaining no mercy at the hands of his Maſter for the gods take, fled to the monument of his Maſters Anceſtors, and for their ſakes implored, and obtained pardon. When <hi>Amyris</hi> a Philoſopher living there heard of this, that men were more regarded then their gods, hee looked for a ruine to come upon the City, &amp; fled away from it. Shortly after, the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonians</hi> their adverſaries ſubdued them and fulfilled that Prophecy. Wee may take home this example to our times, and apply it to thoſe with whom God is neglected, and men regarded more then God. Their voluptuous and <hi>Sybariticall</hi> life hath opened a way to the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</p>
               <p>And they have no way to helpe it, but with a full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of broken ſpirits and contrite hearts. We need not with the fearfull Philoſopher quit our Country, &amp; forſake our habitations: let us remove our crying ſins, by which God is diſhonoured, <hi>and there will be peace within our walls, and prosperity within our Palaces.</hi> And the eyes of them that deſire to ſee us in the duſt ſhall faile, and the ruines of our hearts ſhall repaire the ruines of our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Felicitie.</p>

               <p>I Preſumption on the favour of God to us.</p>
               <p>We think the word more ſevere, and the killing letter of it more cutting then it need to be, and the miniſter of this word more harſh then is cauſe. We confeſſe, that for terrour theſe things are ſet down, and the Miniſters muſt threaten us with heavy judgement, if our hearts be not broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:14122:122"/>But it is God who is veiled in the parable of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to whom his ſervant deep in his debt came and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him for favour: and hee forgave him all the debt. So we confeſſe, that this ſacrifice of broken hearts is a due debt: but our Maſter is ſo gracious and pitifull to forgive it all.</p>
               <p>There be many fair ſpoken texts that ſeem to nouriſh this preſumption in us. <hi>As a father hath compaſſion of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion: but it is on them that fear him, not on them that preſume on him.</hi> And the parable of that father of the prodigall, who did not ſo much as chide his unthrifty ſon, but met him afarre off, fell on his neck, welcomed him with a kiſſe, and feaſted, and clothed him, doth expreſſe a great tenderneſſe. But let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon that, for that ſonne came home with a broken hart, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and againſt thee. Non ſumdignus vocari, &amp; fac me unum ex mercenariis tuis.</hi> I am not worthy to be called: and make me one of thy hyred ſervants. His father was ſenſible of his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee was loſt by his ſin, and found in his repentance: he was dead by the wound of his own conſcience, and made alive by his fathers favourable pardon, receiving him againe to his grace. And the ſervant to whom his maſter forgave all his debt, was put to his <hi>miſerere,</hi> have mercy: his maſter ſaw his heart broken with the grief of his debt, and heard his willing proteſtation to pay all, and received his humble ſupplication for mercie. God is a loving Father, but not indulgent; he loveth not ſo, but that he chaſteneth and ſcourgeth every ſonne whom hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ods are for the backs of fools. <hi>Iudgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at the houſe of God, and the righteous are hardly ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would put any man out of heart to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume too much upon the favour of God: for by three great examples he declareth the ſevere juſtice of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:14122:122"/>
                  <hi>For if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and delivered them into chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be reſerved unto judgment: And ſpared not the old world, bringing in the floud upon the world of the ungodly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>Preſumption doth make an Idole of God; for it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the mercy of God againſt his holineſſe which hateth ſinne; againſt his truth which threatneth ſinne; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his juſtice which puniſheth ſinne. Preſumption crucifieth againe the Lord Ieſus, and layeth on more ſtripes upon him. Preſumption reſiſteth, grieveth, quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the holy Ghoſt, by whom wee are ſealed to the day of Redemption: and ſo boldly treſpaſſeth the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>I need not urge any other evidence againſt preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the favour of God, then his ſeverity againſt his own Son, <hi>Miſit, dedit, non pepercit, non fuit dolor ſicut.</hi> He ſent, he gave, he ſpared him not, there was no ſorrow like unto his.</p>
               <p>And was this to quite us from all paſſion? No: if wee ſuffer with him, wee ſhall alſo reigne with him: hee did not drinke of a ſponge of vineger and gall. <hi>Tranſeat calix.</hi> Let this cup paſſe from me. Hee began the health of his Spouſe the Church: all the faithfull muſt doe him right, they owe him a pledge. Some are put to it to ſuffer for him, none are exempt from ſuffering with him. This is the leaſt and eaſieſt plunge wee can be put to, to break our hearts with contrition for our own ſins <hi>ò mihi tum quàm molliter oſſa quieſcent!</hi> ô then! my bones ſhall take their ſweet repoſe.</p>
               <p>When I can tender to my God a broken heart; no lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no diſſipation of it can ſo unfaſhion it, but that he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14122:123"/>
can put it together again; like the dry bones in <hi>Ezech.</hi> Viſion, and ſay unto it, <hi>live.</hi> In our mortification it dieth a naturall heart, in our firſt reſurrection, it riſeth againe a ſpirituall heart.</p>
               <p>I conclude with <hi>Davids</hi> ſuite, <hi>O keepe thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſins, that they have no dominion over me: ſo ſhall I be innocent from the great offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 A ſecond impediment to the ſacrifice of a broken heart is an over-delight that we take in the vain pleaſures of life. God was pleaſed to make a ſingular triall of two men in two contrary wayes, for example of others.</p>
               <p>1 Hee made tryall of his ſervant <hi>Job</hi> by afflictions, they came upon him ſuddenly, and they came thick. In all the things wherin he had bleſſed <hi>Job</hi> above moſt men, he afflicted him beyond example.</p>
               <p>In his honor &amp; autority he tryed him with diſgrace and contempt. In a fair poſterity he tried him with orbitie. In his abundance of riches he tryed him with poverty. In his friends with paucity; he had few left, and they proved grievous to him. In his health he afflicted his body with painfull and lothſome diſeaſes and ſores. Yet you have heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, hee came off faire. <hi>In all this</hi> Iob <hi>ſinned not, neither did hee charge God fooliſhly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 His ſervant <hi>Solomon</hi> he tryed with honour, riches, and power, with victory over his enemies, and the cup of temporall pleaſures, of life, he made to over-flow: never did any man on earth drinke ſo deep of that cup. In this tryall <hi>Solomon</hi> miſcarried, pleaſures ſtole away his heart: <hi>Solomon</hi> loſt his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> integrity, his wiſdome wherin he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all that were before him was benighted in him, the ſalt in him was infatuate. Such power have worldly pleaſures againſt wiſdome.</p>
               <p>See his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> his recantation, you ſhall ſee how hee declareth himſelf againſt them, pronouncing them all vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>It is an old Proverbe, <hi>Fortis in bello, ſapiens in ira, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:14122:123"/>
                  <hi>in adverſis.</hi> Strong in warre, wiſe in anger, a friend in adverſity.</p>
               <p>This is the Purgatory in which theſe are tryed. If they comefairly off in theſe probations, we eſteeme them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p>I may adde hereunto, that a true Chriſtian is tryed alſo in temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of pleaſure. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not ſo put to it either in the pit wherinto his brethren let him down, or in the hands of the ſtranger Merchants into which he was ſold: not in the priſon where his feet were in the ſtocks, and the irons entred into his ſoule; as in the hand of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, when ſhe laid hold of him, and ſaid, lie with me.</p>
               <p>Pleaſures corrupt our underſtanding, and caſt our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment into a dead ſleep. <hi>They ſteale away the heart. There is none that underſtandeth and ſeeketh after God. Non eſt Deus in viis corum,</hi> God is not in their wayes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Wee are in purſuite of three dangerous enemies, the Fleſh, the World, and the Devill. We have taken an oath in our Baptiſme to fight ſtrongly and conſtantly againſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14122:124"/>
theſe. Faſting is one of our weapons, we ſhall not want the ſweet temptation of hony, that is of pleaſure dropping before us, entiſements to break our faſt. Let us remember our early oath ſworne to God in our Baptiſme. Let us keep a devout faſt from all ſinfull delights: what though it coſt us a pinching and preſſing bunger? This is the way to get victory of our enemies before night: for when night commeth, we can no longer work. Pleaſant to the eye, and delectable to the taſte was the forbidden fruit. But nakedneſſe and the loſſe of Paradiſe; the ſweat of the face, and the multiplyed ſorrows of Child-birth followed eating: our firſt parents were no longer happy then whileſt they were faſting.</p>
               <p>It will be a very hard matter to perſwade a man in the vanitie of his pleaſure to offer God a ſacrifice of a broken heart. For in our full diſhes and overflowing cups wee cannot remember <hi>Ioſeph's</hi> affliction, we ſhall hardly then ariſe from our banquet to viſit him, and ſuffer with him. There is nothing in the world that ſo dimmeth the ſight to behold the courſe of Gods judgments in the World: nothing ſo deafeth the eare againſt the Word that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very ſwiftly: nothing that fatteth the heart to ſlaughter; ſo much as pleaſure doth.

None truſt God leſſe then they, and no eſtates are ſooner blaſted then theirs. God never intended when he placed us in the world, to make us for the world, he ſet our face a better way. Many have found the cares of this world ſuch hinderances to repentance of ſinnes, ſuch encreaſers rather of ſinne, ſuch remora's to godly life, that they have freely abandoned the world, and embraced a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous poverty rather then they would teare themſelves with theſe thornes.</p>

But what ſay the books of time or what can our obſervation of our time teſtifie of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and contrite hearts for them?

                  <item>3 He rejoyced in two things, which have reference to the two duties of Repentance.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1 <hi>Ceaſe to do evill:</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>I am not as other men, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, nor as this Publicane:</hi> not like them in their ſinnes: But <hi>I thanke thee</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Learne to do well: I faſt twice, I give tythes, &amp;c</hi> but we referre this alſo to <hi>I thanke thee.</hi> The Publicane had another bearing, which became humble repentance well. But the Phariſee, for any thing I can diſcerne, might have paſt for an holy man, if Chriſt himſelfe had not detected him. I tell you, this man went downe to his houſe. Yet obſerve the Text: <hi>He went juſtified more then the other;</hi> the other not altogether unjuſtified.</p>
               <p>2 This directeth me in the deduction of a ſecond concluſion, that a broken and a contrite heart for ſinne is as ſafe reſt for the ſoule, as the conſcience of a good life. This appeareth in the direction betweene the ſtate of our innocent creation, and our coſtly redemption. For our creation ſet us in a way of happineſſe, rather in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and fruition of happineſſe, but ſuch as might be loſt; but our redemption bought us a never-withering
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14122:129"/>
crowne of glory. Our holineſſe of life may be corrupted as <hi>Davids</hi> was, but our contrite and broken ſpirit none can heale but God onely; and becauſe it is his ſacrifice, he will not deſpiſe it. In all the examples of repentance above-mentioned, we ſee how firmly the Penitents ſtood upon that ground, for that put away all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes, and eſtabliſhed them in the good favour of God. Therefore <hi>David</hi> having this ſacrifice ready, and now tendring the ſame to his God, doth ceaſe further ſolliciting of God for himſelfe, and beginneth as one fully reconciled to God, to ſollicite him in the behalfe of his Church as followeth. From whence we draw this exhortation: Let us all labour our repentance as the moſt needfull worke of all. We muſt charge all our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon our ſinnes, and we have but this one way left to repaire us, to redeeme the favour of our God to us, even our repentance. One joynt ſacrifice of broken hearts, and whole hecatombes of contrite ſpirits would mend all that's amiſſe.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore commence a juſt warre againſt our owne corruptions and ſinnes: it is not enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the weake Iſland, to deſtroy the vines, the fewell of our drunkenneſſe, to poſſeſſe the towns and villages, the habitations of ſinne in the outward members of the body. There is in every one of us a ſtrong Fort, an hard and ſtonie heart, fortified againſt all piety and holineſſe, where Sathan as a ſtrong armed man holdeth poſſeſſion, this Fort and ſtrong hold, this propugnacle of ſinne, this heart muſt be broken. Let us bend all our batterie againſt that, and ſee to it, that the world, the fleſh, the devill may not ſupply it, and then the day is ours, and <hi>to him that overcometh ſhall be given a crowne of life.</hi> Nothing overcometh this Fort of ſinne in our hearts, nothing breaketh them ſo ſoone as,</p>

               <p>And <hi>Hagge</hi> hath told us that the ſinne of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in their neglect of building Gods Houſe, did bring upon their land barrenneſſe, unfruitfulneſſe upon their trees, their wages did not proſper for the works of their hands, nothing thrived with them. But eſpecially the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Kings did ever bring great evill upon the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rehoboams</hi> ſin rent the Kingdome, and loſt the Church ten Tribes at once, and divided the State into two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Iudah</hi> were the ruine of their Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Davids</hi> ſin crimſoned his houſe with bloud. The pollution of <hi>Thamar,</hi> the death of <hi>Amnon,</hi> the Rebellion of <hi>Abſolon,</hi> as theſe were the great ſorrows of <hi>David,</hi> ſ they were the diſquiet and vexation of the whole

State, and theſe were the effects and fruits of <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>David</hi> doth well to repaire the ruines of Sion by his prayers, &amp; to ſolicite the peace of the Church: which his ſin had ſo much endangered.

               <p>The point is, when any of us come to make our peace with God for our ſins, as we have care of our ſelves, and our owne reconciliation to God, ſo let us remember to commend to God the care of his Church, which by our ſins is wronged.</p>

               <p>The Church is the Congregation of them that call upon the name of the Lord. It is the prayer of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Father, glorifie thy name.</hi> Wee have great reaſon for it: becauſe <hi>our helpe is in the name of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:14122:134"/>It was the old petition of the Church, <hi>To beſeech God for his Names ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 We pray for the comming of Gods Kingdome. His Kingdome of power is over all the World. But his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace is the holineſſe of his Church onely, and his Kingdom of glory is the Crown of the Church onely.</p>
               <p>Here God reigneth, <hi>The Lord is King, and hath put on glorious apparell, he hath clothed himſelf with majeſtie and honour.</hi> His Kingdome is within us, his wiſdome our guide, his word our law, his mercy our hope, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our feare, his truth our faith, his will our obedience.</p>
               <p>3 Wee pray that the will of God may be done on earth, <hi>ſicut in coelo,</hi> as in heaven: So if the Church thrive and proſper, here will be an heaven upon earth, and wee ſhall be like the Angels of God, who obey him by fulfilling his will.</p>

               <p>We conſider our ſelves as members one of another, &amp; ſo the welfare of the members dependeth on the welfare of the body.

               <p>2 Conſider him as a Prophet of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The prayers of all men have good acceſſe to the throne of grace, but Prophets of the Lord beſide the common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation as members of the body of the Church, have a ſpeciall duty <hi>ex officio,</hi> by their office, and are as it were Maſters of Requeſts to put up the prayers of the Church to God.</p>

The vow of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth oblige all our life, and we ſhould ever call it to remembrance, to keepe us in conſtant obedience to our God.
