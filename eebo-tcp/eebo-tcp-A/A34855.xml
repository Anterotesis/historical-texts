            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface
To the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT being uſual for Authors in
Prefaces to render an account of
the occaſion which gave Birth to
their writings, and to acquaint the
Reader with the deſign or ſcope of
their Diſcourſes, I thought it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to continue a cuſtom approved
by many Illuſtrious examples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42016:4"/>
Let me therefore give thee to
underſtand, that it is not deſire
of applauſe hath engaged me
in this Controverſie. The care
I have taken to conceal my Name
will, I ſuppoſe, free me from
ſuch ſuſpicion; but beſides, let
me aſſure thee I am too far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
my ſelf any addition to my
Repute from this ſcrible, That I do
rather apprehend it will leſſen my
Esteem with many of thoſe excellent
Perſons, who are now pleaſed to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me with their Friendſhip: and
do expect from me Diſcourſes very
different from thoſe I here preſent
thee. Which conſiderations ſurely
will gain me credit, when I affirm
That no Motive beſides that of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:42016:4"/>
advantage could ever have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon me, to exchange my dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Studies of Experimental Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
and Phyſick (moſt pleaſing
and profitable imployments) for
barren Controverſie, which I ever
declined. And among all, if I had
conſulted my own quiet or Intereſt;
I ſhould have avoyded this wherein
I have now engaged; which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
me much trouble, but cannot
poſſibly bring me any advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that ſatisfaction which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the reſult of Actions well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Which pleaſure I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
will be much heightned, if this
endeavour of mine meets with good
entertainment and work the deſired
Effect; which that it may have, I
<pb facs="tcp:42016:5"/>
will particularly addreſs my ſelf to
all the Perſons concern'd with me
in this debate: Who are the People
or Patients, and Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe is chiefly intended
for the Firſt, it being they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are
moſt highly injured by the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
practices of thoſe we have
therein accuſed; for although many
underſtanding Perſons among the
People are ſufficiently ſenſible of the
abuſes we have manifeſted; and
that it is of abſolute neceſſity ſome
reformation be made: yet all are
not thus perſwaded, for we may dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerve, that many who are leſs
diſcerning, being deceived by an
imaginary good, covet their own
ruine; and unleſs they be given to
<pb facs="tcp:42016:5"/>
underſtand which is the evil and
which the good, by perſons in whom
they have reaſon to confide, they
muſt neceſſarily run much hazard.
I have here endeavoured to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, which I ſhould diſpair
of, did I only foreſee inconveniences
a far off (the Vulgar being led by
ſenſe, and not by probable conject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures)
but ſince they do now actually
labour under many, and thoſe obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inconveniences, how ſhort ſoever
their ſight be, the ſenſe of feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no leſs acute in them, than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
I perſwade my ſelf they will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
give their aſſent to thoſe Truths
I have here diſcovered. Now there
are many things whereof moſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
are highly guilty, as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:42016:6"/>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nskilfulneſs, Vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
on the one hand, and Intruſion
into the Phyſicians Imployment (I
mean the Practice of Phyſick) on
the other: on all which accounts as
I have fully demonſtrated, they are
exceedingly injurious to the Publick.
In order to the prevention of ſuch
unpardonable abuſes of the People I
have made this Propoſal, That Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
prepare and diſpence their
own Medicines; and at large ſhewed
That the advantages of ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
will be many and great. <hi>For
it will much abate the charge and
expence of Phyſick, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
themſelves will be more
ſafe and effectual than now they
are, intereſt obliging Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42016:6"/>
               <hi>to have their Phyſick as good
as they can contrive or prepare;
and certainly ſuch a State of
Phyſick of all other is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable,
wherein no man having
the Intereſt can have the Power,
nor any having the Power can
have the Intereſt to prepare Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
unfaithfully: wherein
bad men ſhall be made good, and
thoſe that are good never be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
to become diſhoneſt. And
in that Conſtitution of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
for which we contend, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
men be never ſo bad; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
their wickedneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have any ill influence on
Phyſick,</hi> as is manifeſted at large
in this following Diſcourſe: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:42016:7"/>
if the ſick have regard, either to
profit or ſafety, they will addreſs
themſelves to thoſe Perſons who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with the beſt Remedies, and
<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at cheapeſt Rates.</p>
            <p>And as for Phyſicians, they muſt
neceſſarily put their affaires into
ſome ſuch Method, as this we have
commended; If they have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for their Patients, or intend to
improve Pharmacy it ſelf. For as it
hath been well obſerved, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
only upon that we read in
Books, we ſhall never promote this
Art beyond its preſent limits; and if
Phyſicians in former times had not
been knowing in Simples, examined
their Vertues, and Tempers, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into their Effects, and mixed
<pb facs="tcp:42016:7"/>
them with their own hands, there
had been no ſuch Science as
Phyſick. Now according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Axiom, <hi>Ex quibus Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
ex iiſdem Nutrimur,</hi> Thoſe
things which gave a being to this
Noble faculty muſt help to make it
compleat; towards which as nothing
can contribute more than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Pharmacy: ſo neither
can any thing promote that, more
than Phyſicians taking it into their
Management. But beſides all this,
it is fit that they who <hi>exerciſe</hi>
themſelves in the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
be ſatisfied their Medicines
are good; whereby their Mind will be
free, and without any clog: which
would add more difficulties and
<pb facs="tcp:42016:8"/>
dangers to a thing by it ſelf hard
and dangerous.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other Conſiderations
mentioned and inſiſted on in the
following Diſcourſe will I aſſure
my ſelf, perſwade all Phyſicians who
have reſpect to the good and benefit
of their Patients, Honour of their
mrofeſſion, or own Reputation, to put
Pharmacy into other hands, and into
better Methods, than thoſe wherein
at preſent it is; Whereby they who
now diſhonour it (I mean the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries)
will either be reduced to
a ſenſe and performance of their
Duty, or ſufficiently puniſhed. For
Notwithſtanding that they do now
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimouſly reſolve with aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
endeavours to Oppoſe all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb facs="tcp:42016:8"/>
yet I am perſwaded that if
Phyſicians take ſome ſuch courſes as
thoſe I have mentioned, the event
will be the ſame with that of Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Where if the Commander be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
he makes ſome of the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
exemplary, and threatens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
of fierce, that they were in
general, each one out of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fear becomes obedient: So how
inſolent ſoever the Apothecaries
now are when they ſee their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
neer and certain, not truſting
to one another, they will haſten all
to Obedience; eſpecially if good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
be given to thoſe who
return to their Duty, and become
Reformadoes.</p>
            <p>And now (to haſten to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
<pb facs="tcp:42016:9"/>
if any fancy, we have too rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attaqued the Apothecaries, let
them conſider (and then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they will excuſe us) that what
we have done is only in our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
for we had never interrupted
their quiet, could they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
themſelves within due limits
and not invaded our Profeſſion. So
that if the Caſe be ſtated rightly, it
will appear moſt evident, that we
are on the Defenſive part, They
the Aggreſſors; and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
juſtly be blamed, if in our own
Defence we offend them: or if being
forced, we take violent Courſes,
whoſe End yet is not (as may be
pretended) Deſtruction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
but Order and redreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42016:9"/>
Nothing now remains but that I
Apologize for the defects of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Diſcourſe. It may be objected,
that the Method is not exact, the
expreſſion rude, the Style unpoliſhed
and abrupt, the parts not cloſly
cemented by handſom and ſutable
Tranſitions. All which I readily
acknowledge: But withall Deſire
the Readers to conſider that
this Book was begun and finiſhed
within the ſpace of ſix or eight
dayes at the moſt; and even then I
was not free from diverſions of many
kinds: ſo that being penned in ſo
ſhort a time, the ſubject it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant,
and the writer variouſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
ſhould be compleat in Method or
<pb facs="tcp:42016:10"/>
Expreſſion. Beſides, this Diſcourſe
was not calculated for Scholars, but
for the Vulgar to whoſe capacity it
is adapted; for if I had intended to
inſtruct the former, I would have
taken more time and pains, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
the matter better, diſpoſed
it more advantageonſly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to cloath it in more
handſome expreſſions.</p>
            <p>I muſt not here forget to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that I have borrowed
ſeveral paſſages from the judicious
Author of a late excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
concerning the State of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and the regulation of its
Practice. I ſuppoſe it will be eaſily
imagined that I could have ſpoken
the ſame things in other words; but
<pb facs="tcp:42016:10"/>
my reſpect for that Worthy Perſon
diſpoſes me to believe they will
ſound better and be more effectual
in his own language; although I
muſt crave his pardon for tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſome, and accommodating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to a propoſal, he did not then
think fit to mention.</p>
            <p>For Faults in Printing <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the Printer muſt be reſponſible; and
particularly for that formall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the 177. <hi>Page,</hi> which
was never ſo intended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>This is all with which I thought
fit to acquaint thee, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now end with this requeſt.
That thou determine nothing in the
behalf, or to the prejudice of this
<pb facs="tcp:42016:11"/>
performance, till thou haſt imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
examined all that is contained
therein; and then if it appear that
I have ſpoken truth, I expect it
ſhould be owned and promoted by
thee: if I be in any thing miſtaken
I am content to hear of it, and
ready to retract whatſoever is not
conſonant to Truth and Reaſon.</p>

            <head>A
DISCOURSE
WHEREIN
The Intereſt of the Patient in
reference to <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians</hi>
is ſoberly Debated, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN all Ages, and among all Nations,
Health hath obtained the repute
of being the greateſt among
Earthly felicities, in the abſence
whereof we cannot reliſh any of thoſe
numerous enjoyments which the
bountifull Creator hath plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on us; ſo that the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Antient Philoſophers, who
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42016:12"/>
excluded all other External good from
being neceſſary to the well-being of
Man, placing happineſs onely in thoſe
things whereof we cannot be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
yet out of them they excepted
Health, knowing there was ſo near a
Connexion between the Soul and
Body, that this could not be diſordered
in its Functions, but that would be
diſturbed in its Operations.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, that even among the
Wiſeſt, that Science or Art, whereby
thoſe Defects we call Diſeaſes were
repaired, was always accounted Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
and the Miniſters or Diſpenſers
of this Skill were looked on as the
hands of the Gods: and ſome of them
held the firſt places among their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Mortals.</p>
            <p>It is well known how great a name
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> obtained, not onely in
<hi>Greece</hi> (which he delivered from a
depopulating Plague) but in remote
parts; ſo that the greateſt Monarch in
the <hi>East,</hi> and his Vice-Roys, were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42016:12"/>
ſuitors to him to free their Country
from that devouring Diſeaſe, which
threatned to exhauſt thoſe populous
Regions of their Inhabitants: unleſs
the ſame Perſon which freed <hi>Greece,</hi>
interpoſed, whom they eſteemed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and deſcended from the Gods,
becauſe ſo Succeſsfull in ſuch great
undertakings.</p>
            <p>Neither did the Reputation of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
die with that excellent Perſon,
but was afterwards in ſuch high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that the greateſt Kings were its
chief Profeſſors, and Cheriſhers; and
thought to render themſelves more
famous (as indeed they did) by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Virtues of ſome ſingle
Plant, or by the contriving of ſome
noble Compoſition, and leaving their
Names entailed on them: than by their
acquiſts of Countries, or enlargement
of Empire.</p>
            <p>And the Profeſſion of Phyſick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
neglected by the rude antient
<hi>Romans;</hi> yet with the increaſe of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42016:13"/>
Arts and Sciences, this noble
Faculty made a proportionable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in the eſteem of that then judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
people: and it hath ever ſince
been moſt honoured, and encouraged
in the moſt civilized thriving Nations
and Times; Neither was it ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded,
but where Barbariſm or Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
prevailed.</p>
            <p>So that, when I conſider, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
hath been paid to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and the Profeſſors thereof, in
all times whereof we have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account, I am amazed to find
that in this latter Age, wherein it hath
received a greater improvement than
in two Thouſand years before, and
daily makes a conſiderable and ſenſible
progreſs; that nevertheleſs it ſhould
be by many neglected, by others ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by ſome even contemned.
After a diligent enquiry into the cauſes
of ſo ſtrange and ſuddain an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I could not in my opinion ſo
juſtly aſcribe it to Defects in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42016:13"/>
as to thoſe of its Profeſſors.
Not that I deny Phyſick to have its
<hi>Deſiderata,</hi> for I believe it is capable
of receiving great improvements;
But howſoever, all this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it might to this Day have been
maintain'd at leaſt in the ſame degree
of honour and eſteem which all Ages
have juſtly had for it, if the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Real, ignorance and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the pretended, Artiſts had not
interpoſed. Under the former I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
the Phyſicians, under the latter
their Dependants the Apothecaries,
who I am confident have cauſed many
of the inconveniences, under which
the practice of Phyſick now labours;
and will occaſion others, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
whereof Phyſicians are (not
without reaſon) apprehenſive.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I ſhall hardly find credit
among ſuperficial obſervers, when I
affirm, that the greateſt enemies Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
or Phyſicians have at preſent, are
the Apothecaries, who ſhould be, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42016:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are thought to be their faſt friends; but
this Aſſertion will eaſily gain belief
with more diſcerning perſons, who
know that a falſe Friend is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
than an open Enemy: of which
the <hi>Italians</hi> are ſufficiently fenſible
when they deſire to be delivered from
their friends, they being always upon
their Guard againſt their profeſſed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.
And indeed it is much more
eaſie for any one, who is acquainted
with the thoughts, deſigns and affairs
of him, to whom he pretends friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to injure him in his Perſon, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
or blemiſh his Reputation, than
for another who is not privy to his
intentions, nor intruſted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of his affairs. Hence it is,
that Phyſicians cannot ſuſtain much
dammage from common Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers,
or Mountebanks; and that
they cannot promiſe themſelves the
ſame ſecurity from Apothecaries, will
appear ſo evident in the enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that every unprejudiced Reader
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42016:14"/>
will readily conclude Phyſicians were
either very facile, credulous, or elſe
extremely improvident, when they
committed ſo great a truſt to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
in whom they repoſed ſuch
confidence, that the ſhort-ſighted Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
were ſenſible of their danger before
they themſelves could imagine that,
thoſe whom they had ſo highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
would prove unfaithfull to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
and Phyſicians: But now they are
forced, though late, to acknowledge,
that the great Indulgence they ſhewed
to them, and their notorious abuſe of
privileges, wherewith had Phyſicians
been circumſpect, or ſuſpitious, they
had never been acquainted, have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
thoſe inconveniences, to which
they now endeavour to bring a timely
remedy. It is not without a great
deal of regret, that they are neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to proclaim the Crimes of thoſe
whom they have too much, too long
countenanced, too often vindicated;
and they ſtill retain to much kindneſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42016:15"/>
for them, that if a private oppoſition
could have reclaimed them, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
would never have uſed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and violent a remedy, as is the
expoſing their unworthy Principles and
Practices to the view of the World:
but ſince they are both ſo miſchievous,
that to conceal, would be to permit,
and allow them; and thereby to betray
their Patients, themſelves, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and Succeſſors, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forced to declare how much
themſelves, their Profeſſion, and the
Sick are injured by thoſe vile arts of
the Apothecaries, which we ſhall here
diſplay.</p>
            <p>It is well known they have great
pretences (how fair we ſhall ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine)
to the practice of Phyſick;
and are now arrived at that degree of
confidence (not to ſay worſe) that
they are not aſhamed to publiſh this
before all men, whom by moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
and illegitimate Artifices, they
endeavour to alienate from the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42016:15"/>
and aſſure to themſelves. And
beſides, they are not more fraudulent
in their Practice, than unfaithfull in
their preparations, few Phyſicians
having the ſatisfaction they deſire, and
it is fit they ſhould receive, that the
Medicines they preſcribe are prepared
after their direction; nothing being
more frequent than for the Apothecary
to employ bad Druggs, add, ſubſtract,
or ſubſtitute at pleaſure one Ingredient
inſtead of another. Now how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
theſe Actions are with the ends
of their Inſtitution, we deſire not to
be judges our ſelves, but appeal to all
that have the exerciſe of Reaſon; and
if after ſuch unpardonable abuſes, the
Phyſicians do not deſert them, and
make better proviſion for themſelves,
and their Patients, they would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the truſt repoſed in them,
betray their Profeſſion to the ſcorn of
the World, and themſelves ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
contemptible.</p>
            <p>But yet although the Phyſicians
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42016:16"/>
might with juſtice wholly reject the
Apothecaries, and are highly cenſured
by many for their forbearance; and
though the Apothecaries themſelves
have little regarded their frequent
Admonitions: yet ſuch is the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of thoſe generous perſons, that
they are determined once more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
them to entertain a ſenſe of their
Duty, and to return to that ſtate from
which they are degenerated. Its true
we have little hopes of their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
an almoſt infallible Symptom
of incorrigibleneſs, ſeeing their ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
reflections on Phyſicians in moſt
Companies, their entring into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with them, nay, ſometimes
preferring themſelves before them;
their Aſſociations, not to endeavour
the improving their Trade otherwiſe
than by the decay of Phyſicians, their
reſolution to ſtand by each other, and
keep the Ground they have got by
Treachery, reſolving with united
Counſels and Purſes to withſtand any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42016:16"/>
Reformation the Phyſicians ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
among them. Theſe are their
ordinary diſcourſes, and they do not
ſcruple to give them forth, even in the
preſence of ſober Phyſicians, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
certainly be blamed if they do ill
reſent ſuch unhandſome and ſo ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a Carriage. But Charity obliges
them to endeavour their amendment
rather than their inevitable ruin, which
they can when they pleaſe, effect by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
of their own Phyſick; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of which will be found ſo
great by the people (as we ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt)
that they would ſoon utterly
deſert the Apothecaries and leave them
in ſolitude to bewail their wretched
improvidence; who when they might
have had a comfortable and honeſt
ſubſiſtence neglected it, that they might
obtain a greater: though thereby many
lives were hazarded, moſt of their
Benefactors diſobliged; and how could
they expect that building ſhould be
laſting, whoſe foundation was laid in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42016:17"/>
blood, and ingratitude. Yet how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
ſoever matters of Fact are,
leaſt they ſhould pretend innocence, and
thence promiſe themſelves impunity,
we ſhall firſt declare their enormous
abuſes of Phyſicians and their Patients.
Secondly, lay down certain Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherewith if they comply, we
will oblige our ſelves yet to retain
them. Thirdly, if they refuſe to
ſubmit to ſuch reaſonable terms, we
ſhall acquaint the World with ſome
Methods whereby the Practice of
Phyſick can be more ſucceſsfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by Phyſicians without the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
than it can poſſibly be with
them, as they are now conſtituted.</p>
            <p>The grounds of our Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Apothecaries are theſe.</p>
            <p>That no Phyſicians can be certain,
Medicines are made up according to
their preſcription. So that after they
have taken much pains to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe,
to underſtand the cauſes of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42016:17"/>
diſtempers, and have duely delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what are likely to prove the moſt
proper remedies; which being judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
preſcribed, they promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that ſucceſs which uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
ſolid Counſel: but after all this
trouble, either from the deſign, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Careleſsneſs, or unfaithfulneſs
of the Apothecaries, they are often
fruſtrated, not ſo much to their own
prejudice (which yet is not inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
as to the Patients, which
ſhall be here demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Phyſicians are ſubject to ſuffer
from the malice or Deſign of Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries.
Now although Charity obliges
us to think well of all men, till their
actions diſcover them to be bad; yet
ſuch hath been the demeanour of the
Apothecaries towards the Phyſicians,
that they have reaſon to ſtand upon
their guard, and hazard as little with
them as they can. For ſome Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
having been, as they pretend,
highly diſobliged by Phyſicians (I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42016:18"/>
ſuppoſe, becauſe for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
they would not permit them
to injure their Patients by bad Phyſick)
what aſſurance can the Phyſician have,
that they do not meditate revenge; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſince, if they have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
they can execute it, and be
ſo far from being ſuſpected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they may make a great
advantage of their own miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.
(which indeed they often do)
As ſuppoſe a Phyſician with whom the
Apothecary is diſguſted, preſcribe a
Purge, the Apothecary may make
it with Worm-eaten ſuperannuated
Druggs, wherewith moſt of them are
well ſtored; which very probably will
not work according to the Phyſicians
promiſe, and the Patients expectation:
the Apothecary may be ready at hand
to tell him that this was no ways ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to his temper; nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he before-hand preſages to him,
that it will not work ſufficiently, (as
he may without Conjuring or Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42016:18"/>
whereby he obtains the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a perſon more judicious than
the Phyſician, and makes way for this
propoſition, That he will prepare a
purge for him which ſhall work more
effectually than the former. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is the ſame the Phyſician before
preſcribed, but aſſuredly made up of
better Druggs; and ſo the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
at once executes his malice, and
effects his deſign which is to exclude
the Phyſician, and introduce himſelf.
This is, indeed, a ſuppoſition, but I
fear ſuch as is often practiced; and
there are many Phyſicians who have
found it true to their coſt: yet theſe
are ſome of the more Innocent Cheats.
I wiſh we be not often expoſed to
others of worſe conſequence, than
a ſlight diſgrace of the Phyſician, and
abuſe of the Patient. Charity forbids
me to ſuſpect worſe than I know, but
what will not a diſhoneſt mind intent
on revenge or gain, ſcruple? howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I think it behoves Phyſicians to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42016:19"/>
take ſuch care, that they and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
lye not expoſed to the deſigns
of wicked Apothecaries; and that
there either are, or may be ſome ſuch,
they have reaſon at leaſt to fear, and
Conſequently provide, that they be not
injured by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing Phyſitians find
fault with, in many Apothecaries, is
their ignorance in the Latin Tongue,
which is of very ill Conſequence; for
Phyſicians, for good reaſons, not here
to be mentioned, have been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to write thoſe preſcripts, they
ſend to the Apothecaries, in Latin:
which not being rightly underſtood,
hath often occaſioned, not only inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
but alſo fatal miſtakes. And that a
great part of the Apothecaries are very
illiterate, is ſo evident that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
dare not deny it. Nay, I have
heard them often divert themſelves
with the miſtakes committed by the
younger Apothecaries at their Hall;
where it is the Cuſtom before they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42016:19"/>
make an Apprentice (that hath ſerved
ſeven, or eight or nine years) free of their
Company, to put him to conſtrue a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
bill, or ſomething in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;
which is the only mark of reſpect
they have left for Phyſicians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the
Probationer eſcapes this dangerous try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
he is admitted with great applauſe.
But I do not hear of any, whom they
exclude; and they have been highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at Phyſicians, excepting againſt
them: yet many by their own relations,
are guilty of groſs miſtakes; which
though they may be pleaſant to talk of,
yet are ſad and ſerious ones when they
come to coſt people their lives, or ſo
much as hazard them, which they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
do. This aſſertion I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
by an innumerable company of
inſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is ſcarce any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
who hath not been troubled with
ſeveral of them in his Practice. Now
if the Maſters themſelves are ſubject
to theſe miſcarriages, what can we
expect from the Servants, who we may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42016:20"/>
preſume are in every reſpect, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.
Theſe miſtakes are either of
one Material for another, or in the
Quantities of the Materials; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when Phyſicians write them at
length in Latin: for many of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
underſtand the numbers only
in figures, ſo that ſome of them know
little difference between <hi>Sexdecem
Sexaginta</hi> and <hi>Sexcenta;</hi> And of <hi>duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viginti</hi>
they will make at leaſt twice
twenty. And ſo for meaſures, ſometimes
miſtakes proceed from their ignorance
in the names of the <hi>Materia Medica.</hi>
Among many other inſtances of this
kind, That moſt unfortunate one recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by an eminent Phyſician, is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
Of an Apothecary, who inſtead
of a doſe of <hi>Mercurius Sublimatus
Dulcis,</hi> exhibited ſo much common
Sublimate, a mortal poyſon; which
was ſcarce ever given inwardly, inſtead
of an innocent Medicine, approved by
all Phyſicians. Sometimes they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
one operation for another, of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42016:20"/>
which I could give a large account; but
the mentioning of them will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
ſince every Phyſician is able to
make a fair Catalogue of them: and
there are not many Apothecaries whoſe
Conſciences will not at the mention of
this, reproach them with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of many ſuch miſtakes, the
meaneſt and moſt innocent, of which
cannot but be a great injury to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
and Patient. The firſt expects
his Medicines ſhould have ſuch Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as he might promiſe himſelf from
them, if rightly prepared; the other
waits for relief, which in theſe caſes is
uſually the effect of Counſel, rarely of
Chance: or if the miſcarriage prove
fortunate, which hath ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
the Patient is no more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Apothecary, than he was
to the Enemy that cured him of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Ulcer (under which he had long
languiſhed) by a thruſt with his Sword.
For as that ſalutary wound would have
proved mortal, if it had been in another
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42016:21"/>
place; ſo theſe lucky miſtakes might
be dangerous, if the Apothecary had
lighted on another Material: which
that he did not employ, cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
to his knowledge, Care or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,
whatſoever he may afterward
pretend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Complaint againſt the
Apothecaries, is, that they are not well
acquainted with the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi>
the knowledge whereof is an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
part of their Profeſſion: but take
the words of Druggiſts who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are ſometimes miſtaken, and
differ about the names of ſeveral
druggs; and which is worſe, they truſt to
Herb-women, who obtrude almoſt any
thing upon the greateſt part of them.
And that theſe women do often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
one thing for another, ſometimes
ignorantly, otherwhile deſignedly, is
well known to many Phyſicians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
have ſeen them ſell the Apothecaries,
herbs, roots, and ſeeds, under oher
names, than thoſe they do really bear.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42016:21"/>
I do not affirm this of them all, for I
am not Ignorant that ſome Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are good Herbariſts, whoſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
I cannot ſufficiently commend;
and our induſtrious Country-men, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon</hi>
and <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to whom we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
for their elaborate Herbals,
were Apothecaries: although they have
not wrote, eſpecially the former, with
that judgment which is requiſite, and
found in the writings of many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
from whom indeed they derive
the greateſt part of their knowledge,
as they themſelves acknowledge. But
the generality of Apothecaries are of
another humour, they will eat the
kernel, but give not themſelves the
trouble of cracking the ſhell; take no
pains to inform themſelves in thoſe
things which are abſolutely neceſſary
to the faithful diſcharge of their truſt,
many among them cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between Ingredients, noxious
and ſalutary: ſo, That we have not
Patients daily poyſened, is rather
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42016:22"/>
from the care of Herb-women, than
Apothecaries. Now Phyſicians depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
almoſt wholly on ſuch Vegetables
as our own Country affords for the cure
of Diſeaſes; which if rightly apply'd,
are more proper, cheap, fuller of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and efficacy, than thoſe that come
from remote parts (excepting a few
whoſe vertues are kept pretty entire) and
ſome of them ſpecificall for diſeaſes,
which others ſubſtituted in their place,
may exaſperate, though even they alſo
upon another occaſion may prove effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:
ſo that hence proceed many
inconveniences. The Patient is not
relieved, who perhaps might have
been perfectly reſtored to former
health; the Phyſician who would
thereby have acquired repute, is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
if not diſgraced: and which
is worſt of all, he diſtruſts;
nay, perhaps wholly rejects remedies,
commended in the books of experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Phyſicians, or communicated to
him by judicious faithful friends,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42016:22"/>
through the fault of the Apothecary,
which might have proved conducive to
promote the recovery of many ſick
people, who after languiſh all their
lives for want of ſome proper gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Medicine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Moſt of the Apothecaries truſt
to ſeveral for Compoſitions, in whom
(how charitable ſoever the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
may be) Phyſicians have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to confide. There is it ſeems a
great trade driven by many in this
City, of ſelling Medicines by whole-Sale.
One makes <hi>Treacle, Mithridate</hi>
or <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> in great quantities;
<hi>Unguent's</hi> Plaiſters, and what not: now
many of the Apothecaries can buy
ſuch Compoſitions cheaper of theſe
perſons, than they can prepare them for,
after the preſcription of the Colledge
in their Diſpenſatory. This is a good
thrifty courſe, but ſuppoſe a diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Phyſician (of which not without
Cauſe, there is a great number) ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
That theſe Compoſitions are not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42016:23"/>
made of ſound druggs, and other
choice Ingredients; eſpecially ſince
they afford them cheaper than other
honeſt men can make them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
theſe men for the moſt part are
not Apothecaries, or bred in that trade;
but Operators, who caſually have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up this way of living: ſo that their
skill as well as honeſty is liable to be
queſtioned. To theſe Objections the
Apothecaries readily anſwer, That
buying their Ingredients at the beſt
hand, and in Quantities, they have them
cheaper than thoſe that deal for ſmaller
parcels; and beſides they have ſome
peculiar knack in Compoſition, which
ſaves them much trouble and expenſe.
The firſt ſignifies ſomewhat, yet is not
a ſufficient anſwer; but of what kind
this latter ſhould be, an honeſt Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
that ſurmiſes no worſe of others
than he is conſcious of in himſelf, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily imagine. To expend ſixpence
leſs in fire in the making two hundred
or three hundred pound weight of Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42016:23"/>
or Unguent, is not very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
ſo neither is Expediteneſs or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
which at moſt cannot ſave much
more in the ſame quantity: ſo that what
this knack ſhould be, unleſs leaving cut
ſome of the moſt coſtly Ingredients, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
others in their room, or uſing
only ſuch as are periſhed and may be
procured at eaſiy rates, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
And that thus it is, I am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to believe, from what I my ſelf
have often obſerved in the Shops of the
Apothecaries among other abuſes, too
many to mention. They ordinarily vend
to thoſe that pay a price for the beſt
than can be made, <hi>Emplaſtrum Oxycro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceum
ſine croco;</hi> which in down right
Engliſh, is the Plaiſter of Saffron,
without a grain of that noble Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
from which it derives its name and
moſt of its Vertues: which for the
moſt part they borrow of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding
Plaſter-mongers. In ſhort,
moſt of the Plaiſters and Unguents of
the Shop, compared with thoſe that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42016:24"/>
are made by skilful and honeſt hands,
are ſo unlike, that they may be eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by the naked Eye, or ſome
other of the Senſes which argues a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
difference: but there is a much
greater and more ſenſible in their
effects, as hath been often experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And I have ſometimes heard ſome
curious Chyrurgions grievouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the Shop-traſh (they could
beſtow no better title on it) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that if they uſed the Unguents
and Plaiſters of the Apothecaries, their
employment would keep pace with
their cures, and be as little, as they
few; whereas preparing thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
they uſe themſelves, their ſucceſs
is conſpicuous, and their Patients nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.
If Phyſicians did in this i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
the Chyrurgions, they would
not have occaſion to complain ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as now they do; and that, I fear,
not without cauſe.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs this Subject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I take notice of an Obſervation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42016:24"/>
I have often made and admired at,
which is, that the Apothecaries who
are very tender of their Priviledges
(to give them their due) and who
pretend to have a Charter of large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
ſhould yet nevertheleſs permit
theſe Unguent and Plaiſter-ſellers to
follow that way of traffique; whom
yet they are ſo far from proſecuting
and diſſallowing, that on the contrary
they ſeem to approve of them by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Correſpondence with them, and
buying their Commodities. Now
what ſhould diſpoſe them to this ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
and forbearance, of which they
are not often guilty, I cannot imagine,
unleſs it be intereſt? Theſe perſons fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
them with thoſe Compoſitions
at ſuch eaſy rates, that I have my ſelf
over-heard ſome of them queſtion,
Whether they could poſſibly make
them faithfully, ſince the very Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
would coſt as much as the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
&amp;c. were ſold for? Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
is to me, a deep Myſtery: whether of
Iniquity, let others judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42016:25"/>
There is another Cuſtom among A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries,
whereof all Phyſicians do
not approve; that is, there are ſome
who make <hi>Mithridate,</hi> others <hi>Treacle,</hi>
a third <hi>Diaſcordium;</hi> perhaps one, all
theſe: another, that noble Preparation,
<hi>Pulvis è Chelis Cancrorum,</hi> commonly
known by the name of <hi>Gaſcoign's</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
others <hi>Alchermes, Lenitive Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Confectio Hamech;</hi> ſome, <hi>Syrups;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Cordial waters;</hi> and they drive a
trade of Exchanging with each other, it
being to be ſuppoſed, that making great
Quantities, they can ſell cheap: which
dealings render their Preparations ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to the Phyſitian, who often
finds theſe Medicines to be as bad as
they are cheap; and therefore moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the uſe of Preparations, if they
have not firſt an aſſurance that they are
made by the Apothecaries themſelves,
whoſe word we only have for it. But
let us ſuppoſe they do really make all
the Phyſick they diſpenſe, yet ſtill the
Sceptical Phyſician will not be ſatisfied,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42016:25"/>
having ſtill ſome ſcruples remaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which, I fear, will not be eaſily removed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is therefore objected by many
Phyſicians, who are ſomewhat more
concerned for the good of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
than the Apothecaries, as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That theſe in the Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Phyſick employ bad druggs,
and uſe ſuperannuated Medicines which
are fit for the dunghill, without any
previous Preparation; That if they
want any Simple or Compoſition that
is preſcribed, they ſubſtitute in its
place ſome other, which (in their
profound Judgments) they apprehend,
approaches neareſt thereto. Beſides
ſome of them have been found to add
to ſome preſcriptions, and ſubſtract
from others; One or the other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſuggeſtions of a petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
fancy. Theſe are grievous char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and deſerve to paſs a ſevere <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen,</hi>
That if true, ſome remedy may
be found againſt ſuch unpardonable
abuſes; or if falſe, that the innocent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42016:26"/>
may be acquitted, and the ſcandal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.
Its commonly ſaid, <hi>Vox po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,
Vox Dei:</hi> So that the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
being accuſed by both Phyſitians
and their Patients, it is to be feared they
are Criminal. But they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us the Teſtimonies of Phyſicians,
which they endeavour to render inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid;
for being Conſcious that they
have groſly abuſed them, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
theſe will unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them: therefore they are excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt, as intereſted perſons, and
their plea muſt not be allowed of. If
we appeal to events, and tell them of
perſons that have been, either manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
injured by bad Phyſick; when that
which was preſcribed, if it had been
duely prepared, would in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have given them great relief: or
if we mention others, on whom ſtrong
purging, vomiting, or ſweating Phyſick,
or ſuch, as if prepared after the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
preſcript, would have proved ſuch,
hath had little or no ſenſible Operation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42016:26"/>
when the ſame faithfully prepared by
other hands, or by the ſame, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
ſuperviſing, quickly diſplayed its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
according to his intention. All theſe
things they aſcribe to chance, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that when Phyſick hath not the
deſired or promiſed effect, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to excuſe his own defects, lays
the blame on Apothecaries, or bad
druggs. Since therefore we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from theſe ways of proof (which
yet no indifferent or unconcerned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
will deny us) nothing remains, but
that we accuſe them out of their own
mouths. I remember a great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
tells us, that if we would know
what actions are vitious, we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the Vulgar, whoſe Conſciences
force them generally to condemn what
is bad in others, if they have no concern
in the Action; for though they may
approve of it in themſelves, when they
apprehend, it's for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
yet they will endeavour ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
and excuſe it, that it may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42016:27"/>
in its native colour, but paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
under the notion of good, honeſt,
or convenient. This is verified in the
Apothecaries. There is no particular
perſon that will acknowledge himſelf
to be in the leaſt faulty, they all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prepare their Medicines; but if
we will give credit to what they ſay of
each other, we ſhall hear the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
for if the people urge againſt
them, as well they may, the dearneſs
of their Medicines (which frequently
happens) I have often heard them
reply, that they were faithfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;
and therefore deſerved a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
price than thoſe which others ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(its true) cheaper, becauſe they
were made with bad druggs, That ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
none, who had any reſpect for
their health, would grudge to give a
ſmall matter more, for good reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
than the worſt would coſt them:
thus they generally exclaim on each
other. And perhaps there are ſome
who apprehend that few of them are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42016:27"/>
wronged by theſe mutual Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But howſoever, either the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
are an envious, malicious ſort of
people, to traduce each other in affairs
of ſo great conſequence as thoſe
wherein the lives or welfare of many
thouſand men are at ſtake; or theſe
taccuſations are true: either of
which being allowed, muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render the Apothecaries unworthy
of any great truſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or actions. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I am inclined in this particular to
believe what the Apothecaries affirme
of each other, it being ſeconded by
common Fame, and the obſervation of
Phyſicians whoſe duty and intereſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
them to diſcover the intrigues
of a Profeſſion which hath ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
a dependence on them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as indeed
they on it.</p>
            <p>It were an endleſs task to enumerate
all the fraudulent tricks, which are
uſed by thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apothecaries who are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42016:28"/>
not Conſcientious; for ſome I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf there are, who keep
ſtrictly to the end of their Inſtitution,
the faithful and careful Preparation of
Medicines: but I fear theſe are ſo few,
that they are ſcarce obſerved in a
croud of men ſo bad, that to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to render them worſe then they
are, were to throw Ink in the Face of an
<hi>Aethiopian.</hi> And indeed I cannot ſay
worſe of them then barely to relate their
practices. I ſhall not take much notice
of their buying bad Druggs, which they
apprehend to be good, (and that they
are often over-reached ſeems not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to thoſe who have been much
converſant with many of them)
Theſe being miſtakes of Ignorance, and
therefore pardonable, ſo that I do not
more blame then pitty them; and if
many did not ſuffer for their unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I ſhould entertain a pure compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for them without an alloy of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or Animoſity. But there remains
other manner of miſcarriages than
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42016:28"/>
theſe, to be conſidered; and they are
not innocent miſtakes, but deſigned
cheats, and ſuch as not only the all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, but I hope man alſo will call
them to an account for: ſuch are ſome
of theſe. A great Copper <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick
at one Diſtillation (O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
accurtation) ſupplies a whole Shop
with ſimple waters; for it's but fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into a great quantity of Water in
the Stillatory a handful of twenty or
thirty ſorts of Herbs, as much of the
Water being drawn off as is thought
ſufficient, a due proportion is put into
each Glaſs with its title. Now 'tis
well known that moſt ſimple diſtilled
Waters have neither ſenſible ſmell,
nor taſte; and differ as to appearance
no more from each other than the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſalts of Plants, though we find both
them and theſe have ſomewhat (at
leaſt a few of them) different effects:
So that this cheat is not ſo eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,
as an unskilful perſon would
be apt to imagine. But to give our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42016:29"/>
Apothecary his due, I cannot ſay he
vends any of thoſe Waters, whereof
he hath not put a handful into the Still,
his Conſcience is not ſo large as to
permit him to impoſe ſo groſly on his
Patients; Nay, perhaps the Vertue
of each Herb keeps it ſelf diſtinct in
ſome portion of Water, without being
confounded with its neighbour, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chymical Liquors, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much ſhaken, each retires to the
ſtation aſſigned by thoſe various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Gravity and Levity Nature
or Art hath beſtowed on them; ſo
that the ſagacious Apothecary may
perhaps reſtore each Water to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Receptacle. But how poſſible ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this may ſeem, it doth not appear
very probable; and till it can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
we ſhall look upon this as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Practice, and ſuch as no Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
will diſpenſe with. The ſame
thread runs through many of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preparations, as in making Pectoral
Syrups, one made up with a handful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42016:29"/>
of each Ingredient ſerves for all. Some
after that they have extracted the beſt
of the tincture out of Saffron with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Wine, to make the extract and
ſpirit; then they pour more Spirit on
the remaining Dreggs, which being
ſtrongly expreſſed, the vinous Spirit is
a little tincted: and this is often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in the place of that noble
Tincture on which Phyſicians ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
depend too much, unleſs they
could have it better prepared.</p>
            <p>Another juſt cauſe of complaint the
Phyſicians have againſt the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
are their old Medicines; For
ſuppoſe them as faithfully prepared as
they can pretend, or we deſire: yet
length of time will make ſome changes
in them, which are not often improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Thus Syrups grow acid, and
Waters full of Mother; Electuaries,
and Pills dry, and deprived of their
moſt active parts; Powders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are not free from this fate,
whoſe vertues in time we find marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42016:30"/>
diminiſhed. But let the Phyſicians
inculcate this and much more to them,
they may with as good ſucceſs preach
to ſtone-walls; for not a Dram of any
Medicine will the Apothecaries part
with but for ſale: ſo that they many
times ſell their Preparations five or
ſix years after they were made; and
whether their Medicinal properties are
not much impaired, if they have any
left, we leave to others to determine.
And indeed the Apothecary hath many
things in his Shop which are not
called for in many moneths, yet theſe
muſt be vended with the reſt. All
which when they have loſt their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
ſhould they be rejected, it would
be much to the prejudice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries;
and they have a fundamental
Maxim, that no ſuch thing ſhould be
allowed of: for 'tis much better that
the Patient ſhould ſuffer ſomewhat in
his Body than the Apothecary in his
Eſtate. And if he injured by the bad
Phyſick he took, perhaps he will have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42016:30"/>
pitty on him, and the next Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be faithfully prepared; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he makes him abundant recompenſe
for the hurt he received by that which
was bad: and he himſelf makes an
advantage of both. Although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
if he had conſulted the Patient,
he would rather have choſen to keep
his Head ſound, than have it broken,
that a proper Plaſter might be applied
for the Cure. This is ſo notorious a
Truth that all the World, even their
beſt Friends exclaim againſt them for
it; and till they amend this among
many other Peccadilloes, the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
deſire to be excuſed that they ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to employ them.</p>
            <p>Another Property they have of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
one Ingredient for another,
which how pernicious a thing it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Apothecary were equal or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
to the Doctor in judgment, is
very apparent. This is a ſubject, on
which every Phyſician can expatiate;
but I omit it, not that 'tis leſs material
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42016:31"/>
than the others, but becauſe it is better
known: ſo that here to be particular were
as great a Soloeciſme as to carry Coals
to <hi>Caſtle;</hi> for I ſhould acquaint people,
eſpecially thoſe who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
with the practice of Phyſick
with nothing, which they were not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of long ſince. I ſhall therefore
wave this diſcourſe and proceed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
complaint againſt the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
which is,</p>
            <p>That Apothecaries and their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are ſo Careleſs, Slovingly, and
Slight in preparing of Diſpenſatory, or
preſcribed Medicines, that neither
Phyſicians or the Diſeaſed have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to repoſe that truſt in them which
they challenge as their due. As for
ſlovenlineſs they may I confeſs
plead the old Proverb; that, <hi>VVhat
the Eye ſees not, the Heart rues not.</hi> I
confeſs of all the reſt it may be beſt
diſpenſed with, but ſhould Patients
but once behold how their Phyſick was
prepared in ſome Shops, they would ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42016:31"/>
nauſeate it, that perhaps they would
undergo much, rather than take the
leaſt Doſe ſo ordered. But leſt I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
nice queaſie Stomachs, I ſhall
diſmiſs this Subject; and proceed to
another, which is the careleſneſs of
Apothecaries and their Apprentices: on
which I can never reflect without
Fear and Indignation; Indignation to
think what numbers have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
and injured by ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
Fear, leſt it ſhould be my own
misfortune to ſuffer in my Repute, and
in my Patients (for whom every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Phyſician is paſſionately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
abſtractedly from his own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt)
from the raſhneſs or careleſneſs
of ſome giddy Apprentice or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
Maſter. That this is not a
groundleſs apprehenſion many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
can witneſs; and you can converſe
with few perſons, who are not able to
give an account of ſome ſuch miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.
Now although in theſe caſes the
Patient is chiefly injured, yet it reflects
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42016:32"/>
alſo ſomewhat on the Phyſicians; if
for nothing elſe, yet that they imploy
perſons who are ſo little concerned for
that precious Merchandiſe, the Lives
of Men, that they will not be at the
expenſe of a litttle Care, Pains and
Trouble to ſecure them. In vain is it
for a Pilot to direct the courſe of a
Ship skilfully, if perſons ſhall make
leakes in it under Water; the Wiſdom
and Care of the Governour will not
bring them to their deſired Haven: but
even He with the Ship will ſuffer
Shipwrack in his reputation, eſpecially
if what was tranſacted in darkneſs be
not diſcovered; for then it will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that through his unskilfulneſs it
ſplit upon ſome Rock, ſtruck on ſome
Sand which might have been avoided.
Now if Phyſicians and their Patients
will not make proviſion againſt ſuch
Dangers, they have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
when they ſuffer; ſince it is
nothing but what they might eaſily
have remedied.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42016:32"/>
Now the laſt complaint of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
againſt the Apothecaries on the
account of their Medicines which I
ſhall mention, is their being moſt of
them ſtrangers to Chymiſtry, which
is no inconſiderable part of Pharmacy;
whoſe Preparations at leaſt many of
them are of great efficacy and come
frequently in uſe. It's true indeed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
were formerly very ſhy of theſe
Remedies, uſed them with great
caution, and that not without good
Reaſons; for although the Phyſicians
were ſatisfied, that being faithfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
they were endowed with great
Vertue: yet not being at leaſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to prepare them, and being
earneſtly admoniſhed by <hi>Helmont</hi> and
other eminent experienced Spagyriſts
not to truſt to Venal Medicines made
by common Operators, who for their
private gain ſcruple not to adulterate, as
indeed they ever did, and ſtill do, moſt
of their Medicines; Therefore thoſe
that conſulted the good and welfare of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42016:33"/>
their Patients, did rather wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
practice with thoſe Sophiſticated
Medicines than expoſe their Patients
to a manifeſt hazard. But of late
years Chymiſtry is again come into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
for Phyſicians curioſity prompting
them to prepare ſome particular Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
themſelves, others were beſtowed
on them by Perſons of Quality who
proſecuted Chymiſtry; only that they
might oblige the publick with uſeful
diſcoveries, eſpecially in Medicine, ſuch
as That Honourable Perſon Mr. <hi>Boyle:</hi>
and ſome few honeſt induſtrious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries
preparing others for
them, finding theſe Medicines of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
efficacy, they were ſo far from
decrying them (which ſome falſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
that they were of frequent
uſe among ſuch whoſe good fortune
it was to meet with theſe advantages.
Others making uſe of thoſe Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they had from unfaithful Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
or Mercenary Chymiſt, sand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they had ſeldom good, frequently
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42016:33"/>
ill effects, they cannot be blamed for
deſiſting from the uſe of what they
found attended with ſo bad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which how injurious it hath been
to the practice of Phyſick both in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Phyſician and the Patient,
will appear in the ſequel of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe.
Which that it may be more
diſtinct, I ſhall proceed after this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<hi>Firſt,</hi> Shew what Chymiſtry
is; and that its Medicines are of great
efficacy, and ſafe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That very
many Chymical Medicines ill prepared,
are dangerous, and cannot be ſafely uſed.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Apothecaries are not
furniſhed with ſuch Chymical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
as the Phyſicians can confide in. As
to the Firſt, we ſay that Chymiſtry is an
Art which teaches us how to divide bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
into ſeveral parts; and being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated,
to purifie and again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
them according to the pleaſure
of the Artiſt. Indeed according to the
vulgar acceptation of the word it is an
Art of making Gold and Silver out of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42016:34"/>
baſer Mettals; and that even ſome who
before had the repute of being wiſe,
have entertained ſuch favourable
thoughts of it. In this reſpect I am apt
enough to believe, having known many
Learned Mens hopes and expectations
ſwelled up to a high pitch by promiſing
experiments or fine-ſpun ſpeculations,
for which they were beholding to the
writings of ſome eminent Alchymiſts.
But ſuppoſing this to be an extravagant
Notion, and an abuſe of Chymiſtry; yet
the Art it ſelf is not therefore to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded,
It being acknowledged by all
Ingenuous unprejudiced Perſons that an
excellent uſe may be made thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as it diſcovers to us the Nature of
moſt Bodies expoſed to its <hi>Analyſis:</hi> and
in that by its means many Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
may be made, which encreaſe
our Knowledg of Nature and our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over her; ſo that at this day nothing
is in more eſteem with the greateſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
then Chymiſtry. But I ſhall
wave this vſe of it, as not pertinent to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42016:34"/>
our preſent diſcourſe; and proceed to
another, which is the preparing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Subjects in order to the rendring
them Noble Medicines. For in many
Bodies which are of great uſe in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
that Vertue which makes them
ſo, conſiſts in few Parts which by Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Art may be ſeparated from the
uſeleſs though greater Portion, and
further refined or exalted; and then
they do more freely, much ſooner, and
in leſs quantity diſplay their ſalutary
effects. Thus we ſee that a ſmall
quantity of a Vegetable Spirit made by
Fermentation or of Chymical Eſſential
Oyles, are a <hi>Compendium</hi> of a great
quantity of the Vegetables that afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, retaining exactly the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Odours and Taſts of their Mother
Plants; And a few drops of Spirit
of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> are more effectual than
ſome Ounces of the <hi>Horn</hi> any other way
prepared. We could inſtance in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other things which I omit deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brevity. There are alſo among
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42016:35"/>
Minerals, many Subjects which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
with excellent Medicinal Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties;
but they are moſt of them Noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
unprepared: and the uſeful part is
lockt up or cloſely united to the bad
from which it is not eaſily freed. Now
here Chymiſtry aſſiſts us, for by it we
are enabled to ſeparate the Pure from
the Impure, the Good from the Bad,
that which is of uſe from the more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
part, which would either have
none or ill effects. I will mention but
two Minerals which are acknowledged
by all, duly prepared, to afford noble
Remedies. They are <hi>Mercury</hi> and
<hi>Antimony. Mercury</hi> admits of various
Preparations, and there is not one of
theſe that are commonly known (as
for inſtance thoſe in our own <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory)</hi>
which faithfully prepared do not
anſwer many intentions of a judicious
Phyſician which could not be any other
way ſatisfied, Such are <hi>Mercurius dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,
Mineral Turbith,</hi> the red and other
Precipitates; and that not only in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42016:35"/>
diſtempers, for which alone they
were formerly in uſe; but alſo in many
other Chronical diſeaſes; which are
ſometimes cured by theſe, after they
have baffled many other promiſing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and Medicines. As for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
it is ſufficiently known, that ſcarce
any Vomits are preſcribed, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Europe</hi>
that are not prepared out of this noble
Mineral; which ordered after other
Methods is an Excellent and ſafe Purge,
working without gripes: and if
we proceed after another way we
may render <hi>Antimony Diaphoretick.</hi> As
in that which is commonly ſo called,
and in Mineral <hi>Bezoara</hi> Medicine highly
commended by thoſe who in the vogue
of the People have went for great Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts.
I might inſtance in <hi>Vitriol,
Lead, Tin, Iron, Silver,</hi> Many of
whoſe preparations have obtained
much Credit in the World: Such are
<hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Sugar</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> its aſtringent
and aperitive <hi>Crocus, Diaphoreticum
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42016:36"/>
Joviale, Sugar</hi> of <hi>Lead, Lunar</hi> Pills Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Oyle of <hi>Vitriol, Ens</hi> the <hi>Veneris</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> To theſe we may add ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Preparations of Vegetables and
Animals, as the Volatile Spirit, <hi>Salt,</hi>
Oyle and Balſom of <hi>Amber,</hi> Flowers
of <hi>Benzoin,</hi> the Cremor or Chryſtalls of
<hi>Tartar,</hi> its Spirit and Fixt <hi>Salts</hi> Refines of
<hi>Jalap,</hi> and <hi>Scammony,</hi> Extracts of <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,
Rhubarb,</hi> the fixed Salts of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Tincture of <hi>Saffron,</hi> and <hi>Castor,</hi> with
many others, which when duly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
are uſed very ſucceſs fully; and
therefore it is great pity every Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
cannot be ſupplied with ſuch of
theſe Preparations as he hath occaſion
to uſe: which he that conſults the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of his Patients dares not do, unleſs
he either prepares them himſelfe, for
which few have leaſure and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or receive them from perſons in
whom he can perfectly confide. For
Chymical Remedies though as Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
or any that are made, if prepared
by thoſe who are careful, skilfull and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42016:36"/>
honeſt are of more then ordinary vertue
and efficacy; Yet if by others of contrary
diſpoſitions, Nothing more pernicious:
The Conſideration whereof unfolds
that Riddle which hath puzled ſo many.
Whence it is that ſome ſober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Phyſicians do ſo highly exalt Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Remedies; and at the ſame time
others of candid Tempers as loudly
decry them: the one pretending that
they are uſually attended with good
effects: the other confidently pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
that either they have had bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
with them, or that they have proved
wholly ineffectual. The difference
may be eaſily reconciled, the one either
prepares himſelf, or ſuperviſes the
making of his own Medicines; the
other truſt to Apothecaries, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Chymiſts; whom I ſhall evince
in this particular to be as great cheats
as are now Extant in the World: and
do deſerve more ſevere puniſhment,
than thoſe that pick-pockets or rob on
the High way; for by theſe abuſes man
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42016:37"/>
only deprived of a ſmall part of his
eſtate; by thoſe ſometimes of life, often
of Health which is alwayes by their
Medicines extreamly hazarded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Third Place,</hi> I come therefore
to manifeſt that we ought not to truſt
the Apothecaries for Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
There are indeed ſome few that
are very skilful and curious in this kind,
whoſe care and induſtry deſerves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement;
but theſe are not many,
and are ſo obſcured by the far greater
number of thoſe that Act otherwiſe,
that they are ſcarcely viſible. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
(if I may ſo call almoſt the
whole company ſuch, without being
guilty of a Soloeciſm) are not inſtructed
in the very Rudiments of Chymiſtry:
many among them never ſaw a Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
glaſs or furnace, are wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the very names of the
operations; and yet theſe perſons are well
provided with all ſorts of Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
which they buy of the Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Chymiſts. Whom though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42016:37"/>
undiſpoſed to Sophiſticate their
Remedies, (to which I think them
naturally Marvellous prone) they
tempt to adulterate by offering them
ſuch low prizes, for which indeed they
cannot afford them, if Genuine and
Right; and have an handſome ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
out of the gain which certainly
their Labour and induſtry deſerves:
Yet theſe cheap prized Medicines are
retailed by the Apothecaries at unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
rates, at leaſt ſix times the value
they coſt them. Now what truſt there
is to be had in the Venal Chymiſts will
appear by the enſuing account, which
I proteſt is moſt true and faithful, being
free from any other deſigne than that
of having ſuch enormous abuſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed.</p>
            <p>Since Chymiſtry came into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
it hath been ſubſervient, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Medicine, but alſo to Trades;
and hath found employment for many
ſearching buſie heads: ſome of which
engage therein only, that they may
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42016:38"/>
gratifie an unbounded Curioſity, by
obſerving an infinite variety of changes
in the Subject they expoſe to the action
of Fire, and Solvents, delighting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
greatly in the contemplation of
the Cauſes of thoſe pretty appearances:
Others promiſe to themſelves Golden
Mountains, either from the general
great work as they ſtyle it, or from
ſome particular Lucriferous Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.
Now they that are intent
on any of theſe, make uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Materials which are ordinarily
vended by a ſort of men, whoſe ſole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
it is to prepare them. And
we know by ſad experience, that the
greateſt part of Mankind are not acted
by Principles of Reaſon, Honeſty, or
Religion, it being Intereſt which
ſwayes moſt; few regarding how it
fares with the Publick, ſo that they
thrive in their private Concerns. Theſe
Operators therefore having ready vent
for their Preparations, they contrive
the cheapeſt Methods of preparing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42016:38"/>
them, not regarding how injurious
they are to the Sick, and thoſe that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe
their Medicines; or to thoſe
curious Perſons who deal in nice Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments:
which differences in the ſame
Materials do often exceedingly vary,
theſe unworthy Selfiſh People being
highly ſatisfied, if the Subſtance, they
vend, reſemble the Genuine in all ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
properties. Now thoſe that are well
acquainted with Chymiſtry, know that
moſt of the ordinary Preparations
which are the Grounds or Ingredients
of others, may be variouſly prepared;
and yet all of them approach ſo near
unto the true, that the moſt judicious
Eye, Noſe, or Palate, cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between them.</p>
            <p>As for inſtance, There is no Venal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
comes more in uſe than Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
made of <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make <hi>Mercurius Dulcis, Butter</hi>
of <hi>Antimony,</hi> in order to Mineral, and
Jovial <hi>Bezoard<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ca,</hi> That Precipitate of
it, which is abuſively called <hi>Mercurius
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42016:39"/>
Vitae,</hi> or liquid Emetick Remedies; And
yet it is too well known that this is often
Sophiſticated by ſublimation with <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick:</hi>
and certainly we cannot expect, that
Remedies wherein this is an Ingredient,
can be very innocent. There are ſo many
other known Methods of preparing
<hi>Sublimate</hi> amiſs; which yet ſhall be no
leſs fair to ſight than the beſt, that it
is to me a greater wonder we have any
good, than that we have ſo much, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
by vile Impoſtors and covetous
Operators. Some only Re-ſublime
common Sublimate twice or thrice,
and then vend it for that famed harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Remedy <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
almoſt as Inſipid as that; which
whether it doth exactly emulate in
internal as it doth in ſenſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
I leave to Experience to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
But this is none of the moſt
profitable <hi>Succedanea,</hi> Therefore many
only diſſolve the <hi>Mercury</hi> in Common
<hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> or other Corroſive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors;
which abſtracted from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42016:39"/>
that being ſublimed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
is ſaid to be <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> and
ſold for ſuch, and it may be ſo: but
yet ſuch Preparations are (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reaſon) liable to ſuſpicion, It
not being adviſable to permit proceſſes
of this nature to be varied at pleaſure
by any Ignorant, Conceited, Covetous
Operator; for although the Medicines
may poſſibly prove more effectual than
when prepared after the common Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
yet I fear they are often ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
noxious. And this perhaps is the
occaſion of ſo many miſcarriages in the
uſe of the Shop-Chymical Remedies;
which prepared after the uſual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
would have diſplayed ſalutary,
rather than ſuch pernicious effects. I am
unwilling to diſcover more of theſe
fraudulent tricks, leſt I ſhould inform
ſome of them, whom a happy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
only hath kept from putting them
in execution: yet the Sophiſtication
of the Cremor, or Cryſtals of <hi>Tartar</hi>
(which come ſo frequently in uſe)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42016:40"/>
with <hi>Alom,</hi> and the vending common
<hi>Copperas</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Vitriol</hi> for the <hi>Salt</hi>
or <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Steel</hi> are ſuch notorious
Cheats that I cannot but mention
them. And to paſs over the reſt,
Chymical Eſſential Oyls which are ſo
often Sophiſticated, that I never met
with any Venal which was not ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and my skilful Friends have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
complained to me that they
never found, any ſincere unmixed
Chymical Oyl, in the Shops either of
the Druggiſts, Chymiſts, or Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries.
I remember that formerly I
made many of thoſe which were of
daily uſe in Medicine, keeping ſome
parcels by me; that comparing them
with the Venal Oyls, I might learn
whether I was impoſed on. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution
was thus far uſeful to me, as it
inſtructed me that unleſs I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
my Patient, I ought not to make
uſe of any of theſe Oyls; unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
me by my own Laboratory, or
by Friends in whom I could abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42016:40"/>
confide: Thoſe which We, and the
Apothecaries, or Druggiſts borrow
of the Chymiſts enjoying little of the
Taſte, and leſs of the Vertues of thoſe
Subjects, out of which they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be Extracted, being uſually
mixed with a far greater portion of the
Oyls of <hi>Turpentine, Spike,</hi> or rotten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
<hi>Limons,</hi> of which as I and others
have obſerved many of the Chymiſts
make great quantities. Which recals
into my mind what once happened to
me: Having occaſion once to buy a
great number of <hi>Limons,</hi> I enquired of
the Merchant how he diſpoſed of thoſe
that were rotten, and unſound; who
Anſwered me, that nothing was loſt,
the Chymiſts and Apothecaries buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all that refuſe Traſh which he
could not otherwayes vend, to make
Oyls and Syrups<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which did not a little
confirm me in my ſuſpicions of their
unworthy Practices. And ſurely ſuch
as theſe I have mentioned, will deter
thoſe Phyſicians that have any reſpect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42016:41"/>
for their Patient's Health and own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
from truſting to thoſe Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Shops, which the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
have of Mercenary Chymiſts, or
Common Operators.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe theſe Chymical vulgar
Medicines are prepared with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
care and honeſty, there are beſides
them, many noble Remedies, which do
as much exceed them, as they, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Syrups, or Electuaries; ſuch are
thoſe which great Chymiſts call the
leſſer <hi>Arcana,</hi> The greater being it ſeems
no leſs then their renowned Elixir, the
Univerſal Medicine, and the Alkaheſt or
great Solvent which they affirm many
have actually poſſeſſed. How true this
latter aſſertion is makes not for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
But as for what concerns the
former, I my ſelfe can affirm it. Theſe
generous Remedies have been hitherto
induſtriouſly concealed by their Poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
from the Apothecaries and common
Chymiſts, knowing that they would
make a prepoſterous uſe of them; but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42016:41"/>
ſhould Phyſicians put themſelves in a
Method that they can have any Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Preparation, which ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them, faithfully and skilfully
prepared, they would ſoon be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
which would be much to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
both of the Phyſician and Patient,
they being more ſure and ſudden in
their Operation than any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
and are of much greater extent,
one ſingle Remedy often curing many
diſeaſes that have any affinity with
each other. Such are the Eſſences of
Plants made by the union of their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirits, Eſſential <hi>Oyles,</hi> and fixed
<hi>Salts,</hi> Volatile <hi>Salt,</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
Tincture of <hi>Corals,</hi> Eſſences of
<hi>Pearles,</hi> and <hi>Crabs Eyes, Baſilius Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus</hi>'s
Tincture of <hi>Antimony,</hi> his
Mineral <hi>Bezoar, Tinctura Lilii, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s
<hi>Elixir Proprietatatis,</hi> his <hi>Laudanum,</hi>
his <hi>Aroph,</hi> the Volatile Spirit of <hi>Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol,</hi>
the Anodine Sulphur of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> its
Eſſential <hi>Oyle</hi> the Tincture of <hi>Gold: &amp;c.</hi>
All which I have ſeen, and can witneſs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42016:42"/>
that they have had extraordinary effects:
And there are many ſuch or better in
the hands of diſcreet Perſons, who are
nothing ſo reſerved and invidious as the
generality of Chymiſts (how deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I know not) are taxed to be. For
I have heard ſeveral of them, perſons
of great note and honour, profeſs their
readineſs to communicate what they
know in this kind, to any Society of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Induſtrious Phyſicians that would
oblige themſelves to uſe, as they ſee
occaſion in their Practice, ſuch noble
Remedies as they will direct them to
prepare. Now is it reaſonable Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould neglect theſe advantages of
improving their faculty, only to gratify
an ingrateful, idle, careleſs generation,
by whom they and their Patients are ſo
highly injured that no Perſons who have
any ſenſe of Honour or Honeſty can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
truſt them, till they give ſufficient
teſtimony of their Reformation: which
what it is, ſhall be anon mentioned.
Another Remedy may be applyed, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42016:42"/>
which perhaps were moſt adviſable,
that is, for Phyſicians to prepare their
own Phyſick, whether Chymical or
what is commonly called <hi>Galenical:</hi>
but of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Another thing the Phyſicians deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
blame in the Apothecaries, is
their enhauncing the Prizes of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
ſo much above what they might
in Reaſon expect; about which the
Phyſician doth not ſo much concern
himſelf, becauſe it hath a bad influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on him: as on the account of
his Patient; though certainly if Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
were more modeſt in the Prizing
their Phyſick, the Patient could be more
liberal to the Phyſician. Whereas on the
contrary the Apothecary holds them at
ſuch unreaſonable rates that in moſt
courſes of Phyſick, he gains more then
his Maſter, how deſervedly let others
determine; though in my Opinion were
their pay proportionated to their care
and honeſty, I doubt they would gain
little beſides ſhame and reproaches.
But the Apothecaries Bills muſt be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42016:43"/>
paid without abatement; otherwiſe
there ſhall be more clamour than if
twenty Phyſicians went unpaid: but
with how much regret they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
almoſt every Phyſician can
witneſs, moſt of them being daily
troubled by their Patients with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of their Apothecary, which
it is not in their power to redreſs.
Now ſeveral things contribute to, or
are the occaſional Cauſes of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
Grievance: The Number,
Pride, or Covetouſneſs of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries;
and that prizes are not ſet on
their Medicines.</p>
            <p>For Apothecaries, the Phyſicians
procuring it being reduced into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were at firſt few; and therefore
having full employment could afford
their Medicines at moderate prizes:
but being ſince that time increaſed to a
great number, each perſon bringing up
two, three or more, That imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was before in a few hands
became more diſperſed; ſo that a very
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42016:43"/>
ſmall portion thereof falls to the ſhare
of ſome; and indeed very few of them,
have more than they can manage.</p>
            <p>Now the Sick muſt maintain all theſe,
for although there be no occaſion for a
Sixth-part; Yet they muſt all live
handſomly, as thoſe that account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Phyſicians Fellows: to ſupply
which Expenſe they have no other way
than to exalt the prizes of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;
and ſtil the leſs they are employ'd
the higher they muſt prize them: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they could not poſſibly ſubſiſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they become Phyſicians and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
as well as prepare, to which
practices they are not only propenſe but
are initiated in them, as we ſhall ſee
in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now would it not be much better, if
it were with us as in ſome parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many?</hi>
Where the Magiſtrates of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cities, and I think Territories, agree
upon a certain number of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſo many as they can apprehend
are neceſſary, all the reſt being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42016:44"/>
and muſt either ſeek other ſeats,
or be content for a ſmall Salary to
work under thoſe that are allowed.
The number of the Apothecaries thus
limited, is beneficial to themſelves in
that they never want imployment; and
to the Patient, who for the ſame reaſon
hath his Phyſick at cheaper rates. I
hope ſo manifeſt an advantage will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
us to imitate them which would
not only be a great eaſe to the Patient;
but alſo ſhould be deſired by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
themſelves if they conſulted
their own Intereſt. For if the future
increaſe of their number bear any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to what is already added therto
ſince they were Conſtituted a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
the Phyſician need not oppoſe
them, they muſt neceſſarily fall of
themſelves; unleſs they meet with ſome
Extraordinary ſupport which cannot
be at Preſent foreſeen nay ſcarcely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined:
but they are ſo intent on their
private gain that I do them an injury in
propoſing to them the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42016:44"/>
or of their Company, eſpecially
when it will diminiſh their preſent
profit. Therefore, ſince here is ſo little
<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that they will reform themſelves,
others muſt take upon them that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and ingratefull task; and next to
the Magiſtrate I know not who are
more capable of this than the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
as will be ſeen when we come
to the Remedies which ſhall be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in order to the prevention of this
and other inconveniences, of which they
are the Cauſes</p>
            <p>Another bad Property the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
have, is their Inſinuating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things to the prejudice of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Phyſician among their Patients;
to whom the Apothecary endears
himſelf by the frequent acceſs he hath
to them, and ſome little pieces of
Officiouſneſs, as applying of Bliſters
Leeches, Plaſters, or ſome ſuch trivial
buſineſs, which might be as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by any Nurſe that is uſed to
attend Sick people: ſo that a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42016:45"/>
whoſe Name and Intereſt is not
very conſiderable, is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
at their Mercy; which is ſuch,
that he may reſt aſſured if he be a
ſtranger to the Patient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or have not
ſo great an Intereſt in him as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary,
and if this have no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
dependance on him, that if he
be never ſo little diſtaſted, he will
employ all his Skill and Intereſt to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
him in the Opinion of his Patient,
and Introduce Himſelfe or another
Phyſician that ſhall be more compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
in his ſtead. Now one thing which
touches an Apothecary to the Quick,
is Detracting, as they call it, from
the goodneſs of their Medicines (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
how ſpeaking truth ſhould be
Detraction, I underſtand not) againſt
which no exception muſt be made,
though the Patients Lives lye at ſtake;
Another cauſe of their diſpleaſure is,
if they are reproved for ſetting immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Prizes on their Medicines: or
which amounts to the ſame thing (I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42016:45"/>
mean the leſſning of their Gain) if
the Phyſician preſcribes a few Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;
and thoſe either commonly
known to be cheap, and eſpecially if
he gives the Patients Directions to
make their own Phyſick, as if it be the
Decoction or Infuſion of a Simple or
two: or if he cures them by a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Diet. For by this means, little
Profit coming to the Apothecary,
you cannot blame him that he thinks
himſelf highly injured, or affronted,
and ſeeks to be Revenged on that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Phyſician, who prefers the
Good of the Patient before the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Apothecary. Whereupon he
ſuggeſts to the Patient, that this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
is a Man of mean Parts, of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Knowledge, of little Repute;
that the Things he preſcribed are very
Slight, and altogether unlikely to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
what the Phyſician deſignes; that
if he would be adviſed by him, ſome
other Phyſician ſhould be conſulted,
which yet is not very frequent: for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42016:46"/>
they do moſt of them redeem Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
of impoſing themſelves on the
Patient, who certainly makes a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exchange when he parts with a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Judicious Phyſician for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
Daring, Empty, Bragadocio
Apothecary.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration brings to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
another particular, which
is the laſt complaint we ſhall make of
Apothecaries; and that is their taking
on them the Practice of Phyſick, <hi>Quis
Credet haec?</hi> It will ſeem hardly Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
to Sober, Judicious people
that have not obſerved the courſe
of the World: and I confeſs it
amazes me when I behold a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of ſuch Ignorant perſons, dare
at ſo great an Undertaking. I
wonder, Firſt, how they had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
to attempt it; and having
made ſo fair an Eſſay, that they did not
Clandeſtinely manage thoſe unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Practices, creep into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Oblige to Secrecie: But to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42016:46"/>
commit all this in the face of the Sun,
when Challenged, be ſo far from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
and Retracting that they ſhould
publiquely avow, acknowledge, and
Glory in their ſhame, is a piece of
Inſolence that I could never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
a Society of men ſhould ever
have been guilty of. That a private
man ſhould ſo far degenerate, is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
thing; but this is the firſt Rank
of men that ever in <hi>England</hi> did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
revolt from their Maſters, and
greateſt Benefactors; and they are
indeed ſo rare an example, that they
deſerve to be Regiſtred in the black
Catalogue, if not of Perfidious, yet
at leaſt of Ingrateful Perſons, from
whence without ſome general Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation, their names
will never be Cancelled.</p>
            <p>But amongſt all theſe Prodigies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth more excite my Admiration,
than the conſideration tht anay Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
dare confide in them, for whence
can it be imagined they ſhould derive

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:42016:48"/>
this Skill, to which they are ſuch high
pretenders, That eſpecially the more
antient among them, boldly affirm they
have many advantages over young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
Phyſicians, and ſtand on
even ground with the elder. Did ever
thoſe Phyſicians that were a means of
conſtituting them a Company, and
procuring for them ſuch Priviledges,
ſuſpect that in the ſame Century, ſome
of their own Profeſſion ſhould be
forced to take Pen in Hand and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Controverſie, whether They
or the Apothecaries are more fit for
the Practice of Phyſick? One would
think this ſhould be like thoſe common
Notions which are ſaid to be Imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Minds of all men, As that
the Whole is more than the Part, &amp;c.
ſo methinks every Man that is asked of
the Queſtion in hand, who underſtands
what Phyſicians, and what Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
commonly are, ſhould as eaſily
determin which is fitted for, and
which ought to be excluded from
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42016:48"/>
Practice, as to tell us that One and
Two makes three; or that if we add
equal parts to equal they are ſtill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.
But leſt we ſhould be thought
to Aſſume rather then Prove, or it be
Objected that we are Precarious in
our aſſertions, we ſhall give this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
a fair debate; and then we ſhall
manifeſt the unworthy Artifices that
Apothecaries uſe to depretiate and
exclude the Phyſicians, to introduce,
and ingratiate themſelves.</p>
            <p>As for what refers to the firſt,
Apothecaries have this to plead for
themſelves. <q>That it is unreaſonable
to deny them the liberty of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
who underſtand the Symptoms,
and Cures of Diſeaſes; if not as well
as ſome Phyſicians, yet better then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
at leaſt than the young and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.
They have been preſent at
the Death, and Recovery of many
Patients; and therefore have had
Opportunity to obſerve the courſe of
the Diſtempers, and procedures of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42016:49"/>
Phyſicians: That they have kept ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Diaries of theſe Tranſactions,
What Medicines the Phyſician pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
eſpecially if they proved
ſuccesful: That they want nothing of
a Doctor but the bare title: That
they are not deſtitute of this, amongſt
the people, the moſt competent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
who if they were not ſatisfied
with their Abilities and Succeſs, ſurely
they would not ſalute them by that
Name, which is conferred by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
rather upon thoſe who
have read Books than cured Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Not to anſwer to theſe frivolous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations,
that on the account of ſome
of theſe pretenſions old Wives, or
Nurſes, and others, Farriers and
Smiths, may pretend to the Name or
Thing they are ſo ambitious of: Nor
to tell them which is moſt certainly
true, That the knowledge they derive
from Doctors Preſcripts is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and fallacious: it being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42016:49"/>
impoſſible for the beſt Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to calculate a Medicine that ſhall be
proper for all that are, or ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any one Diſeaſe; unleſs he were
Poſſeſſor of the <hi>Univerſal Remedy,</hi> So
great in the variety of Complexions,
ſo many are the complications of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
and ſo infinite are the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Circumſtances: all which the
Judicious Phyſician attends to, and
which few Apothecaries are capable
of Comprehending. The former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commonly men of more ſmart,
piercing, natural Parts; and their
Brains farther refined, purged from
Prejudices, and well furniſhed with
excellent, clear, and diſtinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of things, for which they are
beholding to an excellent Education:
ſo that notwithſtanding I have heard
ſeveral of the Apothecaries confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(not to ſay impudently) affirm they
were ſo throughly acquainted with
ſuch mens Practice, naming ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Phyſicians, that if they knew
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42016:50"/>
the Caſe, they would lay a Wager
they did exactly Predict before they
took Pen in Hand what they would
Preſcribe; when to my knowledge
there is not ſo much difference between
a ſhallow River and the profoundeſt
Sea, as between theſe empty, light
Fellows and thoſe Grave admired
Phyſicians, whoſe depths ſuch light
Shittle-Cocks, Cork and Feathers, are
ſo unlike to ſound, that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty that they are made
to penetrate the very Superficies. In
ſhort, to compare them with ſober,
judicious Phyſicians, is as prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as to parallel the faint glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of an expiring Candle with the
beauty and luſter of the Sun in its
Noon-day Glory. But we ſhall more
clearly and diſtinctly perceive the vaſt
difference between them, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them both with the Idea of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine;
and ſee which is the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have it imprinted in their Minds,
and diſplay it in their Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42016:50"/>
The deſign of the Phyſician, ought
to be the preſervation of Health and
cure of Diſeaſes. The Preſervation of
Health is beſt effected by a regular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
and the due uſe of thoſe things
which are called Non-naturals; to
which may be added ſome ſmall matter
of Phyſick when there is a ſlight
propenſion to a diſeaſe rather than a
Diſeaſe formed. Now in this Part
certainly the Phyſician is more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
than the Apothecary, being
bred a Philoſopher; and muſt therefore
probably (or he is much to blame)
underſtand more of the Nature and
properties of Meats and Drinks, of Air,
Sleeping and Waking, Exerciſes, and
Paſſions of the Mind, than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
who never addicted himſelf to
theſe enquiries. Then as for the Cure
of Diſeaſes, it ſeems highly probable
that they who are beſt acquainted with
the Cauſes and Symptomes of Diſeaſes,
will apply Medicines more properly
than others that cannot ſo well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42016:51"/>
although poſſeſſed of the ſame
Remedies. But we will wave this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it would be very proper for our
preſent purpoſe; and examine which
are beſt furniſhed with Methods and
Medicines in order to the Cure of
Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>Diſeaſes are removed, either by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
Specificks, <hi>Arcana,</hi> chiefly Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical;
or by a Practice mixed of Two
or more of theſe. That Cure by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
which doth not interfere with the
other by ſpecificks, is when by Vertue
of Medicines that have a Senſible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
ſuch are Vomits, Purges, Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Sweating, Diuretick, veſicating,
Cordial Anodyne and Narcotick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
(with the helps of Phlebotomy
&amp;c.) uſed in ſuch a Method as the
Phyſician apprehends moſt proper, the
Diſeaſes are removed. And that moſt
Diſtempers might be Radically or
Perfectly Cured by theſe judiciouſly
preſcribed without either ſpecificks or
Chymical <hi>Arcana,</hi> I am ſo far from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42016:51"/>
Doubting that I could name ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Phyſicians, who have eminently
ſignalized themſelves only by Method.
But then theſe (and indeed whoſoever
inſiſts in this way muſt be ſuch) were
Men of moſt quick apprehenſions Solid
Judgements, knew when, what, how
much, and in what order to preſcribe,
a little miſtake hazarding the Patients
Life in acute Diſtempers, either in over,
or under doing; and how fit a Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained,
Careleſs or Ignorant Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie
is for this Practice, is eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned.</p>
            <p>As for Specificks by which we mean
ſuch Simples as being appropriated
to a Diſeaſe, cure without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Operation; probably by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ill texture of the Morbous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into another more innocent and leſs
incongruous with thoſe parts which
before were extreamly diſaffected
thereby. Now the great queſtion is,
how Phyſicians come by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of theſe admirable Properties.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42016:52"/>
Surely they have it not by natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
much leſs can any pretend to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſpiration. I am not ignorant that
ſome talk of a <hi>Medicina Adepta,</hi> but the
boldeſt and moſt talkative Apothecary
I ever yet met with, had not the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Pretenſions to it; and no wonder
for till they leave off their fraudulent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Practices, of all men I know in
the world, they have the leaſt Reaſon
to expect revelations in this kind, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
there were ſuch. Well then,
ſince there are no other means beſides,
Phyſicians muſt derive this knowledge
from Communication, either of living
or dead Phyſicians; or from their own
Experience and Obſervations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I believe they are not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to the writings of thoſe that
preceded them: wherein yet this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is ſo ſcattered, that great Labour,
Induſtry and Sagacity muſt be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before any Phyſician can arrive to
an ability of Curing moſt Diſtempers
by means of Specificks. Now that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42016:52"/>
Apothecaries are like to be Poſſeſſors
of this Treaſure, will appear very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
If we conſider that they do
not trouble themſelves to ſearch any
other Records than they themſelves
have made of Phyſicians, Preſcripts; and
beſides they are great Enemies of
Cures by Specificks, becauſe that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they perſonate the Doctors:
yet their gain comes in by the Trade of
an Apothecary, which this way of Cure
doth much impair. And therefore by
their good-will they would neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of it in others, nor practice it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
if they were able; from which
they are ſo remote, that al the Phyſicians
in <hi>England,</hi> can hardly beat it into moſt
of their heads, that any thing ſhould
effect a Cure without Evacuating ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
the Material Cauſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe:
and therefore they deal chiefly
in Purges, Vomits, &amp;c. And how ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
they manage theſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we ſhall hereafter make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42016:53"/>
A third courſe whereby Diſeaſes are
ſaid to be cured, are Chymical <hi>Arcana:</hi>
Such were the <hi>Mercurius Diaphoreticus</hi>
of <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelfus,</hi> the <hi>Ignis</hi> or
<hi>Sulphur Veneris,</hi> the highly exalted
Tincture of <hi>Gold,</hi> the Mineral <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and other great Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
which thoſe renowned Chymiſts,
<hi>B. Valentinus, R. Lully, R. Bacon, Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
Helmont</hi> and Others were ſaid to
have had in their Poſſeſſion; and to have
uſed with incredible Succeſs. Theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Remedies curing without any Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
(beſides ordinary Diſeaſes)
thoſe that had then the Repute of being
incurable: ſuch were the <hi>Gout; Dropſie,
Stone, Leproſie,</hi> and other formidable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers.
It is not my intention at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſpend time in inquiring after
the truth of this Tradition, whether
theſe Perſons were actually poſſeſſed of
theſe Remedies, and whether by their
means they effected ſuch great Cures:
Or whether ſuch Medicines may be
procured. I ſhall only inſiſt on this that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42016:53"/>
if any of them can be obtained by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Skill, and Induſtry, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
are much more like to be poſſeſſed
of them than Apothecaries, triffling
Chymiſts, or mean Operators. Many
of them having been long converſant
with Chymical Operations, and having
<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot ſpared for any expence of Money,
Time, or Trouble, are now ſo
throughly acquainted with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Art; and have rendred
Nature ſo familiar, that they deſign few
things which they do not effect: and
I can ſay from my own Knowledge
that the Productions of their Furnaces,
have been as conſiderable as of any ſort
of Men whatſoever that do publickly
appear in the World. So that if there
be any thing in Chymiſtry uſeful and
noble, what ſhould hinder their bidding
fair for the poſſeſſion thereof? Beſides,
there are many Antient, and Younger
Phyſicians who dayly ingage in theſe
Enquiries; and the whole Colledge of
Phyſicians is ſo concerned for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42016:54"/>
this uſefull part or appennage
of Medicine, that they do intend pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
to promote it by aſſociated
endeavours. And notwithſtanding what
hath been ſaid to the contrary, I am
Confident there is not a Society of men
in <hi>Europe</hi> more conſiderable; not only
for that knowledge which we owe to
Books, for their inſight into Philoſophy,
Skill in Anatomy, and all Natural
Hiſtory which is allowed by moſt: but
even for an intimate acquaintance with
Chymiſtry, which though ſome have
denyed them, yet how unjuſtly the
World will be ſoon (if it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
convinced.</p>
            <p>Now it remains that we diſcourſe
of the Fourth and laſt way of Practice,
which we ſaid was compoſed of thoſe
already mentioned, and indeed this
is the moſt frequent; for, although I
know there are ſome few, who confine
themſelves to that which I call ſtrict
Method, others to Cure by Specificks,
a Third ſort who only uſe Chymical
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42016:54"/>
Medicines, which they are pleaſed to
dignifie with the glorious Title of
<hi>Arcana</hi> (although I fear they are far
from being ſo) and perhaps there
may be ſome Perſons in the World,
who have thoſe that are really ſuch;
yet I have obſerved that the generality
of ſober judicious Phyſicians, compoſe
out of all theſe a Practice which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
ſomewhat of every one: yet ſo,
that Medicines which have a ſenſible
Operation, Specificks and Chymical
Remedies, have all a ſubſerviency to
Method, that is, they obſerve a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
order in the uſe of all theſe, which
is ſo advantageous, that inverted or
tranſpoſed, they have not the ſame
effect. Thus perhaps firſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſome general evacuations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Body being freed from impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
the Stomach after ſtrengthned
with digeſtives, the Vital Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated
by Cordials or a Regular
Diet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Specificks then eaſily perfect
the Cure, which perhaps would be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42016:55"/>
compleat neither without them, nor
with them only, without the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
helps. Now he that hath but
half an Eye muſt neceſſarily diſcern,
that much of judgment, much of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
is requiſite in theſe Caſes; and
indeed ſo much, that it is well known
many (and I hope that it may be
affirmed of moſt) Phyſicians, make
a Hiſtory of the Patients condition,
or Caſe: and then after due Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all circumſtances, determine
to proceed after a certain Method from
which they do not recede without
great occaſion given them, as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
of ſome accidents, which
Humane, Wiſdom, and Care, could
neither ſoreſee, nor prevent. Now
how Apothecaries, or indeed any
others that have not a ſolid Judgment,
quick Apprehenſion, and fixed inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
Mind, can ſuſtain ſo much
labour be capacitated for ſo great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
I cannot imagine. And
they that know them did never ſuſpect
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42016:55"/>
they would give themſelves ſo much
trouble to obtain what they can
purchaſe at a cheaper rate. For they
deſign not ſo much the doing good, as
that the People ſhould entertain an
opinion that they do it, which is no
hard matter to arrive at, being in this
like <hi>Machiavel's</hi> Politician (though in
other things ſilly enough) who is to
make a profeſſion of Vertue and Piety;
but not to be really ſo, for many
things will be ſwallowed that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
under the pretence of Vertue
and Piety, by unwary, well-meaning
People, who are not apt to ſuſpect
others becauſe free from Deſigns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
whereas a ſtrict profeſſion of
Religion and Vertue will hinder the
Politician from doing many things
which might prove highly advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to him. The Parallel is eaſie and
obvious. Beſides, as it is eaſie to obtain
an Opinion of Vertue or Piety, but to
be really and truly Vertuous, requires
much Sweat and great diligence; ſo it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42016:56"/>
is with Learning, nothing being more
eaſie then to impoſe on the incautious,
credulous Vulgar, who believes he
knows moſt, who makes the largeſt
profeſſion. And at this the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are excellent; good ſucceſs ſo
rarely anticipating their promiſes, that
I ſcarcely ever heard ſuch a thing
happen'd; but how devoid they are
of ſolid Knowledge, how free from
Care, and empty of Skill, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is requiſite for the making
good their pretences, is ſo well known
to them that dive into the depth of
their ſilly intrigues: and they are ſo
numerous, that it is needleſs to repeat
what is imprinted on ſo many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall now proceed to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
and deſcant on the particulars,
wherein the Phyſician ſeems to have
ſome advantages over the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
and indeed all other whom Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and a good Education have not
fitted for ſo great an employment.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42016:56"/>
1. It ſeems very probable that
Diſeaſes will be better cured by
them that are acquainted with the
Frame and Fabrick of Man in his ſound
Conſtitution, with the Nature and
Properties of the Humors and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Body, that underſtand
(which they chiefly do by Analogy
from what they have obſerved without
Man) how theſe are depraved and
perverted, What was the Occaſion,
or Inſtrument. Whereby certainly they
may neerly conjecture what is moſt
fit to oppoſe the cauſe of theſe Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
and to remove their Effects.
This is no new Notion, it having been
the perſwaſion of former, and later
Ages, That the Phyſician is to begin
where the Philoſopher ends; And
that the Phyſicians have made great
advantages of Experiments and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
is moſt evident from their
own confeſſion: but chiefly manifeſted
in many of thoſe Noble productions
of their Brains, which will perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42016:57"/>
their Names, and oblige all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
that ſhall ſucceed them. Of how
great uſe was that admirable Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Harvie</hi>'s concerning the Blood's
Circulation? and, What great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
may we derive from the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Pecquet, Gliſſon, Ent, Wharton,
Bartholine, Willis, Needham, Lower,</hi>
and other excellent Anatomiſts?
Some have gained to themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Renown by their voluminous,
yet judicious Hiſtories of Plants,
Animals, and Minerals; and indeed
Natural Hiſtory, and Philoſophy have
been ſcarcely cultivated by any beſides
Phyſicians: who were ſo conſiderable
that the deſervedly admired <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi>
not long before his death, was
deeply engaged in the ſtudy of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
Chymiſtry, and other appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of Medicine; deſigning all his
Philoſophical toyl, only for the good
and benefit of Man; intending to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
his later time in the inveſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Nature of Diſeaſes, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42016:57"/>
their Cures. Neither did a high Birth,
and Quality, an Excellent Education,
a plentiful Eſtate, and great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
diſpoſe that Noble Experimental
Philoſopher Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
above the Profeſſion of Phyſick;
which cannot be queſtioned, after he
hath given ſo publique a teſtimony, as
the accepting a degree therein, freely
proffered him by one of the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Univerſities in <hi>Europe:</hi> whoſe
expectations he hath not deceived, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ever ſince applied himſelf to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
that noble Faculty, with ſuch
ſucceſs, that notwithſtanding what
ſome few in their miſtaken Zeal urge
to the contrary, it is well known that
moſt acknowledge themſelves highly
obliged to him for what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
publiſhed; and wait not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Impatience for what he hath
promiſed in the ſame kind. And how
great advantages a Phyſician skilled
in Philoſophy hath over others, He
hath ſo clearly, and copiouſly evinced
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42016:58"/>
in many parts of thoſe excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes
concerning the uſefulneſs of
Experimental Philoſophy, (to which
I refer the Reader) that he hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me a Labour of ſaying more
on that Subject, which would be only
a Recapitulation of what he hath
there at large delivered, and which
will be better underſtood in his own
words; and probably make a deeper
impreſſion than any thing I can add.
So that now nothing remains for me
to do, but to draw this Corollary,
That till Apothecaries become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Philoſophers its very probable that
there will be better Phyſicians: but to
proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not unlikely that they who
in their cures attend to the Age, Sex,
ſtrength of the Patient, time of the
Year, their Conſtitution or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
Antipathies or Averſions,
Diſeaſes preceding in them or their
Parents, and the preſent Complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Diſeaſes (for they are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42016:58"/>
ſolitary) that they, I ſay, who
attend to thoſe Circumſtances, ſhould
be more ſuccesful in their Cures than
thoſe that have little regard of them;
for whatſoever the Apothecaries think,
the Phyſicians are of the mind that
all theſe are material, if not neceſſary
to the Cure of Diſeaſes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Apothecary not hearing the
Phyſician enquire after all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
himſelf alſo neglects them; Yet
nevertheleſs the Phyſician conſiders
them, having ſuch a habit that he doth it
intuitively rather than diſcurſively, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if he were formerly with the
Patient: but the Apothecary looks on
this as work of Supererogation, and
thinks 'tis only to pleaſe and humour
the Sick, and perſwade them of their
care. But that this ſurmiſe is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
rather on Ignorance than Sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we ſhall now manifeſt. To avoid
Prolixity I ſhall inſtance only in one
particular, and that is the Complication
of Diſeaſes; about which the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42016:59"/>
is (not without juſt cauſe)
marvellouſly ſolicitous. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this is ſo nice a Speculation, that
it ſometimes almoſt puzzles the moſt
perſpicacious Phyſicians; and is far out
of the <hi>Apothecarie</hi>'s Ken, who yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
he can ſee into a Milſtone as
far as another man, and ſo he may:
but in this caſe it is with the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and Apothecary, as 'tis ſaid to be
with two perſons diverſly qualified
looking into a Magical Glaſs; where
the one ſees a great variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and the other nothing but a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Glaſs, and will not believe
but what the other ſees is by the help
of Imagination's Spectacles; which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
how true ſoever it may be in
that caſe, is not in this. Or, (to
make a compariſon leſs liable to be
cenſured) It is with Apothecaries and
Phyſicians as with two Perſons that
contemplate the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> or milky way,
the one with his naked Eye, the other
by the aſſiſtance of a Teleſcope; That
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42016:59"/>
to the former ſeems only a confuſed
white cloud, which to him who veiws
it through his Tube appears to be a
great company of Stars: which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
little leſs diſtinctly, than he doth
by his Unarmed Eye, thoſe that are
moſt conſpicuous among that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Company, wherewith the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
aremoſt gloriouſly beſpangled. But
that I may render this more manifeſt, I
will deſcend to particulars, and ſhew
firſt that there is frequently if not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
a Complication of Diſtempers in
the Diſeaſed. Secondly, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
are not often ſenſible thereof.</p>
            <p>It hath been judiciouſly obſerved
by <hi>Piſo, Bontius</hi> and others that in
<hi>Braſile,</hi> &amp;c. where their way of
living is moſt ſimple, the Temper
of their Air conſtant, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
much, and their hereditary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
few; That their Diſeaſes
alſo are few, and ſhort, for the moſt
part ſimple (being ſcarcely ever
complicated) ſeldom dangerous, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42016:60"/>
Criſis certain and viſible, ſo that they
rarely dye, except of Accident, or
old age: wheras on the contrary, in
theſe <hi>Northern Regions</hi> our Diſeaſes
are many and various, Criſis uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and oft-times ſcarcely ſenſible;
and which I chiefly aim at, Diſeaſes
are variouſly complicated. And indeed
how can it poſſibly be otherwiſe when
we are generally very irregular in our
Diet; ſo that I know not whether we
are more injured by the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or ill Qualities of the food we
live on: When we ſometimes too
much indulge our ſelves in ſleep, at
other times allow our ſelves too little,
and that at unſeaſonable times, when
we lead for the moſt part ſedentary
lives, exerciſing either too little, or
immoderately; not to ſay how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
ſome are in their Paſſions,
and inſatiate in their Luſts: beſides
the Air in which we breath is
as uncertain as the Winds that blow
which ſuddenly changes from heat to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42016:60"/>
cold, moiſture to dryneſs; and on
the contrary, cannot but leave ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
behind them, to which we
may add Hereditary Diſtempers.
For what is more frequent than for
weakly diſeaſed Parents to be further
tormented by ſeeing their Children
labour under the ſame Infirmities;
which are either rivitted into the
Principles of their Conſtitution, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in with their milk: from which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
they are hardly, if ever freed.
Now any one of all theſe is ſufficient
to change the nature of a Diſeaſe,
which in their abſence would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in a much different form: So that
there being in moſt of thoſe who are
ſurprized with any diſtemper eſpecially
<hi>Acute</hi> a <hi>previous,</hi> ill <hi>Diatheſis,</hi> or
Conſtitution of the Blood, a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ferment in the Stomach, and theſe
very various, we muſt apply our ſelves
after different methods to cure Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which ſpring from different cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Thus for inſtance in <hi>Feavers,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42016:61"/>
Agues,</hi> and many other Diſtempers,
it is not ſufficient to remove their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional
Cauſe, and to allay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
commotion of the Blood;
but he that will approve himſelf a true
Phyſician muſt (in a great meaſure at
leaſt) free the Patient from that ill
habit of Body, which exaſperated
the former Diſtemper, and diſpoſes
ſtill to the ſame, or worſe. For when
the Blood is depauperated or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
oppreſſed by more numerous
Saline, or Earthy parts, on every light
occaſion the whole Body is diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and indeed the great skill of a
Phyſician is ſeen in the cure of Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Diſeaſes, which is too far out of
an Apothecaries reach: that although
I have made ſtrict enquiry, I ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſs, I never heard of any one cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by them. If then they are unable
to cure Chronical Diſeaſes, which are
thoſe that chiefly reign in <hi>England;</hi>
and if they are abſolutely unfit to deal
with any acute Diſtempers where
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42016:61"/>
there is any Complication, Why are
they allowed to practice Phyſick? With
which if they muſt be converſant,
let them addict themſelves to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Corns, and drawing of Teeth,
which do reſemble the cure of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and that may perhaps in ſome
meaſure gratifie their petulant Fancy
at a cheaper rate by ſpoiling a part, than
hazarding the whole, which is now
their daily practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is no inconſiderable part
of a Phyſician's Office, to know when
nothing is to be done, but the whole
matter committed to Nature, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
ſuperviſing, and taking care to
correct all Nature's aberrations; and if
there be occaſion, to give her ſome little
aſſiſtance. For Diſeaſes ſeize on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in whom Nature is ſo ſtrong that
after ſome conflicts the Aggreſſor is
expelled without any aſſiſtance from
Phyſick, according to the Aphoriſm
of <hi>Hippocrates: Naturae ſunt morborum
Medicatrices.</hi> Whereas ſhould a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42016:62"/>
in theſe caſes adminiſter any
active Medicines, or make uſe of other
pretended helps (ſuppoſe Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)
unleſs by his great Sagacity, or
the obviouſneſs of the Diſtempers
cauſe, he applyes a Remedy very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
(for which there is yet little occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
We cannot imagine otherwiſe, than
that Nature being weakened by evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or diverted from her uſual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
by Medicines; which if not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated,
will rather diſorder or debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate
than bring relief, in the interim
the diſtempers will proceed by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
degrees and at length may become
ſo powerful, that Nature with the help
of the moſt generous Remedies cannot
prevail: where if She had not been
unſeaſonably weakened or diverted She
would have obtained an eaſy Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>As for Example there is a well-known
Diſeaſe, wherewith Children
are as frequently afflicted, as by <hi>Agues</hi>
or the <hi>Rickets;</hi> which ſoone deprives
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42016:62"/>
the poore Infants of their colour;
makes them loſe their appetite; they
ſleep little, and that unquietly; they
will be exceeding Thirſty, Froward
or Peeviſh, and ſeem to have greivous
ſick or fainting fits: and after they
have long laboured under this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
they have uſually great ſwellings
or hardneſs of the Belly, and are ſo
emaciated that they ſeem not much
unlike to little Skeletons; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all theſe threatning
Symptoms I have ſeldome, if ever,
known Children miſcarry who were
forbidden the uſe of Phyſick till freed
from moſt of them (for they vaniſh of
themſelves) and then gently purged for
a few dayes ſucceſſively, they not only
recovered their former health but have
often given me occaſion to diſpute with
my ſelf, whether they were not rather
better than worſe for the diſtemper
thus managed. Whereas on the contrary
others that have been diſordered and
weakened by evacuations, Cordials, or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42016:63"/>
fuges, appointed by the Apothecaries
or other unskilfull practicioners, (who
are very ready to preſcribe and Impoſe
Phyſick on theſe occaſions) although
to appearance they are freed from their
troubleſome companion; yet withall
ſoon after, many exchange this life for
a better: and thoſe that ſurvive, are
uſually weakly, more ſubject to Rickets,
Convulſions, and other Diſtempers,
than thoſe in whom the Diſeaſe was
permitted quietly to take its courſe
without interruption. The ſame hath
alſo been obſerved in elder Perſons
labouring under Quartain <hi>Agues.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it without a great deal of trouble
that Phyſicians obſerve ſo many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
of acute ſimple Feavers, who
committing themſelves to the care of
Apothecaries, and rather unskilful
pretenders to Medicine, often receive
diſpatches out of this World, by
Food, or Phyſick prepoſterouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered,
rather than from their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
which will appear evident to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42016:63"/>
them who conſider that a Feaver is
uſually Natures Inſtrument, or an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition
of the Blood, cauſed by the
Vital Principle, in order to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
of ſome ſubſtance mixt with
the Blood, or other Humors in the
Body: whoſe preſence perverts Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
regular actions, and thereupon
is oppoſed by thoſe active parts,
through whoſe mediation She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes
her operations. Now in moſt
of thoſe conflicts Nature would be
victorious, ſubdue or expel her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
Enemy; if She were recruited
ſparingly with the liquid part of Her
ordinary and daily ſupply: and be not
diverted by groſs Food, whoſe digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
while the Spirits attend the Morbous
matter, exceeding the remainder in
quantity or energy, may gain great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
either by vitiating the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
or by reducing the Humors to
their own Nature by a depraved Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the Stomach wanting Spirits
copious enough to aſſiſt it in digeſting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42016:64"/>
the Food, diſmiſſes it crude: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf diſaffected, imparts thereto
ſome noxious qualities, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
communicated to the Blood,
whoſe impurities it thereby encreaſes,
extreamly hazarding, and ſometimes
over-powring the Principle of Life.
The ſame happens by Medicines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable
to the Diſtemper, or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
exhibited; as if in the height
of a Feaver one ſhould adviſe to hot
Medicines, whereby more Fuel is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Fire, and the Diſeaſe
rendered more formidable and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
of cure than ever: or if in the
declination of the ſame Diſtemper,
when the Patient ſhould be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Cordials, and relieved by Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
whereby the Criſis, or ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the peccant matter is moſt
certainly and eaſily affected; if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of theſe refrigerating Medicines,
<hi>Juleps, Clyſters,</hi> or other Coolers which
weaken the Blood, depreſs the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and diſable Nature for her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42016:64"/>
ſeparation, whereby the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper
runs into a Diuturnity, and if
Life chance to be ſecured for the
preſent, howſoever the Patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
weak: and without great regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
or exact obſervation of Diet,
Exerciſe, and the other Non-Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
will become ſubiect to ſome
Chronical Diſtempers, whether <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
Scorbute, Dropſie, Jaundice,
Scyrrhus, Tumors,</hi> or <hi>Ulcers,</hi> which
frequently ſucceed acute diſeaſes, ill
managed, and are ſeldome perfectly
removed; at leaſt not by the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
who were the occaſion of theſe,
and are daily of many other Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
when they are conſulted about
Perſons who would recover without
the uſe of any, or with the help of
little Phyſick. But as it is above their
skill to know what Perſons are thus
affected, ſo it is contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to manage them aright; and
therefore they neither can, nor will do
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42016:65"/>
it. That they cannot, the faithful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
or Deſcription we have given
of them will render ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;
That they will not, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
believed, if we conſider that this
way of proceeding would diminiſh
their Profit, which they do by no means
approve, but will rather charitably
obtrude ſtore of Phyſick on all their
Patients: and that ſometimes ſo much
to their prejudice, that they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hire them at a dearer rate to be leſs
officious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Oftentimes perſons ſeem to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
under ſeveral Diſeaſes, when
as really the whole Tragedy is acted
by the ſame peccant matter, which is
either tranſlated from one part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and affecting them after different
manners, the Symptoms are various
and their Denominations different:
or from differences in Age, Sex, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
habit of body, Complexion or
Conſtitution, Strength of the Patient,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42016:65"/>
Seaſon of the year, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Matter which hath the ſame
Nature and Properties, may diverſly
affect the Perſons thus diſcriminated;
alſo according to Quantity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the ſame Qualities it may
diverſly affect the body: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
occaſion different Symptoms,
which to the Unwary or Unskilful
ſeem diſtinct Diſeaſes, when as it is
but one and the ſame matter variouſly
diſplaying it ſelf; and which may be
removed or otherwiſe diſpoſed of by
one and the ſame Method or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
            <p>Thus for inſtance a great number
of Diſeaſes are cauſed by the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Acidities, which acid noxious
juyce being mortified, all thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
effects of its preſence ceaſe.
Many Diſeaſes there are which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the obſtruction of ſome
part, ſuch are <hi>Apoplexy's, Lethargy's,
Carus, Catalepſia, Gutta Serena, Palſy's,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42016:66"/>
&amp;c. Now thoſe Methods and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
which will cure the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and dangerous of theſe, will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail to remove the reſt. The
ſame happens in <hi>Convulſions, Epilepſy,
Madneſs, Hyſterical and Hypochondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Paſſions, Vertiginous Affections, and
Melancholy,</hi> &amp;c. We alſo daily obſerve
that many violent Fluxes, wherein the
blood or other humours have the ſame
cauſe and cure, all which proceed
moſtly from ſharpneſs, thinneſs, or
heat of the blood, are removed by
Medicines anſwering the Indications of
cooling, dulcifying or incraſſating. Some
of the Diſeaſes thus cured, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Fluxes in Women, ſpitting
and vomiting of blood, Periodical,
or other copious Evacuations thereof
at the Noſe, <hi>Haemorrhoids,</hi> with the
Urine, or by Stool in the Flux, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Hepaticas,</hi> and <hi>Dyſenteries;</hi>
to which we may add ſeveral ſorts of
<hi>Diarrhea's, fluor albus, incontinentia
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42016:66"/>
Urinae,</hi> much Spitting, Weeping, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryza,</hi>
and Rheumes, of divers kinds.
Further, moſt ſimple, continued and
intermittent <hi>Feavours</hi> have very nearly
the ſame way of Cure; although the
Body ſeems diverſly affected by them:
an evident Argument that their cauſes
are little different. We might inſtance
in Colical, and Iliack pains, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other torments in the Stomach and
Bowels, which ſeem to have their
riſe from the ſame Cauſes, and have
almoſt the ſame Cure; Nay to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ſtill higher, What Analogy
doth there ſeem to be between the
<hi>Palſie</hi> and the <hi>Colick?</hi> yet this often
degenerates into that which alſo many
other Diſeaſes do; whereof I could
give a large account: but ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to a more convenient Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We might proceed to ſhew how
great an affinity, there is between ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
outward affections in their Cauſes
and Cures: But becauſe the care of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42016:67"/>
ſuch Diſeaſes is denied by ſome to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Phyſicians; and becauſe the
Apothecaries do ſcarcely ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
with the Chyrurgeons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
(which yet it is much leſs
intricate then the Phyſicians) I ſhall
paſs over this Ponſideration.</p>
            <p>Thus we have given a ſuperficial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of thoſe opportunities judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Phyſicians have to diſcriminate
themſelves from ignorant pretenders,
by their diſcerning with great Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Sagacity, how to act where
all theſe are allwayes grievouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
and often perfectly confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
as is manifeſt in their wayes of
proceeding, which are uſually ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
and Irrational that they would
give intelligent Phyſicians a full and
pleaſant Divertiſement, if they could
Indulge themſelves therein: which
they can by no means do, where their
Errours and Miſcarriages are ſo far
from Innocent, that they do often
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42016:67"/>
exceedingly hazard, and ſometimes
occaſion the Miſery, or Deſtruction
of the unhappy credulous Patient.
Which ſad accidents diſpoſe thoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Phyſicians, they neglected,
rather to Pitty and Compaſſion than
to diſport themſelves, or look with
Malicious Smiles on misfortunes; which
they in ſome meaſure deſerved, for
being guilty of ſo egregious a piece
of folly, as committing themſelves
to Ignorant, and Unskilful Practicio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
altogether unfit for ſo great a
truſt. And indeed it will excite Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
in any judicious Perſon to
obſerve what a Wild-Gooſe-Chaſe
they go in moſt of the Caſes we lately
mentioned: ſometimes applying a
Remedy they have learned is proper
for the Head-ach, then another for the
Tooth, Stomach, or Heart-ach,
Gripes, Flux, heats in the Head,
and burning in the habit of the Body,
<hi>Vartigo Asthma,</hi> and other ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42016:68"/>
of Diſtempers which one and the
ſame matter will often occaſion. Now
the Sagacious Phyſician ſoon deteſts
this Cheat, and immediately by a
ſtroke or two at the root, intercepts
the depraved Nouriſhment; ſo that
all the other ill effects ceaſe with the
removal of their cauſe: whereas ſhould
he only attend to every particular ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
as the leſs diſcerning do, there
would be no end, either of Phyſick
or the Diſeaſe, which, 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
will receive a great aggravation
by ſo many improper Remedies. For
Phyſick is, or ought to be active; and
if not appropriated to the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
it muſt neceſſarily work an effect
contrary to that for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
ſo that if it do not abate of the
Diſeaſe, 'tis more than likely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
it, if it do not ſtrengthen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
actually, or conſequentially; I mean
by removing Impediments, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
weaken Her.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:42016:68"/>
               <head>V. It ſeems moſt evident,
That many Diſeaſes may be Cured
by a convenient Diet.</head>
               <p>AND if this be ſo great a truth
as Phyſitians have hitherto ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
eſteemed it to be, then he that
is acquainted with the Nature of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the Proceſs of Nutrition,
will probably cure Diſeaſes with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
certainty and leſs trouble to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
than him that is utterly ignorant
of both theſe: And who is more like to
be a Poſſeſſor of this knowledge, than
a judicious learned Phyſitian? For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He underſtands the Nature of
Aliments, whether Animal or Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
he knows that ſuch among
them as are moſt temperate, and have
no ſenſible Operation are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to the body, and nouriſh
more than others which abound with
active parts, whoſe Purging Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42016:69"/>
Sweating, Diuretick, or other
Qualities, render them unfit for Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.
As alſo, that moſt, if not all
things that are uſed for food, although
they be not active in ſo high a degree
as others which come commonly in
uſe for Medicine, that yet they often
cauſe great alterations in the body,
according to the quantity, quality,
right, or unſutable application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and find that the Cauſe and Cure
of many, if not moſt Diſeaſes, have
their dependance on a good and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
or a bad inordinate Diet. But
this will be made more evident by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to particulars. I think nothing
can be more plain and evident, than
that Onions, Shalutes, Horſe-radiſh,
Capers, Olives, Broom-buds, Pepper,
Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Salt, Sugar, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Vinegar, Wine, and Oyl, are active
alterative ſubſtances; and yet they are
often taken alone, or variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to make ſavory picquant
Sauces which are ſuppoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42016:69"/>
digeſtion by rendring the food
more grateful, and by ſtrengthning the
ferment of the ſtomach. But beſides
theſe there are many Vegetables which
come frequently in uſe among all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in ſome Countres with
Bread, Cheeſe, and Milk are almoſt
their only food, ſuch are Melons, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
Cucumbers, as alſo Turneps,
Carrots, Parſnips, Skirrets, Radiſhes,
Peaſe, Beans, Artichocks, and other
Thiſtles, Aſparagus, Hop-tops, Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages,
Coleworts, Cauleflowers,
Comfry, Lettuce, Purſlain, Parſly,
Sage, Leeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (not to mention va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinds of fruits) Theſe are either
boyled, or eaten crude; alone, or
variouſly compounded according to
pleaſure, being rendred more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
or as is thought wholeſome, by
the addition of Butter, Vineger, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or other of the mentioned active
ſubſtances. I ſhall not inſiſt on the
great difference that there is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and qualities, between Fleſh
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42016:70"/>
and Fiſh, the variety of both being
unimaginable; eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the various wayes of preparing
them for food, and the additaments
that are uſed to render them more
agreeable to the Palate: Concerning
which Phyſitians have wrote intire
Volumns. Now the body partaking
of the nature of the Aliments (which
I ſuppoſe no one will deny, or if they
ſhould, I could demonſtrate it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
experiments and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations)
They having ſuch various
qualities, and there being ſo great a
variety in the complexions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of men, it will neceſſarily
follow, that ſome of thoſe Aliments
may be contrary to a good ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of body; &amp; if a perſon indulge
himſelf much in the uſe of them, his
health will by degrees be impaired,
and a bad texture or diſpoſition of
blood ſuperinduced, which would
have been prevented: and if recent,
eaſily removed by ſutable nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42016:70"/>
eſpecially if this regular good
Diet be long continued.</p>
               <p>Now the Phyſitian being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any other perſon acquainted
with the properties of moſt things
that are commonly eaten, and with
the temper of his Patient, can teach
him what to eat, and which to avoid;
what will prove beneficial to him,
which are hurtful. Beſides, he gives
him ſome general Rules in reference
to Diet, yet not ſo ſtrict and ſevere, but
that they may be eaſily without any
trouble or inconvenience obſerved.
Theſe Rules may reſpect men either
in a Healthful, Neutral, or Diſeaſed
ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a man in Health, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
preſcribes him not any ſet time
or hours whercin he ſhould take his
repaſts, only that he ſhould not eat
another plentiful meal, till what he
eat before be well digeſted, and paſſed
out of his ſtomach. Then for the
Quality of his food, that it be ſuch as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42016:71"/>
is moſt agreeable to his conſtitution
and imployment; a groſs food being
moſt ſutable to thoſe that are of a
ſtrong robuſt, a more fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to ſuch as have a more ſpare and
weakly complexion: he allows them
alſo ſuch food as being long accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to, they find agreeable to them,
there being Idioſyncracies or peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities
in ſome men, whereby ſome
food agrees well with them, which
would be noxious to others ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the ſame conſtitution. As for
Quantity, that they ſhould eat only ſo
much as abates, not gluts their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
and after which they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
rather more than leſs lightſome
than they were before eating: That its
better to eat little and often, than much
and at once; that as near as they can,
they keep to an equality for ſubſtance,
not quantity, making allowances for
meats that have little nouriſhment,
as ſubſtracting from what are very
nutritive, as Swines fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42016:71"/>
if they live temperately, to exceed
once or twice in a month in eating
and drinking their ordinary ſtint,
which is found to promote perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the great preſerver of health, and
enables the ſtomach to bear any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
overcharge, there being few
perſons that can at all times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
their Appetites; and ſuch a
ſurpluſage is dangerous to thoſe that
have long obſerved exactly a regular
Diet, not varying the quantity of their
food. Then laſtly for Order, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
that they ſhould not eat imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after any great exerciſe of
body or mind, and that they avoid
all thoſe things which hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
or diſtribution of the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and uſe whatſoever promotes
it. Some ſuch general rules as theſe
obſerved (abating hereditary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
Diſeaſes which yet are in a
great meaſure prevented by an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diet, and are leſs dangerous when
we lapſe into them) will keep them
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42016:72"/>
in perfect health: For then the food
will be readily converted into good
chyle, which conveyed into the veins,
the blood not being overcharged with
quantity, and the food being before
well prepared and opened by the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſtomach, becomes upon
reiterated circulations, a moſt noble
generous liquor, and in its paſſage
through the brain a pure unmixed
ſpirit will be ſublimed or ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it, free from preternatural
acidities which cauſe many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>This ſubtle and ſincere Liquor
or Spirit ſupplies the Nerves and
Muſcles with what is neceſſary for
Animal Actions, the Lungs, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Spleen, and other Viſcera,
And the parts deſtined for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Species with ſo much as
is neceſſary to keep them in a due
Tone and enable them to perform all
theſe actions for which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.
The reſt of the blood viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42016:72"/>
the moſt extream parts of the
body, and others retired from ſight,
where <hi>percolated</hi> through <hi>Parenchymous
fibrous</hi> or bony ſubſtances, it leaves
with each part what is Congruous
to it: And ſo long as this courſe is
continued without interruption, health
alſo will be uninterrupted.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary high
Compounded nouriſhment, whoſe
quantity and ſubſtance is often varied,
eſpecially if it be more then the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
can well digeſt, muſt by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical</hi>
neceſſity cauſe Diſeaſes. For
if the quantity be greater then the
ferment of the Stomach can diſſolve
the Chyle will enter the Blood Crude,
and being more then that is uſed to
aſſimilate at once, and not well opened
by a previous digeſtion, it by inſenſible
degrees depraves the beſt conſtitution,
for then the blood ſupplies the Brain,
Nerves, Viſcera, and Muſculous parts
with unſutable Spirits, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which affecting them after an
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42016:73"/>
unuſual manner, pain or ſomewhat
worſe, is in time the reſult of this
bad or irregular Diet. Then for the
quality of the food if it abound too
much with Oyly and Spirituous parts,
it puts the blood into that great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
or Ebullition we ſtile a Fever,
if with cold Crude juyces as Melons,
Cucumbers or Cherries, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
extinguiſhes the Native-heat,
and if the ſick eſcape they are uſually
ſtigmatized by blotches or eruptions
all over their bodies or in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
parts, whereat the Morbous
matter is excluded. Laſtly, if Salt
be predominant in the nouriſhment
it cauſes various Maladies, eſpecially
of the <hi>Genus nervoſum</hi> often occaſions
ſtrange diſorders in the whole maſs of
blood and ſometimes Corrodes the
External parts which it deforms and
and tortures in Ulcers, Fiſtula's, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and other painful, loathſome and
formidable Diſeaſes. All which might
have been prevented, and if timely
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42016:73"/>
care had been taken, cured by a ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and orderly Diet. For an ill
Craſis or Conſtitution of the blood
doth not always, preſently, diſplay it
ſelf in ſuch bad Syptoms as to deſerve
the denomination of a diſeaſe, this by
Phyſitians is called a Neutral-ſtate
which may be firſt Checkt, and then
redreſſed by Diet. For although if we
will examine things ſtrictly there is no
middle between ſickneſs and health,
yet becauſe it is ſo hard to find a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
for either of them; therefore
Phyſitians have agreed on this third,
as an expedient the better to expreſs
their thoughts: ſo that we apprehend
a man is in perfect health who is free
from pain or any Indiſpoſition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
in his own and the Phyſitians
opinion all Animal and Natural Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as well as if he were in perfect
health, we account a Neutral ſtate to
be a ſlight propenſion to a diſeaſe, when
the ferment of the Stomach begins
to be perverted, the blood ſomewhat
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42016:74"/>
depraved, and yet no very ill Symptom
appears, No function of the body is
much hindered or interrupted at leaſt
not very ſenſibly; As when by too
ſtrict and ſevere a diet the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be Emaciated, the Nerves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected,
or when by drinking to freely
the body is inclining to a fever, dropſie
or Conſumption, to the ſame or other
diſeaſes, by eating frequently too
much, or ſuch food as ſuits not with
the Stomachical Ferment being to it
hard of Digeſtion, or meat endowed
with any other ill quality: by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
exceſſes crudities being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated
which if they increaſe will
diſplay pernicious effects; But if
timely diſcerned may be conquered
without the help of Phyſick. As to
avoid Repetition I ſhall manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the next head.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that a Diſeaſe is
ſenſibly formed: Let us examine then
what Diet can contribute to the Cure,
Moderation, or Palliation of the
Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42016:74"/>
To avoid prolixity, I ſhall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only ſome general wayes of Cure
by Diet, on which any underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſon may expatiate in his
mind.</p>
               <p>It's ſo well known that many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions
are cured by Faſting or
a ſpare Diet, that I need only mention
it. Others are cured by a Diet axact
for the quantity of food which hath
laudible qualities, for what is taken
being no more then can be well over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and diſlolved by the ſtomach,
this conveyed into the blood ſoon
renders it more ſpirituous, whereby
what is crude is either digeſted, or
carryed off in perſpiration; ſo that
Nature being duely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſupply of good ſpirits, the bad
texture of the blood is ſoon exchanged
for one more innocent. Thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions
and other Chronical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
have been frequently cured.
Many diſeaſes are overcome by a Diet
contrary to the peccant matter; as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42016:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hecticks by a Milk Diet; Fevers by
Ptiſans; ſome Conſumptions by
Snails, and other glutinous ſubſtances;
Hot Diſeaſes by moiſt cold, Cold and
moiſt by a hot and drying Diet. Some
Diſeaſes are alwayes moderated and
often cured by ſubſtracting from the
liquid part of the nouriſhment, as
Catarrhs; others by allowing it more
plentifully, as in that dreadful Diſeaſe
called by Phyſitians <hi>Cholera Morbus,</hi>
wherein if the Patient take great
quantities of Poſſet-drink, or thin
weak Chicken-broath, thoſe affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſymptoms of Vomiting and Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſoon ceaſe, the liquor dilating that
corroſive ſaline matter, which prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coats of the ſtomach, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
cauſed thoſe violent workings
upwards and downwards. And this is
a remedy ſo certain that I never yet
obſerved it to fail, and others who
have had longer time and more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to make Obſervations than my
ſelf, and particularly he whom I take
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42016:75"/>
to be the firſt inventor of this eaſily
parable effectual Remedy, do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
affirme, <hi>That it hath ſcarcely
ever fruſtrated their Expectations;</hi> and
yet we know that many miſcarry of
this diſtemper, even where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
generous Remedies of the
Chymiſts, and beſt methods of thoſe
whom they ſtyle <hi>Galeniſts</hi> have been
imployed.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: Another way of
curing Diſeaſes by Diet, and the laſt
I ſhall mention, is with ſome ſorts of
food, which by a hidden or ſpecifical
property cure Diſeaſes. Our inſtances
ſhall be only in the Vegetable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whoſe Simples are numerous,
and they differ from each other in
many ſenſible properties, as Taſte,
Smell, Figure, Colour, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
qualities are far more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
and between them alſo there
are great differences and contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Some are of a hot, others cooling,
moiſt, or dry Nature; ſome are ſaline,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42016:76"/>
others oyly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And moſt of them
have ſeveral of theſe properties in
ſome degree, all which may be ſuted
to the removal of whatſoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to, and leſs powerful than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
now Diſeaſes, if ſimple, are
only an exceſs in one quality or other,
which an appropriate nutritive ſimple
judiciouſly applyed, if the quantity be
ſufficient, and eſpecially if often reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
doth uſually redreſs. To make
this more cleer, I will give one or
two obvious examples of the ſame
diſorders cauſed and cured by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Vegetables. It's well known,
that Parſly eaten in a ſmall quantity
is apt to exaſperate diſeaſes of the Eye,
and there are other Plants which prove
more healing than that is hurtful,
witneſs Eybright: And it hath been
obſerved that even Turneps render
the ſight more acute, cure mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Inflammations, and are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Phyſitians to be of frequent uſe
while perſons are under cure for the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42016:76"/>
                  <hi>Gutta Serena, Recent Cataracts,</hi> &amp; other
diſeaſes incident to that tender part.
But this will appear moſt evidently in
the <hi>Sea Scorbute</hi> which is contracted
uſually by a bad Diet, ſalt meats, and
naſtineſs; ſometimes extremity of
heat or cold combining to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it. 'Tis hardly to be imagined
how deplorable a condition thoſe
perſons that are highly afflicted with
this diſtemper ſeem to be in, being to
appearance abſolutely incurable by
the moſt generous Medicines, helped
with the advice of the greateſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
yet ſuch ſlight things as the juice
of Limons, Freſh meat, but eſpecially
plenty of green Herbs preſently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
all theſe horrid threatning Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
and that ſo ſuddenly that
they ſeem to be cured by a Charm,
thoſe who were not able to ſtir a limb,
were exerciſed with many grievous
Maladies, in a week recovering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
their former health; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
long courſes of Phyſick would
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42016:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never have reſtored to them in a much
longer ſpace. And we find, that not only
the <hi>Sea Scorbute,</hi> but that alſo w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. is on
land contracted by eating ſalt meats, is
more certainly and ſuddenly cured by
a convenient diet, then by Phyſick. And
an Eminent Phyſitian in this city aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me, that moſt ill habits of body
occaſioned by feeding much on ſalt
meats, are ſoon cured by eating daily
for a few weeks a good Quantity of
almoſt any edible green herbs. And
another no leſs conſiderable, who hath
great dealing with Seamen, proteſted
ſeriouſly to me, that he cures all thoſe
among them that are Scorbutically
affected, only with young peaſe, ordred
all manner of ways; eaten crude, boiled
with, or without their ſhells, whoſe
juice is to be plentifully mix'd with
their broth; that this Remedy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failed him, nor the Seamen of
cure: and this ſometimes after the
diſeaſe had eluded many very promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Methods and Medicines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42016:77"/>
We have hitherto treated of Meats,
which Phyſitians, as I have ſhewed,
can render medicinal. I now proceed
to mention, Drinks, which are no leſs,
nay more capable of being improved,
by being impregnated with the virtues
of Simples Animal, Vegetable, and
Mineral, or their Preparations, and
not become conſiderably diſtaſtful to
the Palate, or nauſeous to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.
There are myriads of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
in the books of Authors. I
ſhall only mention that method which
is of general uſe in order to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricating
the virtues of Simples or
Compoſitions, which is this: The
ingredients are to be hung in fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
liquors, whether Wine, Ale,
Beer, or Cider, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that their
medicating properties are extracted
by this method, dayly experience doth
atteſt, many who either will not, or
cannot uſe other Phyſick, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by ingredients thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For the fermenting liquors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42016:78"/>
in a brisk motion, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with active parts chiefly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
inſinuate themſelves into the
moſt private receſſes of the Simples or
other materials, give motion enough
to their active parts to looſen them
from the more groſs, and drive them
into the liquor, and theſe freed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate
with their deliverers to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe
the reſt. And that the <hi>Craſis,</hi>
or chief parts and properties of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are by this method obtained, is
evidenced by the effects and taſts of the
drinks exactly emulating thoſe of the
materials which were thus fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
As for what refers to Cures
effected by theſe means, I dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm, <hi>That there is ſcarcely any
Chronical Diſeaſe, that is cured by the
Shop Medicines, which may not be
cured with more certainty, eaſe, and
pleaſure, by Drinks thus ordered, joyned
with a regular Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we ſhewed of how great
advantage a convenient Diet is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42016:78"/>
to the cure of Diſeaſes. I have
ſpoken more largly to this particular,
not that I deſign to learn Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
any new notion, they having
many of them better digeſted thoughts
on this ſubject, then theſe which
are the Product of two hours Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
But I mention theſe things
partly on the account of the Vulgar,
that they may have other apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of underſtanding Phyſicians,
then they have hitherto entertained;
as alſo that I might learn the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
to know themſelves, and their
own inſufficiency; or if they will not
acknowledge it, to expoſe them ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
to others, that, unleſs they will
ſhut their eyes, they cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
unpardonable weakneſs and
great defects in moſt of thoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
blind Bayards, the Quacking
Apothecaries; who before I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
them, will appear lean and
ſcrannel, though now they ſeem
plump and juycy. I ſhall therefore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42016:79"/>
proceed to poliſh the mirror: wherein
if impartial Spectators do view and
compare them with Learned honeſt
Phyſicians, they will find without any
deluſive Catoptrical trick, no leſs
difference between them, then there is
betwixt admired beauty, and hated
deformity.</p>
               <p>Therefore laſtly, A Phyſitian will
appear to be Superior to other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders,
if we reflect on thoſe many
advantages he hath, whereof they are
wholly deſtitute. He is accounted to
to enjoy a great Piviledge, who hath
been Educated by an Eminent Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioner
of Phyſick, who hath been free
in his communications to him; and
this is by the Vulgar accounted ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to conſtitute a perſon, who
hath been in ſuch circumſtances an
able Phyſitian: And the beſt plea the
Apothecaries have, is, that they have
collected the Practice of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Phyſitian for moſt Diſeaſes; now
there is no Phyſitian but injoys the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42016:79"/>
benefit of the writings of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
excellent perſons, that were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in the ſame faculty before him:
Theſe have faithfully communicated
their experiements and obſervations of
the cauſes and ſymptoms of diſeaſes,
and of their cures; what methods and
Medicines they found moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
what things are injurious and
to be avoided: And there are others
who have left us their writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the virtues of moſt Simple
and Compounded Medicines, in what
caſes they have been found effectual;
and many (which is perhaps the moſt
profitable way of writing) have left
us intire books of Medical Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to which Phyſitians, who have a
Scheme of them in their memories
have recourſe in difficult caſes, and by
Analogy know how to proceed, as do
the Lawyers, on other occaſions.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſuppoſe with ſome that
Phyſick is altogether Empyrical, being
rather a Maſs of Experiments then a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42016:80"/>
Science perfectly formed &amp; eſtabliſhed
on ſound unqueſtionable verities (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
is the moſt plauſible plea Apothecaries
or other pretenders can uſe) yet ſtill it
muſt needs follow, that he ought to be
eſteemed moſt able and ſufficient, who
is furniſhed with moſt and beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
either from his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
or by reading of books
which afford him the experiments of
all the reſt of the world, and can beſt
conclude and argue from the Analogy,
Correſpondence, and Harmony, they
have one to another. So that a ſtudied
Phyſitian muſt, in all conſideration of
reaſon, have far the advantage of any
other.</p>
               <p>Indeed it hath been objected by ſome
that the diſeaſes of one country &amp; age
are ſo vaſtly different from thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that what is profitable to thoſe
thar live in one age, or to the inhabitants
of one Country is not ſo to another.
Which is not only a great miſtake as
I have elſe where demonſtrated, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42016:80"/>
of bad conſequence, leading us to the
neglect of the writings of many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Perſons, from which we do day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
derive great aſſiſtance: For although
I will not deny but that there may be
ſome uncertainty, and the Analogy
may not be altogether ſo exact, as we
could deſire; yet it is no otherwiſe
then the variation of the Needle,
touched by the Load-ſtone; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it doth not always directly
point to the Poles, but in ſome places
conſiderably varies, ſo that the moſt
skilful Mariners cannot certainly,
though they can neerly determine
where, and in what degree of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
they are; yet it is ſuch a help
that they cannot without great hazard
ingage in long and dangerous voyages
without it; and by it's direction, if
no other ill accidents intervene, they
uſually arrive at the deſired ports,
though very remote from the place
whence they ſet forth. So a Phyſitian
by the help of his own and others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42016:81"/>
for which he makes allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or abatements, as he ſees occaſion,
Pilots moſt of his Patients almoſt, as
ſurely as if his courſe were chalked
out for him or directed by a line; So
that patients, who venture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in dangerous caſes with Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Apothecaries, do it only
with this difference, the one (as it
were) Imbarks for a long Voyage in
a Leaking Skiff, with an Ignorant Pilot
without Sayls, Compaſs, and other
due Proviſions, the other in a ſtanch
fair Ship, well Riggid, provided with a
skilful Pilot, good Compaſſes, and all
other requiſites for Navigation: And
which is like to make the moſt ſhort
and fortunate Voyage, which is moſt
ſecure from ſtorms, foundring, or
holding uncertain courſes, is, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
eaſily determined? 'Tis true we
read of ſome, that in a little Boat ſet
out from <hi>New-England,</hi> and made a
quick and ſafe Voyage to <hi>Ireland;</hi>
and of others, who no better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42016:81"/>
Sailed from the <hi>Bermudas</hi> to
<hi>Virginia;</hi> yet theſe Accidents are not
frequent, and if they are regiſtered,
it is under the notion of extarordinary
events. And beſides none of theſe
were ſo mad as to have neglected any
helps they could have procured, it
not being choice but neceſſity, that
put them on ſuch ſtrange adventures,
and to run ſo great a riſque to eſcape
dangers, which they could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
avoid. But this is not the caſe
of any that are ſick, there being choice
of means, ſo that for a man adviſedly
to hazard that, which is ſo precious
and valuable as life, by committing
himſelf to the care of ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful
Empericks, when he might in a
great meaſure ſecure it by conſulting
a ſober Learned Phyſitian, is to put an
affront upon his reaſon, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem
his life; but certainly there
are not many, who after ſo fair a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given them, will expoſe themſelves
to dangers, which they may ſo eaſily
avoid. I will therefore now proceed,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42016:82"/>
in compliance with my promiſe, to
give an account of ſome of thoſe
numberleſs unworthy practiſes, the
Apothecaries are manifeſtly guilty of,
in Order to the diſgracing Phyſitians,
and inſinuating or confirming a good
opinion of themſelves.</p>
               <p>They will often commend to perſons
as preventive Phyſick, a gentle Purge,
and at night a little Doſe of Diaſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
Mithridate, Treacle or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elſe, in ſo ſmall a quantity that it
ſhall not diſorder them; ſo that their
Patient, for ſo they call them, finding
that he hath received no prejudice by
this Phyſick, and the purge poſſibly
working kindly, (of which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Phyſitians preſcriptions may
have enough) apprehends that he may
be ſomewhat better, and ſo begins to
have ſome confidence in the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary;
who doth not looſe any hold he
hath got. For ſoon after the Patient
perhaps hath occaſion for a Phyſitian,
himſelf or ſome of his family being
ill: If it be for any diſtemper they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42016:82"/>
were formerly ſubject to, for which
the Apothecary hath any of the
Doctors Preſcriptions; he then
ſuggeſts that there is no neceſſity he
ſhould give himſelf the charge of
ſending for a Phyſitian who would
preſcribe the ſame things he ordered
formerly, which preſcriptions he hath
by him, and is ready to make up for
them; although now, as I ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the caſe may be ſo altered by
complication or otherwiſe, which the
Phyſitian would preſently have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that this, which did once give
Relief, may be either highly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
or ineffectual. Thus they do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
obtrude themſelves and their
Medicines on the ſick eſpecially if the
diſeaſe be frequent and obvious, as the
Meaſles, Small-pox, Fever, Scurvey;
and ſome among them ſoar ſo high as
the Venereal Lues: For they have ſeen
perſons often under courſes for theſe
diſeaſes, and, having the preſcripts
ſtill on the File, they know no reaſon
why they ſhould not cure them, as
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42016:83"/>
well as the Doctor: They therefore tell
them that it is a great expence to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the Phyſitian, and pay the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Bill, which in theſe courſes they
aſſure them, will amount to much (as
indeed they do by their ordering)
that they are throughly acquainted
with the Phyſitians Method: which as
I have already ſhewed, is a groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
and high preſumption. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſmiſs, without a further Check
this frivolous pretence of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary,
that becauſe he hath moſt of thoſe
Medicines which the Phyſitian otdinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imploys, therefore he ought to be
allowed in the practice of Phyſick, it
being a way of Argumentation not
much unlike that, ſome ſilly fellow
might make, who ſeeing a Lutiniſt
play well to admiration, is there upon
deſirous to pleaſe himſelf, and gratifie
the Company with the like Muſick:
But upon tryal although he have the
ſame Inſtrument, as many Fingers as
the Muſitian, &amp; the Notes prickt down
before him; yet can produce no other
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42016:83"/>
harmony, then what is the reſult of
diſcord: And would he not render
himſelf yet more ridiculous, ſhould
he perſwade himſelf his Muſick is not
inferiour to that of the Excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
and becomes highly difpleaſed
with the Company, becauſe they do
not beſtow on him the ſame applauſe
they gave to the perſon, he vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to imitate? There being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to the beſt performance of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
not only a hand &amp; inſtruments, but
alſo an exact knowledge of the Rules
of that Art, and frequent Exerciſe. So
that for any to promiſe themſelves
the Art or habit without the uſe of
the right means, which conduce to it's
attainment, is the higheſt folly, and
hath as little foundation in reaſon as
an Attempt (according to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
homely Proverb) to make a
Velvet Purſe of a Sowes ear, or any
other unſuitable matter.</p>
               <p>But to leave this, and proceed in the
account of our Quacking Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42016:84"/>
who by ſome ſuch Artifices as
we mentioned having ſcrued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into families, that they take eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
care of them according to their
mean ability, I am willing to admit,
their intereſt, obliging them ſo to do,
and you may be ſure, they ply them
with ſtore of Phyſick; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> how fatal it
proves to thoſe that have the Meaſles
or Small-pox, is too well known. But
if by good fortune the Patient eſcape,
then they ſufficiently Celebrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in all Companies, rendring the
caſe ſomewhat more dangerous &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
then really it was: whereby they
make way for their Introduction into
other families. But if (as is moſt likely)
by their ill management, the Patients
lapſe into a dangerous condition, ſo
ſoon as they are ſenſible thereof, they
immediately adviſe them to ſend for a
Doctor, who is oftentimes ſo Civil as
not to animadvert on what hath been
done amiſs. If they recover, then he
endeavours to perſwade them, that the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42016:84"/>
Phyſician proceeded in the very ſame
courſe he intended to have followed;
and that it was only for their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he was deſirous to have the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
adviſed with. But if the perſon
dies before the Phyſician was ſent for,
he cryes out with a wide mouth on
malignity, which is for the moſt part
no other then the effect of his ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement;
yet being dead he ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuggeſts that he fears the Phyſician
took not a right courſe; and wiſhes
that he himſelf had proceeded after
his own method, which for any thing
he knew might have recovered him:
which ſuggeſtion taking with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the people, who are very
prone to accuſe the laſt medicines of
any ſtrange Symptomes which are
often Fore-runners of death, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
Apothecary makes a great
advantage of his own miſcarriages.
Which double dealing having been
detected by ſome Phyſicians, hath ſo
highly diſpleaſed them that they have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42016:85"/>
often been ready to take up a firm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
never to take care of any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
who had before been managed
by Apothecaries; and had actually
performed it, did they not apprehend
it would be a breach of Chriſtian
charity to puniſh people ſo ſeverely
for imprudent actions extorted from
them by an others over-bearing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
and confidence. Theſe are
ſome of thoſe many artifices the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
employ, I ſpeak not at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
what they may do, but what
they have often actually done, many
of which have fallen under my owne
obſervation, others I have received
from the Patients or Phyſicians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
on whom they have thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
Now I appeal to the whole
Nation, whether ſuch great miſchiefs
and inconveniences as theſe I have
already enumerated, ought not to be
redreſſed; and that we may not think
they are <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>reach</hi> of any <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
I ſhall now proceed to the mention
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42016:85"/>
of thoſe propoſals the Phyſicians make
to the Apothecaries: with which if
they comply, they will ſave themſelves
from ruine, which otherwiſe is at
their heels. I have alſo thought fit to
let the world know that we can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
without them, and that probably
much better then with them; I mean
more to our own and the Patients ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
or ſecurity, as in it's due
place ſhall be made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that Phyſicians
and their Patients have been ſo highly
injured by Apothecaries, that they
might with the greateſt juſtice utterly
reject them; and although the nature
of their crimes ſeem to be ſuch, that
they cannot ſafely keep any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
correſpondence with them: yet
this is ſo far from being the deſign of
the Phyſicians, that if any expedient
can be excogitated (and ſuch they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
they have found out) which
may prove a fair ground for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
they are willing to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42016:86"/>
forgive and forget all former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and give them ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as reaſonable and honeſt perſons
can deſire. Now all that the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
expect of them, is that they keep
in their own Station, and endeavour
to anſwer the end of their inſtitution.
That is, Firſt they ſhall give the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
ſufficient ſecurity and aſſurance,
that they will carefully and faithfully
prepare their medicines; And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this ſhall be their ſole imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they no more intruding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into the Phyſicians, which is
the practice of Phyſick. If theſe be
not reaſonable requeſts, let the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
themſelves propoſe ſuch as
are, which the Phyſicians are ready
to receive. Now that the Phyſicians
can be ſatisfied with nothing leſs, if
they have regard, either to their own
credit and ſubſiſtence, or the welfare
of the Patient, is eaſily evinced by a
recapitulation of what was ſaid before.
For if it be true which I think was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42016:86"/>
That many Apothecaries
are not well acquainted with the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
medica,</hi> and liable to be impoſed
on by Herb-women, Druggiſts, and
others; If they truſt to thoſe for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
that prepare them unfaithfully
as 'tis manifeſt they do; If they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
uſe bad drugs in their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and vent medicines which have
loſt moſt if not all their Medicinal
vertue; Or if they are fraudulent in
their compoſitions, leaving out fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the chief Ingredients; If they
ſubſtitute, add, and ſubtract at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
Are negligent, ſlovenly, and
ſuperficial in their compoſitions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to miſtakes, either from their
own or Apprentices ignorance of
the Latine tongue; and beſides ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unacquainted with Chymiſtry,
a moſt material if not neceſſary part
of Pharmacy; and inſtead of thoſe
noble Remedies, imploy ſuch as they
have from unfaithful perſons, who
ordinarily adulterate and ſophiſticate
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42016:87"/>
them. If all theſe may be affirmed (as
they may moſt certainly be) of moſt
Apothecaries, would not Phyſitians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
themſelves and their Profeſſion to
the ſcorn of the world, and might not
their Patients deſervedly load them
with reproaches, ſhould they ſtill make
uſe of their Medicines? And further,
if the Apothecaries be abſolutely unfit
for the practice of Phyſick, why are
they allowed in it? And that they are,
was proved from the nature of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and thoſe ſeveral wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they admit of cure. Where we
ſhewed, that the Apothecaries are
Maſters neither of the cure by Method,
Specificks, <hi>Arcana,</hi> or any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of theſe; That they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not Phyſiology, and are not
capable of attending to all thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
which ought to be duely
conſidered by a true Phyſician; That
they underſtand not when Nature is
to be left, to manage things after her
own conduct: but on the contrary,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42016:87"/>
that they diſturbe her orderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and diſtract her in moſt regular
Operations; That they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with cure of Diſeaſes, or
preſervation of health by Diet; That
they ordinarily miſtake ſimple Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
for complicated, and theſe for
ſuch as are ſimple; That they are not
furniſhed with thoſe helps which are
of great uſe to the Phyſician, ſuch are
the obſervations of the Ancients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the riſe, ſymptoms, progreſs
and cure of Diſeaſes; and therefore
deſerve not the denomination of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
nor can without extream pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the publick, be permitted
to follow the practice of Phyſick till
they are better qualified for it. I hope
then after ſuch a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
the Phyſicians may either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
their reformation, or deſert
them; and entertain ſuch as will be
more faithful to themſelves, and to
their Patients. But they are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
though highly provoked, to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42016:88"/>
be an occaſion of the ruin of ſo many
as will upon their deſerting them, be
expoſed to miſerable exigencies; they
will not therefore promote their
downfal, till they deſerve it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
verbally or implicitly the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
modeſt propoſals. It will
therefore be expected:</p>
               <p>That they do faithfully and
carefully prepare all the Medicines
they ſend out of their Shops, not
truſting to whole-ſale either Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
or other Medicine-mongers;
That all the Drugs they uſe ſhall be
viewed and approved of by one or
more Phyſicians before they enter
Compoſitions, as alſo the Drugs that
are of dayly uſe; That once in three
months a ſolemn Scrutiny be made by
Phyſicians, deputed for that purpoſe,
of all their Drugs and Compoſitions:
who ſhall be impowred immediately
to cauſe to be deſtroyed all ſuch as
are found unfit for uſe. We alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
That they either themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42016:88"/>
their Chymical remedies, or give
the Phyſicians ſuch aſſurances, that
they are faithfully and skilfully made
as ſhall ſatisfie them; And that care
be taken for the future, that no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
entertain any for an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that is not competently skilled in
Latin tongue; and that they be firſt
examined and approved by ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
as the Phyſicians ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
Further, Phyſicians obſerving
the great inconveniencies which have
enſued on Apothecaries having acceſs
to the Patients, which is not allowed
of in many Countries, do alſo think
it unreaſonable that Apothecaries
here ſhould take that liberty, which
for reaſons mentioned is thought fit
ſhould be denyed them; eſpecially
having found upon due deliberation,
that there is no need of them out of
their Shops, where they are to look
to the Compoſition of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines:
which in their abſence often
ſuffer through ignorance of their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42016:89"/>
young Apprentices, whatſoever is
commonly performed by them among
Patients, being otherwayes eaſily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
Further, That they contract
their number, or at leaſt take care for
the future, that it be not increaſed.
And laſtly, that ſuch prizes be ſet on
Medicines by Phyſicians as they ſhall
think fit, who will take care that the
Apothecaries have reaſonable gain;
That theſe be Printed, as in the <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and other <hi>Pharmacopoeia's,</hi> ſo no
perſon can be cheated.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of what I have here
delivered, is comprized in the laſt
propoſition mentioned, and inſiſted on
by the Judicious Writer of that rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
diſcourſe concerning the ſtate of
Phyſick, in theſe words, or to this
effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Phyſitians ſend bills to be made
up by Apothecaries, as now they are;
provided only that the Time and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of uſing them, be not ſet down nor
the name of the Patient, That it be not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42016:89"/>
ſent by the Patient, but by their own
ſervants; That it be returned to the
Phyſitians again with the Phyſick it ſelf,
to be filed up by them or entred into a
book with the Patients name and the
time: the Phyſick ſo made and provided
by the Phyſitians order to be fetcht at
their own houſes (as it is now at the
Apothecaries ſhops) or from thence ſent
home by their own ſervants to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
And becauſe we cannot ſafely
truſt to Apothecaries for Chymical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
they uſually buying them of
common Chymiſts or Operators, It is
deſired that the Colledge would erect
a publick Laboratory, where all Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Medicines fit to be uſed, ſhall be
well and faithfully made upon the Faith
and Authority of the Colledge; and
that they ſhall expreſsly appoint thoſe,
whoſe Phyſick they ſhall think fit to buy,
to provide all their Chymical Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
from thence; nor to permit the
uſe of any other Chymical Preparations
to any of their number, except he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42016:90"/>
make and prepare them, or have
them from ſuch Apothecaries as the
Colledge being ſatisfied with their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and honeſty ſhall approve of.
And laſtly, That the Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
(who herein will be ſoon imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by others) Enact, That none of
their number ſend bills to, or buy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of, any Apothecary who takes on
him the practice of Phyſick, till they
are fully ſatisfied he is ſenſible of the
injury done to them, and ceaſe to do the
like for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how ſevere and unjuſt ſoever
theſe Limitations may ſeem to the
Apothecaries, yet in reality this is
but a fair and moderate courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and Phyſicians; for it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not the Apothecaries making and
ſelling of Phyſick to any that ſhall
pleaſe to buy of them: which thing
only belongs to their Trade. To vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
the Patient, feel his Pulſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
his Urine, diſcourſe of the ſtate
of the Diſeaſe, and preſcribe proper
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42016:90"/>
Remedies for it, is the buſineſs and
care of the Phyſician: So that by this
method the Intereſt of both will be
preſerved, and all cauſes of jealouſie
between the Phyſicians and them will
for ever ceaſe. The Phyſicians pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and profeſſion will be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and intirely ſecured to himſelf,
that the Apothecary cannot invade
it; for he will never ſee a Phyſicians
bill (from which they alwayes take
direction) nor the Patient himſelf,
and ſo be utterly ignorant of that caſe
for which the Phyſick was prepared
and uſed; nor will he hear the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
reaſon and diſcourſe of the
due times and manner of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
it, or explain the nature and
cauſe of the diſtemper, nor have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of officious intervening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Phyſician and Patient, nor
diſpence the Phyſick with praiſe of
his own great care and pains in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it as he is wont to do, all this
the Phyſician obtains by only conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42016:91"/>
his bills (the writing of a bill
being as it were the Myſtery of his
trade) in which therefore he doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what is held reaſonable
among all men.</p>
               <p>Beſides, This will inſenſibly leſſen
that exorbitant number of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which makes the trade ſcarce a
competent ſubſiſtence. For as things
are now, while the Maſter or their
Servants, are imployed by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
to viſit his Patients, and carry
Phyſick about, they will be under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of taking ſeveral Apprentices;
elſe they cannot perform ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances
abroad, and the buſineſs of
their ſhop too: and this hath made
ſo vaſt in increaſe of the trade within
few years, as has rendred it but a
mean way of livelihood to a great
many, and very dangerous to the ſick.
Now as their number will by little
and little grow leſs, ſo the trade will
become better; and they who are of
it, both for skill and eſtate much more
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42016:91"/>
conſiderable: and, which is of much
greater conſequence, Phyſick will be
better prepared, for the Apothecaries
will be more in their ſhops, and not
leave things to raw, negligent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as is now often done; they
not being ſent about by Phyſitians to
their Patients, or with Phyſick, no<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
engaged in any Quacking practice of
their own, will have more leiſure to
attend making good Medicines, which
is their proper buſineſs.</p>
               <p>This in ſhort, is the Summary of
what we expect from them; and if it
be not granted us, nothing remains,
but that Phyſitians take Pharmacy
into their own hands, ſuperviſe the
making of their own Medicines, and
diſpenſe them themſelves. And we
have reaſon to apprehend that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
will be put on a neceſſity of
acting thus, it being highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the generality of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
ſhould be reduced to a ſenſe and
practice of their duty, having been ſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42016:92"/>
long accuſtomed to ſuch bad courſes.
For Cuſtom, we know, is a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and where bad, they are not
eaſily ſubdued by thoſe that heartily
deſire and deſign it, how much leſs by
Immoral men who if they amend, 'tis
from a principle of fear; and therefore
they will redeem every opportunity
of infranchiſing themſelves and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
looſe from a reſtraint ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and contrary to their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Beſides, how unwilling will they
be to moderate their gain, leſſen their
number, which muſt neceſſarily be
done, unleſs we will allow the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Inconveniencies, which cannot
otherwiſe admit of a remedy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
'tis natural for ſome to be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of practice, not only as it is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but becauſe it adds to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and repute, conciliates them more
reſpect, than people think ordinarily
due to ſimple Apothecaries; and
therefore to part with their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this kind, will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42016:92"/>
unſpeakable regret and vexation.
And beſides, ſuppoſing, which is yet
very improbable, that they ſhould
promiſe to keep within due limits,
reform abuſes, what other ſecurity
can they give us beſides their bare
word or promiſe, which is ſo much
the more unlikely to be valid; becauſe,
as I before intimated, it is not free but
extorted: and 'tis abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for any beſides their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
to detect all their fraudulent
practices. For though Phyſicians ſee
and allow of their Ingredients, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them mixed, what ſhould hinder
them, if any of the old Ferment remain,
from increaſing the quantity with bad
Materials? And indeed, neither Laws
of God nor Man, good Inſtructions,
excellent Examples, or ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of their actions, can hinder
thoſe that are ill diſpoſed from acting
that ſecretly, which ſiniſter reſpects
keeps them from doing in publick.
Therefore ſuch a conſtitution of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42016:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is deſirable, where bad men
ſhall be made good and faithful, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that where thoſe that are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
meet with daily temptations to
be diſhoneſt.</p>
               <p>This will be accompliſhed by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
taking it into their own hands;
for then ſuppoſe them as bad as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
or the Apothecaries can render
them, how little ſenſe ſoever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their duty, that of intereſt
will ſtrongly oblige them to have
good Medicines. <hi>Machiavel</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
prudently adviſes, <hi>That if you
would underſtand what mens deſigns
or intentions are, learn what will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
moſt to promote their intereſt; and
that they will chiefly aime at, although
to the unwary Spectator, they may ſeem
to look another way, and act another
part then they intend.</hi> There are but
two caſes where this Maxim is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
invalid. The one is, when men
are over-awed with ſuch a ſenſe of
Religion, as will not allow them to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42016:93"/>
practice what they apprehend would
be highly for their temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
but this is ſo far from hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Phyſitian, that it is or ought to
be the greateſt incouragement he can
meet with, the applauſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances
he will daily receive from
his own conſcience, proving an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
recompenſe for the unuſual trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he will meet with in compounding
and diſpenſing his own Remedies.
The other occaſion of invalidating the
fore-quoted Maxime, is, when men
miſtake their intereſt and do not ſee
it; which here is morally impoſſible
for a Phyſitian's credit, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
his profit depending on the
goodneſs and ſucceſs of his Remedies,
the better his Medicines are, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will be his gain, the higher his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute:
Whereas the Apothecary, let his
Medicines be never ſo bad, runs little
hazard, the Phyſitian only being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
blamed if they cauſe people to
miſcarry; eſpecially if the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42016:94"/>
can confidently affirm, that his
Materials were choice, carefully and
skilfully prepared, which they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
backward to do: adding, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſuch inſinuations as have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to diſparage the Phyſitian, and
introduce themſelves, as was before
intimated. Therefore now we
proceed to ſhew that Phyſitians can
manage Pharmacy. Secondly, That
if they proceed in ſuch Methods as
we ſhall mention, or ſome other ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
great conveniencies, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to the Phyſician, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
nay, even to the publick, will be
the reſult of ſuch Procedures.</p>
               <p>The Propoſals that we make, are,
That either every Phyſitian prepare
and diſpenſe his own Phyſick; or that
they enter into Aſſociations: either of
which will be of great advantage to
the publick. Nothing can in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
be objected againſt the firſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the Phyſitian himſelf pretend that
it will be too great a trouble, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42016:94"/>
him too much from his other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
of viſiting and adviſing the
Sick, or conſulting in private with his
Books, Reaſon, and Experience, (as
every honeſt Phyſitian doth) in order
to the Recovery and Relief of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.
Now to him that conſiders
things attentively, this can be urged
only by ſuch Phyſitians as have a full
imployment, which will afford them
to keep in their own houſes; or to
have near them perſons skilful in
Pharmacy, whoſe only buſineſs it
ſhould be to provide ſuch Medicines,
whether Compound or Simple, as
they ſhall have occaſion to uſe in their
practice, the Phyſitians directing and
ſuperviſing them. So that ſuppoſing
the Apothecary skilful, there will be
little reaſon to fear miſcarriages; for
the Apothecary will have no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be unfaithful, becauſe it will
not benefit him, his gains not being
contingent (as now) depending on the
quantity of Phyſick he ſells, his ſalary
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42016:95"/>
being we ſuppoſe fixt and certain.
But rather on the contrary it is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to have the Phyſick as good as
he can make it; for the greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
the Phyſitian hath, the more will
be his imployment: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he will be the better able to gratifie
the Apothecary for his care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in preparing the Medicine he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
ſo ſucceſsfully. But ſuppoſe
the Apothecary ſhould have bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
(which yet he can never have ſo
long as he is in his wits) he will want
opportunities to effect them; himſelf,
and his Medicines being almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
under the Phyſitians inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who allows no bad drugs admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
into his Operatory, and may if
he pleaſe, ſee them mix'd and duly
prepared.</p>
               <p>But Phyſitians will be freed from
much of this trouble, if they take the
advice of that late judicious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have already cited, which is,
That the moſt eminent among them
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42016:95"/>
entertain in their houſes perſons of
three or four years ſtanding in either
of our Univerſities, who are to be
received in the capacity, not of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but of young Students, Friends,
or vertuous Companions, to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in their worthy Profeſſion; and
brought up in the exerciſes of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
knowledge of Herbs, mixing and
compounding of Medicines, (the
drudgery reſting on Servants) and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſick under their direction:
who when they are a little advanced,
and ſtudied in this Art, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Phyſitian to obſerve
Patients in his abſence, and give him
an account of their caſes; by which
means he will be ignorant of nothing
material, although he be not there
himſelf. They may alſo viſit their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratories,
and look after the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of thoſe Medicines the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
preſcribe; which as it will
much eaſe the antient, ſo it will be of
great advantage to the young Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42016:96"/>
who while he imployes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
in ſuch ſervices as theſe for the
elder gains (beſides what is learnt
from Books and Authors) his long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſees his Patients, hears him
diſcourſe of their ſeveral Caſes, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Medicines provided for them,
and obſerves their ſeveral effects: All
which advantages are now given away
in vain to Apothecaries, to whom the
practice of Phyſick does not belong.
And if this has been the courſe that all
mankinde has ever taken to raiſe and
propagate practical arts, and trades of
daily uſe in humane life, why ſhould
it not be uſed in Phyſick, which is a
practical Art of much greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
eſpecially if we conſider how
dangerous the errours of this Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are, and how neceſſary a practical
education is for any man that intends
the exerciſe of it. And though ſome
through pride or weakneſs diſgrace
this method as Mechanical; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt there are many ingenious
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42016:96"/>
young men in <hi>England,</hi> who would
be very glad, and take it for a great
honour to be thus received by ſome of
the Grandees and great Practitioners:
and their Friends think them well and
honourably imployed.</p>
               <p>But (to proceed in our diſcourſe,
which was interrupted by this ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Digreſſion) becauſe young Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
and ſuch as have little imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot allow an Apothecary
maintenance out of their ſmall gain;
it being therefore propoſed, That
Phyſitians enter into Societies or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,
(which indeed they do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and many ſuch there are now in
this City) more or fewer in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
according as they have greater
or leſs imployment: That theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a place which ſhall be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Laboratory, for the preparing of
all Phyſick, Chymical and Galenical.
That they alſo procure one or more
skilled in the Operations of both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
theſe to have, either the profit
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42016:97"/>
profit of all the Medicines that ſhall
be prepared: or to have a certain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
or allowance from the Phyſitians,
yet to proceed to regiſter Bills, and
receive money, as if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
only for themſelves. So many
Phyſitians frequenting the Laborato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
will be a double advantage; for
if they meet with any new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
way of preparing any
ſort of Medicines, they will readily
communicate it for the benefit of the
Society: and ſo many ſuperviſing
Drugs and Operations, it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible to erre, and difficult
to cheat, if the Operator ſhould
have ſuch a deſign, which would be
the higheſt folly and madneſs in him
who makes no benefit thereof, but is
rather to his prejudice; as it will be
alſo eminently of the Phyſitians, who
therefore will not connive at, much
leſs incourage, any Practices of that
nature.</p>
               <p>But to be more particular, the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42016:97"/>
Reaſons and Advantages of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
are very many, and of great
Conſideration.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if this courſe be taken,
It will free the Phyſician from much
Anxiety and Hazard, from which, he
cannot plead exemption (if an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
conſiderative perſon) while he
depends on the honeſty, care, and
skill of an Apothecary, in whom
perhaps he hath little reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide,
upon ſome or all of thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
I have already mentioned:
Whereas now in this Conſtitution of
Pharmacy, the Phyſitian will be
ſatisfied his Medicines are good; and
that he cannot be injured by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or deſigne of unworthy, miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
or miſtakes of Ignorant or
Careleſs Apothecaries.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will alſo free the Patient
from fears, jealouſies, and dangers;
to which, they will be ſubject ſo long
as the Phyſitian ſhall repoſe ſo great
a part of their truſt in perſons, who
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42016:98"/>
do ſeldome faithfully diſcharge what
is committed to their care. How
great a ſatisfaction will it be to them,
for Phyſitians to put their affairs in
ſuch a Method, that all the Phyſick is
preſcribed, be prepared exactly after
the Phyſitians direction? and That it
will be very unlikely they ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from any of thoſe miſtakes and
miſcarriages, which have heretofore
often happened? For the Patient
knowing it is the Phyſitians intereſt to
take care that his Medicines be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
aright; that they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
under his inſpection; that the
Operators have no bias clapt upon
them, which ſhould make them run
aſide, will throughly acquieſce in
all that ſhall be done: which quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
compoſure, and ſatisfaction, will
promote the Cure, according to that
of <hi>Galen, Plures ſanat, cui plures
fidunt.</hi> There is greateſt ſucceſs where
people have moſt confidence. Which
in this caſe is far from preſumption;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42016:98"/>
For I ſee no reaſon, why they may
not promiſe to themſelves, and expect
better ſucceſs from Medicines, that
are contrived with skill, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the greateſt care; than
from ſuch as are careleſly and ſlightly
made, or which is worſe, Adulterated.
Which brings to my mind a third Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If this courſe be taken, it will
render Phyſick more ſucceſsful. For
Medicines will be better prepared,
than now they are, the Phyſician
taking care himſelf to have nothing
but what is good; which he could not
ſo well do, when it was made up out
of his ſight. Beſides, He is under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of taking greater care to have
all he uſes very good, and moſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prepared; for no man can now lay
any miſcarriage on the neglect or
ignorance of an Apothecary. It reſts
altogether on himſelf, and he becomes
reſponſible for it.</p>
               <p>Further, the Profeſſion of Phyſick
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42016:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be exerciſed with greater ſucceſs,
if Phyſitians prepare and diſpenſe
their own Medicines, than now it is;
becauſe then, all ſorts of men would
apply themſelves immediately to the
Phyſitian, whereby he will have
opportunities of ſeeing the diſeaſe in
its firſt riſe, which gives him a mighty
advantage, for the true underſtanding
and cure of it. Whereas now it is the
unhappineſs of the Phyſitian (and
indeed chiefly of the Patient) that
he is never almoſt ſent for, till things
are brought to extremity, and all
opportunities of curing neer loſt;
Whereas if the Diſeaſe had been
encountred in the firſt riſe of it, with
powerful and convenient Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Patient had been again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to health: whoſe life it may be
muſt now anſwer for the firſt omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Beſides, that the Diſeaſe if met
in the beginning, is often carried off
with a little matter; which neglected,
requires a long and troubleſome
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42016:99"/>
courſe: Not to inſiſt on this, that
more coming than formerly to the
Phyſitian, enlarges his buſineſs, and
experience. Neither is it a mean
convenience, that Phyſitians will have
no temptations, to recede from
experimented Methods and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
which I fear now they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do, eſpecially if they are eaſie,
or obvious, leſt they ſhould bring
themſelves into contempt with Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
and diſcover their practice;
ſo as they might uſe it to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
which is now frequently done.
Neither need they adde more Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
than are neceſſary, or thoſe
that are of great price, and little effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
to ſerve diſhonourable Intereſts.
And preparing themſelves the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
they give, will help them better to
remember what had a good effect,
and which had not, ot failed; and how
to accomodate themſelves to the ſame
perſons at other times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This will mightily abate the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42016:100"/>
charge and expenſe of Phyſick, the
Phyſitians being contented with ſuch
moderate prices for their Medicines,
as will diſcharge what they expend for
Drugs in their Laboratories, among
Servants and Operators; ſo that if at
the years end their receipts for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
amount to ſo much as they
have expended on them, it is all they
promiſe themſelves, or expect from
others. For the Phyſitian will not, as
the Apothecary now doth, depend
upon the gain of the Phyſick he ſells
to ſuch as come to him; but as he did
before upon the Fees which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from perſons of condition and
ability, when he is ſent for out of his
own houſe: for the trouble of ſelling
his own Phyſick, he takes upon him
only to advance the publick Intereſt,
ſatisfie himſelf more in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
miniſter to the neceſſities of
the poor, and conſult the greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of all. Now the charge of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
(upon a modeſt compute) if
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42016:100"/>
this courſe be taken, will not ariſe to a
ſixth part of what is now paid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it; for we can buy Druggs as
cheap as any retail, Apothecaries, and
every Phyſitian or Aſſociation of them,
knowing what Compoſitions they
ſhall chiefly have occaſion for, ſuch
only are prepared, and ſo much of
them, as they conjecture may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
till they have an opportunity
again to make them, which ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be when the Ingredients are
fulleſt of vertue and vigour. By which
means they will avoid that great loſs
of Medicines which is frequent in an
honeſt Apothecaries ſhop, where many
Compoſitions are made, that are not
uſed ſix times in a year; may perhaps
not once in ſix years, as I have heard
many of them ſeriouſly proteſt: which
muſt neceſſarily occaſion great loſſes,
unleſs they are kept till they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to vend them, as moſt of
them do, although they retain nothing
of the Medicine, they once were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42016:101"/>
the Name. So that in this caſe
the Apothecary is inevitably expoſed
either to be a looſer, or become diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt,
This is to the prejudice of
the patient, the other of himſelf, who
muſt endeavour to repair his loſſes,
by inhauncing the prizes of thoſe that
remain; which doth alſo obliquely
reflect on the patient, although of the
two 'tis more excuſable, and both
of them are avoided, by the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
we have propoſed; Where the
Medicines will be aſſuredly good, the
Phyſitians intereſt obliging him to
look to that, and withal afforded
cheap, I mean at the ſame prizes
they coſt him; Phyſitians being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
requited for their care and
pains in ſeeing to the preparing their
own Medicines by the ſucceſs they
will have, and by it's neceſſary Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant,
a full Imployment. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Phyſitian ſhould ſell his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to the meaner ſort of people, who
give him nothing for his advice, as
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42016:101"/>
dear as the Apothecary now doth, it is
ſtill a great benefit to them, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
advice and Phyſick too for the
ſame rate they paid for Phyſick alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The leaving off the common
way of ſending Patients to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
will be a great caſe to the
publike; eſpecially to the poorer ſort
of people, to whom now the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
will have a fair advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charitable, and exceedingly help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as he will be: either if he let them
have their Phyſick at the ſame price it
coſt him, beſtow it on them freely
or (which I ſuppoſe will be moſt
uſual) teach them how to prepare it
themſelves. For it's well known that
Phyſitians who are Maſters of method,
and well acquainted with the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
properties of ſimples, do often
effect great cures, by means, which to
an injudicious Perſon will ſeem ſlight
or trivial. And indeed if we ſeriouſly
conſider things, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that nature hath made perhaps
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42016:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no leſs plentiful proviſion of remedies
for the poor than for the rich, that
Diſeaſes may be cured in the abſence
of <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> and coſtly Elixirs;
without Magiſterial Syrups, <hi>Apozems</hi>
or other chargeable Compoſitions.
We have I perſwade my ſelf Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
at our doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or neer us; we
need only gather, and ſlightly prepare
them, and certainly 'tis no great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
or trouble to make an Infuſion
or Decoction, to expreſs the juyce,
or dry the herb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and employ the
powder: and yet theſe eaſie and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preparations are oftentimes (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
uſually) no leſs effectual then
thoſe which are more elaborate.
Now of how great advantage is it to
the poor to be adopted Apothecaries
by the Phyſitian; and inſtructed how
to make their own phyſick, which
coſts them nothing but a little labour?
Theſe otherwiſe by reaſon of poverty
muſt commit all to Nature, whereby
they are often expoſed to a manifeſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42016:102"/>
hazard; and many die who if they
had ſeaſonably conſulted the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
might have been reſcued with
ſome common familiar remedy. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
we ſhall frequently have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of obliging the poor in
another way; For Phyſitians having
for their patients many Ladies,
Gentlewomen and other Perſons of
Conſideration or Qualitys, whoſe
charitable inclinations diſpoſe them
not only to feed and clothe the poor,
but alſo to ſupply them with Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
if they knew what was proper
for their Diſeaſes, now a Phyſitian
knowing what Diſtempers are moſt
frequent in his neighbourhood, can
inſtruct them what proviſion they
ſhould make in Order to their Cure,
of Drugs, Simple diſtilled Waters,
Syrups, Conſerves, Spirituous or
Cordial-waters; and thoſe much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any which are made in the
Apothecaries ſhops. For I ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
truth, if I did not acknowledge
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42016:103"/>
to the honour of that Curious Sex,
that all thoſe preparations they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
make, are much ſuperior to
any the Apothecaries can produce.
Now what I have mentioned, is not a
meer ſuppoſition, or a thing deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but is daily practiced by many
tender, ſweet-natur'd Creatures: and
if all Phyſitians improve the Intereſt
they have in Wealthy, Generous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
I perſwade my ſelf it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a general Practice. Which if it
ſhould, as theſe gallant perſons will
be commended by all men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
by thoſe towards whom they
exerciſe this beneficial Charity; ſo
without doubt theſe Actions will
be acceptable to God, and have their
reward in this life, and in that which
is to come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This will be of high advantage
to Phyſitians, and thoſe Patients of
theirs that live in the Country, where
multitudes miſcarry, (and many even
among the Gentry,) either under bad
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42016:103"/>
or for want of good Phyſick. For the
Country Apothecaries not having
certain vent for their Medicines, and
few among them being well skilled in
their Compoſition, to avoid charge
and trouble, buy ſuch things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they
have moſt frequently occaſion for, of
<hi>London</hi> Apothecaries who ſell Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
cheaper than the others can
make them; and well they may, they
being either the refuſe of their Shops,
or fraudulently compounded, I mean,
made either with old or periſhed
Drugs: or elſe they leave out the
moſt coſtly, which are often the moſt
effectual and active Ingredients. Now
Phyſitians in the Country comporting
with the common way of ſending pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
to the Apothecary, eſpecially
thoſe that concern perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
Which Phyſick, what effects it is
like to have, I leave to others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture;
for my own part I will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That any are diſpatched by it
(though we have little reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:42016:104"/>
                  <hi>bad Phyſick</hi> can have <hi>good effects)</hi>
but of this I am <hi>moſt certain,</hi> that it lets
many die (which is little better) whom
probably it would have reſtored, had
it been ſuch as the Phyſitian preſumes
the Apothecary is furniſhed with.
And but that it is contrary to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the deſign of this Diſcourſe,
to divulge any thing which might be a
reproach to particular perſons, I
could name ſeveral gallant Gentlemen,
exceedingly beloved in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
wherein they were very uſeful;
who miſcarried, as is verily thought
(by thoſe that are competent Judges)
between the neglect and baſeneſs of
the Country and City Apothecaries.
Whereas, when it ſhall be once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by the Colledge of Phyſitians,
That it ſhall be accounted to diſgrace
for any to prepare their own Phyſick;
this will be the moſt pleaſing News
that can come to Phyſitians who live
remote from great Cities, and have
hitherto abſtained from that practice,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42016:104"/>
only to maintain their reputation,
the Apothecaries and their adherents,
endeavouring to blaſt the repute of
thoſe that provide, and give their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
themſelves; branding them,
in all Companies, with the ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Titles of <hi>Empirick,</hi> and <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banck:</hi>
which injurious deſign often
takes effect among thoſe half-witted
people, that are greater admirers of
Formality, than Realities. But the
Colledge having publiſhed ſuch a
Declaration, as I have mentioned,
Phyſitians will receive greater encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from diſcerning perſons,
who certainly will be beſt ſatisfied
with their Phyſick, when they have it
from the Phyſitian himſelf, which
ſurely will be as good as he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
or <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ke; otherwiſe he will ruine
his Patient, his Reputation, and indeed
himſelf by the loſs of his livelyhood,
and ſubſiſtence: for now if the ſick
miſcarry, from any defects in the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
the Phyſitian only can be blamed,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42016:105"/>
it proceeding from his ignorance, or
neglect, that he provided not better.
Beſides, in many parts of <hi>England,</hi>
there are no Apothecaries, or the
people are ſo poor, that the expenſe of
Phyſick is intolerable to them; and
therefore the Phyſitian cannot help
them, if he preſcribe only Shop-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
               <p>Now, Is it not a great ſhame, that
Phyſicians ſhould not be able to teach
the poor, how to provide themſelves
with ſutable Remedies? eſpecially in
the Country where Nature hath open
ſo rich and large a ſhop, ſtored with
all thoſe materials Phyſitians can have
occaſion for, who want only the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their virtues, or how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them: with both which they
will better acquaint themſe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, when
they leave off the Apothecaries, and
take Pharmacy into their own hands,
which brings to my mind, thoſe other
Advantages that will attend ſuch a
ſtate of Phyſick.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:42016:105"/>
7. Phyſitians preparing their own
Medicines, and giving or ſelling them
to the poor, without expecting any
thing for advice, is a great advantage
to the Publick, as it overthrows the
practice of perſons that are ignorant
of the Art of Phyſick, who now
take on them to Adminiſter it, to the
great prejudice and dammage of the
people; eſpecially the meaner ſort, who
now the charge of advice is taken
away, and that of Phyſick leſſened,
will much more willingly addreſs
themſelves to ſober intelligent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
than to Apothecaries, and
other Quacks or Mountebanks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This improvement of Phyſick
will be of great advantage to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe thereby the practice
of Phyſick being taken from thoſe
who have hitherto uſurped it, and
intirely ſecured to ſober, learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
will afford them ſomewhat
more than an handſome ſubſiſtance;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42016:106"/>
which of all perſons living, they are
moſt capable of improving, and moſt
ready to imploy in Phyſiological Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches.
This overplus will enable
them to be much converſant with
<hi>Anatomical experiments,</hi> not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Man, but other Animals; that
by comparing their ſtructures, they
may attain to the knowledge of the
true and natural uſes of each part:
they will alſo buſie themſelves more
about the inveſtigation of the nature
and properties of Simples, and be
more frequent in the practice of their
compoſition; and ſome it's probable
will engage deeply in Chymiſtry, a
moſt noble Invention, which ſeems
equally calculated for the benefit of
Medicine, and Advantage of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pharmacy being in
the hands of Phyſitians, will give
them many and great opportunities of
advancing the Knowledge of Nature;
<hi>Becauſe</hi> (as a Learned perſon hath ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:42016:106"/>
obſerved) <hi>Phyſitians will
then be frequently invited to take notice
of many excellent</hi> Phaenomena, <hi>for the
uſe and ſervice of Philoſophy, which now
paſs unregarded in the hands of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
and their Servants.</hi> 
                  <q>Beſides,
that by obſerving the ſeveral muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which happen in the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Medicines, as well Simple as
Compound, they will be aſſiſted to
conſider what effects may happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their mixture with the blood or
other juyces of the body; and give
a great light to the Reaſons of all
the Appearances of Health and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But above all other parts of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
Chymiſtry will moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
manifeſt its uſefulneſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the improvement of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
which it doth moſt ſignally
promote, by diſcovering the nature
and properties of thoſe Subjects,
which are expoſed to its Operations:
as it gives us a great inſight into the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42016:107"/>
nature of thoſe ſimple affections of
Bodies, we call Qualities, The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof is the baſis of a ſolid
natural Philoſophy; as it acquaints us
with the conſtitutive Principles of moſt
Bodies, whether Vegetable, Animal,
or Mineral; informes us what are the
great Principles or Springs of action
in the production, preſervation, and
deſtruction, or diſſolution of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes.
In a word, there is no part of
Natural Philoſophy, which it doth'
not highly illuſtrate and enrich, with
many noble experiments and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which would paſs unheeded
by common, incurious Chymiſts or
Operators: But will be highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by judicious, obſerving Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
in Order to the increaſing our
knowledge of Nature, and our Power
over her, which are the main intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Philoſophy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Phyſitians taking Pharmacy into
their own hand, will be a profitable
means of improving it. For firſt, it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42016:107"/>
may be a means of inlarging the extent
of the <hi>Materia Medica;</hi> and therein
chiefly our knowledge of their Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Virtues. For then, there will be
a more immediate converſe between
Phyſitians, Druggiſts, and Merchants;
which will be an occaſion of bringing
into uſe many excellent Drugs we
know nothing of, but what we read
in Authors: by whoſe directions, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
can give them advice where
they may be procured; how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate
the good from the bad, the
Genuine from ſuch as are Spurious,
and Sophiſticated; they can alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Merchants or Druggiſts how
to preſerve many of them, which for
want of a little care or skill, looſe
moſt of their virtues, before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at theſe parts. And as to what
belongs to the Specifick properties of
Simples, It is generally acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that of late they have been too
much neglected. Now this is the
only way to retrieve and improve that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42016:108"/>
knowledge, which will, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
be greatly enlarged by ſome
new ways of Analyzing Vegetables
lately invented; and which will be
ſuddenly communicated. From which
we may derive fair conjectures, not
only what their Conſtitutive Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are, and what proportion of each
Principle is in every Concrete; but
ſome other hints will be given by
ſome, of theſe Methods of Operating
on them, which will not meanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to diſcover their hidden proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
of which I muſt ſay no more at
preſent. Whereas it's well known
that the Apothecaries have very little
of Curioſity, being rarely tempted to
make any experiment, out of the
Road of our Diſpenſatory: So that
Pharmacy may degenerate, as it doth
daily, every one ſtriving to make Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
cheaper, but few being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to have them better than
others. Now Phyſitians, as they are
more judicious; and underſtand the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42016:108"/>
grounds of Pharmacy much better
than the Apothecaries, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by ſome of their accurate wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
on this ſubject; and may be ſeen
in their ordinary preſcriptions; many
whereof are as exact, and the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
no leſs Judiciouſly diſpos'd,
than in thoſe proceſſes we find in
<hi>Pharmacopoeas.</hi> They are alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with many excellent Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
and <hi>Galenical</hi> Preparations
which have been either Invented, or
publiſhed, ſince our Diſpenſatory
was laſt reviſed; and moſt know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Methods of preparing many of
thoſe Medicines that come frequently
in uſe, as of ſimple diſtilled Waters,
Syrups, Spirits, Extracts, Tinctures,
Magiſteries, as alſo of ſeveral Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Preparations which may be made
in leſs time, and with leſs expenſe
then they now are, ſome Ingredients
being ſuperfluous, adding nothing
but trouble, and expenſe to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Preparation. Farther it
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42016:109"/>
being, as I have ſhewed, the Intereſt
of every Phyſitian to have his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
well made, there will ariſe a
generous emulation between Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,
who ſhall exceed in that
kind, which will put them on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and Experiments. The reſult
whereof muſt neceſſarily be of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
advantage; for ſomewhat amiſs
in former preparations will daily be
diſcovered and corrected, inſtead of
which, additions and improvements
may be made: ſo that probably in a
few years, Pharmacy will be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what it now is, and
greater ſucceſs will attend better
Medicines, Which will heighten the
honour of that Noble profeſſion
which ſeems now to languiſh for
want of ſome ſuch Remedy; add to
the repute of Phyſitians; and be highly
beneficial to the Patient, whoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
will be cured more certainly,
ſpeedily, with greater ſecurity, and
more pleaſure (if there is any in cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Phyſick.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:42016:109"/>
And here, ſince I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to reflect (a little unhandſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it may ſeem to ſome) on our own
Diſpenſatory, I am forced to make a
digreſſion. The ſubſtance whereof is,
that 'tis not my Opinion only; but
the perſwaſion of moſt Phyſitians who
are but indifferently acquainted with
thoſe Methods of preparing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
which are of recent invention,
That our Diſpenſatory is ſo far from
being arrived at the higheſt degree of
perfection, that on the contrary it is
moſt manifeſtly, and in many reſpects
very defective, abounding with pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Preſcriptions, ſome whereof
ſeldom, if ever, come in uſe; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Compound Remedies have been
recently invented or divulged, which
are of greater efficacy and larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
than the beſt our Diſpenſatory can
boaſt of. Beſides in many of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
that are of frequent uſe, there
are ſuperfluous Ingredients, which
add indeed to the trouble and charge
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:42016:110"/>
we are at in compounding them;
but little to the vertues of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
which would be better diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if they were omitted, the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being rather clog'd than impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them. And beſides, Modern
Induſtry, and Invention, hath found
our better Manuals or Methods of
Compounding Medicines, whereby
the Ingredients are better opened,
more exactly mixed, and in ſome
more highly depurated; I mean, where
the Active parts are freed from thoſe
groſs uſeleſs portions of their bodies,
which hindred them from exerting
their ſalutary properties. And there
are many Natural, Genuine, eaſie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of preparing Simples, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vegetable, whereby their whole
Craſis is preſerved intire, their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
being rather heightned, then in the
leaſt impaired; which taken in a
ſmall Doſe are more effectual than
whole pounds of the Vulgar waters,
Syrups or Electuaries. And as they
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:42016:110"/>
are not ingrateful to the palate; So
neither doth the Stomach Nauſeate
them. And they have this further
priviledge, that in ſome years their
vertue doth not ſenſibly decay, not
are they ſubject to corruption, as
the ſhop-Preparations; and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Honey, Sugar nor any Saccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
ſubſtance is imployed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them, their own ſimplicity or
their being exactly freed from groſs
unſutable parts, which are uſually
the occaſional cauſes of fermentation
and putrefaction, rendering them
leſs liable to theſe deſtructive opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Beſides it hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of Phyſitians for many ages,
that Flowers which ſeem to be made
up of the moſt fine and active parts of
the whole Vegetable, and are probably
enobled with Extraordinary vertues,
do, in moſt of the Operations they are
expoſed to, looſe thoſe ſubtile portions
of matter, from which we might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
our ſelves great effects. And I
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42016:111"/>
confeſs it ſeems highly probable to
me, that flowers are the <hi>Compendium</hi>
of the whole plant, and poſſeſs more
of their Medical vertues in a little
room, than is contained in a far greater
quantity of leaves, ſtalk, root, or
fruit; and the wiſe contriver of the
Univerſe ſeems to have deſtined them
chiefly for Medicine. I ſhall not here
mention thoſe reaſons and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which inſpire me with this
perſwaſion; only this I dare affirm, that
they afford more Noble Medicines, if
truly prepared, than any other part
of the Vegetable: at leaſt ſo far as I
have made tryal. Now the ſhops
employ the flowers, either dried,
and then a great part of the Volatile
active parts are exhaled, which being
after decocted leave behind them a
ſcarce ſenſible impreſſion of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
Or elſe they are beat up with
Sugar into Conſerves, which doth,
as I could manifeſt at large, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
wholly change the properties of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:42016:111"/>
theſe otherwiſe Active ſubſtances:
The ſame happens alſo in Syrups
and all other preparations, where
Sugar is imployed. For although
many perſwade themſelves that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
is a moſt Innocent thing, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Simples and their parts from
putrefaction; and that it doth not
make the leaſt change in the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
it is imployed to preſerve:
yet by their leave I do aſſert that it is
highly queſtionable, whether ſimples
mixed therewith do not looſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of thoſe Properties, with which
by nature they were endowed, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
being an Active body, a ſweet
Salt (for ſo it may be ſtyled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Soloeciſme, I having often made
a Salt ſweeter then Sugar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
either very Acid, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Fiery) and is a potent
<hi>Menstruum</hi> or diſſolver of bodies.
And though Metals are commonly
reputed indeſtructible, it being well
known that they are recovered from
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:42016:112"/>
all ordinary Solvents, the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
without any alterations that
they were when firſt expoſed to
their Actions; for notwithſtanding that
they are ſometimes diſguiſed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the form of Volatile
Salts, lovely Cryſtals, or are brought
over in the form of an Oyl ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on water (both which I have had
my ſelf from them) nevertheleſs after
all theſe Operations, the Metals
are eaſily reduced into the ſame for
weight, colour and other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and yet the Calces of theſe
ſeemingly indeſtructible bodies, by
a ſlight manual with Sugar over a
Kitchin fire are ſo ſtrangely alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that none of the ordinary
ways of Reduction will recover them
their Metalline form. And ſo mild
an Ingredient of Medicines as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
only by Diſtillation is made,
as Corroſive and pernicious as any
<hi>Aqua fortis</hi> made with Salt-Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Vitriol, diſſolving Metals
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42016:112"/>
much after the ſame manner. If
then Sugar and Honey may, and do
probably often ſuperinduce another
Texture, and other qualities than
they found in Vegetables, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former, it were adviſable,
that beſides theſe Preparations we
uſed others, at leaſt on extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
occaſions; wherein the vertues
of the ſimples are preſerved more
intire: and wherein much is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred
in a little room. I will
not deny but there is more
trouble in making the latter, than
the former; but extraordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
will be an abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
for the expence of time and
trouble, the charge being rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
or at leaſt but equal to
what the vulgar Shop-Medicines
now coſt: a ſmall Doſe of thoſe
being likely to prove more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
then a great Quantity of theſe.
And as for Flowers which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this digreſſion by a moſt facile
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42016:113"/>
and natural method without any
additament, or ſo much as the
help of Culinary fire, they may be
converted into Liquors exceedingly
Spirituous; and which may be kept
without loſs of vertue many years.
But of this the world will ſhortly,
I ſuppoſe, have a more particular
account; and therefore I ſhall let
it paſs without any further Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>ut if it be enquired, <hi>What Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of Vegetables they are, which
are pretended to retain the whole
Craſis and Vertues of the Vegetables
intire?</hi>B</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The Eſſences made by
Diſtillation, <hi>per deſcenſum,</hi> in the Sun,
which by other eaſie Operations, are
further purified and exalted: the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
Salts of Vegetables, I mean
not the vulgar, but ſuch as have the
exact taſt and ſmell of the Vegetables
that afforded them, whoſe active parts
are moſt evidently united in the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42016:113"/>
Cryſtalline Salts, as appears by the
effects; as alſo from this, that if the
<hi>Capious faeces</hi> be Diſtilled, they yield
only an inſipid Phlegm, and a very
ſmall portion of groſs faeculent Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reumatical
Oyl: and afterwards the
<hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> calcined never ſo long,
yields no fixed Salt, which is in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
form in the Eſſential, united with
the active Principles of Spirit and Oyl,
as appears upon Diſtillation. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe, the Eſſences of Vegetables
made by the union of their pungent
vinous Spirits, eſſential Oyles, and
highly depurate fixed Salts, which by
iterated Cohobations become a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Liquor, wherein the Principles
are inſeparably united, are noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
and though I do not affirm,
that they retain all the Specifical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of their Vegetables: yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf, that if they want any,
this defect is abundantly ſupplyed by
the acqueſt of new, which perhaps
in many caſes are much ſuperiour to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42016:114"/>
what we could expect from the crude
plant, moſt exactly appropriated. And
that in a word I may manifeſt, how
great alterations may be made on
Vegetables by ſlight means, I will
mention one Method more of dealing
with them; whereby without any other
additament than what they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the Air, the leaves of all
Vegetables being duly fermented and
diſtilled, yield copiouſly a Liquour
which rectified, is not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from Spirit of Blood, Soot,
Harts-horn, or other urinous Spirits
or Salts: and mixed with highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmed
Spirit of wine, they concoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
into the <hi>Offa alba.</hi> And though
ſome herbs, as Wormwood, <hi>Carduus
Benedictus,</hi> Mugwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yield it more
plentifully then others; yet all yield
ſo much that a large Retort filled only
with common Graſs thus ordered,
gives at leaſt a pint of this ſubtile, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
Spirit: which if often rectified,
appeares in a Saline form, and is as
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42016:114"/>
penetrating and fugitive, as the Salt
of fermented Urine. As for the <hi>Caput
mortuum,</hi> in vain do you expect a fixt
Salt in it; That being made ſuch
by the action of the Fire; it being vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile
not fixed in the Vegetable, as
this natural way of <hi>Analyſis</hi> evinces. I
have by me an intire diſcourſe on this
ſubject; wherein there is a great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
(I had almoſt ſaid infinity) of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
and obſervations. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I am apt to flatter my ſelf into
a belief, that this is the true, genuine,
and univerſal way of extricating the
component Principles of Vegetables;
and that it will give us a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
into their nature, than any thing
which hath been hitherto made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
Beſides, there appear during
theſe Operations many things, which
will prove highly inſtructive to thoſe
that Philoſophize on other Subjects.
But to return into the way from which
we were diverted, I affirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42016:115"/>
That, Phyſitians preparing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing
their own Medicines will be
of great advantage to the Publike, as it
confirms the health of the weak, and
reſcues many from diſeaſes, who
would otherwiſe faint under them,
This addition to the number of the
living, and increaſe of their ſtrength,
being of no mean importance, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and proſperity of a Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in a multitude of ſound minds
animating healthful bodies; whereby
they are rendred fit for the Arts of
War and Peace. And therefore, we
may preſume that publick perſons,
whether the moſt ſupreme or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Magiſtrates, will be ſo far from
oppoſing ſuch a reformation as this
we deſign; that they will give us all
the encouragement and aſſiſtance we
can deſire. And queſtionleſs, if there
be any Impediments or Obſtacles,
which Phyſitians themſelves cannot
remove, as I hope there are not many,
they have reaſon to reſt aſſured; that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42016:115"/>
our Great and Wiſe Counſel will in
ſuch caſes interpoſe their Authority,
which will extirpate whatſoever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
it ſelf to ſo juſt and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deſigns. For where any thing is
of publick advantage, what ſhould
hinder its propoſers from expecting
publick Countenance? It being well
known, that in all well founded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
where there is a union of
intereſts, there will be united Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and Endeavours. And we may
farther encourage our ſelves from
hence, that they who are ſo tender of
every mans propriety, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
every invaſion thereof, an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
done to themſelves, will not deny
their aſſiſtance to Phyſitians, whoſe
propriety alſo is ſtrangely invaded,
the Uſurpers now being almoſt ready
to plead Preſcription. And beſides,
we ſuppoſe that they who are ſo much
concerned to keep every man in quiet
poſſeſſion of his own eſtate, will not
be wanting to thoſe who would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42016:116"/>
to render them more ſecure of
their lives; which are of ſomewhat
greater value. And that the lives of
many are frequently indangered by
ignorant, bold, daring Apothecaries
and Empiricks, hath been made ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
manifeſt.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, If Phyſick be
really, as is pretended, a uſeful Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the Publick ought to take care it
do not degenerate; and that its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Profeſſors be not diſcouraged, or
deprived of an honourable ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
For it hath been ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
That where any Art receives
greateſt encouragement, there it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ariſes to its higheſt perfection; and
where its much ſlighted, there it ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
declines: The Artiſts either lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoſe places, or applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the ſtudy and exerciſe of
more profitable imployments. This
will be exactly the caſe of Phyſick,
which whileſt it is eſtabliſhed in that
degree of Honour and Eſteem it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:42016:116"/>
may juſtly challenge, and the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
thereof are liberally rewarded,
and duly reſpected: this countenance
will exceedingly heighten their Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
and put them on Actions which
may manifeſt to the World, that they
do, in ſome meaſure, deſerve the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it ſhews them. So that ſome will
cultivate the Anatomy both of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and its humours, endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
themſelves and the World
with the admirable Fabrick and uſe of
thoſe parts whereof Man is compoſed,
and the nature of thoſe humours
which produce ſuch admirable effects
as are dayly obſerved. They will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ceaſe till they have inveſtigated
the nature of the ſtomach's ferment,
a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> ſo univerſal, that there
is ſcarcely any Animal Vegetable,
nay, even Mineral ſubſtances, which
can elude its diſſolving property, they
being all by it reduced into a ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
homogeneous milky liquor; they
will then enquire how this comes to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42016:117"/>
be tincted with a noble purple dye,
which they find it puts on ſoon after
its admiſſion into the bloud, and how
that nouriſhes all parts, leaving with
each what is ſuitable to its nature, and
then returns again for freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
running this round without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion
till death puts a period to its
Courſe. They will further examine
the frame of the Lungs, the nature
and properties of that air whereby
they are dilated, its uſe in reference
to reſpiration, and whence it is that
we cannot ſubſiſt a minute without it.
They will alſo more attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the nature of the Nervous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
and that truly admirable effect
thereof, Muſcular motion; where ſmall
chords, by means of a little ſpirituous
Juyce, helped with an advantageous
ſituation, perform actions which would
appear ſtupendous if they were not
common: And are a Subject which
hath hitherto ſufficiently exerciſed the
greateſt Wits later or former Ages
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42016:117"/>
ever produced: But nothing will more
deſerve their attentive conſideration
than the propagation of the Species, in
which proceſs there is not a greater or
more pleaſant variety than obſcurity:
The one ſerves to excite Deſire, the
other to heighten Induſtry; and there
is no Phyſician, who hath any ſpark of
Curioſity, or ſenſe of his Duty, and
ſufficient Encouragement, but will
endeavour to acquaint himſelf with
theſe great Proceſſes of Nature; I
mean, the preparation of the food, its
Diſtribution, Reſpiration, Muſcular
motion, and Generation: To which
we may add, the excluſion of what is
uſeleſs or burdenſome. And then he
can be no longer a ſtranger to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
actings, and knows what are
moſt likely to continue them ſuch
without interruption. But before this
excellent Perſon we would here cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize,
I mean, a true Phyſitian,
attains to this knowledge he is at the
expenſe of much money, time, and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42016:118"/>
trouble; for howſoever Providence
might deal with the <hi>Protoplaſt,</hi> the
wiſeſt of Kings, or others in former
Ages, and whatſoever ſome now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the contrary, we cannot find
that this Skill comes by inſpiration,
but is the reſult of innumerable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
and Obſervations. One diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection
of a dead man is not ſufficient
to inform him of his frame, doth not
learn him the uſe or function of each
part; he converſes with many other
Animals living or dead, whereon he
makes numerous experiments, which
by Analogy and Induction he aptly
applies to Man. Neither doth his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
toyl here end, this is but the
<hi>Praeludium</hi> and moſt pleaſant part
thereof. He is forced therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the body of Man, not only as
an Engine of curious and admirable
contrivance, of unmatchable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
wherein nothing beſides
beauty and order appears: But alſo
as a Machine, which conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42016:118"/>
parts, and having great variety of
motions, is often out of order, ſeldom
long performing them all with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
exactneſs, but ſometimes gives the
skilful Artiſt an opportunity to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
that he knows much of its nature
and contrivance, by redreſſing what
was amiſs, and ſome waies ſupplying
its defects. It is needleſs to mention
thoſe many diſeaſes Man is ſubject to,
there being no perſon that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
himſelf, and others, who hath
not a Scheme of them in his memory;
and yet, although the Anomalies mans
body is ſubject to are ſo numerous,
and many among them appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
formidable to moſt Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
they may be all removed by
the skill of a Judicious Phyſitian. But
how great is his care, how unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
his trouble, before he attain to
the knowledge of the Symptomes and
cure of Diſeaſes? How often is his
mind upon a Rack, and he frequently
perhaps too anxiouſly ſolicitous for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42016:119"/>
his afflicted neighbour? He makes it
his buſineſs to enquire into all thoſe
helps Nature or Art can afford him,
which may prove conducive to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
their recovery; he many waies
examines Simples, and uſes all means
to extort from them a Confeſſion of
their nature, deliberates whether he
ſhould imploy them in their ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
ſlightly, or more elaborately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared;
and when he hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
adminiſters them with all due
Circumſtances. Now, ſurely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
himſelf of the Medicinal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of Simples, to know how skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to mix, compound, and ſutably
apply them, as it is no mean Art, ſo
neither is it an eaſie labour, or an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
trouble, whether he derive his
knowledge from thoſe that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him in the ſame Faculty, or
from his own perſonal obſervations.
And if Phyſitians, who are of ſo clear
Judgments, ſo unparallel'd for Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
have no more reſpect or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42016:119"/>
than mean, empty, ſhallow
pretenders, we have reaſon to fear
that hereafter perſons of great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and liberal Education will ſcorn
to look towards a Faculty which,
though noble and honourable in its
own nature, is ſo low and mean in the
eſteem of the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
who hath the confidence to affirm
he is a Phyſitian, although perfectly
ignorant of the Rudiments of Phyſick,
ſhall yet have no leſs countenance
from the Publick, than thoſe gallant
perſons, who after a long courtſhip
have rendered nature familiar, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the cauſes and cure of
diſeaſes, and who have ſo well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of Mankind, that I cannot but
marſhal them next to thoſe Divine
Perſons, who alſo, as theſe, are often
ſlighted and neglected, <hi>although of
them the World is not worthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is now fit I ſhould leave theſe
idle melancholy ſpeculations, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
better things of the Publick, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:42016:120"/>
to ſober learned Phyſitians. For I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf, I may promiſe them
from Authority encouragement, and
aſſiſtance proportionable to their care
and ſucceſs; both which will be more
conſpicuous, if they prepare their own
Medicines: which I moſt paſſionately
commend to their Conſideration.
And that this Propoſition may meet
with a kind Reception, and be more
readily entertained, I will endeavour
to return ſatisfactory replies to
to whatſoever can be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, by either Apothecaries or
Phyſitians: For the moſt Noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
have ever met with great oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſometimes a propoſal, which
was made with a ſincere intention of
Publike benefit, hath occaſioned the
ruine or been otherwiſe prejudicial
to the propounders; which would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in this Caſe, ſuppoſing the Event
of affairs did depend on the will of
Apothecaries. But howſoever if they
are reſolute, and determine unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42016:120"/>
to oppoſe all reformation,
(which is ſufficiently probable) they,
and moſt of thoſe that are tied to
their Intereſts by alliances, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to poſſeſs the people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they come, with an Opinion of
the injuſtice, and unreaſonableneſs
of the Phyſitians cauſe, and as plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
as they can maintain their own
pretenſions; whereby they may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
many with prejudices againſt a
moſt honeſt and Honourable deſign,
who would otherwiſe have promoted
it: For hearing the plea, but of one
party which, if they proceed at the
uſual Rate, will be well ſtuffed with
falſities, denying many matters of fact,
which are notoriouſly ſcandalous, and
producing things in their own behalf,
which almoſt every Phyſitian can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
diſprove. So that thoſe perſons,
whom they ſhall thus abuſe, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
they are engaged in a good
cauſe, may unawares oppoſe Truth
and Equity, contrary to their Intention;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42016:121"/>
which they had never done, but
through miſinformation. Beſides the
Apothecaries may urge (where they
have not confidence to deny truths
as viſible as the Sun) that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of Reforming them are indeed
fine ſpun Speculations, but can no
ways be reduced to Practice; That
if the hedge be once broken, and
the Apothecaries discountenanced, it
will occaſion greater inconveniences
then thoſe, for which the Phyſitians
deſign a remedy.</p>
               <p>The Inconveniences are ſome ſuch
as theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt,<hi> It will be an Act of great
cruelty, adviſedly to deſign the Ruine
of ſo many Perſons, who have moſt
of them families to make Proviſion
for. Beſides that it will be a great injury
to the Publike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we anſwer, that the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
deſign no mans ruine, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
are Innocent, Rational, and
ſuch as will approve themſelves to all
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42016:121"/>
the world; And I ſuppoſe they are
ſo far from deſerving blame for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to reform abuſes, which
have crep't into their Faculty, that,
on the Contrary among wiſe people,
they will meet with great Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and Encouragement: And for
the Apothecaries to oppoſe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their credit by ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
will be Eclipſed, and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
gain diminiſhed, is, (pardon
the Compariſon) like <hi>Demetrius</hi> and
the Silver Smith's oppoſing the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
becauſe, if the people hearkned
to his wholſome Counſels, their
Trade would fall to decay; a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
way of Argumentation, and ſuch
as is in the mouth, only of ſelfiſh
perſons, who are more eager on
their Private gain, then the Publike
good. And the Apothecaries being
ſo little concerned for that, I admire
with what confidence they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Publike ſhould be ſo deeply
engaged with them in a Quarrel
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:42016:122"/>
againſt thoſe who are it's beſt friends,
and fall out with the Apothecaries,
only becauſe they are enemies to the
Publike; as moſt certainly they are if
the leaſt part of that be true we have
affirmed of them which whether it be,
let the world firſt examine, and after
determine. So that if the mentioned
plea of the Apothecaries paſs for le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
and valid, what ſort or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of men is there ſo baſe, and
vile, which may not uſe the ſame
Argument? Coyners, Robbers, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſes,
Sophiſticaters of wine, who
all pretend neceſſity of acting as they
do, that otherwiſe they cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
but the Law is ſo far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of ſuch idle pretences, that
it deſervedly, orders ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for ſuch as ſhall by fraud or
force deprive men of their Propreity.
And ſhall we animadvert with ſo
great ſeverity on thoſe that take away
unjuſtly an inconſiderable portion of
a mans Eſtate, without which he
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:42016:122"/>
can well ſubſiſt, and at the ſame
time take no notice of him, that ſhall
deprive men of health, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
life? This were like fiſhing with
that ſtrange net, which keeps little
fiſh and diſmiſſes the greater: There
is no reaſon we ſhould puniſh offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for ſlight faults, and find excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and evaſions for ſuch as are guilty
of greater crimes. In ſhort <q>where
the continuance of a few diſorderly
perſons in any place, employment,
or Publike capacity, is inconſiſtent
with the good and Welfare of the
Community, it is ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
and cruelty to reject them,
that it were both, ſhould we do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,</q>
which is the very caſe
of the Apothecaries, if their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
and practices be ſo danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as we have reported them. But to
be more particular in our reply, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſome deceit may be concealed
in univerſals; Firſt, I ſay if it be ſo
great cruelty to ruine many men in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:42016:123"/>
their Eſtates, how much greater is it
to expoſe as many, not once in
an age, but every year, to a manifeſt
hazard of loſs of health, or life which
are ſo much more conſiderable, that
the Eſtates and wealth of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
put into the balance againſt
the life of the meaneſt perſon in theſe
Nations, the latter will ſurely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate.
Therefore when we are
in ſuch ſtraits, that of two inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
we can avoid but one, none
but an Imprudent or mad perſon
will make choice of the greateſt: But
this is not our preſent Caſe. For all
ſuch Apothecaries, as are found to be
upright and honeſt, ſhall be well
provided for; and the remainder
may addict themſelves to other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions:
If they pretend unskilfulneſs,
no one will regard that frivolous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation,
who obſerves their frequent
intruſions into the Practiſe of Phyſick.
For w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, by what hath been ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
appear more unfit, then for any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42016:123"/>
or other imployment; to the
knowledge of whoſe Myſteries and
Intricacies they may certainly much
ſooner arrive, then of ſo profound a
Science as Phyſick. But to put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
to this Reply the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
may conſider, that there are in
this famous City, and many other
parts of <hi>England</hi> a great number of
Ingenious Perſons, whoſe ill fortune it
was to addict themſelves to the ſtudy
of Phyſick, (for the event plainly
ſhews it was their unhappineſs) theſe
after great expenſe of Money, after
long and intenſe Study, being become
well Qualify'd for the Practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
cannot have a ſubſiſtence, the
Apothecaries having more in their
own hands then would be a ſufficient
maintenance for ſome hundred ſuch
perſons, who are under ſo great
diſcouragements, through the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Injuſtice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
as none can imagine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe that converſe with them.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42016:124"/>
Now to retort the Apothecaries ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
upon themſelves with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
we ſay, that it is a high piece
of Cruelty and Injuſtice for the
Apothecaries to deprive ſo many
Learned, Ingenious Perſons of a
means to ſubſiſt. And I make full
account that the Practice which is in
the Apothecaries hand is as much
their due, as an inheritance, which is
held from the right owner by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
of ſome uſurper, and to take
the Practice out of their hands, and
turn it into the right Channel, deſerves
no more blame, than he that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
an inheritance long withheld to
the true owners; For ſince but one can
poſſeſs it, 'tis fit ſurely, that he to
whom of right it appertains ſhould
enjoy it, rather than any other, how
urgent ſoever his wants may be, how
great his neceſſities. Thus all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
duly weighed, it appears
evident that the inconveniences, ſome
few perſons will deſervedly labour
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42016:124"/>
under, is not comparable to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
the Publike will receive
from their Secluſion or Reformation.</p>
               <p>Another thing the Apothecaries
plead in their own behalf againſt the
Phyſitians, is, that they are like <hi>Aeſop's</hi>
Dog in the Manger (for ſuch an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
Expreſſion I heard one uſe)
who could not eat Hay himſelf, and
yet would not permit the Ox to feed
thereon. So the Phyſitians will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
take care of the poor themſelves,
nor permit the Apothecaries ſo to do,
who are chiefly Converſant among
them, adviſing and aſſiſting thoſe who
would meet with little other help,
they not being able to gratifie Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians;
who are (as one of their
worthy Authors ſays) like <hi>Balaam's</hi>
Aſs they cannot ſpeak till they ſee an
Angel. Theſe being neglected (as they
would perſwade the world) by Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
have recourſe to them; and they
it ſeems being prevailed on (Tender
Hearts!) by ſentiments of pity, let
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42016:125"/>
them have ſuch Medicines as they
think moſt appoſite to their diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever reads this plauſible ſtory
which the Apothecaries ſet off with
greater advantage than their Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
can, will look on the Phyſitians
as churliſh Levites, paſſing by their
diſtreſſed brother, not vouchſafing
him a ſingle regard; who there lies in
miſery and danger till he is reſcued
from both, by ſuch as vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſo many Charitable <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans:</hi>
But how well that title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
them, and how groſly and
palpably they have calumniated the
Phyſitians, will appear by the enſuing
Diſcourſe. Firſt, ſuppoſe the Phyſitians
ſhould ſay to them (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> yet they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do nor ever will) we cannot but
approve of your charity, although we
do not intend to imitate it; therefore
we give you free permiſſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
your ſelves as much as you pleaſe
for the poor, we allow you to adviſe,
and give them Phyſick, either freely:
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42016:125"/>
or to afford it at ſuch priſes as you may
be no gainers, ſo neither looſers. This
and a greater liberty we will allow
you, ſo that you tamper not with
the rich, to whom we will give bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advice and greater aſſiſtance than
any they can receive from you. Can
any man think, underſtands who
the Genius of the Apothecary, that
ſuch Language will be very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him? No, the Contrary is
well known, they make it more
their buſineſs than the tending of
their Shop is, to inſinuate themſelves
into the moſt wealthy families, and
find this Imployment more beneficial
then their obſervance of Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>But let us imagine, that our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
Shop is like an Hoſpital, to
which there is great reſort of poor
diſtreſſed people, all which he ſupplies
with ſutable remedies (we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the beſt) but upon what terms?
Truly on ſuch as are very beneficial
to himſelf. For, not a doſe of any
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42016:126"/>
thing goes out of the Shop, which is
not twice paid for; I mean is ſold for
double the value or price, for which
they might afford it, and yet be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
So that by this time we ſee the
Charity of the Apothecary is not ſo
Conſpicuous, as his Colluſion in
gratifying of others at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
And that what I have ſaid, are
no Fictions will be atteſted by great
numbers of Phyſitians, whoſe repute
was never yet ſtained by unhandſome
practices; and are ſo far from being
ſuch covetous, uncharitable perſons
as they repreſent them, that they
have on the contrary often given their
advice freely, refuſed money when it
was offered them, if they knew or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the condition of the perſon to
be very mean. And it's well known,
that ſcarce any Phyſitian exacts mony
of his Patient, what comes, is free gift,
not extorted; whereas the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie
will be paid by the poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately:
and he alwaies gains
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:42016:126"/>
more of them by his Phyſick, than
the Phyſitian hath ever for his advice.
Nay I am well acquainted with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Phyſicians, who pay their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
every year out of their own
Purſes, for a large Catalogue of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
they cauſe to be beſtowed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on poor Patients. I fear the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
cannot produce many ſuch
Examples of perſons in their own
faculty. And beſides, there is a great
company of Phyſitians, of whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I own my ſelf to be (and I am
confident many others, with whom
I am not acquainted, have the ſame
intentions) who have ſolemnly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themſelves to go at all times to
all Patients, poor as well as rich,
whenſoever they are called; and if
they are in a neceſſitous condition, to
give them their advice freely: only
they will be called by the Patients or
their friends, not by the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who will endeavour to give
them much unneceſſary trouble, and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42016:127"/>
put them to as many Inconveniences
as they can, that they may make a
benefit of their well-grounded refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.
If any perſon be taken Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
with Convulſions of any kind,
violent pains, or any other dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
diſeaſe or Symptome, we will
not at midnight decline giving them
viſits, although they dwell with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
it ſelf; But it's unreaſonable a
Phyſitian ſhould be called out of his
Bed on trivial occaſions, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
himſelf to do that, which without
any danger to the Patient, might be
deferred till morning. To invite a
Phyſitian to viſit them at unſeaſonable
times upon the aking of a tooth or
corn, a ſlight pain or lask of the belly,
or to cure diſeaſes which are extant
only in a depraved Fancy, is a moſt
unreaſonable requeſt, and ſuch as the
Apothecaries themſelves will not
comply with. And indeed Phyſitians
have been ever more ready (If I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them not, which I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly)
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42016:127"/>
to Viſit and Adviſe the poor,
where it has been only a deed of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and abſtracted from intereſt, than
the Apothecaries.</p>
               <p>Another Objection I have heard
ſome Apothecaries make againſt Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
diſpenſing their own Phyſick,
and deſerting them, is,<hi> That the publick
cannot with ſafety allow thereof; for
then Phyſitians might preſcribe their
Patients poyſon inſtead of ſalutary Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick:
and all this without any danger
to themſelves, if they have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of their Tongues and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
That this is prevented by ſending
Bills to the Apothecaries, which beſides
is a great convenience to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
for ſhould they be ſuſpected upon
ſome horrid Symptomes or ill Accidents
attending the Phyſick they preſcribe
(which the Apothecaries well know
ſometimes happens, rather from their
own careleſsneſs, unfaithfulneſs or
Ignorance, then the Phyſitians as I
have ſhewed) theſe ſurmiſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:42016:128"/>
quelled by the Phyſitians, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to his Bills on the File, which
on Examination being found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
nothing of that kind, for which
he is ſuſpected, he is without any more
ado acquitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection is ſo fraught with
malice, and deſign, that I cannot conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it without ſome Indignation.
This is the firſt time that ever I heard
Phyſitians were in danger of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Poyſoners; and I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that ever any were ſuſpected for
that fowl crime, although it's well
known the Apothecaries have not
eſcaped ſo well. But howſoever
this is a moſt frivolous Objection on
many accounts, for firſt, If Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were ſo wicked, as this Objection
ſuppoſes ſome of them to be, that
they ſhould deſign the deſtruction of
that life, they ought to preſerve, Is
any man ſo ſenſleſs as to think they
could not meet with Apothecaries, as
ill minded as themſelves? Yes, I
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42016:128"/>
dare ſay ten for one, beſides, Is it not
very apparent that all people lie now
more at the mercy of Apothecaries
and their Apprentices or Operators,
then (ſuppoſing the deſign we have
propoſed take effect) they can ever
at the Phyſitians? For although we
ſend Bills to the Apothecary we can
have no aſſurance, they are made up
according to our Preſcription, but the
Maſter or Servants may add what
they pleaſe, without any but their
Conſciences, being able to detect
them. Therefore ſince they are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
as to ſtart ſo unworthy an
Objection, we might retort it upon
themſelves, and argue; ſince Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and their Patients are in danger
of being poyſoned by every Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
or their Apprentices, Were it
not much better that Phyſitians
ſhould ſuperviſe thoſe that make their
Phyſick, whereby they may prevent
this danger? And ſince the truſt muſt
be repoſed in ſome, whether doth not
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42016:129"/>
the Phyſitian more deſerve it; than the
Apothecary and his Apprentices?</p>
               <p>But we will not inſiſt on this, For
I hope that all <hi>Engliſh</hi> men have ſo
ſtrange an Antipathy againſt this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Crime, that I am perſwaded there
are few amongſt the worſt of them
would be guilty of it, although to
ſave their own lives; and therefore
we will acquit the Apothecaries, and
others from ſuſpicion of a crime, of
which ſhould they entertain the leaſt
favourable thought, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be excluded from humane
Society. But theſe vices I hope have
not paſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> and I wiſh they
may ever keep within thoſe bounds;
and that they will never paſs the
Seas to us, ſo as to become <hi>Epidemical,</hi>
my mind doth ſtrongly preſage.</p>
               <p>But yet nevertheleſs, that no ground
may remain for ſuſpicion we ſhall
ſend Bills or Preſcriptions to our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratories,
as duly as we now do to
the Apothecaries, which neceſſity will
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42016:129"/>
oblige us to, many being concerned
together; otherwiſe inſtead of that
order, and Conveniency we promiſe
our ſelves, we ſhall have diſcord and
confuſion: but I ſhall relinquiſh ſo
nauſeous and ingrateful a Subject,
Whereunto Phyſitians might have
returned the ſame anſwer the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi>
did to him that asked, What
was the puniſhment among them for
Parricides? <hi>viz. That they could not
imagine any perſon ſhould arrive to
ſo high a pitch of wickedneſs, as to be
guilty of ſo enormous a crime; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had made no Proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another thing they are ready to
Object to us, is,<hi> That if Phyſitians
reject the Apothecaries, let them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
their buſineſs never ſo prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Medicines will be more unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prepared, than whileſt they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we Anſwer, That the
Contrary will happen; for Phyſitians
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42016:130"/>
will imploy, as I ſhewed before, ſuch
ſober induſtrious Apothecaries, as
are willing to be engaged by them,
to which ſhall be aſſociated, ingenious
Operators: all theſe Combining,
certainly Medicines will be better
prepared, than they have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
for Phyſitians the Inventours
of Pharmacy have ever ſince been the
great improvers thereof, and not the
Apothecaries: Among the Ancients
<hi>Meſue,</hi> among the Moderns <hi>Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeus,
Schroder, Zuelfer, Quercetan</hi>
and <hi>Others.</hi> Beſides, its well known that
moſt Phyſitians are Maſters of ſome
Excellent Compoſitions, which are
not extant in our <hi>Diſpenſatory,</hi> with
<hi>which only</hi> the Apothecaries are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
and many of them there are,
have found out better general Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Diſtilling Waters, making
Syrups, Electuaries, and other forms
of Medicines than are commonly
known: which if this deſign ſucceed,
they will put in Practice highly to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42016:130"/>
their own, and the Patients advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
And indeed there are few Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
but would preſcribe (if they
knew where to have it) Phyſick
more pleaſant, leſs Nauſeous for
quantity, and Quality, than any is in
the Apothecaries Shops. So that we
ſee this Objection returns upon them
to their prejudice.</p>
               <p>And indeed, if we impartially
examine things, it will readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that many Phyſitians have
greater skill in Pharmacy, or the
ways of Compounding and Preparing
Medicines than any Apothecaries.
For if no Perſons are ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Nature, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Simples, or with the ways of
finding them out as Phyſitians, which
is acknowledged by all; It will
thence follow, that they in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
muſt know beſt, how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Simples, how to diſpoſe them
to Operate with the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which are moſt Effectual
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:42016:131"/>
with, and what without Elaborate
Preparations; whereby the Vertues of
many Simples are often deſtroyed not
improved. And in Compoſitions they
know the true Methods of mixing
things together, that ſome may not
annihilate the force of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo
become altogether ineffectual.</p>
               <p>But if it be further Objected by
Apothecaries,<hi> That the </hi>Materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica<hi>is ſo copious, Compoſitions ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
that it will be an unſpeakable
trouble to Phyſitians to provide the one,
and ſee to the Preparing of the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this we Anſwer,</hi> That a good
Method with little trouble, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
much buſineſs, which in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and confuſion, will require a far
longer time, greater expence, more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and perhaps at laſt be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily,
and ſlightly performed
then the other. But further its ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known that few Phyſitians,
uſe a tenth part of what is in the ſhops;
&amp; perhaps if they made their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:42016:131"/>
they would find a convenience
in a farther contraction of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
I mean confining themſelves
to fewer compoſitions, making amends
for the number in the goodneſs
and extent of thoſe they uſe, and
they can at any time ſupply the want
of a Compoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which yet will
ſeldom happen) with Simples which
as I have already manifeſted, would be
ſo far from an inconvenience, that
it would be a priviledge to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
and Patient, and conduce great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the encreaſe of our knowledge of
the Specifical properties of concretes;
wherein I fear we are very defective.
And every Phyſitian knowing what
Medicines he ſhall uſually employ,
may have them only made, which
perhaps are different from thoſe made
in other Combinations, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
a double benefit; making fewer
Medicines, he hath the more time to
prepare them, and is likely to take
care they be ſuch as they ought to be:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:42016:132"/>
and making only ſuch as he is ſure
he ſhall have occaſion for to diſpence,
thereby having little loſs in their
Medicines they can afford them
cheaper; whereas the Apothecaries
who make all the Diſpenſatory Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
looſe many, (they being never
called for) and are put on the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſelling others, when they are
old, ineffectual, and have loſt their
ſanative properties.</p>
               <p>Another thing the Apothecary
Objects againſt the Phyſitians new
Model, is,<hi> That the Patients will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
they not having made Proviſion
of Perſons, that are acquainted with
many Operations, about ſick people
which the Apothecaries perform with
great skill and facility; ſuch are the
adminiſtring of Clyſters, applying
Leeches, Veſicatories, Plaſters, Pigeons,
Cupping-Glaſſes, tending them whilſt
under ſalivation, making fomentations,</hi>&amp;c.<hi> and that otherwiſe they are very
helpful to, &amp; officious about the diſeaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:42016:132"/>
To this we anſwer, That moſt of
theſe litle pieces of Officiouſneſs,
whereby Apothecaries do ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear
themſelves to Patients (of which
favour, we have ſeen, they make no
good uſe) are either ſuch, as may be
altogether as well performed by nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
or others that attend the ſick, by
the Apothecaries of our Laboratories,
or others we ſhall breed up to theſe
eaſily learned Operations; which
have nothing of difficulty, but that a
child of ten years old by the Phyſitians
directions ſhall accurately perform:
looking to people under Salivation
only excepted; whom the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the moſt part leſs underſtand
how to manage, than many whom
the Phyſitians having inſtructed ſhall
depute for that ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>The Apothecaries may further object,<hi>That neither Phyſitians nor Patients
have much reaſon on their ſide, when they
find fault with the dearneſs of their
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42016:133"/>
Medicines; which if the Phyſitians
upon Complaint find too high prized,
the Apothecaries do make ſuch abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as they think juſt and fit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will be a fair pretence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I never heard it urged by any
of them, neither do I believe they will
truſt to the Phyſitians arbitration;
but on the contrary I know ſeveral
have flatly refuſed it. But ſuppoſing
they ſhould all agree, let us examine
whether this will give much relief to
the abuſed Patient. For, firſt the
Engliſh are known to have ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a humour, eſpecially the richer
ſort; that they will rather pay the
whole bill without deduction, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the ſum be not conſiderably
great, rather than give the Phyſitian the
trouble of enquiring into this affair,
which is indeed unreaſonable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if ſuch complaints were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
and nothing more certain,
than that if all who were abuſed,
ſhould appeal to the Phyſitian, he
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42016:133"/>
would hear daily as many complaints
of Apothecaries, as he now doth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.
And that an endeavor to relieve
the Plaintiffe would give the Phyſitian
ſufficient diverſions from more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
employments, will appear, if we
conſider that Apothecaries bring in
their bills but once every year, when all
circumſtances are forgot; which gives
them a fair opportunity of adding to
the true number and heightning the
prices of Medicines, the Phyſitian
not remembring what he preſcribed
ſo long before. Neither is it to be
imagined that a Phyſitian will, or
indeed can have leiſure to examine
twenty or thirty bills, and ſet down
the true value of the preſcriptions, not
to urge how unfit an imployment it
is for the Profeſſors of ſo noble a ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as Medicine, to decide ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.
Beſides that there would
be no end of this trouble, ſome of
the original bills being loſt, only the
common title of a Cordial or Purge
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42016:134"/>
being regiſtred with their prices in
the book. So that it will be impoſſible
to make an Eſtimate of the value of
Compoſitions, whoſe Ingredients we
do not know.</p>
               <p>The laſt Objection we ſhall think
worthy an anſwer, is made by ſuch
Apothecaries, as will not acknowledge
(which we have ſo largely proved)
their unfitneſs for the practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
All they have to plead is,<hi> That
ſurely people would not truſt their lives
with them, were they not ſatisfyed with
their abilities and ſucceſs. That Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
indeed, may be better verſ'd in
the Theory; but that they are as well
acquainted with the Experimental,
Practick part, which is the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, Let them
prove that any perſon who is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the greateſt Chymical <hi>Arcana</hi>
(for that ſomewhat may be done by
them extraordinary, though exhibited
by illiterate, unskilful perſons, I dare
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42016:134"/>
not abſolutely deny) can ſucceſsfully
exerciſe Phyſick; and yet have none
of thoſe Qualifications, I have before
enumerated: Some of which ſeem
not only conducive, but neceſſary,
to the right adminiſtration of Phyſick.
And for the vulgar to entertain a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
good opinion of many, who
little deſerve it, hath been obſerved
by wiſe men in all ages; and hath of
later years been confirmed by many
almoſt incredible Examples. I ſhall
inſtance only in ſome of recent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:
although I might without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting
the ſtore, in many hundred.
It's well known that a pretended Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
who calls himſelf <hi>Lockier,</hi> hath
gained by a Pill many thouſand
pounds; which yet is one of the vileſt
and moſt contemptible among all the
Mineral Preparations, I ever yet knew
tryed in Medicine. The Ingredients
being certain proportions (it's needleſs
to mention, though I have often made
it) of Antimony, Saltpeter, common
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42016:135"/>
ſea-Salt and Charcoal; whereof more
may be made in one Laboratory, by
two men in twenty four hours, than
I believe he hath ever diſpoſed of in
the ſpace of a year: and is ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a Medicine that no honeſt perſon
skill'd in Chymiſtry, who is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with it's Compoſition, durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to exhibit it. It's true the gums
and ſugar wherewith the yellow pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is made up, do add conſiderably
to it's bulk; but the chief and only
active Ingredient is taken in ſo ſmall
a doſe, that I know few things which
can poyſon in ſo little a quantity and
this hath been fatal to many, who
never ſpake after it had begun it's
operation, and others did long repent
their uſe of ſo rough a Medicine. I
could give the world a large Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of its miſchievous effects: But
I think they are generally ſatisfyed in
that point; which is the reaſon that
it is now diſuſed. But formerly what
crouding, what enquiring was there
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42016:135"/>
after it, and how highly did <hi>they</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
it whoſe good fortune it was not
to be prejudiced thereby? Now if
this were ſo admirable a remedy, why
is it not ſo ſtill? wherefore lies it neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
if ſo effectual as was once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?
But it ſeems long experience
hath given the generality of people
ſuch proof of it's noxious qualities,
that thereupon, they have deſiſted
from it's uſe, and learned a leſſon of
abſtinence, which ſome have offered
to teach them at a cheaper rate. But
the wit of the vulgar is moſt of it
bought, and many of them cannot
avoid any other inconveniences, than
thoſe they have ſuffered by.</p>
               <p>Thus Time the Miſtreſs of truths,
often diſcovers many of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and the vulgar, though not ſo
quick-ſighted to diſcern dangers at a
diſtance; yet they can feel preſſures
when they labour under them: and
having caſt their burden, will never
again admit of it unleſs ſo diſguiſed,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42016:136"/>
that it appears different from what it
was before. And thus my mind preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it will be with the Apothecaries,
if their Ruin or Reformation do not
anticipate it; for this encroachment
of theirs on the Phyſitians Profeſſion,
is of no long ſtanding. So that people
are not yet well aware of what they
ſuffer by them, but time and ſome
more Experiments will open their
Eyes; then the tide will turn, and
that ſame water which carried them ſo
merrily down the ſtream, will return
them to the place from whence
they ſet forth; and it's well if they be
dealt ſo favourably withal.</p>
               <p>But further, That we are not to take
our meaſures of things from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and perſwaſions of the vulgar,
will be yet more Conſpicuous, if we
conſider, how many reſort to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
pretenders to Phyſick, that ever
yet appeared; which may ſerve to
abate the Pride, and Confidence
of Apothecaries, who urge this is an
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42016:136"/>
Argument of their own worth.
There is ſcarce a Piſſing-place about
the City, where many Bills are not
faſtned; among which the moſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
Penn'd, promiſe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
One undertakes a long Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of diſeaſes, and among them
(can any be blamed for laughing
thereat) of thoſe that are incurable.
Another performs wonderful cures by
vertue of Medicines extracted out of the
ſouls of the heathen Gods (by which I
ſuppoſe he means Tinctures of Metals
which he never ſaw) Many cure by
direction from the Stars: Some by
Phiſnomy and Palmiſtry can foretell
events; and I wonder none undertake
to make the Heavens more propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for if they ſhould I ſuppoſe there
are many credulous enough to believe
them. And how likely are moſt of theſe
people, who make ſuch large promiſes
to perform them, when they are not
inſtructed in the Rudiments of any
Single Art or Science, being moſt of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42016:137"/>
them mean, Ignorant Mechanicks;
who not being ingenious or induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough to ſubſiſt by the calling
in which they were brought up, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in another, the meaning of
whoſe name they ſcarcely underſtand,
and whoſe firſt Principles they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unacquainted with: and yet the
world flows in a pace to them they
ſhrowding themſelves from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Ignorant, under the
Covert of pretended Secrets, which
are uſually ſome ridiculous, ſordid
Preparations, whoſe effects if they
have any good cannot poſſibly be
made out unleſs we have recourſe to
the imagination of him that takes it.
And if either they or the Apothecaries
brag of any particular ſucceſs; We
may anſwer them, as he in <hi>Lucian</hi> did
the Prieſt; who ſhewing him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of thoſe that had invoked
<hi>Neptune,</hi> when they were in danger
of Shipwrack, boaſted of the Power
of his God which was manifeſted by
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42016:137"/>
the number of his <hi>Donaria,</hi> but
how ſhall we know replyed he,
how many notwithſtanding they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
thy God, have nevertheleſs
ſuffered Shipwrack, which he ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be far the greater number. I
wiſh the Application were not ſo
eaſie as I fear it is. Thus we ſee
that popular approbation is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to authoriſe Practicioners of
Phyſick, even by the Apothecaries
own Conceſſion; who in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
do moſt bitterly inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe pretenders, and diſſwade
all people from conſulting them:
which whither they do from a ſenſe
of their duty or Intereſt is ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
I ſhall therefore take my
leave of them, with this requeſt that
they would Exchange the Motto of
their Arms for another, which will
better ſure with their actions. It is
this <hi>Eadem probamus, eadem repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendimus;</hi>
for the Quacking Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
can plead little in his own
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42016:138"/>
behalf, which the Mountebanks will
not make uſe of in their defence: and
urge few things againſt thoſe Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvers,
their profeſt enemies, which
theſe, if they have ſo much <hi>Latine</hi>
may not again retort on them, in the
ſaying of the Poet;
<q>
                     <l>—Mutato nomine de te</l>
                     <l>Fabula narratur.—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now having diſplayed at large
though not at full the injuries Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
it ſelf, the Phyſitians, and moſt
ſick people do dayly receive from
the unwarrantable Practices of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
nothing remains, but that
I add a Proviſo, which I have had in
my Eye all along this Diſcourſe. I
would not therefore have any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that, what I have ſaid againſt
the Apothecaries, is intended againſt
them all, being affirmed only of the
greater number; for it would be the
higheſt injuſtice to Comprehend
them all in the Character I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of their unworthy aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates:
whoſe actions the Phyſitians
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42016:138"/>
do not diſſallow of, or declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
more, than ſome among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
I dare not, I ſay, accuſe them
all of diſhoneſt practices, there being
ſeveral on whom there is impreſſed
ſo true a Senſe of their duty to God,
and their Neighbours, that they are
not capable of actions which will ſo
highly diſhonour their Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
or injure their neighbour. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there are, whoſe skill in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
and Chymiſtry, ſecure Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
from thoſe fears they would be
otherwiſe Subject to, from their
unskilfulneſs or ignorance, in one or
the other. And here I muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
acknowledge, that I have met
with ſome Apothecaries that for
knowledge in Chymical affairs, have
been much Superior to profeſſed
Chymiſts; and of all that I have
hitherto met with, I account them
the moſt faithful and induſtrious:
and which may ſeem ſtrange, they do
prepare <hi>Galenical</hi> Phyſick, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42016:139"/>
than moſt others, who have no
other imployment; and therefore of
all others in a New Conſtitution of
affairs, they will deſerve the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
incouragement, as being moſt
likely to be ſerviceable, and faithful
to the Profeſſion of Phyſick, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians.
Who are ſo far from deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing which will be to the
prejudice of ſuch honeſt ſkilful Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
(who are all ſufficiently
known to ſome Phyſitian or other)
that on the Contrary they intend
them more good than they can in the
preſent way, promiſe to themſelves;
and will make ſuch proviſion for them
that they ſhall never have cauſe to
complain, or occaſion given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,
as the greateſt part of their
Company have done ſo Noble a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
as that of Phyſick, Or ſuch
generous friends and great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
as they will find the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to be, ſo long as they keep in
thoſe due limits which ſhall with their
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42016:139"/>
own conſent be Preſcribed them.</p>
               <p>But here I foreſee, ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may be made, by Phyſitians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
againſt the Deſign of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their own Medicines; which
although they are weak, and of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
import, and deſerve not to be
named after the mention of thoſe
many reaſons, and high advantages,
wherewith that propoſal is attended;
yet we ſhall give them a fair debate,
and ſo put a Period to this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>It may be pretended by ſome that
are guilty of delicacy, ſloath, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and by others, who are either
proud, or imprudently Zealous, for
their own honour, and that of their
Noble Profeſſion; <hi>That it is below a
Phyſitian to make his own Medicines,
or give himſelf the trouble of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing
thoſe whom he ſhall appoint to
prepare them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, That I would
gladly learn, whether they are <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts</hi>
or Chymiſts that object this;
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42016:140"/>
not the latter certainly, for then they
deſert the Principles of their great
Maſters, <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi>
who do Anathematize all thoſe
that truſt to Mercenary Chymiſts
for their Medicines. And as for
thoſe who are the followers of
the deſervedly admired <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
or <hi>Galen,</hi> I wonder with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
any among them can ſcruple,
as beneath them, thoſe Offices where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their great Dictators were ſo much
Exerciſed. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in many of his Writings, the
care and pains he took to provide
Simples, preſerve, and prepare them
for Medicinal uſes; not only diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them himſelf, but making them
in his own Operatory. And <hi>Galen</hi>
viſited many parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which
were renowned for famous Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
as <hi>Paleſtine</hi> for it's Noble
Balſome, <hi>Lemnos,</hi> for it's Earth,
and <hi>Cyprus</hi> for it's Minerals, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away quantities of them; Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42016:140"/>
himſelf to great hazards, labour,
and expenſe, only that he might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
himſelf with the genuine Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and provide againſt the Cheats
and abuſes of Impoſtors. He had
alſo a Repoſitory where his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
were always, either under
his Eye, or in his hand. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
made Treacle, and never gave any
Medicine of which he had not firſt
taſted or ſmelt. Now could theſe
great Perſons give themſelves ſo
much trouble, and publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, as apprehending it
would rather enhance than derogate
from the Eſteem the world had
juſtly for them? And ſhall their
pretended admirers, and followers
plead exemption from ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
becauſe dignified with
ſome empty Title? For ſo indeed
it is, where not accompanied with
reall intrinſe call merit, although it
conciliates more Reſpect and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42016:141"/>
to thoſe Gallant Perſons, who
Honour their Titles and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by a diligent purſuance of
thoſe Noble Ends, on whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they were conferred on them;
not neglecting any means which
may make their Profeſſion more
Effectuall for thoſe great ends of
preſerving life and reſtoring health:
Which if any Neglect, it is not
their Formalities will gain them
Repute, or enable them to Cure
Diſeaſes. They muſt therefore in
this imitate thoſe great Phyſitians,
they do ſo highly Magnifie in their
Diſcourſes, who did not refer to
Apothecaries the Preparing of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
but made it their own
care; neither did they think it too
mean, or below them to do with
their own hands, moſt of thoſe
things which are now accounted
(by thoſe, who in their own and
the worlds Opinion are much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:42016:141"/>
them) the Miniſtery of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Perſons.</p>
               <p>I have by this time, I hope, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
ſatisfactory Anſwers to all
thoſe Objections I can foreſee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries,
or others, will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Phyſitians preparing their own
Medicines; which is a Propoſal more
free from Exceptions than any I have
hitherto met with. But let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that it is attended with ſome
ſlight inconveniences; yet ſince there
is a neceſſity of a change, in the
opinion of all honeſt judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I know no expedient like this
I have offered, which in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
promiſes ſo well, that although
through difference of opinions among
Phyſitians and Patients, it may prove
a difficult taske to introduce ſuch
a change as this we plead for, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perhaps not underſtanding the
good of it: yet I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42016:142"/>
that having once made tryal,
both Phyſitians and Patients will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
agree, not to quit, upon any
ſlight, frivolous pretences, what both
one and the other find experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be highly advantageous. I
would therefore perſwade them to
deal with this Propoſition, as they
do when a fair new Suit of Clothes is
brought them; which they put on,
knowing, that though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
fit at firſt, it will either fit it's
ſelf to the body in wearing, or
thereby more plainly ſhew wherein
it may be mended. But if I flatter
not my ſelf and the world (which
I do not if I know my ſelf, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the things I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating)
not only few or no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and inconveniences will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the mentioned Propoſition;
but on the contrary, as I have fully
demonſtrated, many and great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages:
whether we have reſpect
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42016:142"/>
to the Patient or Phyſitian. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
what can be more deſirable to
either, than to have Pharmacy put
in ſuch hands, and in ſuch a method,
that none having the Intereſt can have
the Power, nor any having the
Power, can have the Intereſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Medicines unfaithfully? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Phyſitians regard the Honour
of Medicine, or good of the Diſeaſed,
they will not neglect the means which
anſwer theſe noble ends. And as it
has been well obſerved in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the ſafety of a Kingdom,
or Common-wealth conſiſts not
wholly in a Prince that Governs
wiſely, while he lives; but in one
that ſo orders it, that he dying, it can
preſerve it ſelf: So the ſafety of the
People (in reference to health) being
caſt upon Phyſitians, it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that they are honeſt men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to all the good ends of their
Profeſſion, unleſs they be alſo skilled
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42016:143"/>
and careful to put their affairs in ſuch
a method, that theſe ends may be
certainly attained to, not only by
themſelves, but alſo by others that
ſhall ſucceed them. Which will moſt
infallibly happen, if it become the
cuſtom and faſhion for Phyſitians to
look after the preparing of their own
Medicines; for then the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
will oblige all Phyſitians to
have them as good as they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
or make them. And let their
Servants, Apothecaries, or Operators,
be never ſo bad or wicked; although
I will not ſay, if this courſe be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it will make them good: yet
it is attended with the great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of being ſufficient to prevent
any influence their wickedneſs can
have on Phyſick, It being highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
that they ſhould Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
or Adulterate Medicines, when
they make no benefit thereof. And
beſides, it will be almoſt impoſſible
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42016:143"/>
to effect ſuch deſigns, ſhould they be
ſo miſchievouſly diſpoſed; for they
would be ſoon diſcovered, and for the
future prevented.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore remains, but
that I addreſs my diſcourſe to the
Phyſitians; And certainly I need
not uſe many more words to engage
them in a deſign which Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
(the moſt perſwaſive and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Arguments in the World) muſt
neceſſarily oblige them to promote.
That it is our duty to reform ſuch
enormous abuſes as thoſe we have
mentioned, I ſuppoſe no one will
queſtion; and that it is alſo no leſs
our Intereſt, the Arguments I have
produced, will render to thoſe that
are free from prejudices, ſufficiently
probable: ſo that as I am moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
no honeſt perſons who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
themſelves the liberty of reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be ignorant of their Duty, ſo
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42016:144"/>
neither can they miſtake their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
It is true indeed, the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
give forth in moſt Companies,
that they are not at all apprehenſive
of any danger from the deſigns of
ſuch Phyſitians, as ſhall endeavour
their reformation, who they pretend
are but few, and thoſe inconſiderable
perſons; that the greater number,
and they the moſt eminent Phyſitians,
have their Intereſt ſo interwoven with
the Apothecaries, that they cannot
be ſeparated from them, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
deſert them: but repute all ſuch
perſons their own enemies, who ſhall
attaque the Apothecaries, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that are done to theſe, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt themſelves. All which
is a meer fiction, of their own devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
to deter Phyſitians, from enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
againſt ſo great a number, ſo
potent a faction, as they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the world they are. But how
groſs and palpable a cheat this is, will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42016:144"/>
then appear, when all honeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
Phyſitians ſhall unanimouſly
agree to confute them; and I dare
aſſure the world, that this will moſt
certainly and ſuddenly be effected,
unleſs there happen the moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
change in the humours, intentions,
and reſolutions of men that was
ever yet known: And for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
to expect ſuch an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were to promiſe to themſelves
little leſs then impoſſibilities. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
Suppoſe any Phyſitians ſhould
ſtand Neuter, or appear publickly
concerned for them, they will be
ſuch as will rather diſcredit their
cauſe, than add to it any honour or
repute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they that ſtand Neuters
in this quarrel, or vindicate the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
muſt either be ſuch who
look on the profeſſion of Phyſick, as a
meer cheat, a craft, rather than an
art or Science, who believe, that as
much is performed by thoſe that are
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42016:145"/>
reputed the meaneſt Phyſitians, as
by any other; the difference ariſing
only hence, that ſome being more
prudent and fortunate than the reſt,
obtain a repute proportionable to
their pretended ſucceſs, affable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
demeanour, or cunning manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the People, working more
upon the humours of their minds,
than on thoſe of their bodies. And
if there be any thus minded, I do not
wonder that their Zeal ſhould not
tranſport them too far againſt the
Apothecaries; for if Phyſick doth ſo
little influence diſeaſes, what matter is
it whether the Medicine be made up of
bad or good Drugs? Whether it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
or of a longer ſtanding? Whether
made up of the ſame or different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients
from what were preſcribed?
Neither will a perſon thus perſwaded,
apprehend he is in conſcience obliged
to reform theſe abuſes, which as I
have ſhewed, are frequent among
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42016:145"/>
Apothecaries; Nor can he have the
leaſt pretence againſt their exerciſing
the practice of Phyſick. For if all
cure alike, and ſo little good be done
by the Profeſſors of that Faculty, then
why may not the Apothecaries be
allowed as well as any others? So
that theſe, ſhould they oppoſe them
on an account of intereſt, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
rather reproaching than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them, they cannot with
any confidence accuſe the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for actions, which if they be faults,
they themſelves are guilty of the ſame;
and if they be not, the ſame Principle
which acquits them, muſt alſo free
the other. <hi>Theſe</hi> probably, if there are
any ſuch, will ſtand Neuters, and not
much concern themſelves in a quarrel

               </p>
               <p>But perhaps there are ſome of
another humour, who make great
advantages of the Apothecaries in
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42016:146"/>
wayes I could mention; which for
many reaſons, I forbear to manifeſt.
Now if there be any Phyſitians of this
latter ſort, who ſhall endeavour to
uphold the Apothecaries, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they do not relinquiſh their
former ill courſes, only becauſe they
make ſome benefit of them; whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I ſay, they are that have ſuch
ſordid Spirits, ſo unworthy the Name
they bear, the noble Science they
make profeſſion of, and the great
Truſt repoſed in them; that for a
little gain, ſhall betray their Profeſſion
to ſcorn, and their Patients to moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
hazards, Theſe diſhoneſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
perſons will have ſo good
eſpial kept on them, that all their
prudence ſhall not ſecure them from
having their ſordid actions diſplaied
in genuine colours: which will render
them ſo odious and deſpicable, that
moſt will deſert them, and apply
themſelves to thoſe worthy Phyſitians
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42016:146"/>
who are ſo far from countenancing
the Apothecaries in their fraudulent
courſes, that they had rather give
themſelves the trouble of preparing
their own Phyſick, than expoſe the
Sick to manifold inconveniences: as
they do who compromiſe with the
Apothecaries in their unworthy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
and ſhare with them their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
gain.</p>
