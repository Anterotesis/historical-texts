            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce through the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and dark distractions of these unfortunate times, I am thus ecclips'd, and linkt to an ill and duskie fate; as by being Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd in a Dungeon, am debarr'd of that happy liberty that might allow me the wish'd-for opportunity of kissing your hands; Yet am I thus only Cloyster'd, since though my Body suffer a most severe and strict confinement, it rather addes to the liberty of my Soul, and makes it expatiate it selfe with a greater Freedome; And so I
<pb facs="tcp:64182:3"/>
am alwayes waiting on you, though not to your apprehension, yet with my better Genius; and though not as an Angell guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, yet still attending the illustrious throne of the All-powerfull Majesty in my wishes, and Prayers for you.</p>
            <p>And that you may not onely know the reality of my Soul, but the command also you have over it; I have adventured to answer (in my obedience) your Will, though perhaps not Expectation, in sending to you, with this my account of <hi>Colchester;</hi> by which you shall only understand I stood not there as a dumb Cypher, though not as a very eminently active Figure: Other Honour to my self I dare not appropriate by it, but am content (chusing <hi>ex malis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimum</hi>) to lay open to your serious scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my greatest imperfections, rather than adventure the hazard of falling under the censure of ingratefull disobedience; hoping your Charity will extend to a Courteous reception of my Imbecillities, because cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with as cheerfull endeavours; in which garb they humbly thus come to waite on you, having for attendance onely this seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous request: That your own eyes alone may be made witnesses of their nakednesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64182:3"/>
For though I know that truth (which I assure you here really is, and nothing else) need not be abash't who ever she meet with, she is naturally of her self so Beautifull, and never was more than in this service: Yet I am sensible enough how grosse an absurdity it is for any man to send her abroad in vile, and ragged unshapen Garments; of which I must acknowledge my self too much too guilty to expect a Justification when I shall appear at the bar of a judicious Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but therefore suffer under the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a just and weighty Censure.</p>
            <p>Which I might the more seriously expect, were it more exactly done, should it come to the publick stage, since I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and made it my observation too, how the Honour of that unparallel'd action is dayly crucified, with a confusion of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, and prejudiciall opinions, almost me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosing it into a prodigious disguise past knowledge.</p>
            <p>Yet I have a little digressed as possible, knowing that many passionate Historians transported with splean against Tyrants, or too great a luxury in the glorification of those theyhonored, have imperfectly delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the image of Truth; like <hi>Aurelius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64182:4"/>
Painter, who, when he was to draw the face of any Image, alwayes made it to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of a Woman that he most dearly affected.</p>
            <p>But I have confined my self to a strict-Commentary of the reall passages; and to adde more to your satisfaction, I have drawn my rise not onely from the first step of it's motion, but the cause that gave a product to that motion. By which means it must prove something more tedious to you; Yet if your patience shall so far sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with my desires, as my obedience hath done to your will; and at some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse times permit you to run it over: You shall not only receive the benefit of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to your own phancy in requitall, but a knowledge to give the like to others that you shall finde unresolv'd, and deserving, in it, and heap much of Obligation and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>INgenious Reader, (for to none other doe I wish this may come) not that I value any mans cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Author, but because it is an Age wherein Truth is accounted Diabolicall, and Loyalty a Treason un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable: And I may justly suppose some thick-skull'd Separatist, or frothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd Ignoramus, whose customes are to criticize, because they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value what they fancie not, as much as what they understand not, will be swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about it with their Hypocriticall Censures to stifle it with an undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving odium: But let not the so slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slovenly, and obscure birth of this off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of Loyall Zeale, any whit derogate from its worth in your opinion; for you cannot but know, that many gallant Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Personages, have received life
<pb facs="tcp:64182:5"/>
from as great an obscurity; and truly I shall thus far Apologize for it, (though its deserts require not any) read but the fore-going Letter, (not at all intended for what is now placed) and you shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand, that the Authors will, and desire of not publishing it, as not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for the publike stage of the world, hath been the chiefest reason of it: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made it his request, as being diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of its worth, that it might not suffer the danger of the Presse. But I having raised a contrary reason, and far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his for silencing, from the same grounds, thought it a greater evill to let so worthy a structure lye buryed in the wombe of perpetuall oblivion, when it had received so happy a conception, then to give it a lasting life, though by so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure a birth.</p>
            <p>I cannot but expect that the so many Legions of Lyes, that doe every day op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the very Presse it selfe, and tyre out mens fancies with their mutinous tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
<pb facs="tcp:64182:5"/>
upon the stage of the world, will be ever justling at so handsome and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did a piece of Loyall truth, whilst the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill the Father of Lyes is so much ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and Christ that fountaine of honour and truth crucified and slandered every houre amongst us. But I am confident their power will never prevaile to beat it off, while there is yet a sparke of Loyaltie left to light us through this dark Chaos of Atheisticall Rebellion.</p>
            <p>That I am cautious of too plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging its Author, is, because otherwise there might much of inconveniency ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him for so bold a discovery of his conscience, (being already in prison) by the splenitick malice of some base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born phlegmatick dispositions; whose stomacks are so full gorg'd with Rebellion against God and his Vicegerent, they can brooke or digest nothing that savours not of Treason or Disloyalty.</p>
            <p>These reasons being well weighed by any ingenious and Loyall Reader, will be
<pb facs="tcp:64182:6"/>
sufficient. Wherefore I shall urge no more, but desire all such, as they peruse, to draw examples of Loyaltie from it, and pick not out more cautiously what they may more artificially convert to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if not liked; as it is too often seen: and let your constant endeavour (who ere you be) in the behalfe and Service of your King, and Country, exceed his if you can; then censure and spare not; So wishing all mens Consciences as good and faithfull Subjects to a sweet and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince ought to be, Reader I commit you to the protection of Heaven so long as you are so, and bid you farewell.</p>

            <head>A most true and exact Relation of that as Honourable as unfortunate expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Kent, Essex,</hi> and <hi>Colchester.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPon <hi>Christmas</hi> day, 1647. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen and others of the meaner ranke in the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> being Religiously disposed to the Service of Almighty God, according to the Liturgy and Orders of the Church, (a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence, I must confesse, in these times of Reformation) met at Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> Church in the High Street, Where M. <hi>Allday</hi> the Resident Minister of the Parish preached to them a Sermon answerable to the day; A thing so much out of Custome now, that we begin to forget even that Christ was ever borne, as well as the Celebration of his Birth. And now this piece of orderly and Christian Devotion startled the consciences of the new Saints, who enflamed with fiery zeale, began to make tumults in the streets,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64182:7"/>
and under the Church windowes, thinking thereby to drown the voice of the Preacher: but it could not any whit discourage him from persisting in his holy and devout Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
            <p>The Sermon being done, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flock more tumultuously together, so that the disturbance encreased very much; By the meanes especially of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, (a man indeed <hi>Knave</hi> enough, and I thinke as much <hi>Foole,</hi> as appeares by this) who walking through the Streets pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely, would have forc'd some people to open their Shops, and set out their Wares to keep the Market (the day being Saturday, and Market day) but he denying, and urging of it more seriously; one man answering his Commands with some words which he could not well relish, he strook him a blow in the face with his Fist: Making himself, by that means, the first ingager and instrument to the breach of that Peace, which upon all occasions whatever, he was Sworn to see kept and preserved.</p>
            <p>This made a greater Distraction and Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub in the City; and many men throng'd together, and so mad they grew, that the Mayors heeles were soon flung up, and all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64182:7"/>
his Worship thrown in the Channell, he was afterwards glad to shift for his life, as he supposed. But one of the Constables, by name and quality <hi>Huse,</hi> a Shoo-maker, a Senior of the Faction, ran hastily out with a Pistoll in his hand; and running up and down the Streetes with aggravating Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours summons out his Crue, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tumbled out of their houses with their Armes in their hands, and such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Weapons as first they could lay hold of, in such hast, they over powred all they met: among the rest, one <hi>White</hi> a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (a man swell'd as full of ungodly Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Principles of Rebellion as a Toad with poyson) standing in the Street with a Musket loaded, and his match ready cockt, meeting another man by chance stepping forth of his doore, as being Inquisitive to understand the occasion of the tumult; whom he knew to be one that fancyed not his humour, made not much dispute with him, but upon his questioning his standing in that posture, lets fly at him, and Shot him through the Body, so that there was little hope of life in him.</p>
            <p>Thus the businesse grew still to a greater height, and more people still flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64182:8"/>
as it is alwayes seene in such Mutinous Broyles; and many bickerings fell out in the Streetes: But ere long those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ranged about as furiously at first, as <hi>Herods</hi> Souldiers in the Infant Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, began to slink, and were at last glad to betake themselves to their heeles, and every one to shift for himselfe. <hi>White</hi> being taken, was committed to Custody into the Towne Goal, there to lie till he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Justice of the Law for so horrid a Villany.</p>
            <p>The other party being thus enraged, and incensed by so foul an Affront, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of their owne security; and knowing the malice of those they should most certainly have to do with, seized on the Magazine of the Town, and placed Guards about at every Gate of the City; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that mischief which indeed afterwards came to passe, and might have been preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had they not thought themselves too secure. At last they grew something vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and encreased to a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, till Sir <hi>William Man,</hi> Master <hi>Lovelace</hi> the Councellour, and some other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by an extraordinary Industry had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them to a quiet desisting from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting

those rash Attempts which they boldly resolved on; engaging themselves with the Mayor, and Master <hi>Savin</hi> an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman, and Justice of Peace, by Articles drawn up, and Signed between them, that no man should be molested or questioned for an thing that was done.</p>
            <p>Upon this, they all quietly lay down their Armes, and every man betook himselfe to his Vocation, and particular Habitation, which else might have produced greater matters both in that City and the whole County.</p>
            <p>About a moneth after, upon the instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mayor, whose malice could not be appeased without revenge, by Order of Parliament came down Col. <hi>Husons</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot from about <hi>London</hi> to quarter in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> who no sooner were settled in their quarters, but by Order from the House they seized on Sir <hi>Will: Man,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Lovelace,</hi> M. <hi>Savine,</hi> M. <hi>Dudley Wiles,</hi> and some other Gentlemen; and many poor men of the City also, and hurried them away to <hi>Leeds</hi> Castle neer <hi>Maidstone,</hi> where they continued Prisoners about two moneths, and more, till some of the poorer sort that had not where withall to subsist
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64182:9"/>
(none daring to relieve them) were wel nigh starved there, as their Wives and Families at home. At last, with some solicitation of the Gentlemen to the House, by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Burgesses of the City, and some other of the Deputy Lieutenants of the County, who began to be a little touch'd with a sence of their abominable Injury, procured so much favour as to have Baile taken for their Liberty, till they should be called upon to answer at the Barre of their Mock-Justice for this high and unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Ryot of Peace-making. This high fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour being obtained, they all returned home; but they were no sooner there, and scarce setled, but the Mayor, out of his own power, having Myrmidons enough then to maintain him in any thing, though never so ignoble, wicked, or unjust, (although hee had before Signed to the Articles of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity, and that those poor men had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so much misery, notwithstanding) would have had all those of the most Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour rank to be Whipt, or ride the Wooden Horse; for now he knew how to domineer, having the Souldiers to clap him at the back, and encourage what ever he would doe: But by the more grave advice of some of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64182:9"/>
more moderate Brethren he was taken off from that project, &amp; the busines lay quiet till about a forthnight before <hi>Whitsontide;</hi> at which time the Parl. gave Commission of speciall Oyer and Terminer for a Court of Sessions in the Castle at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and sent done Sergeant <hi>Wild,</hi> and Sergeant <hi>Steel</hi> to try them upon Life and Death, who in the whole businesse were the onely Sufferers, and the Raisers of that, got either to be their Judges, or Witnesses against them to condemne them. Condemned indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, as by the sequell appeares.</p>
            <p>A Grand Jury also was Summoned in of Gentlemen from every Lathe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and none to be prickt but such as they thought so well affected to the Parliament as to cast any whom they should desire to convict. All the Deputy Lieutenants were also appointed to meet at this great Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; Sir <hi>Michaell Lusey</hi> being then one of the House, and not in Command (a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell in the Service once, and before that, in debt farre beyond what he was worth, but now clear from all, and his Estate very much augmented) made it his suite to the House that he might have leave to be there at the Bench, which he soon obtained; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64182:10"/>
comming down, made it his Brags that he thanked God he had obtained leave of the House to be there, and that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to set some of those Gentlemen packing to another World, which he would willingly have done had God given so large a power into his hands; but his protection guarded them from the intended ruine these Unjust Judges had pre-ordained them to.</p>
            <p>For the day being come, and the Judges and Bench in much State and Pomp set, the Prisoners were summoned to the Bar, and the Jury Impannell'd: Then the Indictment was read, and the Jury sent out to bring in their Verdict, who retiring, and scanning the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after they had heard the Indictment pleaded against, found an Ignoramus upon it; and being again brought in, gave in their Verdict accordingly, at which the Bench wondred, and the Judges were much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, having resolved their doome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand; wherefore the Jury was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time commanded forth, and againe returned the same Verdict; whereupon the Judges, as it were forc'd to it, cleared the businesse for that time, and broke up the Court, but would not absolutely quit them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64182:10"/>
till the House should resolve farther upon it, intending to have brought them to a second Triall: But ere the Bench could rise, came in a Packet from the House of Parliament, with a Relation of that great defeat given the <hi>Welch</hi> at S. <hi>Fagons</hi> neer <hi>Cardiff</hi> in <hi>Clamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganshire;</hi> which being read, one of the Bench rising up, said to one of the Grand Jury, <hi>Had we known but this newes before, we would have made you found something else than an Ignoramus:</hi> But the Gentleman being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute man, and as Consciencious, soone made him this answer, <hi>Neither your newes Sir, nor your threatning words should have made us give in a Verdict upon another mans Life, contrary to the result of our Consciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the world now judge by this, what the Justice of these men is, whom nothing but fear shall keep from committing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide and murder on their fellow-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Subjects and Country, upon the very seats of Justice and Judgement.</p>
            <p>After this passage, the Grand Jury all meeting together, began to revolve in their discourses, (being aggravated by so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable a speech) of the intollerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and slavery this wretched Kingdome was involved and plunged into; and under

Some Deputy Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants also did approve of it, and willingly Signed; others seemed to approve of it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but when they were desired to Signe, slipt their necks out of the Coller, and left the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64182:13"/>
City: but that day it was Signed by above two hundred Gentlemen then in the City, and Copies transcribed, and dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them all, by which means, by a very quick flight they were dispersed over all the County also; there being so many Centle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men then met together from every Lath and Hundred, a more fitting opportunity could never have been fancied. Then on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of every Petition was Endorsed this Post-script:
<q>
                  <p>It is desired, that all Copies and Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be brought into <hi>Rochester</hi> on Munday, the <hi>29.</hi> of this Instant <hi>May 1648.</hi> And that all who intend to accompany this Petition doe meet at <hi>Black-heath</hi> the day following by nine of the Clock in the morning.</p>

            <p>By this meanes the whole County might unanimously go, not only in their Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but in the presentation of it to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>But there were at the same time some of the Grandees, in the City, who by no means could swallow it, lest it should have choaked their Reputation, with the House; and indeed, being stung with too guilty a Conscience, found this pill too harsh a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasive to them. Amongst the rest, Sir <hi>Henry
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64182:13"/>
Heyman,</hi> and Sir <hi>Michaell Lnsey,</hi> who po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted immediately away to the Parliament to give them a timely notice, for prevention of a design so Honourable, Conscientious, and Religious, but absolutely destructive to their Interest and Proceedings; or at least, that they might, by being <hi>praemoniti,</hi> be also <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniti,</hi> which two are seldome other then Correlatives; the one drawing a usuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from the other, as indeed it proved by them, as will afterwards appear by their Votes, and Stratagems against it.</p>
            <p>But ere they went, out of the tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection his rebellious Bowels yearn'd with, towards his true Bretheren in Iniquity, went to the Prison where <hi>White</hi> the Barber lay for his horrid Villany; (the man not being yet recovered) and brought him out, with hat in hand, giving him thanks for his so good service, and extraordinary zeal to the Cause; and thus set him at liberty without ever being questioned for his Fact.</p>
            <p>Upon Sunday following, Letters were sent from the Speaker of the Lower House, to all the Deputy Lieftenants in the County, and what Justices of Peace the House thought good, that they understood of an intended Petition to be preferred to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64182:14"/>
House from that County, willing them to use their utmost indeavours for the speedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting it, and suppressing the people in it. Never disputing the Justice of it, nor inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of themselves in denying the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, which was as horrid as might be for any man that knowes how to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween right and wrong almost in any thing, knowes that the intentions of a Kings cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Parliament are for the speedy redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the agrievances of his Kingdome, and the admitting by him, and the choosing by the People, the Commons into Parliament never for any other reason then to present the Agrievances of the Commons in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for what part of the Kingdome they served as Representatives, by way of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from them to the King and Lords for redresse. But they have now so altered the Constitution of Parliament by their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Kirk-lawes</hi> of Reformation, that no man, no not the best of Polititians is Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian good enough to feel its pulse, though in a most horrid distraction too of ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; and our blessed Reformers have so long faught for the Priviledge of Parliament, as that they have both lost that, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and true Rights of the Subject,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64182:14"/>
with the Prerogative of the King to Boot; and Metamorposed the Lawes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into the shapelesse monster of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government, and Tyrannous power of the Sword.</p>
            <p>But these Letters also they were ordered and authoriz'd to Seize, and Surprize all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they should find, or suspect to to be active in the prosecution of it; &amp; to secure all Castles, Towns, and strong holds in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and by their greatest care to prevent all publick Meetings at any places whatsoever within the County, except their own. Then began the Committee to thunder abroad their loud menaces with high threats, to all such as should dare to prosecute so bold a Villany, and tumultuous Seditions, as they tearmed it; and issued forth a Libellous Order against it, and all such as should signe it, or any way prosecute the progresse of it amongst the people, by any publique or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister means.

            <p>Now the Committees began to bestirre themselves on the other party with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, because they saw Threats would no whit prevail to their Advantage; and sent out their Warrants for all the Trained
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64182:18"/>
Troops and Companies to meet at Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze at severall places of the County. But this neither would availe, or any whit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer their Expectations; for, not any shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in answer to their Warrant, but rather absented themselves from their Homes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Captain <hi>Foach,</hi> and some of his Troop; who, with about twenty of his Men, met together, and Marched away to <hi>Maidstone</hi> there to attend the Committee, who thought it by this, time to consider of their own security. Sir <hi>T. T.</hi> sent out his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants likewise for his Troop to meet him at <hi>Barham</hi> Down, where appeared some ten, but not one Officer, nor any Colours, for his Officers were all engaged for prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Petition. There he waited almost all the day in constant hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their comming up; but towards night, no more appearing, he dispatcht his Man away to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to see if any were met together there, and to Invite them (for now he durst not Command) but his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships man no sooner entered the Gates of the City, but he was surprized by a Guard there, and Dismounted, and so forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to his Master on foot. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim Sir <hi>T.</hi> staying on the Downes with his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64182:18"/>
few men he had, by chance was resolved to drink; and calling for some Beer, one of his men began the Kings Health to him, which rellished not well with his Pallate, having long time been a trusty Wight for the Parliament; and as he said, not being accustomed to drink Healths, it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire his own Health very much; but indeed was something jealous they did that but as an occasion to advance some other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to him: Whereupon he stole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, and clapping his heeles to his Mule (for Spurs he seldome wore any) away he drove as furiously as <hi>Jehu,</hi> never making the least stop till he thought he was clear of the danger of the Cannon Jug; and like a Hare, regarding nothing before him; overtaking by chance another of the Deputy Lieutenants more suttlely plodding along, and ruminating upon the businesse; he had certainly over-run him had his Beast been big enough to have performed it without taking any notice of him; so extraordinary was his hast, as I was informed by the same Deputy Lieutenant himself.</p>
            <p>Now, as it was high time, the Gentlemen engaged in the Petition began to consider farther of their Interest; and being so farre
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64182:19"/>
engaged, how to make what they had done good, and which way with most security to goe forwards; for retreat they could not now, and not to perfect what they had ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, was not only to undoe it, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also without dispute; wherefore they neglected not to meet every day. And considering withall, the imminent danger of that perpetuall slavery, not only they, but the whole Kingdome were fallen into; and the extremitie of violence the Grand Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kingdome did threaten to crush them with, for but Petitioning (with the Children of <hi>Israell</hi> under the slavish Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) for ease of their burdens; resolved like Men of <hi>Kent</hi> to maintain, if it were possible, their Ancient Honour and Liberties, or to perish in the Attempt, which indeed they knew must prove a hard diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, having such an infection within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all over the whole body of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; insomuch that they knew not any sound part in it, but that every one might be likely enough to cherrish and breed up Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min to destroy it. But yet, notwithstanding their losty menacings, and Bug-bear threats, to proceed in their Engagement. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Manifesto was drawne up by them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64182:19"/>
and Signed as an absolute and unanimous Engagement amongst themselves, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards disperst to the view of the whole world, that all might know the candid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of their Resolutions, in these words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>THat the Innocency of our intentions, and Justice of all our undertakings may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to all men of uncorrupt understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and hearts not made too servile by the long, and odious custome of Oppression. We the Knights, Gentlemen, Clergy, and Franchlins of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> the most free people of this late flourishing Nation, by the wisdome and valour of our Ancestours delivered from the Lawes of the Conquerour, and to the late dayes of unhappy confusion and distraction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the same, through all the raignes of the most glorious, and victorious Kings and Princes of this Nation: Doe hereby declare, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to all the world, that our Meetings, and Assembling together, is no other then a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our selves, and purposes from the scandall and aspersions of the Committee of this County; who, upon occasion of a Petition, in behalf of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> assented, and subscribed to, by the Grand Jury at the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Judges, upon speciall Commission of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64182:20"/>
Oyer and Terminer, executed at the Castle of <hi>Canterbury</hi> the <hi>11.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> instant for the said County; have not only made Orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same, and Commanded them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be read in all Churches, sentencing and condemning the said Petition, and all the Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thereof; but have summoned the Troopes of Horse, and forces of Foot of this County for suppression of the said Petition. Which tends not only to the suppression of the Liberty even of the most enslaved persons in the world, but also, as much as in them lies, shew an indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon any causes whatsoever, which suit not with their humours, to over-owe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of other men; and, upon opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, think they have ground enough to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the lives or fortunes, or both, of their said opposers.</p>
               <p>In consideration whereof, and that now the said Committee finding themselves unable to involve this County in bloud, have made their addresses to the Parliament and Army; and make strange, and malicious representations of our purposes, thereby discovering nothing so much as their owne pride and malice.</p>
               <p>We the said Knights, Gentlemen, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and Free Yeomen of the said County of <hi>Kent,</hi> doe hereby appeal to all the world to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64182:20"/>
judge, if it were not high time for us to put our selves into a posture of defence: And doe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare, that we will prosecute our said Petition, with our lives and fortunes, not doubting of a faire reception from the two Houses of Parliament, whom we know to have been instigated against us by the said Committee.</p>
               <p>And therefore, saving to our selves, the enlarging of the said Petition: we have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to charge the said Committee with increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Taxes of this County above due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and onely for maintaining their owne private luxury and pride; with usurping a power over the Estates and Fortunes of the free men of this County, not granted to them by any power of Parliament; and with a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, unlimitted, and imbittered spirit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally engrafted in them, and expressed by words and actions all along the exercise of this power (which makes them unfit to rule) to the exasperating of the peoples hearts into all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity, and overthrowing of all love and peace in this County: which also hath been followed to that height of persecution, that had not the two Houses given a stop to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> proceedings, we had suffered much more under the torment of these mens projected designes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64182:21"/>
Wherein we doe acknowledge our selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to have been secured in the temper and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Houses. We have no more to say or doe, but to defend our selves till we can have a right understanding of our purposes and actions before the Houses. In the mean time we shall look upon all opposition as the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a conscious and endangered Committee; and in respect of the Invasion lately made upon the persons of our neighbours, we think fit not to lie at the mercy of the Souldiers, but to have refuge to our Armes, from which no threats, or face of Souldiery shall drive us, knowing well the justice of our Cause, and the temper of our own Hearts.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus resolv'd they proceeded in their desigue, seizing all the Armes and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition at <hi>Scots</hi> Hall, <hi>Ashford, Feversham,</hi> and diverse other places, whilst Sir <hi>Michael Lusey,</hi> and some others of the Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants ceased not to act, to the utmost of their power, for the suppressing of them; But Esquire <hi>Hales</hi> (being a man well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and that indeed for his true desert, and worth) in short time had raised a great party in that part of the County; and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to work with those bold opposers, soon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64182:21"/>
laid their Power flat, and their Honour in the dust, till at last they were forc'd to shift for a better security than their Armes, and took sanctuary in Sir <hi>Peter Ricots</hi> house at <hi>Ailsford;</hi> but the Foxes lay not long there ere his Terriers were so neer forcing them forth, that they were glad to make Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Law to run away from them; which being granted, they delivered up the House, a great Magazine of Armes and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, which proved very serviceable to the Victors.</p>
            <p>In the interim other parties being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and modell'd into order, still moved up and down, and received all that wished well, and had signed and engaged in the Petition, who were so unanimous, that within two dayes space there were strong parties gotten together about <hi>Wy, Ashford, Sittingborne, Rochester, Gravesend,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse other places; insomuch, that the whole Committee were glad to make triall of the old Proverb, <hi>One paire of legs is worth two pair of hands,</hi> so they posted away to <hi>London</hi> to tell a lamentable story to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Captaine <hi>Lee,</hi> and another of the House being sent downe by order of the House, came to <hi>Rochester</hi> to Parley with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64182:22"/>
those that were met there; where, upon debate of the businesse, they used the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test policy they could to perswade them to accept of an Act of Indempnity from the House, and to lay down their designe; but these Gentlemen were immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, and were forc't to treat for their owne Indempnity and Liberty at last; for well the Engagers knew what the Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the House would be, if once they laid their Swords out of their hands, and were submitted to the malice of theirs.</p>
            <p>Tuesday, <hi>May</hi> 23. a great number of Knights and Gentlemen were again met at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> intending one and the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and as Active as Cordiall in the reall advancing the generall businesse, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other interest then the publique welfare; concluding with a magnanimous courage, to March with the Petition in one hand, and a Sword in the other: Not, though (as some have Malicioufly (not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously) given a false interpretation to) to force the Higher Powers to what they should fancy, or desire, (which indeed they might have done, (according to so grand examples in that kinde, as have been shewed by those too they were to deal with) the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64182:22"/>
Law now being swallowed up into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited arbitration of the power of a, though bloud-drunk, yet bloud-thirsty Sword) but that they might make their way through all obstructions, and have liberty; maugre all apposition to present their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grievances (according to the Ancient Custome of this Kingdome) to the Houses of Parliament, a thing never opposed, nor accounted Riotous till this Parliament by their All-powerfull Arbitration voted it so. Which being a generall resolve through the County, all men betook themselves cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to their Armes; the Inferiour sort, and Comminalty, submitting themselves to the Commands of the Superiours; who, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, acted what by a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was thought most convenient for the security of so great an Engagement as that was now brought to. And that there might be a clear, and candid satisfaction given as well to their friends as enemies throughout the Kingdome for their thus Arming themselves, caused this ensuing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance to be Published. (Having also understood before of the Bloudy answer their neighbours of <hi>Surrey</hi> had to their peaceable and legall Petition; for which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64182:23"/>
unhumane massacre the Butchering Mirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons (being fetcht for the same purpose by some of both Houses) had the thanks of the House.)</p>
            <q>
               <p>BEing reduced to this choice, whether to deliver up our Lives and Liberties toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or die Free: We are resolved to act the last scene of this Tragedy with our Swords in our hands, which we shall sooner turn upon our own hearts, than upon the publique Peace. By what necessities exasperated to this resolve let the world determine, and understand, that a Petition to Religion and Honour (if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be Judge) is by some persons nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Warranted by any Authority from the two Houses, nor pretending to it, upon their owne Score have audaciously affronted: The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners menaced, and persecuted into this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, by spirits so implacably distempered, that Sir <hi>Anthony Welding</hi> vowed he would not crosse the street of <hi>Rochester</hi> to save one Soul that subscribed to the Petition. And it was a proposition of <hi>Beales,</hi> to hang two of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of every Parish. If this be not enough to admonish others, let it suffice that it awakens us into a just sense and scorne of these Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64182:23"/>
We have lost all with patience; and if at last it be accounted a crime to Beg, we shall prefer to Perish.</p>
               <p>Therefore we doe Solemnly, and Religiously, oblige our selves, with our lives and fortunes, to oppose effectually, what person or persons soever shall presume to interrupt us in the just and legall presentation of our humble desires to the two Houses of Parliament; and to the utmost of our endeavours to save harmlesse, and protect each the other in a Priviledge so undoubtedly our own; and so not only adjudged, but practiced and encouraged by this present Parliament. And further, in case any single person shall be for this Engagement prosecuted, all of us to rise as one man to the rescue; this so help us God, as we shall respectively perform, and resolutely.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus gallantly resolved was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Gentry in the County, which animosity encouraged also the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty into as great Bravery, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Boldnesse. And indeed it was high time, as the state of all the Kingdome then stood, in so dismall a cloud of dull and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Slavery: The Tyrants swords having so long time drunk the Bloud of the Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Gentry of the Kingdome, that now
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64182:24"/>
they were insensible how they went on, or upon whom they exercised their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>This Tuesday, about noone, the Knights and Gentlemen that were intrusted as Commissioners (for that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> gave Commission to Colonell <hi>Robert Hammon</hi> for the beating up his Drums to raise a Regiment of Foot, and Colonell <hi>Hatton</hi> for Listing, and raising a Regiment of Horse. Their Commissions ran thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>For the more safe and speedy expedition in preferring the generall Petition of this County, we the gentry now Interested and trusted therein, do nominate and appoint you <hi>R.H.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell of one Regiment of Foot, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Having the day before seiz'd on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine of that part of the County then in that City, being very great both of Armes and Ammunition of all sorts; Colonell <hi>Hammon</hi> immediately beating up his Drums, he had in a short time Listed a considerable number of men, more, I think, than ever were listed by one man in so short a time. Then both Colonell <hi>Hatton</hi> and he had Orders given to Rendezvouz the next day at <hi>Barham-Downe,</hi> where all the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64182:24"/>
Souldiers of that part of the County were appointed (by warrant from the Commissioners) to meet: But this day proved extraordinary wet, which hindred the appearance very much.</p>
            <p>However Colonell <hi>Hammon</hi> came with about 300. Foot well Accoutred and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and Colonell <hi>Hatton</hi> with about threescore Horse: a good Collection for so short a time as one half day to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> many businesses for the advancement of the Engagement, using their utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the raising not onely of Men, but Money also, for the supporting, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging those who were not able to goe through it themselves, being off from all their Callings and Imployment. Engaging for the constant paying both of Souldiers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64182:25"/>
and Officers whilst they should continue in the Countries Services: For the better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement whereof, every Gentleman, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Ability, subscribed to the loan of Moneys, some a Hundred pounds, some Eighty, some Fifty, some Forty, some more, some lesse; and sent abroad their Warrants into all parts of the Country for the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all such men as had, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in that service for the advancing the generall safety of the County, and Liberty of the Kingdome.

Where, when they came, they found the Ports all shut,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64182:25"/>
and guarded round about the Town; then Master <hi>Mat.

So immediately they were, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching quietly in, they drew up in the Market place, and first changed all the Guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Town before they engaged in any other businesse, it being then almost night. Then the Commissioners being together, they sent for the Mayor of the Town, and demanding his subscription to the Petition, gave him orders immediately for the raising of Moneys for the forwarding the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; but he proved very slow in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, pretending that the Town was very poor, and could by no means raise any: The Excise officers were also called in, but their stores proved very poor also; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64182:26"/>
much that there remained little hopes of any good to proceed from that place.</p>
            <p>In the evening came in a Gentleman that had been formerly a Divine, and a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine at Sea, and a Major in the service of the Parliament, (as it seemed by his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) very penitent for that he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself in so unjust a Cause, and Horrid Employment; and proffered the best, and utmost of his service to the furthering the Petition, and the Engagement of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try if he might be employed in any thing that might give him opportunity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they knowing him to have been at Sea, and well acquainted with the Navie, being both Chaplain there to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and Minister of <hi>Deal,</hi> thought it could not prove amisse to employ him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving signed to the Petition before; and so had Letters drawn up for him that night, to every Ship one, and in every Letter a Copy of the Petition, making this absolute result, that some happy successe might follow; however, if it did no good, yet it could no way endamage them; which indeed proved a most happy, and fortunate designe as all the Kingdome are witnesses of. The next morning being Thursday, the Mayor and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64182:26"/>
Aldermen were againe called upon to know what moneys they had raised, or would advance to that Service, being solely for the Re-enthronement of the King (as they told them) and the speedy redemption of the most Turkishly enslaved Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to their true, ancient, and native Liberty: But they were then found as tardy as before, dull, and unwilling to endeavour, pleading the great necessity, and inability of the Towne, as nothing touch'd with any consideration of Loyalty or Conscience to their imprisoned King, or the bleeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of their enslaved Country. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commissioners thought it neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, nor fitting, to intrust them with a Military Power; but took away the Comissions from the Mayor (who was Captaine of a Trayned Company in the Town) and the other Trained Captains, and disposed of the Companies to other Gentlemen in the Town, such as for their Honesty and loyalty were thought worthy the trust; cutting to pieces that Commission of the Captaine of the Auxiliary Company, then seized on the Magazine of the Towne; and having loaded a Waggon with powder, Match and Ball, for the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64182:27"/>
made ready for a March towards <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ere they March'd, the Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againe drawn up to their Colours in the Market place, the Commissioners went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to give a Visite to a stripling Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture that lodged (by order of the Mayor, and his wise Brethren) at Captain <hi>Forstalls</hi> house, one of the Jurates, who pretended himself to be the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and that he was forc'd to fly out of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Queen, his Mother, had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to poyson him: Which notable phancy he had seriously insinuated into the generall opinions both of Towne and Country, by his often asseverating it with impudent Oathes, and damnable impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Insomuch that many Gentlemen and Women came dayly to kisse his Hand; and many Presents he had made him, Rich Cloathes, and Accommodation in every kind provided him by the Mayor and Jurats of the Town, who were so serious in it, that Sir <hi>Thomas Dishingto</hi> a Scotish man, being upon a Message from the Queen, and Prince, into <hi>England;</hi> and at <hi>Dover,</hi> in his journey back againe, hearing the report so generally in the Country of the Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64182:27"/>
at <hi>Sandwich</hi> was much startled at it; and to satisfie himself went to <hi>Sandwich</hi> to be informed, where he found him indeed a Welch Prince, but not the Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> and comming to him, after some discourse, as asking him who was his Gentlemen Usher, who his Pages, and other Servants? where the Queen was when he left her, and the like questions? he not being well provided with answers to either; and those questions so unexpectedly proposed to him, could give him no account at all (which was enough to satisfie any reasonable opinions that he was an Impostor) whereat Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> being much incenst, call'd him Villaine, and Counterfeit Rogue; the new-coyn'd Prince immediately shewes his power, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Mayor to clap Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his Treason; The Mayor presently obeyes his Command, and Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> instead of going back to <hi>Dover,</hi> is carryed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, where he lay about two dayes ere he could be set at liberty. Master <hi>Carter</hi> was also the Sunday after Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> was confined to see him too, to satisfie not only himselfe, but some Deputy Lieutenants in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whether it were he or not, (comming in so strange a manner as on foot, and in an
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64182:28"/>
old black ragged sute, without any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions but Lice) being acquainted with some of the Jurates, who knew that he could sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them well too, but would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their foolish confidence, although he not only assured them (amongst the rest, Captaine <hi>Forstall,</hi> at whose house he lay) that he was an Impostor, but affronted him upon the beach, before the Mayor and Jurates, who, with a Guard of Musquetteers were walking there with him. So highly did this young Prince of <hi>Sandwich</hi> bear up his businesse in as high a raunt as can possibly be imagined above a week; Trumpets soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Meat to the Table most commonly, and, as some say, most nights drunk ere he was acquainted with his Bed.</p>
            <p>But the Commissioners having had this account, and understanding of him, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to carry him away with them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he was sent (by some who have too long enjoyed a power of marring Princes, though not of making any) upon some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe on the County; and finding the hearts of the people much inclined to him (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what he had said to be true) spake nothing at all of him over night, nor of their resolutions, but just as they were ready to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64182:28"/>
March, as to give him a civill visit, went to see him, having an empty Coach of Sir <hi>Richard Hardreses,</hi> in which they intended to Invite him to March with them, as to free him from that restraint he had, by a Declaration which he had published, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be in, lest by violently taking him away they might cause a Mutinous Hubbub in the Town and Country: But this would not take, for when they came to the House, this precious Prince, and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, surmising their intentions, as guilty of their reall Knaveries, refused to let them in; Captaine <hi>Forstall</hi> shutting his doores, told them, the Prince had commanded him to keep them out, and he durst not disobey him. This they took as a high indignity and affront; and upon their desires Master <hi>Carter</hi> immediately drew up sixty Musquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers before the house to force an entrance, the rest of the party loading their Musquets, and lighting their Matches, stood all to their Armes, expecting some suddaine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; for now the whole Town grew into a Mutiny, and Distraction, so that the Commissioners were forc'd to prepare themselves for to fight too, for they did expect it every minute, and commanded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64182:29"/>
all Houses, and Shops, to be shut up.</p>
            <p>Mean time this young Impostor raunting in his new invested Authority, waves his Hat, and Plume, out at the window, calling out, <hi>Raise the Towne, Raise the Towne: Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, stand to me Seamen:</hi> throwing out handfulls of Money into the Streets among the people, which began to swarme up and down in throngs and tumults; women weeping for the violence they feared would be done to their Prince, and men swearing they would all die rather than suffer the Prince to be injured any way, or violently taken away: Almost every one either cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believing him to be really the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or else undoubtedly confederates in the same designe, raised so high a Tumult as would have ended in much mischief, had not the Gentlemen bestirr'd themselves resolutely, and undauntedly, in the quelling them.</p>
            <p>But whilst they were thus forcing an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the House, those Confederates who were within, privately conveyed him through the Back-side; and some Seamen waiting purposely at the Water-side, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported him immediately over into the Isle of <hi>Thanet,</hi> where a party being sent after
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64182:29"/>
him, found him that night at Master <hi>Crispes</hi> house at Supper, where he was entertained like him that he pretended himself to be: from whence he was conveyed to <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> Master <hi>Crispe</hi> being so courteous as to lend him his Coach thither also, and from thence to <hi>Newgate.</hi> This passage being over, he escaped for the time; they took Captaine <hi>Forstall,</hi> and would have carryed him away prisoner for refusing to let them enter his House; and by that meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his confederacy in the designe of that Mock-Prince, and so being the cause of the Hubbub in the Towne, which was so dangerous as might have caused much Bloud. But pretended he did really believe him to be the Prince, and he had commanded him to it, and he durst not disobey him: Then the Town Clark engaging himselfe for his appearance when he should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to answer for his default, he was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
            <p>Then the Gentlemen leaving some of those men they brought with them, and an Officer with them in the Town for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of it, and Orders to the new Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to call their Companyes to their Armes; they Marched away with the rest
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64182:30"/>
towards <hi>Dover,</hi> where they found Colonell <hi>Hammons</hi> Regiment encreased by that time to five hundred, and upwards; and Colonell <hi>Hattons</hi> of Horse to be about 200. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their former Orders drawing up to face the Castle, with some Trained Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of that part of the County; and many people with Cartes of Scaling-ladders, Spades, Shovels, and Pickaxes, according to the former dayes Warrants.</p>
            <p>Here they found the Town in a joyfull posture to receive them with much ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, where Captaine <hi>Bethels</hi> Fort resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, and all the Towne unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously betook themselves to their Armes; Trained men (which were two Companies) and others to joyn with them in so hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-happy a designe, as by all appearance that must of necessity be.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon diverse summons were sent to the Castle for Surrender of it to the service of the King and Country, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed. Sir <hi>H.</hi> a grand Independent, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament man being then in it (pretending no power at all there (as by his Letters indeed appeared) yet bearing the only sway, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all privately) by whose command those in the Castle had made incursions up.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64182:30"/>
on the Country a night or two before, and drove in many Sheep for to Victuall it; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to make out his own Interest, as it seemes, under the notion of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for it was without any Commission from them, as if it were an axiome amongst them, every one to act his phansie for the propagating the generall Calamity of the Kingdome, no matter at what rate, so their interest were secured: So large an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hath their arbitrary Prerogative, and unlimitted illegall Jurisdiction, as to abhor, as destructive, all conscience, or thought of affection to their Countryes peace, which easily discovered it self by the answers he made to the Letters and Propositions which were sent into the Castle to him from the Commissioners: As if that burden of intollerable guilt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, and unparallel'd misery of this gasping Nation had over-whelm'd his Conscience with a cloud of dispaire of any other safety than the old Roman Rule, <hi>Per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> semper, sceleribus tutum est Iter;</hi> knowing indeed himselfe to have been as zealous a promoter, and accessory to the generall Calamity as any confederate in the grand Juncto what ever; to whom indeed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64182:31"/>
the name of Peace is as odious as the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they know themselves guilty of, and if given over to the hand of Justice, and the Law of the Kingdome, they must unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perish under. Of which I doubt not, but though their resolutions be with <hi>Cataline,</hi> yet their end will be as the thirty Tyrants of <hi>Athens,</hi> whose proceedings have not much deviated from theirs.</p>
            <p>Now they sent not only summons to the Castle, but also civill Letters to Sir <hi>Hen: H.</hi> to invite him to a compliance, or at least to a cessation from his Engagement, with all promises of their Engageing for his security, and fafety, either for his staying in the County, or passing to <hi>London,</hi> or where he pleased; But he was farre enough from hearkning any whit to their civill Treaty, and by his meanes and one Lieutenant <hi>Swans,</hi> (who had before betrayed the Princes Commission (after he had engaged his faith for the acting according to it,) and indeavoured the taking away the lives of some Gentlemen that himselfe treated with about it) those in the Castle withheld from any rendition though often sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, and the greatest part as often wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deliver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64182:31"/>
This night Major <hi>Keme</hi> that went to the Fleet returned, assuring that those Letters he carryed to the Commissioners, were not onely received with extraordinary cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, but answered with as industriously reall action, relating, that the Mariners had no sooner read them, but immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, one, and all, for the King, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdome, and the Engagement of the Gentlemen of <hi>Kent.</hi> Boldly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the businesse upon the deck (though they knew not generally one anothers mindes) with their Armes in their hands; as if being surprised with so happy an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity were resolved to try what party they could make against opposition; which they found indeed so weake as not to engage, much more dispute, then to give them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to seise on some Officers and a few marriners in their particular Vessels, who did but timorously seem to contradict their actions; for oppose they durst not, so small was their Party, they were able to make amongst them, as any else whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer knowledge made them undesirous, or unwilling to trust, who they secured imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their businesse in the holds, and round-houses of the respective vessels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64182:32"/>
Upon this, the shouts they made Aboord were so loud, that they ecchoed a shrill ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to the eares of Colonell <hi>Rainsborow,</hi> then Vice Admirall, who being a Shore at <hi>Deal</hi> Castle, and hearing such acclamations made him haste from the Leads of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle (where he stood all the while the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners and Gentlemen were marching by, waving his Sword over his head in a threatning defyance to them) to goe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, that he might be the more certainly informed of the cause of this so generall Shout, not being from one, but every Ship then riding at Anchor in the Downs.</p>
            <p>But when he came neer, and would have Boorded, the Admirall, he was put off by the Marriners, who told him <hi>he had nothing to doe with them, nor should he.</hi> He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their reason, and what the matter was, being so much amazed at so suddaine an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration? they answered him immediately, <hi>That they were now upon other designes then they knew he would lead them on, or joyne with them in, and had declared themselves for the King, and the Gentlemen of</hi> Kent. But did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse he had been a loving, and Courteous Colonell to them; and in that respect should have no injury offered unto him, nor
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64182:32"/>
should he suffer any the least damage in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Goods; but what things he had aboord he should have safe away when he pleased.</p>
            <p>Whereat, seeing them so serious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, demanded a Pinnace to carry him up to <hi>London,</hi> for he was something time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and jealous how to trust himself a Shore, although he had the Command of <hi>Deal</hi> Castle within his Commission. But a Coxon stepping forth upon the Deck, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him: <hi>Sir, we cannot spare you any the least Vessell in the Downes, they are engaged for better Service; but there is a Dutch Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boate at shore, and for six pence you may have a passage in her to</hi> London. This much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted him, and augmented an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of danger in him; for understanding that <hi>Sandown</hi> Castle had at the same time declared with the Navy for the King and Country: He did not know how to trust himself either at Sea, or ashore. For he might justly fear the same in every Castle for ought he understood of their resolutions, yet was forc'd to betake himself to that <hi>ultimum refugium;</hi> in which manner, with his Wife, Children, Sisters, and the rest of his Family, which remained before in <hi>Deale</hi> Castle, he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64182:33"/>
wafted it away to give an account of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable escape to his great Masters at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> which alteration, with him, was as much beyond all mens expectation as his own.</p>
            <p>This welcome Messenger having given this fortunate account of his, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good successe: he was immediately dispatched away with Letters of Summons to the other two Castles of <hi>Deale</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> having instructions also, and power to treat with them for Rendition. Which actions, at that time, although they carryed a martiall face with them, to the opinion of our Enemies, yet took forme and life only from prudentiall, and cautious premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, not military Designes, for who could not but think it most unsafe to the Country, especially that part of it? and dangerous both to private and publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, to leave the strongest holds of those parts? in the Rear of them possessed by a violent and bloudy Enemy to make Encur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and Inrodes upon them, when they should please, the greatest strength of the County being to March away with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; of which, those in <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, by Command of Sir <hi>H. H.</hi> had given us a taste, as a faire warning, some two or three nights
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64182:33"/>
before; having sent out a party, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Country, taking (or rather rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing) from one man at least a hundred Sheep, and many more from others, that they had intelligence to have been interested in the Petition. Yet in all these actions of possessing the Fleet and Townes, was there so orderly a comportment, that not the least prejudice accrued thereby, either to the Life, Person, Estates, or Goods of any man.</p>
            <p>Then were Letters sent into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with Engagement of the Gentry and Merchants, for the bringing over ten thousand Armes, and a great proportion of Amunition of all sorts; as Letters also to the Prince to give him an account of all proceedings and intents of the engagers; altogether as honest, as resolute, and as yet (by Gods providence) so prosperous, that fortunes gates seeme to be wide set open to their so Honourable resolutions: being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing intended, or inclinable to the raising of any offensive Warre, but the purchasing (though at the hazard of all our Lives and Fortunes) of a happy and lasting peace; and that not particular to our selves, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to the Sion of our Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64182:34"/>
for which all men, I think, ought both to pray, and fight, if rightly, and Loyally called to it.</p>
            <p>And now having thus far proceeded, and with so auspicious successe, they went on, and prosecuted their businesse with much expedition, alacrity, and courage: know that time admits not any delayes where danger always is knocking at the door; and sloth and neglect in desperate and difficult enterprizes, are advancements onely to ruine and destruction; but in extremities the winning of time is the purchase both of life, and Honourable successe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the next morning they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched back from thence towards <hi>Deal</hi> Castle, leaving in <hi>Dover,</hi> and before the Castle, the Trayned Bands of the Towne, and three other Companies of that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that were not yet compleatly come up. And M. <hi>Arnold Brumes,</hi> and one or two more Justices of Peace more, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for the Country, to steer at the <hi>Helme,</hi> lest for want of good Pilots the businesse should suffer wrack; who the next morning drew up the great pieces that were planted on the Bench, and mounted them on the most advantagious ground on the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64182:34"/>
hill neer the Castle, which they did without any more losse than of one man, although the Castle played both small and great Shot very thick upon them; and having boldly planted them (where, I believe, never any Cannon were ever known to be placed, it being a most extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) very neer the Castle; they played very hot upon it, and battered the walls very much, being old; supposing, that seeing this violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, they would have yeelded it up, but all to no purpose, and Storme it they could not.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners, with the rest of the Gentlemen, (which were a handsome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) marched on towards <hi>Deal,</hi> carrying with them Colonell <hi>Hammons</hi> Regiment, being by this time compleated to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, well Armed, and as perfectly resolv'd, with Colours Flying, of white answerable to the candid innocence of a peace-making Egagement; and Col. <hi>Hattons</hi> Horse, with some Dragooners: The Gentlemen being about forty, were orderly drawn up into a Troop, and marching thus all the way upon the Downes, gave a very handsome appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both to the Country on the one side, and the Ships then riding at Anchor in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64182:35"/>
Downes on the other, which gave encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to both, and a disheartning also to the Castles, then upon treaty for Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Then the Castles discovering so orderly a Body of men advancing towards them, sent to the Commissioners to desire that they would not advance any neerer to them till they had concluded their Conditions, being on Treaty about them, the Articles being drawing up. Whereupon a halt was made, and a Rendezvouz, the party being drawn up, and planted an orderly Front towards the Castles.</p>
            <p>The Knights and Gentlemen then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them at the Rendezvouz, rid away to <hi>Deal</hi> Towne; where the first (as indeed most requisite) thing they did, was the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care for sending provision to that small Army they left in the Field; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went aboord the Ships to take posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them, and to place such Officers as they thought fit to entrust with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Where they were received with great acclamations and expressions of Joy.</p>
            <p>There one might have read in every mans face a perfection of cheerfulnesse, as having
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64182:35"/>
been a long time like slaves Gally-chain'd to a more than Turkishly condemnation, and now happily set free into the glorious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Loyall obedience; wherein they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed themselves so highly devoted to the service of the King and Country, as that they would not only be Commanded by Sea, but desired they might have first admittance to be listed Ashore; but that would not be granted them by the Commissioners, for they should thereby have disfurnish'd the Ships, and did not perceive they should have any need of them for Land service; for now they thought, that although they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing lesse then an affront, and opposition ere they should have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med what they had undertaken concerning their Petition; yet they supposed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would so unanimously joyne, as there should be little want of number, able to force through all obstruction whatsoever: Foot comming in at that time also very fast from all parts, and this happy successe, and gallant deportment of the Gentry being so high an incouragement to call them to their aid, gave new life and courage to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty, and made them content to leave all rurall occasions to joyne in that so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-like,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64182:36"/>
and Loyall designe. Although there were yet too many that lay lurking in their dunghill dens suttlely, to joyne with any Enemy that should endeavour to make a prey of them, and help forward (upon any opportunity) so desperate a ruine, as they cared not though it turned to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dissolution to the whole Kingdome, and a most wretched and untimely fall to their too indulgent, gloriously virtuous, and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd patient Soveraigne; so their owne Factious Interest might recover to their wished (but ignorantly proposed) end.</p>
            <p>A nest of other Cockatrices lay brooding also as idlely in the very heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nay, too many all over, whose dirty Souls were so settled on the lees and puddle of worldly interest, as depressed them down to so ignoble and cold a disposition, that would not suffer them to look up to Loyall obedience, nor permit their capacities to climb so high as a knowledge of that duty they owed to their King and Country, though their owne Interest was as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded as anies that was the most active, every man being alike concerned in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peace; and, I think, according to his quality and condition ought to endeavour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64182:36"/>
as industriously for its advancement, many of them, knowing as much too, yet so wretchedly worldly as to prefer the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Estates, though like Jewes, under the worst of bondage, than like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to hazard (the impairing them onely) for the setled and assured enjoyment of them in the happiest liberty the Golden Age of a Just and Religious peace would give them in the future.</p>
            <p>There were some Deputy Lieutenants also came in, (for their security more than their Conscience sakes, which they slubber'd o're with a counterfeit disguise of dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to purchase a better welcome) whom I could name too, but shall forbear; the comming in, and entring the Lists, with these Loyall Engagers, after they had signed not onely to the Petition, but War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and Commissions too, made a faire retreat, and bidding adieu to the danger of proving Loyall Subjects, slipt their enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Coller, and stole away to <hi>London,</hi> and may chance deserve a Halter for it hereafter, as well as the rest of the greatest Opposers: But, I suppose, ere this, though not in respect of their fortunes, (for which they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce) yet in respect of the better wealth of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64182:37"/>
their Soules they may have undergone so much of repentance, as may purchase a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from Heaven, which my charity makes me hope rather, than wish the contrary: and they are sensible enough they have a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne to deal with, so farre inheritor of his Fathers Virtues as well as Honours and Prerogative, as by his excesse of mercy to mittigate the rigour of Treason and Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p>But to return to our new Sea-Royalists, who now not onely thought, but express'd also the great happinesse of their chang'd condition; saying cheerfully, many of them, <hi>They onely now lived, and had a long time, as it were, laine amazed 'twixt life and death, and desired rather to die in the service of their King, then to live againe in that of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which the Commissioners were much joyed to see, and encouraged them on in their gallant Loyalty, giving amongst them in every Ship, a summe of mony to drink, which they as gratefully received; and at their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off to shore, gave them from every Vessell many great Shot, answered with as many Shouts, and Acclamations. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Marriners were so eager in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64182:37"/>
prosecuting this new engaged Loyalty, that the greatest difficulty in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, proved in the keeping them Aboord, being almost Mutinous to come ashore to list themselves for Land ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as believing they should not finde any opposition at Sea; or if, yet not time enough for them to expresse in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what they had already done in their words, and as absolutely resolved in their hearts, as it was the expression of many of them.</p>
            <p>Which, to make up the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, they afterwards, of themselves, sent away a Messenger to the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Navy with this Declaration following.

This day about night the Articles for the Castles of <hi>Deale,</hi> and <hi>Wamer</hi> were signed, and the one delivered before, the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Commissioners marched away. Their conditions upon surrender were to march away with their baggage, leaving their Arms and Ammunition behind them entirely, without any imbezelment or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
            <p>The Rendevouze being broke up, they marched away and quartered in <hi>Sandwich</hi> againe that night, leaving in <hi>Deale Anthony Hamond,</hi> Esq. and Cap. <hi>Bargrave,</hi> who had been formerly an Officer of the Navie; (both Justices of Peace, and gallant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet men, (not according to those of this wise reformation) as Commissioners for the managing of the businesse there, and in the Fleet; having sent away for Sir <hi>John Mince,</hi> Capt. <hi>Fogg</hi> and some others, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that had formerly been employed at Sea by the King, and for their Loyalties displaced by the Parliament, who were also earnestly desired by the Officers and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners aboarde.</p>
            <p>When they came to <hi>Sandwich</hi> having beene so prosperous in all these underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and done so much in so little time as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64182:39"/>
indeed amazed the whole Country. The Mayor and his brethren began to comply, and received them with farre more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse then before they had done; and that night made them a present of two hundred pounds to the advancement of the Designe, who before were so needy they knew not how to subsist amongst themselves, much lesse to raise any summe of money for extraordinary service.</p>
            <p>The next morning they hasted their march from thence to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> leaving also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them two or three Commissioners, and five trained companies, for the better securing that Town, being a place very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and apt to take the opportunity of the weaknesse of the Country, to make a mutinous opposition in case of a retreate.</p>
            <p>That night being Sunday night, they quartered in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> not slipping any opportunity or minute of time, without an improvement of it to the best advantage, and acting something to the furtherance of that Engagement; the next day being the appointed limitation for their meeting at <hi>Rochester.</hi> Here there came in many Gentlemen and others to Joyn with them that were not at all Engaged before, unlesse
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64182:40"/>
against us; amongst the rest, Sir <hi>John Roberts,</hi> and one or two Deputy Lieutehants more who Signed to the Petition, and Subscribed to the Loane of Money, although they had before engaged themselves with the rest of the Committee against the Petition; But rather like Physitians, that out of a private interest, are nimble to assist and pleasure others to profit themselves, than out of any cordiall affection to so just, and honest an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutchmen</hi> of the City (which indeed are very numerous) engaged themselves for the raising and paying of two Companies; here also Colonell <hi>Hammon</hi> compleated his Regiment, many more men comming in to him, and others that he had raised in the City, and neere about fitted themselves for a farther March.</p>
            <p>In this City and Suburbs were three Trained Compaines which were all drawn up to Armes; which, that they might secure the place (with the two <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies then a raising) they left behind some Knights and Gentlemen to manage the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in that part of the County were left there, lest some insurrection might happen by the obstructers of the designe, who swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64182:40"/>
about that place; and by surprizing it, not onely doe much mischief in the Rear of the Body, but in case so much misfortune should befall them, as to force them to a Retreat, (which caution is no whit too soon remembred in the strongest, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Armies at any time) and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed most unfortunately fell out to them at the last.</p>
            <p>In this time the noble Peer, the Earl of <hi>Tha.</hi> acted his most Heroick gallantry about <hi>Ashford, Hotfield,</hi> and <hi>Charing,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the first that rose, and drew that part of the Country to a resolution of betaking themselves to their Armes, by sending his Letters to all Gentlemen he knew had any power, and secured above a thousand men in that part to rise in a short time; and at the first of any rising at all in the County, giving an account of it also to Squire <hi>Hales,</hi> encouraging him thereto, who farre more gallantly proceeded than ever he began.</p>
            <p>So now, when he had made a fair and hopefull beginning, and had assured very large assistance from his purse, makes a slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exit from this scene of Honour, and obscures himselfe behinde the hanging of Apostatisme. In so much that when he was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64182:41"/>
sought for by his neighbouring Gentlemen, whom he had incited by his forwardnesse, and invited by perswasions, the Noble Earle was fled, (not for Religion, nor I thinke to any) to take councell of his peere the Earle of <hi>Pembroke;</hi> whom (after some grave and wise consultation had) he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged so farre as to goe with him to <hi>Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> there to plead with the quintessence of his oratory for forgivenesse, promising if he might but scape a whipping, then never to doe so againe, Which he did.</p>
            <p>Where the gallant and doubty Earle (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a pause for recovery of breath) made what discovery the whole action was lyable to, and his capacity could reach; Making also severall propositions to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, which he assured them was the only way to remove those distempers; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that he had heard such things from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Gentlemen in the Engagement that gave assurance to his hopes.</p>
            <p>The Committee thereupon began to be a little enclinable unto his discourse, and gave as much credit to it, having his Friend, and Couzen <hi>P:</hi> to sweare for him; and thereupon resolved upon some Instuctions to be given him as concerning indemnity
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64182:41"/>
upon a disbanding, and submission again to the Yoak, and the like: Which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reported to the House, were resolved on; and he on the thursday morning dispatcht away with them.</p>
            <p>Who immediately posts home, and with his greatest power endeavours the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commonalty; beginning first with the discouraging the Gentry, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once down, the other must necessarily fall; and indeed proceeded so farre in it, that caused diverse Gentlemen, as well as Commoners, to desert the businesse; but the generality being constant, and their Consciences linck'd to the service, by the golden chain of Religion, and Loyalty, were not to be disheartned; insomuch, that I think, those stratagems, as the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured for suppression, gave a more couragious life to their actions, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that pestiferous obstruction to a cordiall advancement.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen and Commoners being not onely sensible of this his basenesse, but also insens'd at it, gave the noble Earl this satisfaction to that designe of his (or rather treachery) as it were a pill for to purge his Apostatisme (better physick I confesse
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64182:42"/>
might have been administred, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) remitted him up to the Committee with this Letter.

            <p>Thus did this Jewish Apostat Lord fall short of his intended Treachery to his Lord and Master the KING, and disloyally to his Country: And his supposed Glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe extinguish'd in a stink, so great, I fear, as will remain fresh in the nostrils of Fame, and render him odious to his Country to all Posterity; how he savoured in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of the Committee I know not. Yet he hath obtained thus much reward, he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64182:43"/>
hath gotten a fame by it, which he may if he please boast of; that in it he shall live after death; But it is no better then that of <hi>Erostratus,</hi> who wilfully set fire to the Temple, that he might get to himselfe a fame when he was dead. Which will be as due a recompence as so unhandsome and unnaturall Apostatisme can deserve.</p>
            <p>But now on the contrary our Resolute Engagers resolving to regard no obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what ever, any further then to kick it out of the way; and the time drawing neer to the limitation of the Postscript, those from <hi>Canterbury</hi> hasted their march on the munday morning towards <hi>Rochester</hi> both Horse and Foot: But the march was too tedious, and the men not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, that day being the time of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to march away again the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towards <hi>Black-heath;</hi> Wherefore the Foot marched no farther then <hi>Sittingborne,</hi> where they quartered that night, intending to march on the next morning. But the Commissioners and the rest of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with Col. <hi>Hattons</hi> Horse marched on that night to <hi>Rochester,</hi> ordering their march to a very military conformity.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rochester</hi> they met with the Gentry
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64182:44"/>
of the County from all Quarters, in a very great number, as at a generall Rendevouze: But the maine body of those men they had drawn together, (or rather who had drawn themselves together) for they came in with a voluntary cheerfulnesse, and as cheerfull a resolution) lay in, and about <hi>Daertford,</hi> as being an advance twenty miles forwards of their next dayes march to the appointed Rendevouze.</p>
            <p>That night came one or two Gentlemen out of <hi>Essex,</hi> To treat with the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners at <hi>Rochester</hi> (being then generally met from all parts of the County) about the association of both Counties in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Engagement, assuring that the whole County of <hi>Essex</hi> would unanimously rise to joyne with them, and desired a meeting of a resected party of the <hi>Kentish</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to joyne in a parley some where over the Water, with some that should be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in <hi>Essex</hi> for that purpose, but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then so neer the period of that time, wherein by our generall Engagement we had bound the whole Country to meet, and to march towards <hi>London,</hi> could not Joyne in any such thing; but took the promise of those Gentlemen as an assurance, that the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64182:44"/>
County of <hi>Essex</hi> would unanimonsly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to rise at the same time to joyne with us in the maine Interest; Others came also from <hi>Surrey</hi> to treat on the same termes, promising as great a readinesse of that County to joyne in that association which was received with a great deale of alacrity.</p>
            <p>But about midnight the same night (they being to march onwards the next morning) came down a post with an order from the House of Commons to <hi>Rochester,</hi> to the Commissioners joyned in that Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this purpose; that, whereas they did understand that the people of <hi>Kent</hi> were comming up to <hi>Westminster</hi> in a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and pretended petitionary way, they knew not the Intentions of it, and had therefore referred them to treat with the Generall the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Derby-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rigorous order of prevention being received and read, In the morning the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell being met, the businesse was scand and discust; for now this graine of paper had quite turned the Ballance, and absolutely altered the constitution of the Generall Interest; for they could not but believe that the Army would advance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64182:45"/>
against them, knowing well enough (considering the posture the Country was in) what it would be to treat with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and potent adversary, in that inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced condition, I meane of a new rais'd and unmodelled body of raw men.</p>
            <p>Whereupon by a generall result, orders were immediately dispatched away to <hi>Dartford;</hi> and the other places adjacent, where the maine Body then quartered and lay upon Guard, to march then back to <hi>Rochester;</hi> having also intelligence within a very short time that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> with his maine Body was advanceing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us already: But however upon their retreate left a Guard at a place called <hi>Stone</hi> bridge neer <hi>Gravesend</hi> to secure that passe, but they could not long hold it, the enemy (for so we might easily guesse them to be by this time, by the ceizing all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others they met) comming up so close, although, to say truth, a better order might have been observed in it; and indeed would, had the Party been a formidable Body.</p>
            <p>When they came back to <hi>Rochester,</hi> Master Mat: <hi>Carter</hi> having received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Quarter-master Generall of all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64182:45"/>
the forces then raised, or to be raised in that County, from the Commissioners and Gentlemen engaged, received Orders from the Councell for the Quartering them there, Whereupon he first caused them to be drawn up by distinct Regiments in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Fields; whereby he was able to take an exact account of the strength of every. Regiment, so to know how to dispose of them, and ascertaine the Councell of the full number in grosse; which then he Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in rank and file compleatly arm'd, seven thousand of the Infantry, and as well accoutred, being most of them very suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men of ability, and not wanting of as Honourable resolutions. The Horse not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn together, but abroad, the most of them upon severall parties, could not be so well taken notice of. At which time also there were at severall places of the Country about three thousand more which never came up to this party, as at <hi>Canterbury, Maidstone, Sittingborne, Sandwich</hi> and <hi>Dover.</hi> This gallant Body by his care were equally divided into Quarters in <hi>Rochester, Strood,</hi> and <hi>Chatham</hi> the Horse in Villages neer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent. And the Engagers now began to cling more closely, and taking time by the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64182:46"/>
fore-locke, thought it not good to let slip any minute, lest their hopes and security might be lost with it; and began more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider what might most probably advance their safety and honour, knowing that what they were now to trust too was difficult severity of Fortune, the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like enough to fall in suddainly upon them.</p>
            <p>Amongst many considerations, at last they easily concluded, that the next busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that must be endeavoured, must be to mould that party into a formidable Army, and to appoint one particular man to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief. For now they were forc'd to stand upon their own guard, to maintain that with the Sword which was intended onely in a just and peaceable way, according to the Ancient Customes of this Kingdome. But this is a new liberty of the Subject, none of the old I am sure: A sad world when men shall fall deeper into the pit of Destruction, by the endeavours of those they supplicate for aid to bring them out; and who, by naturall, as well as legall alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and interest, are bound to assist, and by themselves placed for it. If this be to Reforme, Heavens blesse all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64182:46"/>
and Loyall Subjects from Reformation. Having now thus resolved, they appointed a Rendezvouz the next day at <hi>Barham</hi> Downe, some three miles distant from thence towards <hi>Maidstone:</hi> Where the Lord <hi>Norwich</hi> was proclaimed Generall in the head of the Army, (for now being drawn together, they deserved that Title) so gallant a Body they were of Infantry, who received him with as much cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; expressing an unparallel'd willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to serve their King, and as much joy that they were so engaged to it, knowing that their service was not onely for Him, but the whole Kingdomes peace, the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of their Countries Liberty, and the Churches tranquility. As it hath been a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and as true an Observation in all Ages and Common-wealths, that those that engage in other mens quarrels are more remisse, and unspirited, as knowing that they shall partake in the danger, but not in the victory, since another would receive the greatest and fairest fruit thereof, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Honour likewise to themselves: whereas they also that take Armes for their Country, may conceive better hopes that God will prosper them, for that they seek
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64182:47"/>
not to take from others, but to keep their own; and that they fight not for other mens phancies, but their owne defence, whereby the whole benefit of victory will redound to themselves.</p>
            <p>This Rendezvouz being broke up, the Army Marched again into Quarters, though not the same as before, neither by the Quarter-master Generals laying out; much, I confesse, contrary to the Lord Generalls sense or intentions, whose advice it was that it would have been most convenient to lodg them close together, or in the Field, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very faire weather at that time. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have been informed there are some, who have broach'd a most damnable Aspersion on the Earl of <hi>Norwich;</hi> throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dirty and odious Calumny in the face of his innocent and unspotted Fame: <hi>That he was the man who betrayed that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to its succeeding destruction; and that he made it his designe to take that Command upon him, that he might the more easily effect that designe, being himself no Souldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so impudently, or else ignorantly, they proceeded in this Ignoble derogation, as to raise a confirmation of it from this conclusion: That had it not been so, he had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64182:47"/>
as well paid the losse of life for his Loyall service, as the Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, that his owne designe steered him to that Interest, is so palpably false, that it was as absolute an accident as could be, that brought him to <hi>Rochester,</hi> (as at the first of his comming, and at his being in <hi>Colchester</hi> I have heard him relate my selfe) being in his Journey to <hi>Sussex,</hi> and taking that road to scape the Army, who then lay very thick in the other, and who knows not how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is to travaile amongst them. Where when he came, and the Commissioners (Just then upon the dispute, whom to invest with that command) hearing of his arivall, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly selected peculiar Gentlemen to make a civill addresse unto him, with the tender of that Command, and their serious obedience and service with it, as being a Peer of the Realm, and a man of so known a worth, and a mind so deep and able, as to capacitate him for any great command. Whereby he might easily end that strife which so sodainly might have been blown up to a destructive flame, being already kindled by those more then sparks of Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, in the breast of some Gentlemen
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64182:48"/>
then Interested; Having before with much earnestnesse solicited the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> to that no whit dishonourable (though it might be feared unbeneficiall) Engagement. But his feares turning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, dictated to his Soul more powerfull arguments for easie denyalls.</p>
            <p>To which the Earle of <hi>Norwich</hi> returned this most courteous answer, (with as modest an excuse from undertaking so high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in a Country where he had so little engagement) That he was confident the Duke would yet Engage with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being so generally, unanimously, and courageously met, and upon so just, unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, and candid a designe, and that he believed he would undertake the command. For the further advancing whereof, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himselfe a solicitor for them to the Duke; which favour they accepted grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and he as willingly performed.</p>
            <p>And going to <hi>Cobham</hi> to him with his best rethorick, and powerfull perswasions, Invited, and courted him to it; But all to no effect. Whereupon the Commissioners at his returne still intreating him, and as it were pleading a necessity of it to him, he at the last accepted of it, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64182:48"/>
and satisfaction of all the Gentry, and Commonality too, then met together.</p>
            <p>But (as I have heard him declare since) onely that the Army might be modelled, whereby it might be a greater invitation to the Duke; Not that he intended after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to dissert the service, but continue it, only with an acknowledgment of superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Duke, for the better encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Army; who must of necessity receive so much the more of a vigorous courage, by how much the more nobility, and Generous honour, is Engaged in their Conduct.</p>
            <p>Yet all perswasions proved alike in effect; By which meanes he became totally En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. Which I thinke (though he were no Soldier) was then as advantageous (if heaven had designed it fortunate) as could be then expected.</p>
            <p>For through the whole course of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding service, upon any nicety, he did most prudently declare himself, and after his owne opinion layd downe, gave it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a Councell of Warre, for a more mature and generall result: Appearing in his constant actions more a Soldier then some of no small name and undertaking,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64182:49"/>
who have so boldly adventured to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Loyalty and Honour. More con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations, I neither need, nor shall desire to give.</p>
            <p>Now this night the Army, (by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some at the Councell held in the field (as being indeed more generous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Gentlemen then experienced Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, or Soldiers) was quartered at large in the Country, the Generall and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners returned back to <hi>Rochester,</hi> where Sir Anthony <hi>Aucher,</hi> and Master <hi>Hales</hi> left them; not as some falsely surmise, and give out, because they heard of the Enemies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing; nor through any discontent as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as Idly report; But upon this account, Master <hi>Hales</hi> being of a more noble and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous gallantry, then his yeares might speak him to be, living within fifteen miles of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> had upon his first Engagement, (as his expression to my hearing) made a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to see home till he had seene the Army in a formidable posture; according to which resolution he had not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly continued with them till this night, and now having seen the Army in such a modell as that daies Redevouze and the appointment of a Generall rendered it:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64182:49"/>
took it for an absolute solution of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and resolved that night to goe home onely to accomodate himself the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Mony, and other necessaries for a longer March, and to return the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; so took his leave of the Generall, the Commissioners, and the rest of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and rid to his House; and Sir <hi>Anthony Aucher,</hi> by his earnest entreaty, went along with him, but the misfortunes of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding night obstructed their return.</p>
            <p>For in the night the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> with his whole Body, marching downe towards <hi>Maidstone,</hi> and finding the River slightly Guarded, about <hi>Farley</hi> Bridge beyond the Town some two miles, easily got over; and with a strong party fell upon the Towne, ere those within it were almost Alarumed; in which Town lay part of Sir <hi>John Maynies,</hi> and Sir <hi>Will: Brockmans</hi> Regiments enquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that never came to the Rendezvouz, consisting of about eight hundred men.</p>
            <p>The Enemy being possessed of that passe, Marched over with their whole Body, they in the Towne not having any true Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence all the day before of them, or their motion, and fell in upon their Out-guards so violently, that within a very short space
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64182:50"/>
those in the Town were forced to fight upon extraordinary disadvantages; the Enemy so farre exceeding them in number, and the Army quartered at such a distance, they could never make a Retreat, nor have any Relief time enough to assist them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, their Courage was such, as made their Enemies know they fought with men so well satisfied in the justice of their Cause, as not to be daunted, or startled at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or apprehension of Death, though in never so grim a shape; but rather like true-borne Heroes contemning all danger, and death it self, so they might but bury their misfortunes in the wounds of their surious opposing, and oppressing Enemies; who thinking them no other then a number of men hudled together in a tumultuous manner, because of their being so suddainly gotten together, the whole Body being raised within ten dayes; fell on them with so much violence, as if they had been Lyons, and would have devoured them at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; or like a boysterous whirlwind scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them before them like dust: But much contrary to their expectations, instead of finding a prey, they met with those that were more likely to make a prey of them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64182:50"/>
whose bold resolutions soone daunted their fury. And these tumultuous disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly fellowes, as they termed them, they found orderly enough to oppose them; and although newly raised, yet of courages of the oldest Souldiers, selling their Lives and Liberties at as dear a rate as ever men did; few of them falling without first dispatching twice as many I am confident, (and their survivers must confesse it) to receive their reward of their Grand Lord and Muster, who, I believe, hath ere this paid them their Arreares in the other world for their good service in this.</p>
            <p>This service, (though unexpected) grew very smart, and hot, both parties conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which should expresse more Valour; the one defending their Lives, disputing their fortification, which were but bare, and thin Hedges, with as little thought of danger, or security, as if this had been in an impregnable Fort.</p>
            <p>The Foe behaving themselves as gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if they did not think of such a thing as a possibility of being beaten. Yet this over-powred party so bravely defended their ground, that ere long them had bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten they off, in such manner that the Lord
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64182:51"/>
               <hi>Fairfax</hi> finding his party in such disorder, even upon a Retreat, alighted from his Horse, and came on himselfe with them to encourage them on, who were so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the unexpected courage of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, that their disorder was like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have much endangered their whole Body.</p>
            <p>But at the last, fresh men still powring their shot in upon them, they were beaten off from their Hedges, and forc'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute the losse of their ground from place to place, against an extraordinary disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the Enemies Horse now breaking in upon them on all parts, and shewing but little remissenesse in their execution, when they had an opportunity to make any home Charge upon them; yet they left not their Courage with their ground, but still di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed the losse of every foot with as clear a Courage as if but still beginning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; from Street to Street, and from Porch to Porch, often falling upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse with onely their Swords, in such a generous manner, as they seemed as prodigall of their Bloods, as they were of their Blowes, which they distributed in a plentifull manner on every one durst stand
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64182:51"/>
to receive them; insomuch, that they put them to as often Retreats, by their so handsome and bold Encounters; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still over-powred by the numerous reserves that continually advanced on them, were enforced still to Retreat, till at the last they came to the Church-yard, and from thence to the Church, quitting not any place dishonourably, or unhandsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So that they made the businesse so really hot, and difficult, that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the Victors themselves would have wish'd to have rather been without that Victory, than to have purchased it at so dear a rate. But this party, after a long Fight, were drawne to so hard a push, they were forc'd to capitulate, none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to their assistance or reliefe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it were a few scattering men, who hearing them so engaged, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order, left their Quarters and hudled into this Croud of confused De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, which they were over-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in.</p>
            <p>And here againe in a cause received, that too many Gentlemen conceive sufficient for them to approbriate the Generall, as either treacherous, or infinitely negligent
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64182:52"/>
in not relieving that Party, which as they say might easily have been done. And then in all their discourses they frequently urge, endeavouring thereby to obscure the face of his Honour with black shades of Infamy. But all cannot do; his Honour is too high flowne, for those short wing'd Bastards to reach at, having a Soule I am confident as white, with Innocent and Loyall thoughts, as his head with hairs, and a Spirit as active as the boldest he that dares question it: And to cleare him in this, first, although proclaimed Generall of that Army, yet of so little a date was that Title to him, as that he was not so immediately and clearly impowered with the charge of them, and conduct of their Interest, as (like a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) to act his owne will immediately in it; There being as yet too many Generalls, or at least ambitious Spirits Interested, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving formerly a power in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of them, had not yet so clearly layd downe their power, they supposed, that nothing must be done (or at least ought) without the result of their opinions in it. By whose advice and perswasion the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was quartered in the Countrey at large; too wide indeed to be rallyed in any time
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64182:52"/>
considerable, or drawn to any Rendevouze, what ever occasion might, or should fall out; as it fell too appearantly true in this. Although of my own knowledge it was the advice of the Generall, to Lodge them all that night in the field by the river side; which counsell, had the Gentlemen of that County observed, the body had remained entire, ready to wait, and receive the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon any motion they should, or could make; and the river so garded that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy could never possibly have forc't any place, passe, or Forde of it. But the men are thought weary, and harased off their leggs, (having indeed marched very tedious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) and therefore must have fresh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and large, to revive and refresh their tired Spirits; By which meanes the enemy made an easie passage over the river, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any opposition at all, and the Party in the Towne quite lost, e're the Army or a Party considerable for their reliefe could be drawne together to any Rendevouze. And yet not only strangers to the businesse (who indeed ought also to be carefull how they censure, and asperse men of so much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) but some whose young Soldierships councells were partly the cause, cast the losse
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64182:53"/>
of the businesse upon the Generall, who I am assured all that night, while constant Alarums were sounded in his eares, of their being in fight, did his endeavours to draw Parties to a Rendevouze from their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to their assistance; but none could be forced out, at least considerable; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next morning early, he caused the Army as soone as it was possible to get them together, (having sent out orders at the first newes of their being in fight at <hi>Maidstone</hi>) to be drawn up to a Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze at <hi>Finsbury</hi> fields, on the other side the river <hi>Medway,</hi> by <hi>Stroode;</hi> Where a Councell was called in the field, and upon a report that it was yet possible to relieve them at <hi>Maidstone,</hi> it was a generall result, and desire of the Generall, yet to march entire thither. Whereupon the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched through <hi>Rochester,</hi> it being the resolution of the Generall if it were yet possible to relieve them or to fight the whole Army of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But he had not marched two miles, when certaine Intelligence came, that they were all cut off, and taken Prisoners the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore early; though many of them came up to the Army afterwards having made their escape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:64182:53"/>
Upon this Intelligence the Army was marched back againe to <hi>Rochester;</hi> Where the Generall with the Commissioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themselves to their Councells againe, to consult what was best to be done in that condition; the Parliament having before hand refused to receive their Petition, and the Enemy already entred the very bowells of their Country, and a party roaving about, and making a prey of their Estates, and Friends. For one Major <hi>Osborne</hi> an Officer of the Parliaments with a Troope of Horse, was before wheeled downe about <hi>Ashford,</hi> and so towards <hi>Sittingborne,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Col. <hi>Hammon</hi> was ordered to stay with his Regiment at <hi>Sittingborne,</hi> and Col. <hi>Hatton</hi> marched back with his Horse, and liting on this troope of the Enemies, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, where Major <hi>Sumner</hi> was kil'd, and one or two Gentlemen more wounded. Upon which Sir <hi>Rich: Hardres</hi> was againe entreated back, by the Commissioners, into <hi>East-Kent</hi> to raise the rest of the Country, and to take care for the securing of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and the other townes. Sir <hi>Michaell Lusey</hi> was also raising all he could make, this Major <hi>Osborne</hi> with his troop securing him in it; by which meanes the whole
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64182:54"/>
Country began to seeme with a face of an absolute seat of Warre. But now the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Soldiery at <hi>Rochester</hi> was such, as would not admit the Generall time enough to resolve on any thing, being then at consultation what course to steere; For though the weather were such as would have envited them rather, to desire the shelter of the towne, then to expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such an extremity of Raine, as then showered downe; yet they were so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous and greedy of action, as almost tended to mutiny; For drawing out their collours themselves caused their Drums to beat, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; If their Officers would not march, they would both march and fight without them. Whereupon the Earle of <hi>Norwich</hi> commanded them to be drawn into the field to a Rendevouze in the same place as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; not being yet resolved which way to contrive the laying of his designe to the best advantage; for he would act nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the absolute conclusion of the Councell, in which was now included many able Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which came in from severall parts to Joyne and engage with us, more indeed there came then the present condition of the County would permit accommodation
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64182:54"/>
to: Which gave an occasion to divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to thinke themselves disrespected, wanting Horse, and other conveniences for Warre, by reason of their comming down from <hi>London</hi> by water, and unprovided: But indeed the County at that time could not yeeld so many Horse as was supposed it would, therefore they could not be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for the present, but order was given by the Commissioners for their Civill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an Ordinary provided at the County charge for them, that they might continue on free quarter with promise of the furniture of all accoutriment answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Quality, as opportunity would give leave: Master <hi>Hales</hi> also out of his owne purse presented a Party of them that most wanted for the present, with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound to be distributed amongst them.</p>
            <p>Now it had beene the advice of some to plant the Army in that place, and by fortifying that City to maintaine it as long as they could; But this young mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary policy was not liked by some, who better understood that the Generall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement concerned action, and not to lie still under a passive designe, besides
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64182:55"/>
that towne was not to be maintained, though some thinke it was, by reason of that River which of it selfe was a fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one part of the towne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore now comming into the field, the Generall called again the chief Officers of the Army and Gentlemen to Counsell; Where it was a great dispute, and the onely now, whether they should march on towards <hi>London</hi> in the prosecution of the intended designe, according to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, or march back to fight the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy who was wildly roaving, and raving in the very heart of their Country; and by Joyning with those in <hi>East-Kent</hi> strengthen their force, and either fight the Enemy or secure that County: But it was not long, e're they concluded to march on; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though their body of Infantry was strong enough for to give the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a field, if occasion should require it; yet the Horse was so weak as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to any Fight at all, having not two hundred Horse they durst put any confidence in; and for joyning with those in <hi>East-Kent,</hi> they were strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, or would be, of themselves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, they knew, that if they Marched
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64182:55"/>
backwards, the Enemy would certainly draw down more powerfully upon them; and forcing them to retreat into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Country, take off all hopes of any assistance from any other County, which they expected, according to the association agreed on betwixt <hi>Surrey, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi> and themselves. And if they Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on, they should draw the Army af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them: And by drawing nearer those two Counties be both an encouragement, and assistance to draw them together; who once joyning with them, would make so great a Body, as in all probability would be formidable to the Enemies; for now they were forc'd by that violence, into an absolute defensive War.</p>
            <p>This being the result of the Councell, we immediately Marched from the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz towards <hi>Dartford;</hi> onely Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>D. Wyles</hi> with his Regiment (some of them being gone before) Marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards <hi>East-Kent;</hi> which Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was full upon Muster twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men. Colonell <hi>Hammons</hi> of Foot lying about <hi>Sittingborne, Feversham,</hi> were ordered by the Generall to March back to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to strengthen that place,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64182:56"/>
and never came up to the Rendezvouze at all.</p>
            <p>About midnight we came to <hi>Dartford,</hi> where the Generall caused a Letter to be drawne up, and sent to the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Councell of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to give them notice of our March that way, as also of our intentions. Desiring withall, that if it might be, we might have their assistance, which we hoped for, having Treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with them: Or at least wise that if we might not have their assistance, yet that they would permit us to March through the City of <hi>Westminster</hi> without interruption, or resistance. Engaging the whole Counties security for theirs that they should not thereby be endamaged the least mite.</p>
            <p>But they (like a Dogge to his Vomit) turned to their old course of Parliament Service; and no sooner received the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but immediately instead of returning a civill Answer to the Generall, dispatch'd it away to the Speaker of the House un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke up.</p>
            <p>However, we knew nothing thereof till the next evening; so we marched on
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64182:56"/>
all that night, and the next day without any refreshment, or repose at all. The next day about noone we came to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> where the Generall drew the whole Army into the Park, expecting to receive some good satisfaction from the City, as also from <hi>Surrey, Southwark,</hi> and <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we found but small encouragement, or reason for the continuance of those hopes, receiving no intelligence from <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> nor any newes of appearance of men for our assistance, either from thence, or any other place. <hi>London</hi> we heard had shut, and guarded their Ports against us; Onely there came a Gentleman out of <hi>Southwark,</hi> as he sayed, who comming to the Quarter-master Generall, assured him, that if the Generall would send any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable party into the Burrough of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> for their assistance, that they would unanimously rise and joyne with us; which he acquainted the Lord Generall with, and returned him this Answer: <hi>That in regard he was a stranger, and not known, he must not expect a party should be adventured upon his bare assertion; but if he would returne to those Gentlemen of the</hi> Burrough <hi>that he said employed him, and that any of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64182:57"/>
men would engage to what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that then they should have what party they should desire. <hi>With which answer he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but never came againe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There came a Gentleman also out of <hi>Essex,</hi> who assured the Generall that the County was up for to joyne with us, (which was more then we expected, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard contrary newes before at our first comming to the Park, or afterwards found trne) and that about <hi>Bow</hi> there were two thousand men in Armes, and more at <hi>Chelmesford:</hi> Upon which intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the Generall (earnestly intending the prosecution of what he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken) cross'd the Water in the Ferry-boat with his Horse, and went over privately into <hi>Essex</hi> himself, not carrying one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant with him, intending onely to goe to <hi>Stratford,</hi> or <hi>Bow,</hi> where his intelligence assured him a Body was gotten together, to assure himself of the truth of it, and to returne; and in case it proved not true, to steer some other designe with the Army: But if he should finde the Country in so good posture as his Intelligencer related, upon his returne to provide Boates, and to conduct the Army safe over to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64182:57"/>
joyne with them. Leaving Sir <hi>William Compton</hi> with the charge of the Army then Major Generall, by whose appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provision of Bread, Beere, and Cheese, was brought into the Parke: Though it proved a great difficulty to procure it in that Towne, not being very well furnished for its owne store.</p>
            <p>But now our party began to be much weakned from what it was two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and no assurance of any aide ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and we absolutely frustrated of our designe, of marching through the City to <hi>Westminster:</hi> Our Condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to seeme something desperate, not knowing what to trust to, besides Gods providence: For we were not able to fight with any hopes of victory, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, if they had followed us, although so great a resolution was still amongst us, that had an Army double the Enemies Engaged us, it would have proved some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a difficulty to have vanquisht us.</p>
            <p>Now the night being come, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall not returned, according to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; Which he could not doe, for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64182:58"/>
finding no party stirring at <hi>Bow,</hi> or <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he made no stay till he came to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> because he would assure to himselfe a certainty of the condition of that County ere he returned, which would be the next morning. There being no possibility of procuring Boats for the transporting such a number of men over the River in the night, which was the next hopes we had left, some timerous Spirits began to steale away, which put such a distraction amongst the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as every man was almost in an amazed confusion. To advance which disorder, one Riding into the Park in the darke of the night, told the Soldiers, that they were in very great danger, and that their Officers wisht them to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; no man regarding what he was, nor demanding his reason; which so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused the Soldiers that heard it, and so aggravated the distraction (although no Enemy were neere) then many began to shift for themselves, and procuring the Ferry boat wafted over to the Isle of <hi>Dogge</hi> as they thought for their absolute security. Some also endeavouring it, and being got into, were againe forced back
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64182:58"/>
by other Soldiers, who exclaiming upon them for running away, threatned to fire at them if they should offer to stirre off the shore with their boat.</p>
            <p>Thus did this hopefully well-ordered businesse suddainly suffer under the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant humour of fortune, to the greatest change that ever was. But all men are naturally subject to change, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be the more cautious in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and resolute in change; for too much security in the one precipitates to the other, and too much dejection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenesse in the other hurles into despaite; to destruction.</p>
            <p>At last this causlesse, and unlook'd for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction begat in some a pannick fear, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a mad fury; so that every man began to shift for himselfe, and hunt out for his owne security, being doubtfull of it almost in every place; but as a thing designed by an extraordinary providentiall power of that All-powerfull Divinity that always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents misfortunes, and so gives life to future; actions, especially such as are ground in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Honour, though in a disorderly rout, throwing themselves into the very mouth of Destruction (who else might have been
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64182:59"/>
secure enough, had they remained till the Generalls returne where he left them) the greatest part of the Foot, and some few of the Horse at severall places transported themselves over the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> no man knowing what would be the event of their rashnesse, nor able almost to give a reason for what they did in it, or if any, but a supposititious one, though it proved lucky enough: For had we remain'd there till the Generalls return, according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he found the <hi>Essexians</hi> in, he would hardly, in reason, have laid the scean of his designe that way; by which means we had likely, not only have lost that service which afterwards hapned, but have fallen in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and in much lesse Honour.</p>
            <p>But this rashnesse had been ill enough too, had not the great and All-seeing Soul of Nature inlivened our then almost dead fortunes by a miraculous guidance through that gulf of mischief we were then plunged into, and as before strangely, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly brought us together, so now as providentiall conducted us through a misery as great, and else, unevitably ruinous. For having thus confusedly, as it were, throwne our selves over to the other side of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64182:59"/>
               <hi>Thames</hi> for our further safety, (in that fear where indeed no danger was) we had no sooner landed, but supposing our selves to have been in <hi>Essex,</hi> where then our only hopes had fixt their Anchors; but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly understood that we were in <hi>Midlesex,</hi> under the Hamlets of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and posting to absolute ruine; like that unfortunate vessell, that seeking to avoid the fatall Rock of <hi>Scylla,</hi> plung'd her self into the more desperate gulph of <hi>Charibdis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here (by the appointment of the House) lay a Regiment of Hamletteers of the <hi>Tower</hi> drawne up to their Armes in severall Guards, ready to receive, and cut us off at our Landing, which might easily enough have been performed, considering the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order we were then in; every man March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his owne phancy, and comming up from the River sides at severall places and wayes: Yet all, at it were by a strange sympathy, steering one and the same course.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>Will: Compton</hi> (a man truly Noble, and more compleat in Gallantry, Virtue and Honour, than yeers) having first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this plotted mischief, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ruine we were running blind-fold
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64182:60"/>
into: As supposing it the best course in that condition, treated with them for the whole party before he would permit any man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to March in amongst them. By which means conditions were drawn, and Signed between him, and the Officers in Chief of the Regiment: Which were, that all our Foot should, upon laying downe their Armes, depart to their own homes, or where they pleased quietly, without any violence, or molestation offered to them. And all Gentlemen, and Officers, with their Horses, and Armes, to March where they pleased also without any disturbance. But those conditions were soon as almost broke, as made; for, before the foot came up, some Gentlemen marching through their Guards, had their Horses and Armes both taken from them by the Major of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by whom the Articles on their party were Signed.</p>
            <p>Then the Foot, and a greater number of Gentlemen, by their easie March comming up together; and understanding what was done, and how unlikely they were to keep Articles when they should lie unarmed at their mercy, that had so unworthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and so soone broke them, Marching
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64182:60"/>
through two or three Guards, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to passe any by-way, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the easie March the Gentlemen made, the Foot came closer up; so that they hop'd the better to avoid abuses of those who began already to scoffe and fleere at us.</p>
            <p>And considering what a condition an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auspicious fate had reduced us to, and how these Gallants had broken conditions; we began to think of some other way then so lamely disband, and submit our selves by such worthlesse Boores, (who understood not so much Honour (I except the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of them) as to know what was meant by drawing, and signing Articles of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and so began to sift out the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the private Souldiers, who we soone found so resolute as to expresse themselves rather desirous to die there, in the bed of Honour, than to survive such an infamous misfortune, and live slaves all the dayes of their lives after.</p>
            <p>This bold resolution proved now the happy guide to a better Fate; and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to make a second dispute for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Charge through them. And being now in the midst of them, every man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64182:61"/>
provided himselfe accordingly, the Foot all lighting their Matches, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men drawing their Pistols, began to alter the constitution of our fleering Hamletteers, who left their vanity of jeering, and so we marched on from gaurd, to gaurd, through the midst of them, as moving to the place of disbanding, where we expected an opposition, and as much resolv'd to force through it; but that proved the last and utmost guard just at <hi>Bow</hi> towne.</p>
            <p>But now they beholding us marching in this resolute manner, and still moulding our selves into better order, were absolutely dasht from a thought of opposition; so we marched on without the least affront till we came to <hi>Bow-bridge,</hi> where we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed was the place for our disbanding: At the other end of which bridge was a turne-pike strongly guarded with Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, and having entred upon the bridge, we made a stand to parly with them; but after a very short discourse being asked whether they were Friends, or Foes, we were answered from them, Friends; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we replyed, if you are Friends let your turne-pike be opened; so they opened their turne-pike, and with a very great shout let
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64182:61"/>
us in. And now we were in <hi>Essex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we marched cleere through these Hamletteeres, and carryed away the Major Prisoner, and another Officer; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon their Parolls, they were suffered to goe to <hi>London,</hi> but never returned againe according to their Engagements, by which also you may guesse how much Honour they had in them; so we marched on still till we came to <hi>Stratford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we met with the Generall againe, returning backe to us, expecting to have found us in the same posture he left us in the Parke at <hi>Greenwich:</hi> But understanding the carriage of the businesse, and what had fallen out, was much troubled at it, and knowing the long and tedious marches they had made, and the precedent nights actions, could not permit them any repose; nor that they had received any refreshment for two nights, and that the third day. Immediately gave command for the drawing them up into order, and by planting on the green, to procure such refreshment as the place would afford for the present, ere we marched any further.</p>
            <p>And here was a providence in all this unhappinesse, had we received the least
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64182:62"/>
affront or opposition by these Hamletteers, or by any obstruction been hindred never so little time, we had beene absolutely cut off; or had we been disbanded, we had beene as sodainly ruined; for we had no sooner marched over the bridge, and scarce drawne up, but we received a very strong Alarum by a Party of Col. <hi>Whalies</hi> horse; Who, as it was conceived, came thither pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely upon the Intelligence that we were to disband, to make a prey of us when we were naked; and by surprising us, make what spoile they pleased with the private Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and take all the Gentlemen Prisoners; but by Gods assisting providence that was prevented; and now they fell on thinking to have beat us off from our guards by their sight onely, so they marched on a full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer (having laid an ambuscade of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goones to secure their retreate) as if they would have destroyed us in a minute, which indeed had been facile enough had we been as tame as they supposed we had beene, and had not the Gentlemen bestirred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves couragiously; But now we were awakned againe by this Alarum, and roused from the drowsie spirit that possest every man almost, if he but sat downe, or still on
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64182:62"/>
Horseback; and drawing out a Party of Foot to strengthen the Guard, rallyed a Party of Horse to a number of thirty, and marching forth the turne-pike, gave them such a home charge, that so started them, as it put them to such a perfect rout in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and kill'd and wounded many of them; which succesful action gave life to our defatigated spirits, and encouraged our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty so, that they followed the pursuit as far as <hi>Milend-greene;</hi> but by that meanes fell into their ambuscade, who fired upon them from the hedges, so they were forced to make as much speed in retreating, though none pursued. In which service only one Gentleman, a <hi>Grecian,</hi> being shot by the Dragooners was left behind about the Green, and in the Charge Cap. <hi>John Lynne</hi> cut over the Chin, and over the Brest, which was all the hurt we sustained in it. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our pursuit continued no further, yet the Enemy kept on their flight in that disorder, no body following them, till they came to <hi>White. Chappell;</hi> which, as I was Informed, gave an Alarum to the whole City, as farre as <hi>Temple-barre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Hamletteeres began againe to oppose us, but were as soone forc't to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64182:63"/>
take Sanctuary in <hi>Bow</hi> Church, where we surrounded them with a Party of Horse and Foote, and put them to treate with us for a quiet returning home to their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, engaging themselves never to oppose us againe. Thus was there a convertible change of various fortune in two opposite Parties, in lesse then two houres space.</p>
            <p>After this our Party again retired within the Turn-pike; and strong Guards comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on all Passes and Fords about the River, and on all High-waies and Avenewes, for hindring the Enemy from making Incursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon us, who were againe calling and drawing up a strong Guard at <hi>Milend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greene,</hi> both of Horse and Dragoones.</p>
            <p>But after all this, our Party resting a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle began to take heart againe, as thinking themselves secure from any opposition or Inconveniencie, being amongst our professed Friends; When our condition gave ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reverse, and was like to change for the worse, then ever before: For after he had run through so many difficulties, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with so tedious marches, our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ready almost to fall downe in the Street for want of foode to sustaine them: we were like to fall into another encounter
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64182:63"/>
with adverse fortune. The Generall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his great age, which might easily have dis-inabled him from such toyle, yet as if he had beene absolutely Indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, or else miraculously nourisht, (not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving almost any rest or sleepe, for the space of foure daies, and three nights, and yet not seeming to want any) posted imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately away againe to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> where the Gentry of the Country were met; giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order for the Quartering that shattered Army in <hi>Stratford</hi> till further orders from him.</p>
            <p>But when Quarter-master Generall <hi>Carter</hi> had sent for the Constable, and given him Orders accordingly: The Constable seeming to goe about in obedience to his Warrant (whilst by some other Gentlemen he was civilly, and honourably treated as a stranger) makes no long stay ere he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe, accompanied with three or four burly Gentlemen, (as I conceive Justices of Peace of that part of the Country) who making it their businesse, began to question the Quarter-master Generall of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Quartering an Army in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, intimating that they were all quiet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and at peace amongst themselves, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64182:64"/>
with the Parliament; and that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had granted them what they desired, and had sent them an Act of Indempnity: But we bringing an Army into their County, should draw down the Parliaments Army upon them, and make it a Seat of Warre; and they could not any way condescend that we should fix a Quarter there, it being no way for their safety, but like to prove the readiest way to their destruction.</p>
            <p>Cheerfull expressions to men that had run through so many hazards, and confused difficulties. Having let our own Country to the Cruelty of a most barbarous and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse Enemy, to come as by an abolute as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated engagement to their assistance; whereby we hoped to be strong enough to break the bonds, and tear off the shackles from our most inhumanly imprisoned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and unnaturally enslaved Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and now no sooner entred the Confines of their County (from whence so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny publick Declarations of their Loyall and sincere Intentions had flowne abroad throughout the Kingdom) and so late check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Insolence of the proud Enemy, and beaten them off from forcing a violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion upon it, and to have such an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64182:64"/>
welcome, was too harsh, and severe, and might have proved very mischievous, if resented by the inferiour sort of the Army, whose fury knowes little, or no more, when enflamed with so just a discontent.</p>
            <p>But the Quarter-master Generall retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them this Answer in short: <hi>That for the power by which he Quartered that Army, it was by Commission from the Generall, and that he quartered them in that place by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Command also from him:</hi> But for our comming into that Country, it concerned him not to dispute it; neither could he give any other account then the Engagement between both Counties, and the Generall, the Earl of <hi>Norwich:</hi> But if they should desire any further satisfaction, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, they must receive it from the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall himselfe.</p>
            <p>But the Generall being gone to <hi>Chelms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Sir <hi>Will: Compton</hi> being Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, hearing of this dispute, came also to them, and gave the like satisfaction, but would not long dispute the businesse with them, knowing nothing at all of them, nor by what Authority they were empowred to make those interrogatories.</p>
            <p>And now our Blouds being hardly coole,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64182:65"/>
since the last Affront, when heated again by this new, and the consideration of the sad successe of our so just, and honourable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, almost boyling to fury, resolved to Quarter there till we should againe receive Orders from the Generall; and then (in case the businesse of the Country should prove so, contrary to our hopes, and the expectations of the whole Kingdome, as to answer the expressions of those men of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall</hi>) to March on, forcing our way through all obstructions, till we should find a party to joyne with, or be destroyed in the Field; that we might thereby win an Honourable Liberty, or Tombe.</p>
            <p>Here we Quartered till Wednesday in the afternoon, it being Sunday morning when we came thither, still keeping the Enemy in some play, who lay with their Guards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a mile of us, and their Scouts still pekiering with us at <hi>Bow</hi> Townes end. All which time the Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi> continued at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> agitating the businesse with the Gentlemen of the County; and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what it would turne there, who had not long before put forth this declaratory Engagement.

            <p>But notwithstanding this Engagement, they were yet backward enough in prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing to the purpose, in answer to their Petition, or Association here. When his Excellency came, he found the greatest part of the Gentry of the County met; but all business so dis-joyn'd, and so strangely confused, as there seemed almost an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any good to proceed from that so high Engagement, and mountainous Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And our party consequently left (as inconsiderable) to be cut in pieces by a most cruell Enemy, who had already possessed themselves of our whole Country; ruin'd our Friends, made lavish havock of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states: and having proclaimed us Traytors for comming thither for their assistance, would prove as undoubtedly prodigall of our lives, if ever we should fall under their power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64182:66"/>
The distraction indeed was so great, that the Gentlemen, and Commoners, who came there with reall intention to prosecute their Petition, and Engagement, were likely to have been dispersed in lesse time then they were in coming together; Capt. <hi>Lin</hi> of that Country had once before raised a thousand men, which were immediately dispers'd. An order of Indempnity being read in the head of them by Colonel <hi>Farre,</hi> which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the County so pressed to them, that they went all quietly home. And now were as active in their Indeavours for the ruine of the maine interest of that Designe; as indeed it concern'd them enough, for they knew the prosperity of Loyalty is destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rebellion: I leave them to make the Application.</p>
            <p>They were so active in their <hi>Machivilian</hi> Stratagems for countermining all policy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as that <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> being there urgently tending upon the designe, and many other Gentlemen with carefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the advancement of the King, and Countries Liberty, (it being the sole and generall end, both they and we really intended, and the sole reward of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we all aimed at; and consequently prosecuted

secuted all circumstantiall opportunities which we conceived conducing to it, that at last, though by the hazard of a Warre, we might generally attaine to the happy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of an honourable and lasting Peace) thought it their best course in that distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to depart privately forth the Town, lest some unexpected inconveniency might take hold on their persons, if once it had over-whelmed the generall interest, as now they began to fear would be, absolutely dispairing of any good at all.</p>
            <p>But some of the Country Gentlemen then got together in the Town, and by chance meeting them, desired Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> that he would not goe away so, but let the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee doe what they would, they were sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible enough how they had ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done them, and they would be abused no longer by them; but if he would be pleased to draw them out into the Field, and stay with them, they would one and all engage with him, and live and die in that Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the intention of their meeting together, having resolved not to returne till they had performed something.</p>
            <p>This suddaine change in a little time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very violent, as it is commonly scene in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64182:67"/>
all things; so they immediately drew into the Field, and seiz'd on the Committee, and were so furiously incenst against them, that some of them would have kill'd them immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had not some Gentlemen rescued them, &amp; pacified the others fury, and afterwards pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Guard over them; for now they were resolved, that since they had actively enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themselves, they would be no more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in their prosecution by those grand Opposers; who they well understood would be active enough in their endeavours, for the destruction of that designe, (if at liberty) and the ruin of the Actors in it, being right-beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Committee-men of the Parliaments own bringing up, as appeared afterwards by Sir <hi>Tho: Honywood,</hi> who being at liberty, and at his own house at <hi>Coxwell,</hi> alwayes an Enemy to the King and Kingdome, made himselfe appear so really now, by raising both Horse and Foot, as many, as by his power he could draw together, either for love, or fear, and made his house a Garrison to oppose the County (as much in him lay) in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in that designe; But his party pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so inconsiderable then, as it could doe but little injury.</p>
            <p>The businesse comming to this height,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64182:68"/>
his Excellence the Lord <hi>Norwich</hi> sent his orders to Sir <hi>William Compton,</hi> to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards <hi>Chelmsford;</hi> so we marched away from <hi>Stratford</hi> with our whole Party, which by this time was well recruited by many of our men that came up, and divers Prentices from <hi>London,</hi> who came daily in and listed themselves; And about Wensday night we met the Generall at <hi>Rumford,</hi> but the Enemy marching after us, so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed our march by Alaruming us in the Reare, that the whole Body could not get up till the next morning; though the Enemy durst not adventure in all the march to fall on upon the Reare guard.</p>
            <p>The next day being the eight of <hi>June,</hi> we marched on towards <hi>Burntwood,</hi> whither Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> was advanced with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of Horse, and Foot, to joyne with us: And having Intelligence, how the Enemy followed us with Alarums in our Reare, commanded forth all the Horse that were then in the Towne to assist us; so we marched up, and quartered that night at <hi>Brentwood;</hi> and the next day being the ninth, we marched on to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> where the Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> the Lord <hi>Loughborow</hi> and divers Gentlemen of quality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64182:68"/>
other Counties, came in to joyn also with us; which gave a great encouragement to our Army. There came in a Party also of Gentlemen consisting of about fifty, who entering their combination in <hi>London</hi> made their Rendevouze at <hi>Hideparke</hi> corner, and marching all night, the night before inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to beate up a quarter of the Enemies at <hi>Epping</hi> (being in their way) But the Party was drawne out by chance hard by the Towne, upon some other designe, so they were disappointed of their Strategem; but though they found them ready drawne up in order, yet unexpecting any affront (not thinking of any Enemy) they marched up, and being well Horst charged through them, and the next day came up to us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lost only one Man, and one Horse; but the Horse being a gallant one and taken by a Country-man, was recovered againe, the Gentleman that lost him comming off af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, went out with a Party and fetcht that man in, and so regained him.</p>
            <p>That afternoone both Parties of <hi>Kentish,</hi> and <hi>Essex,</hi> were drawne out to a Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouze in <hi>Newhall</hi> Parke neere the Towne, belonging to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> which Generall meeting gave much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64182:69"/>
to both Parties. Where the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> joyning in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation the Gentlemen of both Counties also, that by a unity in the engagement, as well as the Interest, there might be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes of prosperous successe.</p>
            <p>At which councell it was once a generall result to have marched away Immediately, and fallen upon the Party of Sir <hi>Tho: Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> at <hi>Coxwell;</hi> but upon a more serious deliberation otherwise resolved on, and orders given out for the quartering in the Towne that night; But this Party of <hi>Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> disincouraged the Country that they began now to be very slack in their apear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to joyne, in relation to what they were before; not only by reason of Sir <hi>Thomas Honywoods</hi> activenesse, but because of the Enemies entring also into the Country with their whole Body.</p>
            <p>Saturday the tenth we marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Brantree,</hi> but tooke <hi>Leeds</hi> house in our march, belonging to the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> where we were like to have beene op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by some people who were purposely placed there, and upon the Quartermaster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generalls comming thither to secure it from the violence of the Soldiers, refused to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64182:69"/>
open their gates, being about twelve or more men with Fire-armes and two Drakes, saying that they were placed there for the securing that house, and they would rather die, then deliver it up to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered tamely. But being afterwards by some parley Informed that the Generall himself was coming, and that the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master Generall was commanded before to secure them from Injury; they gave him entrance with some other Gentlemen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it was but little boote for them to dispute with an Army: about noone the Generall and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> came, and haviug first dined there, ceised on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, where they found a good Magazine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of Armes and Ammunition of all sorts; so we carried from thence the two brasse field peeces, and about two or three hundred Muskets, and as many pikes, with about 60. great Sadles, and body Armes proportionable to them, and some Pistols and Carbines; and a good proportion of Match and Ball, with divers other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and furniture of Warre; But many of the Sadles we left behinde for want of carriages for them. Here we Rendevouzed all the afternoone, till towards night in the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64182:70"/>
Parke beyond the house; the Enemy of Rendevouzing also with a Party of theirs very neer the other side, and that night in the Parke; but adventured not to appeare all that day in sight of our Army. There was a Party of Horse also came in to us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the march, (which along time we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed an Enemy) from <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> and <hi>Bedfordshire</hi> consisting of about sixe score. From thence we marched forwards, and quartered that night at <hi>Braintree.</hi> Where the next day being Sunday, both Parties were drawne into the field in the forenoone to Rendevouze: And after prayers all the Gentlemen that were in the Army, were drawne into troopes, under the command of the Lord <hi>Norwich,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Loughborow,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas;</hi> that they might not only know to dispose of themselves upon any occasion of Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; but being in order it would be a great conveniencie, for disposing them into quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon every remove.</p>
            <p>About nine of the clock at night we marched from thence; and continued our march all that night, making onely one halt about daybreake, till the next day about fower of the clock in the afternoone; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64182:70"/>
which time we drew neere <hi>Colchester,</hi> whither at a Councell the night before, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> his desire, and beliefe of recruiting very much there, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to march, but not to stay above one night or two at the most, and therefore moved in the night to amuse the Enemy that they might not to sodainly follow us; And being within five or six miles of the Towne, a Party was sent before towards it, for Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> had received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that they would not receive him in Armes; then himself, with some other Gentlemen, marched onwards before the Army, after that party was marched away: But ere the Quarter-master Generall left them to goe to the Town, came intelligence from the Party, that the Towne stood upon their Guard, and were so far from giving entrance to our party, as that they opposed them, and were too strong for them: At which newes Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Gentlemen with him, set Spur to their Horses, and hasted on with a full speed till they came within sight of the Towne, and comming neere, they found that they had shut their Gates, and drawn out about sixty Horse in a very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall Troop, well Arm'd and Accoutred;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64182:71"/>
some of their Scouts being without the Turn-pike by the Almes Houses, then Sir <hi>Charles</hi> made a stop to send back a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Army to hasten their March; but some four or five Gentlemen keeping on their speed, drew their Swords onely, and Charged up to them, and forc'd them within their Turn-pike; so they retreated on the Head gate, where their whole Troop was drawne up in order; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen retreated againe towards the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pike, but some of them, as they retreated, fell in amongst the Gentlemen, yet never fired a Pistoll till they came out of the Turn-pike againe, then one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men turning quick about shot one of them, and he fell from his Horse. But when they perceived the Body of the Army comming, and that Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> had drawn up two or three Troopes of Horse very neer them, they sent out to treat with him; and upon his Engagement that the Town should not be plundred, nor any injury offered them for what they had done, they submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves, and engaged to deliver up their Horse, and Armes, with the Towne; so the Gates were opened, and the Army quartered that night in the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:64182:71"/>
The next day being Tuesday, <hi>June</hi> 13. about noone we received a very strong A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum, and that the Enemy was advanced within a mile of the Town; and indeed by that time we could provide parties to send forth, their Forlornes were engaged with our Out-guards in the Suburbs; which Guardes were immediately doubled, and it was not long ere we were as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, as they to assault us: Our men being drawne up to their Colours, fresh parties were sent out to assist the Guards, both of Horse and Foot; and the Enemy came on as strongly on all parts of that side the Town next <hi>Lexden,</hi> and fir'd up to the very Hedges and Guards of our Foot, but were as furiously opposed, till at the last some of the Guardes wanting Ammunition to maintain the heat of the Service, about the Almes houses, and the house called <hi>Grimstones</hi> house, were over-powred with the number of men that threw in their Shot like haile upon them, and so forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and gave the Enemy the Liberty of all that ground. Which retreat gave them also advantage of falling upon our other Guards neer <hi>Sheere-gate;</hi> whereupon the Out-guards were ordered to retreat within the town; it being the best policy to take the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64182:72"/>
greatest advantage in opposing an Enemy, were an Army double the Enemies strength: But ere this retreate could be made; and the Guards drawne within the Gates, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute grew close, and very hot; the Enemy comming on so violently, that it was much difficulty to maintaine any ground against them, yet were they still as resolutely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, so that it was as hard a matter to judge whether shewed more courage, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in assailing, or our Party in defending.</p>
            <p>Now we being forc't to a retreat, although as much out of policy, as danger, gave an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encouragement to the Enemy to prosecute their charge upon us, as thinking themselves more then halfe victors already, and that they should in short time make themselves masters both of the Town and us.</p>
            <p>But this new and scarcely flesht Army of Country men, added fire to the heat of the Service, in such a height, and with so undaunted a resolution, far contrary to the Enemies expectation, although they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an experimentall knowledge of them at <hi>Maidestone,</hi> that many of them could not digest it, but left their bodies in the Streets, and Hedges, as Infallible witnesses of what was done; yauning out their Soules to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their arreares, in another world,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64182:72"/>
for their so Religious rebellion in this.</p>
            <p>Many of their dead bodies they threw into wells, some they buried in ditches, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they carried off; yet left so many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, upon the place, that by some relations we received from the Country, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Army the next day, and the account we had of many of their Soldiers, that came voluntarily in to us; we could not believe that they lost lesse then seven hundred men; Col. <hi>Needham</hi> and diverse others of their prime Officers being also kild, besides many which were wounded, and above one hundred and thirty Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, taken and brought into the Towne; for having retired within the walls, our shot fell so thick in amongst them, they could not long abide it; but after a seven or eight howers fight were so gauld, that they were forc't to a dishonourable retreate, leaving behind them one brasse peice of Ordnance (which they brought to force the gate) twelve of their traine Horses being shot within twenty yards space of ground, and about five hundred Armes, which the next morning were brought into the Towne. Their retreat was in such distraction, that had we sallyed out with a fresh party upon them, as was once intended, we had cut their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64182:73"/>
whole Army off, or the greatest part, as many of their own acknowledged. I must confesse I never yet saw any men fight with a more gallant resolution, and courage, then those men did, although raw Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, as they could not but do indeed, having so rare presidents, in so honourable personages, as those Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under whose conduct they were brought thither, and under whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they then fought, who ceased not themselves to act the duty of the meanest and most inferiour Officers, or run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the privatest Souldier; but took Pikes in their hands, when their Horses were not of immediate service, as well for the maintenance of their ground, as to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the more inferiour sort lest by unusuall heat of the service they might grow slow, and dull in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty to the utmost: The Lord <hi>Capell</hi> charging at Head-gate (where the Enemy was most pressing) with a Pike, till the Gate could be shut, which at the last was but pind with his Cane. The Enemy still gallantly enough too, (to give them their due) endeavouring to force their entrance in upon us, adventured on so farre as to fire under the Gate, and oft times to throw stones over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:64182:73"/>
In this service we lost Sir <hi>William Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and Col. <hi>Cooke,</hi> men of incomparable and unblemisht honor, both receiving mortall shots upon the first charge in the suburbs, and one Lieftenant, and about thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty private souldiers, though many more were wounded</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Layton,</hi> though not interested in any immediate command in the Army, yet of so high and noble a soul, as could not admit of a private ingagement, in so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a designe, took the charge of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and endeavouring to make his retreat, when he perceived the enemy possest of so much of our ground as to get between him and home, was unfortunately shot in the foot; so that ere he could recover the gate, it was shut, and the enemy intermixt with his party; so that he could by no means es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape being taken; but by chance, by a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that had formerly served four year un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, in the Kings service, and in his own Company; who upon the service, knowing him, came to him, and would have carried him off, but was forc'd by reason of the shot that came so thick in upon them from the town, to run away and leave him; but though he were very neer, yet had lost so

much blood, and was grown so stiff, he could not shift for himself: After a while, the souldier coming again, carried him off, and rescued him from the most inhumane usage of other souldiers; which souldier after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proved very officious also to him, and upon the receipt of the next pay to conduct him home, left the Army upon the unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian demeanours he observed amongst them.</p>
            <p>Lievtenant Colonell <hi>George Rawlins,</hi> commanding another out-guard on that part of the town, was also surprised ere he could make his retreat, and about forty foot souldiers; so that in all were taken of ours about fourscore prisoners; But many of them that were taken, upon their distracted retreat got from them again, and came safe into the town.</p>
            <p>But night coming on, and it proving ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dark, was an oportunity for them to steal a retreat; but ere they drew off, set fire on some houses neer to Head gate; hoping ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the wind would so force the fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that it should burn the whole town; but the diligence of the souldiers proved as great in defending it from fire, as before from plunder and the sword, guarding it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64182:74"/>
from an enemy mercilesse in the one, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable in the other, as the suburbs in the town can well witnesse; where although poor people were so little indamaging them, or assisting us, that they rather seemed to oppose us, not only in our coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in all we did there; yet the next morning we found scarce one house un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plundered, from the one end to the other, and many poor men dead in their houses, and women and children fled.</p>
            <p>Amongst the rest my self by chance recevied this account the next morning by break of day: Just over against the Almes-houses lived a poor Weaver, where I chanc'd to ride by, and finding a poor woman very heavily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> her self, and in so lamentable a nature, could not but demand the cause of so much grief; whereupon she answered me, that the last night, some of the souldiers that fought against the town came violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into her house, and took what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and that they were no sooner gone, but more came in, and not finding any thing in the house left that pleased them, came to her husband in the loom at work, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded money of him, who told them, that he had been worth but a little before in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64182:75"/>
house, and what he had, the souldiers that came before them had taken from him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only some small sum he had in his purse, which he would willingly give them if they would be fatisfied with it; But it not answering their expectations, no more would they answer his desires, but told him he was a Cavalier Rogue, and had more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which they would have or kill him; both which he denying, one of them shot him through the body, so that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately died; at which noise his son coming in, they fell to cutting of him, and had so cruelly wounded him, that he lay more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to die then live.</p>
            <p>Now having thus made their retreat in the night, the next morning they drew back to Lexden, a village about a mile from the town, where they fell immediatly to work, and cast up a Fort just upon the high-way to secure the head-quarters, and barricado's crosse all the high-way; here they lay about two dayes still; then approaching neerer, in the night cast up another Fort in that road towards the town, where they placed a guard; and the next night they entred ground upon the hill called the Warren, and placed a strong guard there the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64182:75"/>
and so every night broke up fresh ground in severall places, which they thought most advantagious, running their line by degrees from one Redoubt and Fort to another.</p>
            <p>This gave us just occasion to believe that they intended to plant themselves before us for a longer continuance then before we had imagined, and to block us up; by which we were invited to consider of our own fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture security, which then consisted in the greatest care of victualling and fortifying; the only two things to be first thought on in such a case; especially in a town so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the one and the other. A place, I suppose, as little ever supposed, as before by us intended, for what it was afterward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to; no man, I think, that had survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with the judicious eye of an experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced souldier, could be so weak as to suppose it a place fitting to be mantled, or maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a garrison; it was our intentions only to take it as a present quarter for a night or two.</p>
            <p>But this ingagement having forc'd us to it, enlivened every man with an active and cheerfull diligence to forward an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all requisites.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:64182:76"/>
To march away now we could not, for we had no way to march, but that we must within a day fall into a champian country, where the enemy being so very strong (as we were weak) in horse, would have cut us off at an instant; our Foot being no such experienced souldiers as to maintain a charge of themselves, both against Horse, and Foot, where there were no hedges to guard and shelter them from Horse; though some have judged otherwise of the design, and the conduct of it.</p>
            <p>Now by this incomparable diligence on all parties (no man at the first knowing where to find provision of any sort, more then belonged to every private family for ordinary sustenance) we found in a short time, in severall places of the town, and a place called the Heyth adjacent, many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate stores of corn, and wine of all sorts, with much salt, and some fish, and a good quantity of powder, the want whereof would suddenly have thrown us into abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ruine, having very much exhausted our magazine by the last dayes businesse.</p>
            <p>It is said, that he that will picture War, must first begin with the belly: so we (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that policy) having many bellies
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64182:76"/>
to feed; and not knowing how long it should please God to continue us there, were the more inquisitive after provision; by which means at the Hieve (for so it is more vulgarly called) we found a greater assistance then indeed we could have hoped for, which was conveyed into the town as conveniently, as time would permit, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy being so favourable as never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavounto cut us off from that place, till we had almost dreyned the honey from the comb: which they might easily have done, had they ever enterprised it. A providence almost as great as that of the Israelites in the Wildernesse: For, it is reported, that in the memory of man there never was known such plenty of all things in that place, as accidentally then.</p>
            <p>Whilest we were thus active for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all dangers that might happen, by strengthening the walls of the town, and fortifying where no wall was, by casting up rampires and counterfcarfs, as a very great part of the town required, the Enemy was as busie without, in running their trenches, making their approaches, and casting up Forts and Batteries against us, still earthing themselves, and we as diligent and laborious
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64182:77"/>
within, as in truth not without much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity on our part, the Towne being in all places very weak, neither had it any more then one Flanker about it, and that very bad too, which was called the Old-Fort.</p>
            <p>Now if it shall be objected, why in this time, not being certain of any timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, we did not draw out and fight with them, as it hath been often urged: They that will judge discreetly of our condition, will easily be satisfied of it: had we had no hopes at all of relief, which we then had, both from the Scots, and divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at the same time in action; besides it was conceived the greatest piece of policy, by keeping the enemy in a lingering action, to give a remora to their designes, and so ruine them by delaies; by which meanes especially we should give liberty, and all opportunity to others that intended any action, to work their designes without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and not to run the hazard of an immediate ruine, by giving them battell: for had we fought with them, it must have been upon infinite disadvantages, (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) first in the inequality of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Infantry: And secondly in that we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64182:77"/>
had no considerable party of Cavalrie in respect of theirs, whose greatest strength consisted in horse. And it was not a rash or fond supposition to think that could we hold what we had, till the rest of the Kingdome should rise, we should then do as good service, as in the immediate victory: we supposed we might possibly hold out a moneth, and were resolved on it, though it concluded in our own ruine; yet by that time, if not sooner, we could not but expect (in all probability) a relief.</p>
            <p>By this design also we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to give liberty to the Scots to march <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into the Kingdome, being then as we most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly understood, upon their march, and neer the borders.</p>
            <p>Neither was this all the hopes we che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht by this resolution; but there remained a possibility of a victory over that Army, by delaying to fight with them, till some more fit opportunity should offer it self, or the tediousnesse of the service weaken them by hard duty, constant action, &amp; unseasonable lying in the field, in respect of the weather; &amp; we have many gallant examples in this kind. <hi>Pompey</hi> was well advised for a while when he refused to fight and gave <hi>Caesar</hi> ground:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64182:78"/>
But when by the importunity of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains he adventured the battell at <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> he lost the battell, the freedome of Rome, and by it his own life.</p>
            <p>The Constable of France made frustrate the mighty preparation of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, when he invaded Provence, by wasting the Countrey, and forbearing to fight; so the Duke of Alvaria, by that policy wearied the French King in Naples, and dissolved the boysterous Army of the Prince of Orange in the Low Countries.</p>
            <p>One <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               </gap> I shall insert, to touch more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> upon those hot-spur Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that shall so violently criticize upon that point, and accordingly refer the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by looking into that battell of Pavy, as tragicall as fatall to France, where the King was taken prisoner, and the French frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their main hopes of Italy.</p>
            <p>The day before this overthrow, the King summoned a generall Councell of War, and desired the opinion of his Officers, whether he should give a Field to the enemy or not: Whereat an old Captain began exceedingly to perswade the King to stay, and delay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging till supplies (which were already le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied) should come up and strengthen his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64182:78"/>
Army: desiring him not to throw into haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard unnecessarily, the welfare of France; Urging, that the consultation was not only for the Kings honor, but his safety: At which time there was at the Councel a young hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spur, fitter to begin, then continue a charge, who alleaged, that nothing was more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then that the victory should be gained by fight, &amp;c. taunting the old Captain, It was no marvell though an old man and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sought delayes, whose mind was distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with his usuall fears, and now was seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a passage through his guts: The old man could not indure this his scurrility, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, Seeing the King will have us fight, I will die to morrow an honorable death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face; when thou, forgetfull of thy brags, and rashnesse, shalt by a base flight forsake the field: Which Prophesie in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects was fulfilled, the field desperately lost, and the King taken prisoner. Many more examples in this nature I could insert, but I think it as unnecessary, as tedious.</p>
            <p>Now although we gave them not a field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battel, yet suffered them not to lie idle from fighting constantly almost in one place or other, both night and day. Neither were they so weak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> some suppose, after our shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

them, but that they were in their foot still above, or equall our number before the Suffolk Foot joyned with them, who lay upon the bridges of the river so strong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enemy drew them over, that we could not have forced our passage, in case we had attempted it, but that we had been fallen on by the enemy in the rear, and been engaged both waies, to the hazard of an immediate destruction of our whole Army.</p>
            <p>About the twentieth day of the moneth, divers gentlemen were sent forth privately with Commissions to raise men in Norfolk, Suffolk, &amp; Cambridge shire: But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try forces having broken up the bridges, and guarded the passes, and the enemy taken the Fort called Mersey Fort, that commanded the passage into the Island, there was no passage left open for them, so they were forc't to return again, which they did secure, although through the enemies quarters, not a man being taken.</p>
            <p>The next night a party of horse, and foot was commanded forth into the hundred of Tendring, for the bringing in of provision, which returned the day following safe, with about one hundred sheep, and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64182:80"/>
Then was another party commanded forth in the night, which marching out at the North-gate, forced through their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in the morning returned safe, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing not above two men, for which losse they gained livelihood for many more; for they brought in with them about fifty oxen, and cowes, besides sheep, and some corn and other provisions, and might have brought more: But Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> being tender of his Countrey, would not permit them to drive from any, but those they should know to be actuall enemies; which proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a very great inconveniency, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Towne, for after that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain the like opportunity, the enemy drawing immediately down neerer upon us, came within lesse compasse, and begirt us more straight; for they were indeed much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with anger amongst themselves, that they should fuffer us to march through their quarters upon a sally, and return again safe. Yet we secured the Heith, as a finall refuge for provision, from whence we conveyed daily, such provisions as it would afford, keeping a constant guard there; which the enemy endeavoured not to hinder us of, till we had left very little there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:64182:80"/>
July 5. The Councell of Warre published a Proclamation, for the calling in all such townes-men, as would serve upon the line for the security of the Town, to list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the service under severall Captains and Officers, being deputed by Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> to command them, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to bring in their arms to be delivered up into the Magazine; and that none, who should refuse to list themselves, should keep any arms in their houses, upon pain of death, and the forfeiture of their goods, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and use of the Town.</p>
            <p>About this time the enemy incroach't so neer upon us with their approaches, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our daily sallies, and skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes with them on all parts, as that they fell down into East-street, and seized on the Mill on the river, and placed a strong guard there; which guard, (out of hopes to have fired all that part of the street hetwixt them and the Town, because many of our men both quartered and guarded there also) set fire to a Tanners house and barn, with all the goods, leather and corn in it; the house being the next house to the inner-side over against them, and bringing downe two Drakes began to be something busie, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64182:81"/>
troublesome to our guards; whereupon at the next Councell of War upon the dispute, a result was made for a grand sally on that part of the Town, which was accordingly performed, and Sir <hi>Charls Lucas</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in chief, marched in the head of the horse, and Sir <hi>George Lisle</hi> commanded the foot; the whole party consisted of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot, and two hundred horse, out of which a forlorn party being drawn out, they first marched down towards the river, where the enemies guard was on both sides the street, and a Barricado crosse, from whence with their case shot from their Drakes, and small shot from the Barricadoe and guard-houses, they play'd very thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, having no other passage over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> river then a foot bridge, the end wherof reach'd within five foot of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies barricado. But as if it had been but a sporting skirmish amongst tame souldiers at a generall muster, they regarded it not; but running on in a single file over the bridge, &amp; some for hast through the river, mounted their barricado, and beat the enemy off in an instant; and having once gained that, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Drakes, and charged on upon other parties that still fired on them in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64182:81"/>
street, and pass'd by the Guard-houses till they had cleered a great part of the street; then surrounding them, charged in upon them, who having neither possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, nor indeed of retreat, or escape, yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Quarter; so they took the Captain, Lieutenant, and Ensigne, and about foure score private Soldiers, with all the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Officers. Many were also kill'd in the adjacent houses, the whole street almost being full of Soldiers. The Drakes they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turned, and one of them they threw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River, but not having Teames ready, could not bring them off. Now the whole party being marched up, and having thus surpriz'd the Guard, they marched on, and made good the Charge till they had cleared the whole Street; which gave so great an Alarum into all their Leager, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rallyed together all the Foot and Horse on that side the River, and marched down the hill from behind the Windmill, on the top of another hill in a very full and orderly Body, onely they left their Colours and Pikes with a reserve behind the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill. But our Party having gained almost the top of the first hill, followed their charge so smartly upon them, that they soon forc'd
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64182:82"/>
them to a disorderly retreat, and quickly made them strive to take their leave of their ground: But the Fields were over-spread with distractedly disperst Soldiers both of Horse and Foot, some from Houses out at Back-doores and windows, and others from Hedges in a great disorder. Our Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby encouraged, prosecured their successe, till they had beat them up beyond the Wind mill, and forc'd Reserve and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and all they had, or could rally, to quit their ground, and so to disperse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they were forc'd to divide their Horse into three Squadrons or Bodies, one Division to keep the Field against ours, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now made a stand to draw into better order; and the other two constantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> up and down, beating their Foot up as they ran away: Which course, had they not taken, their Foot would never have disputed a hedge, (for that was their refuge now) and we had immediately cleared all that part of the Leager.</p>
            <p>But now having gotten a very thick hedge for their shelter, and being thus forced up, began againe to stand: and our Foot out of more heat of courage indeed then mature policy, having engaged thus farre, some of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64182:82"/>
them still ran on, till they gained an old thin hedge, opposite to the Enemy, beyond the Wind-mill, where they still fir'd upon the Enemy, maintaining the opposite hedge, a party of the Enemies Horse still wheeling about in the Field between them; Which party by chance discovered that they had spent all their Ammunition by hearing a Soldier foolishly <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing out for some, and thereupon suddenly clapt spurs to their Horse, and made a full Charge in upon them through that hedge, (as they might easily doe any part of it) who not having Ammunition, nor time to retreat, were most of them kill'd and taken. Till when we had lost very few in all the Charge, though many were wounded in it, as could not otherwise choose in so smart a service: Althrough I confesse the Saints of our times have found out such a way of fighting, as to kill thousands, with the losse of very few <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nites: but tis onely Tongue-charmes that guard their Armies, and not any Providence, that conducts them to such Miracles.</p>
            <p>Now the Body of our Party being upon their Retreat, and perceiving of this, faced about againe, and received their Charge with such an undaunted retort, they forced
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64182:83"/>
them againe to as speedy a Retreat; and so marched easily off into the Towne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>In this action Sir <hi>George Lisle</hi> was once taken Prisoner, but immediately rescued; and in all we lost one Captaine, and one Lieutenant, and about 30, private Soldien which were taken at the broken hedge, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>July</hi> the 28 the Enemy drew downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heith, where we had a guard placed in the Church, but the Officer (Cap. <hi>Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> by name) who then Commanded the guard no sooner saw the Enemy, but delivered up his guard, himselfe, and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, without so much opposition as the firing of one Musquet; Which had he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed he might in a very short time been relieyed and drawn off; though the place could not have beene maintained. But that place proved very little benefit to them for by that time we had scarce left any thing of Provision or Ammunition there, onely this benefit they might receive, they might understand what a neglect they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in permitting us so long to keep it within our Quarters, when with so much ease they might have surprised it from us, for it lay so opportune to them to have fallen on, that had they made an attempt upon it we could not have maintained it without engaging our whole Body, and quitting the Towne; and indeed had they surprised that place in any convenient time, as they might easily enough have done, before we drained it, we could not have kept the Town ten dayes, there lying the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64182:87"/>
greatest part of our Provision, by which we afterward Subsisted.</p>
            <p>The next day having drawne the line ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> his house, they planted to Demy Cannons, against St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Church, from whence they fir'd three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and odd great shot at St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church steeple, but did very little hurt, for with as much speed as could be a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery was raised against them upon the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from whence we had not playd above four shot, but one of their best Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers fell, and about six men more, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theydrew off their Guns from that place, finding it too hot for their continuance.</p>
            <p>Now the cause that made them so envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at that Steeple, was because we alwaies kept a Sentinell there, which discovered their motion both night, and day; besides we had made a platforme in the frame of the Bells, and planted a brasse Sakar there, which flanking their trench did them much Injury.</p>
            <p>The 25. day the Enemy drawing their line neerer the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> his house, under the shelter of an old wall, and some build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, brought up two Demy Cannons, and battering upon the Gate-house (wherein
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64182:87"/>
was a guard of a hundred Musketteers) beat one side of it to the ground, which falling into their worke (that was but a small halfe moone drawne from one side of the great House to the other) anoyed them very much; then fired two or three Granadoes immediately with it, which buried many in the stones and dust, the rest not able to stand the shock; betaking themselves to their Swords, and the but ends of their Muskets, disputed it very hard from one place to another, after they had lost their line, till most of them got away, some out of the Wicket of the gate, and some out of the windowes, and broken places of the house. The Officers also forcing their liberty with the points of their Swords, came all off safe.</p>
            <p>Neither could the Enemy much boast of this surprise, although it were some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them; for they purchased it with the losse of many stout men, and of their oldest Soldiers, who they quickly found by the wall and trench sides, some dead, and others speaking their Enemies valour, in their owne miserable dying grones, Whilest of the whole guard consisting of a hundred men, not above ten were taken Prisoners,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64182:88"/>
and some foure or five kill'd, many I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse were wounded, but came off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

            <p>By this time our Magazeens began to be very empty, all our flesh being spent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next businesse that was concluded on and ordered, was the searching what private stores there were in the towne, but they proved as weake as the other, then the Councel of Warre, (receiving a returne of the searches what the condition of the towne was, for matter of Provision, who had now examined every private Family.) ordered that all the Horse excepting two hundred, should in the night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

At the next Councell of Warre, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the stores were so exhausted, and all the stesh, or very near the matter, spent, it was thought most convenient to keep those horse, which were fitting, for the Souldiers to eat; so they were againe drawn into the Castle yard, with order that not any Officer whatsoever should conceale his Horses, but cause them to be brought into the field, upon the forfeiture of them to immediate slaughter; &amp; the 3d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of every Troop drawn out and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Commissary to be kill'd, and some to be immediately distributed, and the rest powdred; which the Soldiers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly submitted to, and as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fed upon them, rather than deliver themselves to their Enemies, upon any base or dishonourable terms, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of theirs were so common and publique, as that the Enemy hearing of our falling to Horse-flesh, heard also of that resolution of the Souldiery, which did something startle them; for before they hoped for, and expected, our da yly submission to a Treaty for Rendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion.</p>
            <p>Now upon the last search that was

            <p>But let men dispute and censure what they please; The Enemy (having possest themselves of the Lord <hi>Lucas</hi> his house, and the <hi>Hieth</hi>) began to draw their Line more streight about us, and now lay abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely round us, so that we were soddainly begirt within a very little distance; Then they brought their biggest pieces of Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

            <p>The five and twentieth, in the night, the Enemy alarum'd us round the Line, and fell on upon the Guard in the Middle Mill, against <hi>Ryegate,</hi> and getting over the River at a fordable place came in upon them, and beat them off to a retreat into the Town, and set fire of the Mill (Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Rainsborow</hi> commanding in chiefe) but a party of fresh men with Halberts and Sithes (most of them Gentlemen) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I must confesse
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64182:93"/>
that once or twice the top of their House was shot through with great shot from the Leaguer, (I know not what House could be assured free in the Town) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they sent a speciall Message to the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> to let him know what House they lay in, and desired him that he would not shoot that way; they should have gotten an Order of Parliament that the bullets should not have dared to molest them, if he did shoot that way, they might then have fedsecure. Now the Enemy thus proceeding in their siedge in a very formall order, crept still with their approaches neerer and neerer to us; yet many of their men paid dearly for their boldnesse, for though by reason of the scarcity of our Ammunition we could not make very great sallies upon them, nor constantly fire from the line, yet sallies were made almost every day in one part or other, and our shot so warily disposed of, that many of them fell dayly; some of our men they often killed going out to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64182:94"/>
firing at the Enemy whilst the others cut grasse, all the thatch from the Houses, and boughes from the Trees being eat up, but very few else did we lose in all the time of the siedge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>August</hi> the tenth, The Lady <hi>Kath: Scot,</hi> accompanied with some other Ladies, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leave of the L. <hi>Fairfax</hi> that she might have the liberty of going to the L. <hi>Norwich</hi> her Father (the Lady <hi>Norwich</hi> being newly dead) could not procure so much liberty as to goe into the Towne to him, but only to come to the Sally port; and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> neither but accompanied with a guard, that might hear all discourse that should passe between them; there came with them the Quarter-master Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Gravener,</hi> and some other Officers, and were entertained with a collation of Horse-flesh, and a Bottle or two of wine; the best accommodation we could treat them with, which they eat heartily on, and liked.</p>
            <p>And now began Horse-flesh to be as precious to us as the choicest meat before, the Souldiers in generall, and all Officers and Gentlemen from the Lords to the lowest degree or quality, eating nothing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64182:94"/>
else, unlesse Cats and Doggs, which the enemy disgusted very much, expecting a dayly rendition by us, by the assurance whereof, they constantly encouraged their Souldiers on, to the continuance of the hard duty they then underwent, who else would have been hardly kept together being often upon the March, either away into the Country, or else to us into the Town.</p>
            <p>It was so hansome a diet grown by this time amongst the Souldiers to eat such food, that we could harely secure our Horses in the Stables, but every morning one Stable or other was rob'd, and our Horses knock'd o'th head, and sold in the Shambles by the pound; nor was there in a short time a dog left, for it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Souldier to reserve halfe his ammunition Loafe, and in a morning walke the streets, and if he discovered a Dog, to drop a peice of bread, and so drill him on, till within his reach, then with the but end of his musket knock his brains out, and away with him to his quarters; I have known there six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings given for the side of a Dog, and yet but a small one neither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:64182:95"/>
Then the Enemy perceiving they could work nothing upon us by summons, threats, nor force of armes, betook them to petty stratagems, sometimes sending false fires of strange improbable News of great victories over the <hi>Scots,</hi> long before they ever met with them; and Lists of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners taken, never in Arms, and such like Whimsies, hoping thereby to terrifie the Inferiour sort of Souldiers to such a timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous apprehension of their condition, as to force their Officers by their mutinous resolutions, to treat for conditions, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leave them in the lurch, which of the two this Enemy rather wished, that so many Gentlemen might fall a prey to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable malice.</p>
            <p>Then they sent private papers into the Town amongst the Souldiers by Women, incensing the Souldiers against their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, reproaching them with that odious name of Rebels (which they knew to whom more properly due) and men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting against the Peace of the Kingdome without Commission, which still they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped would so poyson the braines of the Souldiers, that if they would not mutiny, yet at least the greatest party would be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64182:95"/>
incenst against their Officers &amp; quit their Line, by whose loss we should have been so weak, as to be easily stormed &amp; taken.</p>
            <p>But instead of receiving any benefit by these sucking stratagems, they wrought nothing more than an injury to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for it engaged the Souldiers to higher resolutions.</p>
            <p>Then they shot Arrows into the Town at severall places, with papers fastned to them, promising our Souldiers, that if they would desert the Town, they should have fair quarter, pardon for what they had done, and liberty to go to their own homes, with passes from the Generall, without being plundred, or suffering the least prejudice or injury: But this neither proved any benefit to them, or injury to us, but still rather exanimated and enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Souldiers, who were so couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their resolutions as very often to expresse that they would either live with Liberty, or dye with Honour, neither of which could arise by a poor submission to an ignoble Enemy.</p>
            <p>And now the Enemy had possest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of al places of conveniency and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage round about the Town, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64182:96"/>
to annoy us very much in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Line, from the opposite and flanking Houses, and our Magazines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to grow very low of powder, so that Order was given out, that the Souldiers should be careful not to wast their ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition by firing without a very reall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and that no Gunner should fire a Cannon without the Command of a Field Officer of his Post, or a General Officer of the Field. But these Houses under the Line proved so obnoxious, that by degrees they made that line to hot for any almost to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it; &amp; the enemy having found this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage drew thicker down into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, under the shelter of the houses; which the Officers being very sensible of, knew there remained no securer remedy, sallyed out amongst them, &amp; beat them out of the Streets, &amp; some houses they set fire to, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given order to those Inhabitants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to secure and convey away their goods first; and those which lay immediately under the Line, &amp; Wall they first pull'd down by Carpenters, and other Workemen, that the Materials might be preserved, and the lesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> done to the Town, and Owners;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64182:96"/>
Which should they have let stand, would have proved so miserable an inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that we could not have maintained the Town one halfe hour, I am confident, had the Enemy ever attempted a resolute storm, when once they had begirt us so close; by reason that in many places the st airs came up to the top of the Wall, in the highest places of it, so large that two or three men might haue come up a Breast, and some Rooms equalled the height of the Wall in a perfect Diameter. And if the Enemy should have taken no other benefit but the opportunity of a Wind, and set fire to them, they might probably have set fire of the whole Town; Which they attempted the first night, and once after had effected, had not the Wind been very calme, and the Soldiers as extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligent in quenching still as they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The eleventh day more Arrows were again shot into the Towne to entice the Souldiers by alluring charms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with as severe threats, to quit the service; intimating, That if they came not away before the next Monday (it being then Friday) that not a man which came after
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64182:97"/>
should have any quarter; Which Messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Soldiers still resented so well, as that they resolved to answer it by the same Messengers, and took some of their own Arrowes annointing them with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and wrapping the same in paper fastned it to the heads of the Arrowes, and writ on the papers this superscription, <hi>An Answer from Colchester August the</hi> 11th. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>as you may smell;</hi> informiug by that how little they regarded their baits, or estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their threatnings.</p>
            <p>And now by this time the greatest part of our Horse had changed their Stables for Slaughter Houses, and their Riders being willingly dismounted took up foot Arms, the Gentlemen Halberts, and the private Troopers Sithes, ready fitted with long staves for the service, which were very terrible for execution; and there were many Sithes found in the Towne up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a search for Arms, more than ever was known to be in the Town before; and many brown Bills were also made in the Town; so that no man might be idle for want of Arms; these men were all listed both Gentlemen and private Troopers (for more orderly disposing them in

            <p>Now these Companies must not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood neither, for the only reserves we had, for it was the constant method of the Armies duty in Generall (for I cannot willingly, nor I thinke rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tearm it a Garrison, but a quarter) to lie every Regiment on their severall post, the one halfe upon guard, and the other all night very neere, at the most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place upon reserve.</p>
            <p>And having maintained and held it out in defiance of a proud, succesfull, and imperious Enemy (this being the 17 of <hi>August</hi>) still cherishing our resolutions with hopes of reliefe, and having yet no certaine intelligence of the state of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs

in the other parts of the Kingdom, nor reliefe approaching, and our stores very much-wasted, insomuch that all our Corn was welnigh spent, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ammunition left to maintaine our guards only with; by a Generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of the Councell of Warre, His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the Lord <hi>Norwich,</hi> the Lord <hi>

            <p>Other hopes we had none left (and indeed but little reason for these) the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Hollands</hi> parties were already dissolved into nothing (indeed without doing any thing) and no other parties risen, or expressing any inclinations, much lesse intentions, to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:64182:99"/>
But this would not be granted; then they were forced to send away private Spies and Messengers, and concluded in a generall resolution, to maintaine and defend it to the last; and in that time not to be idle with them, but as active as the want of Ammunition would admit; and according to those resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, send out a party every day or night at the Sally port (they went vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily upon it) and sallying upon them were troublesome enough to them, and kept them upon constant and hard duty; but <hi>ultra posse, non est esse;</hi> and our Ammunition was so exhausted, that we could not send out great parties often; yet found out a way with what materials could be gotten to make some match, which though it were not so good as what we had before, yet served our present necessity; and some powder also we made, but it was not much, for we were forced to resigne ere we could bring it to prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Then our Commissaries began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their stores which were almost emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the people generally much necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated for bread (the true staffe of Life)
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64182:99"/>
and the poorer sort meerly for want of Corne neer starving, we being not able to relieve them againe.</p>
            <p>Then the poore people Petitioned the L. <hi>Fairfax</hi> by the Mayor and Aldermen, that they might have liberty to leave the Town and disperse themselves into the Country amongst their friends, that would keep them from famishing. But he thought it not policy to grant it, but on the contrary gave order to his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my round the Leaguer, that if any should be turned forth, by us, they should fire at them; but at that time they considered by their privat friends (our bosome E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies) their Town intelligence, that we had made Proclamation at that time, that whosoever had not twenty dayes provision in their houses, should depart the Town, as well rich as poore; at which time search being made againe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few were found to have provision for above two or three dayes, and then the Enemy having given this unchristianlike, though politick, order, it would have been a very difficult thing, to have forc'd so many people through a Sally Port, and dangerous to attempt, who of themselves
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64182:100"/>
were apt enough to a Mutiny, and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane a policy (though policy it would have been) to have forced them from their own houses upon the Swords of a most cruell and mercilesse Enemy.</p>
            <p>Then the stores were again reviewed, and the Magazine also, and the stores found to be so empty as not to yeeld two dayes provision of bread in them, for the whole Army; and the Magazine not to maintain two hours fight, if a storme should happen: Then a Councell of Warr was again summoned, where this want being considered, it was agreed, That it was the best course to Treat with the Enemy in time; and by the Major part by Voices it was carried; and Letters accordingly were drawn up, and Doctor <hi>

            <p>And now too sad it was to understand, we had done our utmost, and as much that was, I think, as was possible for men to doe in our condition; having engaged so potent and conquering an Enemy so long, with so inconsiderable a party, and now at the last destitute of any hopes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a possible relief in so short a time
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64182:100"/>
as our Condition would enable us to hold out.</p>
            <p>The next morning the Doctor returned again with this Answer from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; <hi>That we had held it out so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and to the utmost denyed his Summons, That the best Conditions wee must expect from him, must be to submit to Merey, only that the Inferiour Officers and Souldiers should have liberty to go to their owne homes.</hi> Which was so much beyond the Honour of our actions, that it was thought as unhonourable to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Tuesday the two and twentieth, Early in the morning more Arrowes were shot into the Town at severall places of the Line, with Papers fastned to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was written as followeth.</p>

               <p>August 21. 1648.</p>
               <p>VVHereas on Sunday last, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Lucas,</hi> Conditions were offered to all private Souldiers, and inferiour Officers under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

superiour Officers, Lords and Gentlemen to submit to Mercy. And whereas the same hath been concealed from the Souldiers and Inferiour Officers aforesaid, neverthelesse if they will before Thursday next lay hold on the said Conditions, and come away in a Body from the Enemy, the same Conditions shall be performed to them which have been offered; but in case they shall suffer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>-People (whom we shall not receive) to be turned out of the Town, and suffer them to perish under the Walls, they must expect no Mercy; And if the Towns-men in armes shall joyne with the soldiery in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth in a body as aforesaid, they shall also be free from violence.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This prety little stratagem they thought would have infused such a wild-fire in the mutinous brains of the Rout, as would in an Instant have blown our Interest into Ayr, and invited the Soldiery to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Officers up as a Sacrifice to obtein their own Liberty: But their hopes were laid flat in this, for instead of a compliant acceptance of these Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they resolved to accept of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wherein their Officers should not receive a benefit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:64182:101"/>
The Councell of Warre having also the day before permitted Doctor <hi>Glyston</hi> to go out again, with one Master <hi>Sheffield</hi> (one of the Committee then Prisoner in the Town, brought from (<hi>helmsford</hi>) to mediate with the Generall for the People of the Town, sent also by him other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Souldiery, for Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Rendition, but Answer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, <hi>that they had given us a former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what Conditions they would give us, and those they would stand to, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must expect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now being drawn to a sad exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and plunged into a very great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it was not for us to protract time, but to adde Wing to our resolutions, and close up our mis-fortunes as neer as we could, with an honourable conclusion, and with the best contrivancy of speed that might be; for we had scarce left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten, one Cat or Dogge in the Towne, some Horses we had yet alive, but not many, for there were at that time in the Commissaryes account a list of seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nnd thirty Horse, that had been kil'd by him, and orderly distributed out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those that the Soldiers had stoln out
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64182:102"/>
of the stables and kill'd, and others that Gentlemen flaughtred for their privat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which I am consident made the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber above eight hundred; and for Bread there was not Corne left for one dayes provision, and many mouths to feed, for we had made all kind of Corne the Town would afford, as Mault, Barley, Oates, Wheat, Rye, Pease, and all we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover into bread, for eight Weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to lengthen our store, still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to undergoe any thing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that we might advance the generall service; but our hopes were now quite dissolved in absolute feare of unavoidable ruine.</p>
            <p>Yet this gastly visage of our Interest could not exile that incomparable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that generally inspired this gallant party with lively actions and patient suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, as if it had been equally indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to them, contentedly to undergoe prosperity or misfortune; all mens resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were set on fire to desperate designs and by some unpresidented attempt to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine their Enemy, or to perish nobly in the enterprize, since it is much better to die Honourably, than live Basely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:64182:102"/>
The meanest of the Soldiers as yet held a conformable obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Officers, undaunted in their courages, and couragious in their actions, notwithstanding the many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figns and politick engines the Enemy had imployed to alienate them from their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and dishearten them in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>But least there might be any mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension betwixt the Soldiers and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers upon the putting any designe in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, This Engagement was drawn, and generally signed by the Officers, and Gentlemen through the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

            <p>Then the Town was againe searched what Provisions was left, a severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given, and all private stores ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and brought into the Commissaries, leaving but to every family that had most but one peck of Corne, of all or any sorts, yet all would hardly amount to one dayes Provision of bread.</p>
            <p>The next day being Thursday the foure and twentieth, the Enemy sent in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Kite to the Towne, which hovering a good while over, that the Souldiers might take notice of it, at last they let drop in the midest of it, with many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers fixt to it, to the same purpose as those before shot in with the Arrowes, and with them a book also of the relation of a great Victory over the Scots, and their generall rout; and within two how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers after made a generall triumph through the whole Leaguer, giving a volley both of small and great shot, round the Town in all quarters; and some of their shot playing thick into the Town gave us a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strong alarum, and as great hopes that

it was but the forerunner of a storme, or the Beginning of one, till we perceived it at so great a distance, as beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Windmill beyond the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street. But now their assurances were so great of gaining a Victory without blowes, that they thought (as indeed it was) the best policy to forbeare, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had drawn their approaches so near the Line under <hi>Berry</hi> Fields, by the shelter of a wall which was yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as that their Souldiers from the Trenches, and ours from the Line might talke together, and throw stones at one another, and did frequently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday the five and twentieth, the Councell of War met againe early in the morning, where they resolved to send the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>word into the Leaguer,</hi> That since he denied to treat upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that were Honourable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our actions and demeanours in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> had been nothing but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came our Honoursand fidelity, if he were pleased to make an attempt of attaking us, he should not need to spring any Mine (as he boasted he had ready,) but that any Gate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

choice of, should be set open, and his ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance disputed afterwards.</p>
            <p>But he was now sure (as he thought) of having us at an easier rate than the losse of so much blood as such a surprize must cost him if he had carried it, which he would hardly have doue. And indeed it was his best policy not at all to storme us, since he had leisure enough to wait our doome, the Kingdome in generall being so dull &amp; sluggish, as not to act any thing that might require his remove; which had but any parts done by rising, though with small parties, at that time, might have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily forced him to; so that he must either attempted a surprize by storm, or fairly retreated with a hazard' of his honour, if not his Army; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he storm'd we had endangered the shattering of his whole Body, the edge of whose fury was by this time much taken off, and somthing start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both at our resolutions and courses for defence, and much frighted at our Sithes, and scalding Pitch, which was kept boyling in Iron pots and caldrons, every night round the Line, with long Ladles to cast it over the Rampire upon their storming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64182:104"/>
Wherefore considering the condition we were so sadly plunged in, through the defeat of the Scots, the disloyalty of the whole Kingdom, and the want we were in of provision to subsist any longer, not having any hopes that we could possibly hold out two dayes longer, unlesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bread, which we must do, or not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> all; it was the finall result of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Warre, to draw out the whole party that night, to their Arms, both Horse and Foot, with what Ammunition was lest, which was not much, and as many short Scaling Ladders as could be procured in the interim, and in the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest time when we might be least expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to set open two of the Gates, and march out and storme their Line, and so falling into their head quarters, beat up their whole Army, and relieve our selves, or force our march through all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions that they should endeavour to obstruct us with, or perish in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and if the private Souldiers should entertaine any suspicion that the Gentlemen, and Officers, who had yet Horses, should seeke out their safety by flight, and leave them engaged

every man (excepting only the General and the Major General) to pistol his own horse in the head of them; Which design being agreed on, and secrecy enjoyned, and every one taken his orders according to his duty in it, the Councel broke up, &amp; every man betook himself with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his endeavours to the making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration in the day for the nights ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>The Enemy having this day planted four great pieces for battery against <hi>Berry</hi> field; fired about sevenscore great shot in the foorenoon against the old Wall, but did very little hurt, only beat off the tops of two old ruined Towers upon it, and kill'd some three men.</p>
            <p>This was taken as an opportune alarm to call the Souldiers generally to the Line, whereby they might unexpectedly be in a readinesse for the intended sally without Bag or Baggage, which was concluded ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly to be left behind; for if we gained our hoped victory, we should command both them again, &amp; our Enemies to boot; if we failed, we resolved to have no need of them.</p>

            <p>Now all things were almost in a redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before night, and the Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and scaling Ladders brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place, ready to be carried to the Line; but long ere night there was some Officers that (although I am so charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to think not dissenting from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe) alleged many Arguments, that it might be better deferred till the next night, because they thought that then they should be in a far better readinesse; by which means it was put off.</p>

But that night, by a most desperate misfortune, though by what means I know not, but before morning, some mutinous spirit had insinuated, into the private Souldiers, that the Officers and the rest of the Gentlemen were resolved that night, or very sodenly to break away through the Leaguer, and escape, and leave them all engaged.</p>
            <p>Which sparke role to such a flame, as indeed proved a prefating Comet to our succeeding ruine, and those Souldiers so remarkeably gallant before, gave a curbe to that couragious spirit that guided their Actions in the honourable obedience; and poysoned their disturbed brains, into a frenzy of desperate mutiny round the Line; In fome places threatning to cast their Officers over the Line: So high a mutiny indeed it was grown before day, that it was rather likely to end in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ruine to themselves and Officers too, than a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Yet notwithstanding all endeavours to pacifie and allay this strangly conjured Devill, it proceeded so on till it grew to such a height, that many left their guards and got in crouds about the Line, and at the last, whilst the Councell of War was sitting, selected about thirty, which they sent to the Councell, to know what their intentions were, saying, <hi>That if they would not make conditions for them, and such as they should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Night being come, and the Chaplaine being returned, and this being related to the Lords and Gentlemen, every man expected that his own turn might be next, looking one upon another with clouded faces, that dictated to each other a noble sympathy of their troubled hearts, not out of any consideration or fears of what they expected to suffer, but for the untimely loss <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>After the Generall had kept us thus up three or foure days, he found out a new stratagem, both for disposing the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and paying his Army; first he layes a fine of 13000 l. upon the Towne, with which money he intended to pay the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

Souldiers; and for the Officers, he distributed to every Regiment a certaine number of Gentlemen that were prisoners, as slaves to the Gallyes, or to ransome themselves. The Officers whereof came to the pound (as the manner of grasiers is by their cattell) and cald them first out of that into another, and then drove them away for the market, to make the most of them; so most of them afterwards as they were able, and according to the civility of those they were distributed to, bought their liberties, and returned home; in which manner they disposed of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part excepting those who in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe were in principall command.</p>
            <p>The private Souldiers and inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were drawn from their Line, and shut in the Churches, where they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed guards over them, and gave free Liberty to their foot Soldiers, to goe in and pillage them; so that in a very short time there was very few or none left with any cloathes on them, hardly shirts, and afterwards they having thus pillaged and stript them, some changing for their raggs, &amp; some giving them nothing, they march't them away, in a day when it rained so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently, as (had we not had Gods engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

It is too saucy a thing to confine his providence, or determine his holy will, for my part I am confident had our repentance been as ripe for his favour and mercy, as our sins were before (and I feare do yet continue) for his frowns &amp; judgments, this engagement had brought home the Ark to Israell, our liberty, and His, whose glorious seat is now in Heaven, while His memory on Earth lives fresh in the martyrdome of the most Saintlike man that ever swaid an Earthly Scepter.</p>
