            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, You may there finde all the brood of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisi ors in a strait, for want of an honest Rule to walk by, there being no Law to justifie their proceedings.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Some benefit you may get in the severall passages at the severall appearances that I had before them at the High Commission Court; where you may finde them put to a stand, when I come up close unto them, in regard of the Lawes of God and of the Land.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some benefit you may get, if you be not wanting to your selves, by reading the Discourse that was between Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> and my Selfe, concerning an action and rule, as is there laid downe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some benefit you may get by reading that large Discourse I had with the Lords of the Councell; wherein it pleased the Lord most graciously to carry me along in my Answers without offence unto them, and yet kept my Conscience uncorrupted.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Some profit you may reape by the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against me at the <hi>Guild Hall London,</hi> three severall Sessions, both in point of charge, in respect of Iury, as also in regard of Witnesse, and the malice of my perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; and in observing the hand of the Lord in my


<pb facs="tcp:51942:5"/>
deliverance, which was not ordinary, but extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, his blessed Name be praised therefore.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a hint of some things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the insuing Discourse, which if thereby God may be glorified, you may be edified, then have I that which I aimed at.</p>
            <p>How if it be against all this objected, that I seeme in this my Epistle to justifie my selfe in my carriage of the whole businesse, and much to derogate from the credit of mine enemies. You know what the Apostle sayth, <hi>You suffer fooles gladly, because you your selves are wise.</hi> Truly, if I had knowne any thing in any of my Spirituall Adversaries worthy of remembrance, for their credit I would not have detained or kept it backe, but have freely yeelded it unto them. Put when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what I have by experience found, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have felt and found by their cruell proceedings and dealings with them or against them, I could doe no otherwise then I have done, least as <hi>Job</hi> sayth, <hi>While I give flattering titles to men, the Lord should confound mee.</hi> And to Apologise for my selfe, if I be not mistaken, I have already said, that I have put this to the Presse by Solicitation of others. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>not seeking shelter, as is usually done, under some great Patron to defend me, thought it my dutie <hi>not to detaine the truth in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi> but to declare it nakedly, without either feare of foes, or hope of reward, but onely that God might be glorified; for whom I have suffered all this, and much more; and will with Gods helpe continue to the


<pb facs="tcp:51942:6"/>
end, what ever may fall out in the way. As also that you might be incouraged to goe on in your Christian course of profession of the Gospel without feare, and to store your selves with such promises of divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in spirituall things, as that those which walke in darknesse, observing no Rule, by leaning to their owne understanding, may be convinced by your invincible boldnesse in standing in, and for the truth.</p>
            <p>And thus not troubling you any farther at this time, onely one Request I have unto you, that you will be thus favourable unto me, that where I shall come short, or overlash, through want of memory, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of judgement, in any of the severall passages and carriages of my Answers, you would be pleased to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with the Mantle of love and charitie, and by observing my imperfections, to get strength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the enemies of God and of his truth.</p>
            <p>And thus I commit you to God, and to the Word of his grace, <hi>who is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among those that are sanctified by faith in Christ Jesus.</hi>

and contemned: the enemies of Gods Church have been alwayes exceeding inraged against them, but now more then ever, their time being but short, and their enmitie everlasting: there hath sprung up in this last age of the world, a cursed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, (shall I say of men) nay, of Vipers, who slily and insinuatingly have more ruined the Church, then all the open persecutors that ever were, who under pretence, of being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> have been the most mercilesse, and dangerous tyrants that ever it had; I meane the Prelates, with all their hellish retinue, who have drunke so deepe of the poyson of <hi>Aspes,</hi> and have so intoxicated their braines with that same bloody Cup of the <hi>Scarlet Whore,</hi> that they can spit nothing but poyson and malice, against the truth and people of Christ.</p>
            <p>And therefore have they laboured to put scandalls, and nick-names, (never heard of among Christians, untill these innovating Prelates brought them in) Scandalls, I say, upon Religion, and the sincere Professors of it; calling them facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, seditious, <hi>Cum id genus monstris;</hi> their foule-mouth'd Chaplaines, and their gracelesse Curates, in every Sermon almost, have not ceased, in their <hi>Turkish</hi> Dialect, to powre out their venome on the most judicious, and holy Christians: Neither was this their malice onely against some malignant Spirits (as they cald them) but even against the very power of godlinesse, in any poore soule that profest it. As one of their reverend Champions most wickedly said, <hi>That if he had<note place="margin">Jo.

            <p>Concerning the Discourse, I shall say no more, but onely this, Reade it, and if thou finde any good by it, give God the glory, and the Authour thankes. I know <hi>(Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> that manifold are the temptations which thou meetest with daily in the flesh: And indeed, Christ tells before hand, what his service will cost, <hi>If any will live godly in Christ, he must suffer persecution:</hi> But yet be not discouraged, <hi>though wee sow in teares, wee shall reape in joy:</hi> though wee have a nipping Autumne, wee shall have a Ioyfull Spring; goe on thou blessed Christian, and the Lord goe with thee; fight the battailes of the Lord Jesus, quit thy selfe like a man, be couragious for God and his Cause; start not aside for all the malice of the enemies; God hath whet his Sword against them, and thou shalt ere long see them all dead on the shore before thee.

And these were for Examples to us, sayth the Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 6.</hi> God never set any upon high imployment, but he gives him proportionable strength, <hi>He will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will give an issue with the temptation, that you may be able to beare:</hi> The duggs and breasts of the Scripture are even bursting with promises of this kinde, <hi>Open your mouth wide, and he will fill it:</hi> There are a kinde of people in the world, who goe for professours and would thinke it a great matter to deny them the name of Christians) who will be content to follow Christ, while Christ is advanced in the world, and seemes to be a good neighbour, but when he comes to be thrust out of the Court, and out of the Councell, and out of esteeme with the men of the world, they are afraid to follow him too close at the heeles, least he should dash out their braines; they will be religious and wise, they must not thrust themselves into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they say; it is good sleeping in a whole skin; and indeed, it is no marvell to see men fall away as leaves in Autumne, and perish everlastingly; for they never took Christ upon his owne Conditions, they never were really ingraffed into him; they hung as the Ivie to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <p>You say true, said I, and therefore I pray Sir, bring the Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> to that Scripture, and open that Scripture, and shew how lawfully by that Scripture I may take the Oath.</p>

                           <p>That will I gladly doe, said the Doctor.</p>
                           <p>First, <hi>Thou shalt sweare in truth,</hi> saith the Prophet; and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doe I beleeve you will doe, saith he; for, I take you for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, and therefore you will speake nothing but the truth.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou shalt sweare in judgement,</hi> and that doe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you will doe, because you are an understanding man.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thou shalt sweare in righteousnesse,</hi> and that doe I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> beleeve you will doe; because the Oath being in a lawfull way administred unto you, it is a righteous and a just thing for you to submit thereunto.</p>

                           <p>Yea, with all my heart, said the Doctor, God forbid else, it is very fit that wee should labour to have our judgements informed in every thing.</p>

                           <p>Then Sir, in the first place, I cannot sweare in truth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and therefore if any should aske mee, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did Christ, what thing is truth, I must answer him in this particular, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, and that because truth is wrapt up and hid from mine eyes, either in the administration of the Oath, or in the Oath it selfe, that I cannot see it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I cannot sweare in judgement, because my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> wanteth information from my understanding, by reason of the darknesse and obscuritie of the Oath; and yee know what <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Where there is not judgement, the minde is not good.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, I cannot sweare in righteousnesse; for it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thing for me, either to accuse my selfe, or my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore, I conceive, by vertue of this Scripture, this Oath can lay no waight on my conscience; and therefore wee will bring it to the Rule, as to the touchstone, to try it by, for I doe conceive, the end of this Oath is voyde, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is God glorified, nor my brother edified; which ought to be the end of every action.</p>
                           <p>And now as concerning the rise from whence it came, wee will examine that.</p>

                           <p>Then Sir, you may remember the Oath was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a Statute in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths time, and it was a cursed curbe or scourge, invented by the Papists and Prelates, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and put to death the people of God, under the name of <hi>Lollords,</hi> who then were true Christians. And this Oath was supprest in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes; and in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes it was set up againe; and in the first of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was supprest, and the High Commission Court was establisht, and hath continued by the Bishops ever since; and they have made use of this Oath, both to suppresse the people &amp; truth of God, and therefore the rise of this Oath cannot be good.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, This Oath is contrary to all good meanes, for by the Law of God, every thing should be determined by two or three Witnesses; and this Oath causeth a man to be his owne accuser, witnes, and judge, contrary to the Law of God, and of the Land, and the Law of Nature, and therefore this Oath as it is an action, neither is nor can be good, and therefore to be avoyded.</p>

                           <p>The first is your libertie, and that is a great benefit, as you know.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, If you will call for it, you may have a Promoter of the cause, and he shall give you good securitie to pay the cost of the Suit, if you overthrow him, and this the Court cannot deny, if you will challenge it at their hands.</p>

I will bring it to the first Rule, and that is this, Thou mayst not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doe evill that good may come thereof; thy damnation is just in so doing; for me to have my body at libertie, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in prison, it is an evill and a bitter thing so to doe, and therefore by this Rule to be avoyded.</p>
                           <p>Againe, secondly, for me to have my cost allowed me, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> goe further in debt with God by reason of sinne, that will not hold by this Rule; and therefore as our Saviour saith, <hi>What will it profit a man to winne the whole world, and loose his owne soule.</hi>

               <p>I being called by Bishop <hi>Wrenne</hi> (the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop being absent that day) the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> asked me, if I would take the Oath.</p>

               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>To whom I answered, as before, that I would not take it, for I did not hold it lawfull.</p>

               <speaker>Bish. Wrenne.</speaker>
               <p>Why, said the Bishop, you were to goe to Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> and that he should report hither how he found you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered and said, that he was a very wise and judicious Gentleman.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bish. Wrenne.</speaker>
               <p>How? said the Bishop, a wise and judicious Gentleman, and yet not give you satisfaction, concerning the lawfulnesse of the Oath.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, that doth not follow, he may be a wise and a judicious Gentleman, and yet we may differ in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this thing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bish. of Bathe and Wells.</speaker>

               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, I was to go into the Countrey to visit my friends, and that I could not return so soon.</p>

               <speaker>Bi. Wren.</speaker>
               <p>Well, said Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> let it be the second Court day, and in the meane time inform your judgement; for assure your self, if you do not conform your self, we will take another course with you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, I would do any thing that an honest man should or ought to do, or else I would suffer for it: if you will convince me by Scriptures, I shall willingly submit thereunto, or else suffer as a Delinquent.</p>

               <speaker>Doctor.</speaker>
               <p>Then said a Doctor, A pox a God on him, if he will not take the Oath, we may burn our books. And this is the sum and substance of my second appearance.</p>

               <p>My third appearance in the High Commission Court, was the eighteenth day of June, 1640. at which time the Archbishop and Bishop <hi>Wren</hi> were both present together, the Archbishop with a very sterne countenance spake unto me in this manner.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, I am not yet resolved to take it, I do not find it l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Then said the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> It was lawfull before

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, if you do, then you and I shall not differ.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>Then said the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> you were wisht to go to Doctor <hi>Featly,</hi> and that he should report to the Court how he found you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, I did go according as I was directed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>Then said the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> where is the Report?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, I brought it into the Court the last Tearme.</p>

               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>What is the reason you are not resolved to take the Oath? Did not Doctor <hi>Featly</hi> labour to informe your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, he did his best endeavour.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>You stand much upon Scripture, did he not give you Scripture enough for it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, he gave me foure Scriptures.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and what do you say of those Scriptures?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered it was the holy Word of God, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, for the lawfulnesse of the Oath taking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>Then I see it is not Scripture that will satisfie you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, if you do convince me by the Scriptures, I will submit.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Archb.</speaker>
               <p>I pray by what rule will you be judged?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>I answered, by the Law of God, and of the Land.</p>

               <p>On Satterday, which was the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>October</hi> 1640. about eight of the Clock at night, as I was going to my House, a Messenger from the Privie Councell came unto mee, with a Warrant, and ten Privie Councellors hands to it, and carried me away prisoner to the Catterne. wheele in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke;</hi> for his Warrant was so strict, that no Bayle would be admitted of, for I had neighbours that offered body for body, but the Messenger durst not accept of them. Truly, the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was in such a condition, that he trembled, as if he would have sunke. But I blesse the Lord, I was never more chearefull in all my life; but there was such vild aspersions cast upon me, and such false informations given to the Lords against mee; and the Messengers charge so strict, that he wondred to see mee so chearefull and well contented; and I told him, there were three things that made a man chearefull; a good God, a good Cause, and a good Conscience; and I praise God in this thing all these I have. Afterwards, I understood that the Lords had given him order, that I should not be carried to prison, for the prison would be pulled downe, and I rescued from him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he should carry me with any tumult, for feare of the like danger that might insue; so upon the Lords day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as aforesaid, in the afternoone I was brought to <hi>White-Hall</hi> before the Lords of the Councell, and when I came thither, Sir <hi>Dudly Gaveston</hi> his Clerke began to examine the Messenger,<note place="margin">Clerke of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To whom he answered, yes; what <hi>Quatermayne,</hi> yes, <hi>Quatermayne,</hi> said the Messenger. Where is he, said the Clerke. Here is he, said the Messenger.</p>

               <p>Then the Clerke looking upon me, supposing I had not heard them, said, he is a proper tall man; but before God, he will be hanged, all the world cannot save him. I nnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing of him, thought though all the world cannot save mee, yet God can, and I was no whit discouraged by his words, as knowing my hope was not in the world, but in God onely. There I waited certaine houres, while men stared on mee, and every one censured mee, and condemning mee. At the length I was called in before the Lords, where was about sixteene or seventeene of them together, and when I had stood there a pretty while, the Lords looking one upon another, and then upon me; at last spake the Lord privie Seale to the Archbishop<note place="margin">Privie Seale.</note> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> My Lord, what say you to this man?</p>

paines therein. And whereas you say, you used me not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, in not imprisoning, nor threatning of me, I doe not lay any hard thing to your charge.

               <p>Then turning my selfe to the Lord privie Seale, I answered him in this manner; As for all that your Lordship hath said, it is impurtenent, and to no purpose, it is no way proper, nor appertaining unto mee at all; all that your Lordship hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I will reduce into two heads, and answer it in two words.

were gone, and then I went into <hi>Pauls</hi>-Church-yard, to looke for my wife, and leaning my backe against a Drapers stall, I saw the Cushions fly over mens heads, and into the dirt, and men kicked them; but who they were, I know not; but my Lords, under your Lordships favour, I doe conceive that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners themselves were onely in the fault; for, if they had done as in other Courts of Justice, that is, in this manner, Be uncovered in the face of the Court, Gentlemen keepe silence, Give audience to the Court; or my Lords, in the third place, if they had made Proclamation, and deferred the Court untill some other time, there would have been no tumult at all, but they brake away from the Court, and the people followed hooting as Birds at an Owle.</p>
               <p>After all this, my Lords, I with my wife and her sister and two or three more, went into the uppermost house in <hi>Carter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lane,</hi> and there we dranke a cup of Beere together, and then parted some of the company; my selfe, my wife, and one other went to Master <hi>Seamans</hi> his Lecture in <hi>Bred-street,</hi> and there heard both Service and Sermon.

               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I was in the Countrey, but made no Conventicles, nor yet did preach.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Quater.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I never made any Conventicle since I knew any thing that was good. But I was close by where a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Conventicle was, and that upon the Sunday or Lords day, where were at the least two thousand met together, to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God, and to prophane his holy Sabbath, abuse his creatures, and to misspend their precious time, to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of God, and the provocation of the eyes of his glory. And my Lords, except your Lordships speedily looke to it for a Reformation, the judgements of God will fall upon this Kingdome. But my Lords, if this be a Conventicle, when the judgements of God be upon the Land, for a people to meet


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51942:23"/>
together, and humble themselves, and pray before the Lord; we are farre off from <hi>Salomons</hi> judgement; for he saith, <hi>If the Lord send a judgement among the people, if the people that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his Name, shall humble themselves, and pray and seeke his face, and depart from their wicked wayes, God will heare from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, forgive their sinnes, and heale the Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And my Lords, are not the judgements of God upon us? is here not the plague of pestilence, and a threatned famine, and the sword of warre hanging over our heads? and shall not wee my Lords, humble our selves in the sence of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure?

               </gap> following, which was the third day of <hi>November</hi> (the first day of the Parliament) in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. I conceive one reason my Lord Major might have the twenty-nine of <hi>October,</hi> he was to leave his place, and it was his wisedome not to carry the guilt of innocent bloud with him upon his conscience, and peradventure he might also thinke that they would proceed no further, in regard of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is the sum and substance of the first proceedings in this Sessions, which continued untill between seven and eight a Clock at night, and then to my prison againe, with as much joy and peace as I could containe or hold, attended on by hundreds of the Saints of God. I looked on that place in the one and thirty <hi>Psalme,</hi> the fifteenth Verse, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> sayth, <hi>My times are in thy hands:</hi> Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thus much, that if my times were in Gods hands, then neither in <hi>Canterburies</hi> nor in <hi>Cottingtons</hi> hands, and that as the creature could not give life, no more it could not take away life. But I concluded, if my death might be as <hi>Sampsons,</hi> the pulling downe of the <hi>English</hi> Antichristian Hierarchie, the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe the Devillish spirituall Courts, then should I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifice my life in the cause of the Gospell, for Christ and his true <hi>English</hi> Church.</p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51942:27"/>And now to returne backe to that from which I have a little digrest; Betweene that time and the next Sessions, the old Lord Major going out of his place, and the new one comming in, the spirit of jealousie fell into the hearts of my enemies, and wrought so deeply in them, that they plotted more cunningly to take my life then before, they being afraid, as indeed it did fall out, that the Iury would learne more wit and be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised betweene that and the next Sessions, made the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Bill, and Iury, and all voyde, as if nothing at all had been done, and our three <hi>London</hi> Sergeants in their Scarlet rode in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And then the new Lord Major, Sir <hi>Edward Wright</hi> sent for <hi>Smith</hi> the Sergeant, giving him a strict Charge to warne a Jury of speciall able men, telling him that it was for a businesse of greater consequence then he tooke it to be, and so it was done accordingly. And now Christian Reader, I will lead thee along from my Prison in <hi>Southworke,</hi> to my next Sessions holden in the <hi>Guild Hall</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> where were twenty Constables, and each man had twenty Watchmen to attend with Bills, and Halberts, and a greater number to see me then at my first comming; more to see me then were to see Doctor <hi>Ducke</hi> let downe and puld up with a Rope at the High Commission Court in <hi>Pauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we ascended up into the Court, and the old Iury fitting themselves to give in their Bill, all joyntly did assent to give up their Bill <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> But when they came into the Court, supposing to begin where they left off, they found it otherwise, for there was a new Iury impannelled, and a new Commission read, and a new Charge given, and the old forsworne Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses anew swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ne, and the old Iury much disgraced by <hi>Stone</hi> our <hi>London</hi> Sergeant: which Iury had learned more wit or wisdome in his absence, then ever he would have taught them being present. So the new Iury being called by their names, they answered to them, three and twenty were summoned to appeare, and did all appeare, but six of them were not called, because (sayd the Register) they are Puritans, of <hi>Quatermayns</hi>


               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:51942:27"/>
faction. Then <hi>Stone</hi> the Sergeant, sitting as Judge, told me it was not fit I should be in the Court. Then said I to my Lord Major, my Lord, so your proceedings be to Gods glory, and the good of the Common-wealth, and in a just way for my owne particular, my presence shall not be hurtfull to you; you have chosen a Iury of wise discreet Gentlemen, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to referre my selfe unto them. Then sayd Sergeant <hi>Stone,</hi> K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>epe him safe Messenger, you must looke unto him; Then I answered him againe, My cause is good, and I will not start, though you would give me a thousand pounds. Then answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Lord Major, I thinke you will not Master <hi>Quatermayn,</hi> then the Iury looked upon me, and when they looked upon the Witnesses, how like Rogues they looked; then I answered<note place="margin">Said the Jury.</note> they are of the Court, meaning they were of the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court. So the Iury going into the Iury-roome, my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries thought, they had expunged all Puritans out of the company, but they were utterly deceived; for one Master <hi>Lee,</hi> a Vintner at the Sunne Tavern at <hi>Criple-gate,</hi> a very wise and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious man, did so debate the matter with the rest of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that notwithstanding my enemies, which were the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the truth, had cast such aspersions upon me, saying, that I was an Arian, an Anabaptist, a Separatist, a Familist, and the like, he made them to see clearly, that the Bill could not be found against mee, yet notwithstanding, they did not make an end that night. At length the Iury being often called upon to bring in their Bill, it being late in the night, the Iury came forth, and Sergeant <hi>Stone</hi> asked them if they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, they answered they were not agreed, then inquiry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made how the businesse stood, seven would have found the Bill, and ten were against it, and so the Sessions for that night ended, untill the next Friday following, being the sixth of <hi>November</hi> 1640.</p>
            <p>Loving Christian Reader, I will put thee in minde of one thing, my persecutor said, he would have my life, though it cost him five hundred pounds, and another said, that if <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termayn</hi> were not hanged within six houres, he would be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him; but the first hath mist of his purpose, and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ssions, and I returned home to my prison againe, waiting upon the Lord for my free and full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in his own good time.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, there were three or foure Letters sent from the Lords of the Councell, or the Councellor of the<note place="margin">The Archbishop.</note> Lords, to the Lord M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides, divers Messengers were sent to the place where I was imprisoned, to see whether I were safe or no. And now Christian Brother, I shall lead thee to my Gayle-Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <p>And this proved a Sessions of peace, for when we came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was neither Constable nor Watchman, so the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after some certaine time came forth and desired audience, for they would give up their Bill, and the three Sergeants would not receive it, by reason that my Persecutor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of the High Commission Court was not there, but at length <hi>Lathom</hi> came in, and then the Iury was called, and they were all agreed but one, and they yeelded up the Bill, and it was a Bill of <hi>Vera,</hi> for one <hi>Reynolds</hi> a Waterman and <hi>Ignoramus</hi> for all the rest. At which word, there was a great rejoycing among the people; but <hi>Lathom</hi> looked as pale as ashes, then I blessed God with these two words, <hi>Truth is strong and will prevaile;</hi> and then divers good Christians tooke me by the middle, and sayd, Master <hi>Quatermayne,</hi> you are sr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed; and I said, Blessed be God, who is the deliverer of his people. Then <hi>William Barrife,</hi> who was one of the Iury, was called for, who would not assent with the rest of the Iury; but see the hand of God in this also; for he was fined fortie shillings for his absence, and was glad to submit to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and intreat the favour of the Court for his fine. Then I spake to my Lord Major and his Brethren, saying; Is it in your power to free me, seeing I am freed by the Iury? And they answered, No. Then I asked if they had not authoritie in

those Letters that they had received, to free me; but they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me, No. Then I told them, I would use meanes my selfe. And thus was I most graciously delivered from the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Beare, and the uncircumcised Philistims, and the <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> the troubler of the people of God, by their prating of many swelling words of vanitie; But the Net is broken, and I am delivered; to God onely. be the glory; and to the Instruments thereof due respect and praise.</p>
