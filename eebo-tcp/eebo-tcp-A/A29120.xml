            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not my buſineſs, nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Paper-praeſent, to ſet out all <hi>Caeſars</hi> dues, or duties; but as a Subject under your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs government, and a friend and
<pb facs="tcp:93741:3"/>
ſervant to the Commonwealth, whereof I am a Member, to do mine own. It is a buſineſſe concerning which I have formerly acquainted your Highnes with ſome things in the<note place="margin">Col. <hi>Goffe,</hi> Lieut. Col. <hi>Worſley,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Scobel</hi> Clark of the Council.</note> general; and ſince that, ſome others appointed by your Highneſs to take the cogniſance of it in particular; and it is at this preſent before the Commiſsioners for diſcoveries at <hi>VVorceſter-houſe:</hi> But as the preſence of the Sun obſcures all other leſſer lights, and makes them burn more dimly, ſo the aſſembling of the preſent Parliament doth in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuſpend and ſuperſede all vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actings of derivative and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our powers: And therefore I have made bold to make this addreſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly unto your ſelf, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto your Highneſs own hand and view, in ſhort, and yet in full too, the whole ſubſtance of the matter, with the grounds and reaſons of it;
<pb facs="tcp:93741:3"/>
ſhewing the legality, equity, juſtice, and neceſsity of it, that you may at your leaſure deliberately conſider of it, and the more confidently reſolve what to do in it. It is the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great Princes, that they muſt ſee with other mens eyes, and hear with other mens ears; In this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your own may be Judges. And now, my Lord, I ſhall humbly crave your favourable protection in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of this propoſal, and the further purſute of it, if any further purſute be made in it: For although it ſpeaks nothing but Law and Reaſon, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Antiquity; yet what enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment it may probably meet with when it comes abroad, both the title and the ſubject of it may promiſe and preſage, even ſuch as all ſubjects of this nature do uſually find, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom; yet truly there are none of thoſe that are moſt concern'd in it, but upon conference, when they have
<pb facs="tcp:93741:4"/>
rightly underſtood my mind in it, and their own Caſe, they have gone away wellſatified; but, my Lord, they will be better ſatisfied, if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe great ſums your Highneſs is to receive out of the Church-revenues, ſo freely and ſo firmly by law conferr'd upon you, your Highneſs will be pleaſed to protect them in all the reſt, and to ſettle upon the Church, and confirm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it her antient portion and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Tithes, &amp; to put them into a better capacity of demanding and receiving them, than now they are in, when men will pay them but what they liſt, and if they do but demand their dues of them in a legal way, preſently they are threatned with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectment, which (as things now ſtand with them) is no hard matter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, conſidering the many pins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their ſtanding doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and the world of exceptions,
<pb facs="tcp:93741:4"/>
which the Commiſsions, Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Orders, and Ordinances made concerning them (if ſtretch'd upon the tenters, to the extremity of them, and acted upon with rigour) make them liable unto; beſides, many of thoſe which are their Judges in theſe caſes being of different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ways of worſhip, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly principled, not only againſt their perſons, but even againſt their very callings and the payment of Tithes, out of which their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and your Highneſſes revenue ſhould ariſe, the continuance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the only way of perpetuating the Miniſtry, in the Church; and which once taken away, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably follow, that in ſhort ſpace the Miniſtry will be utterly ruined and rooted out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that once down, all other Ordinances fall with it, which
<pb facs="tcp:93741:5"/>
it is your higheſt honour to protect, and to uphold; but leaving thoſe matters to your Higneſs wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and care, with the contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my prayers to the great God of Heaven and Earth, the high diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all things, for his bleſſed protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, direction, and aſsiſtance, to be ever preſent with you in all your Great, Noble, High, Wiſe, and Religious undertakings, I paſſe to the buſineſe intended, and ſubſcribe as above,</p>

means be ſetled and confirmed upon them, and his Highneſs inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to protect them in the enjoyment of them, together with his own intereſt, and in all other their antient duties and immunities, now miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably invaded. In three words, Me thinks it ſhould be ſatisfactory to all, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here propoſed but what there is Law for, what there is reaſon for, and what there is bond for. If his Highneſs will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93741:27"/>
be pleaſed to remit all theſe his dues now he knows them, he ſhall therein do a very noble, and gracious Act, and I ſhall have my ſhare in the benefit of it; but if (the exigencies of the time ſo requiring) he ſhal be pleaſed to demand them, we have no more reaſon to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his own, than the people have to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with us for taking ours. The way for us to improve this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93741:27"/>
to our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, is to doe it freely, and cheerfully, and out of our ſence of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing neceſsities of the time, and our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Highneſs for our protection in them, to offer it up to him as a free-will offering; though there were no Law at all to require it. Were the Clergy of thoſe times ſo ſenſible of the great burthens of the Commonwealth, and ſo thankfull to the King for his care and pains in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93741:28"/>
managing the affairs of it in troubleſome times, as to make ſuch a Law when there was none, and ſhall we be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the greater burdens of the preſent times, or ſo unthankfull to the ſupreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, upon whoſe ſhoulders the weight of them lies more heavy than ever it did upon that King, as not to obſerve it now it is made? ſurely, as the Clergy of thoſe times did ſhew their ſenſe of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93741:28"/>
the one, and their thankfullneſs to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their free offer of this their aſsiſtance, in making ſuch a Law; ſo the Miniſtry of theſe times will be much more forward to doe their parts to aſsiſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and encourage the Magiſtrate in his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by keeping it, and every one to put to his little finger, to the eaſing of him of the heavy burthen of it lying upon his ſhoulders; ſo as I truſt I may general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in the name of them all, as well as of my ſelf, tender this preſent unto him as to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, Protector and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. And although that ſervant which doth no more than his duty cannot plead merit, nor challenge any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reward; yet upon this our readineſs and cheerfullneſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, we may undoubtedly promiſe unto our ſelves from his Highneſs ſuch Acts of grace, in reference to our

In order to all theſe things, and of ſettling all things into a right poſture, concerning the

               <p>In which (as alſo in any thing elſe that I have written, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſetling of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their dues, and their payment of their dues, I humbly crave to be candidly interpreted on both hands, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in reference to both, being honeſt, juſt, and good, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> may have his due, and that they that pay it may have theirs too, with an earneſt deſire and hope,

that as they are to pay with one hand, ſo they may receive with the other; that in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe great ſums by their own voluntary Act, ſo clearly coming to the publike treaſury, for the publike good, ſome Act of Grace may be paſt for them, or ſomething done in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of them, which may ſo ballance the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, as that they may reſent it, not as a burthen, but a benefit, not as a damage, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93741:32"/>
an advantage; if it ſhall pleaſe his Highneſs as freely to remit the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them, as they did at firſt grant it unto him, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Pulpit to him that way, what is that to me? why ſhould my eye be evil becauſe his is good? he ſhall therein do an act both of bounty and policy; but what will the reſt of the Commonwealth think the while, when (reaſon of State and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity ſo requiring) he
