            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>GOUT! I conjure thee by the powerful Names</l>
               <l>Of <hi>CHARLES</hi> and <hi>IAMES,</hi> and their victorious
Fames,</l>
               <l>On this great Day set all thy Prisoners free,</l>
               <l>(Triumphs command a Goal-Delivery)</l>
               <l>Set them all free, leave not a limping Toe</l>
               <l>From my <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi> to mine below;</l>
               <l>Unless thou giv'st us leave this day to dance,</l>
               <l>Thou'rt not th' old Loyal Gout, but com'st from <hi>France.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>'Tis done, my grief obeys the Sovereign Charms,</l>
               <l>I feel a Bonfire in my joints, which warms</l>
               <l>And thaws the frozen jelly; I am grown</l>
               <l>Twenty years younger; Victory hath done</l>
               <l>What puzled Physick: Give the <hi>Dutch</hi> a Rout,</l>

               <l>Come then, put nimble Socks upon my Feet,</l>
               <l>They shall be <hi>Skippers</hi> to our <hi>Royal Fleet,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which now returnes in dances on our Seas,</l>
               <l>A Conqueror above <hi>Hyperbole's.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Sea which with <hi>Bucephalus</hi> doth scorn</l>
               <l>Less than an <hi>Alexander</hi> should be born</l>
               <l>On her proud Back; but to a Loyal Rein</l>
               <l>Yields foaming Mouth, and bends her curled Main:</l>
               <l>And conscious that she is too strait a stage</l>
               <l>For <hi>Charles</hi> to act on, swell'd with Loyal Rage,</l>
               <l>Urgeth the <hi>Belgick</hi> and the <hi>Gallick</hi> shore</l>
               <l>To yield more room, Her Master must have more.</l>
               <l>Ingratefull Neighbours! 'twas our kinder Isle,</l>
               <l>With Her own Bloud, made Your <hi>Geneva</hi> Stile</l>

               <l>Swell to the [<hi>HIGH AND MIGHTY LORDS</hi>] in Text;</l>
               <l>And can ye be such Snakes to sting that Breast,</l>
               <l>Which in Your Winter gave You Warmth and Rest?</l>
               <l>Poor <hi>Flemish Frogs,</hi> if Your Ambition thirst</l>
               <l>To swell to <hi>English</hi> Greatness, You will burst.</l>
               <l>Could You believe Our Royal Head would fail</l>
               <l>To Nod those down who fell before our Tail?</l>
               <l>Or could Your <hi>Amsterdam</hi> by her commands,</l>
               <l>Make <hi>London</hi> carry Coals to warm her Hands?</l>
               <l>A bold Attempt! Pray practise it no more;</l>
               <l>We sav'd our Coals, yet gave you fire good store.</l>
               <l>It is enough; The righteous Heavens have now</l>
               <l>Judg'd the Grand Quarrel betwixt us and you.</l>
               <l>The Sentence is—The Surface must be ours,</l>
               <l>But for the bottom of the Sea, 'tis yours:</l>
               <l>Thither your <hi>Opdam</hi> with some thousands, are</l>

               <l>And through th' affrighted Ocean summon all</l>
               <l>His scaly Regiments, to come and take</l>
               <l>Part of that <hi>Feast</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> Their King doth make;</l>
               <l>Where they may glut Revenge, quit the old score,</l>
               <l>And feed on those who fed on them before;</l>
               <l>Whom when they have digested, who can find</l>
               <l>Whether they're fish, or flesh, or what's their Kind?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Van-God, Van-Ling, Van-Herring</hi> will be cry'd</l>

               </l>
               <l>Their States may find their <hi>Capers</hi> in their Dish,</l>

               <l>Thus they'l imbody, and encrease their Crew;</l>
               <l>A cunning way to make each Dutch-man two.</l>
