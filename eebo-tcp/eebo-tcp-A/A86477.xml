            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The means and cauſes that have produced this decay, and the remedies to prevant further miſerie, and revive trading: My Lords, it is a common obſervation, and the experience of former Ages hath made it manifeſt, that when the ſword of warre is unſheathed, famine that

followes, the greateſt deſtruction of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and Kingdomes, witneſſe the miſerable calamities and troubles that have of late years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen upon <hi>Italy</hi> and Germany. If wee call to minde ancient Hiſtories mentioning the fatall deſtruction of the Eaſterne Empires, wee ſhall finde that the firſt ſtep to their deſolation, hath been domeſtick diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and home-bred mutinies, upon which hath followed Nationall warres, and the effects of all hath been famine and peſtilence, which hath given a full period to the utter confuſion of thoſe Kingdoms. If wee pry and ſearch into the ancient Hiſtories of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall find the only deſtruction both of that Kingdom and Citie; hath happened only by theſe occaſions, the pride and ambition of the Popes and Biſhops of that See, uſurping authority to themſelves over the Churches in the Eaſt, produced the wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Eaſt Vandals and the Romans, beeween the Eaſt and Weſt Gothes, and the <hi>Italians,</hi> which was the utter deſolation of the City of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by <hi>Allarick</hi> Captain of the Weſt Gothes. Secondly by <hi>Adolph</hi> their Captain. Thirdly, by <hi>Athila</hi> King of the Hunns.

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Princes</hi> by the ſword and fire, executed the iuſt iudgements of God upon proud and wicked <hi>Rome;</hi> the originall whereof was occaſioned by the impurity and uncleanes of the Clergy: and what ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Famines and grievous peſtilencies followed theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112911:3"/>
warres, is likewiſe too manifeſt by Hiſtory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the beginning whome <hi>Rome</hi> firſt began to lift up her head againſt Gods true Religion and his anointed Servants, Kings and Emperours, ſhe had been daſhed and ſuppreſſed, all thoſe bloudy and long warres procured by the Biſhops thereof in all parts of the Chriſtian world had bin prevented and avoyded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords, I</hi> have ſpoken this onely to remember your Lordſhips of the miſeries and calamities that have hapned unto thoſe Nations that have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt themſelves diſſenſion about the diverſity of worſhip of God in Religion, which alwaies hath proved the root and principall means of future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that now in time while opportunity doth ſerve ſuch occaſions of difference as do threaten the the ſame deſolations to the ſtate wherein we live, and whereof we be a part, may by the wiſdome of this high Court of <hi>Parliment</hi> be prevented and avoyded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> if Dearth and Famine be in a Nation, there can be nothing expected but confuſion as well of the rich, as of the poore, It is the Common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, neceſſity hath no law. There is no delaying of preſent neceſſity. It is not to be thought that Millions of men, women and childrdn will ſtarve and periſh, ſo long as there is Corn in the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> or in the cuſtody of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> It is therefore the deſire, my Lords, of the Commons, that as they have compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately conſidered among themſelves this neceſſiated Petition of diſtreſſed Tradeſ-men, and have limited a day certaine for anſwering the ſame, ſo your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips would be pleaſed to take the ſame Petition into

your conſideration with them, that the petitioners may at the time appointed, receive from both Houſes of Parliament, ſuch anſwer from their demands, as may give them full ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, under favour, I am to ſpeake a word or two of the means that have occaſioned the decay in trading, and the remedies to prevent the ſame for future time, and againe renew Trading, the meanes they conceive is principally want of due execution of Juſtice upon thoſe perſons that have bin the cauſers, and Authors thereof, and then the remedies, due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Juſtice, without any further protraction of time and the Enacting of ſuch wholſome and good lawes, for the reſtriction of vice, and maintaining of vertue, both in goverment of the Church and State, as ſhall be congruent to the word of God, and the peace and proſperity of his Sacred Majeſty, and all his Kingdoms, as ſhall be thought meet by the wiſdome and policie of this great &amp; high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which I further humbly leave to the grave conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Honourable Houſe.</p>

In length half a mile or more, as it was judged, ſharp at the North

end, and broad at the South end: for the length of it was North and South, red as bloud, and very clear, almoſt in colour like the Moon when ſhe is in an Eclipſe; which though it ſeemed cleere, yet cauſed rather a darkneſſe then a light; the length continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much alike, but it grew ſomtimes broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſometimes again it was narrower; there was neither Sun, Moone, nor any Star viſible in the skie, which was very black and dark, onely this bloudy viſion which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this manner.
