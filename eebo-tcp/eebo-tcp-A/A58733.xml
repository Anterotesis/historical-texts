            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was from thee that I at first Derived
the Original of my Being; and it is
upon the sole account of thy free Grace,
and unmerited Goodness, that I injoy
my Well Being too, with all that I am and
have, which both Obliges aud Encourages me
to approach thy Foot-stool, and with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:57376:4"/>
Veneration, prostrating my self before the
Throne of thy Glory, Humbly Offer up, and
Dedicate to thy Sacred Majesty the insuing
Meditations, Solemnly begging for the sake
of thy Eternal Son, the Lord Jesus; that thou
wouldest cast a Favourable Eye upon them,
and do thy Servant who acknowledges himself
to be the meanest and unworthiest of all thy
Subjects, the Honour to accept and own them,
by makeing them useful to Convey the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thy self to Vnconverted Sinners?
Convince them of their lost and undone Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by Nature, and the danger they are in
of being miserable for ever. Allure them to
fall in Love with, and Imbrace thy Son, who is
so Beautiful and Lovely, that he infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all Comparison; and so Loving, Tender,
and Compassionate, that he hath no Parallel.
Let it point out to them the way to Christ,
who is the way to thee, and the only means
whereby they can be Reconciled to thee, and be
made happy in the injoyment of thee: Let
them tend to the promoting the Spiritual
Good and Eternal happiness of all those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose hands they shall come.</p>
            <p>It is probable, and I expect no less, that
they will fall into the Hands of some whose
Curiosity will be the only Motive that Prompts
them to Read, and Design the Perusal of them
<pb facs="tcp:57376:4"/>
shall only serve to please and gratify their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with the Quaintness and Vnusualness of the
Method wherein they are Penned, or to verify
the truth of the Proverb, <hi>The Eye is not
satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with
hearing;</hi> but if thou wilt please by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
influence of thy Grace, to make them
fall in Love with and Entertain the Substance,
whilest they only designed to sport and play
with the shadow, I shall thereby obtain my End
in Composing and Publishing them.</p>
            <p>And I humbly Implore, that as when I was
indeavouring with incredible Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
to precipitate my self into a Gulf of
deplorable Misery, the Nature and Extent
whereof thy self hath described to be <hi>Wrath
to come,</hi> Thou wast pleased out of thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness, and Tender Compassions, which
have been ever of Old, to pluck me out of the
Horrible Pit, as a Brand out of the Fire,
and by an Effectual changing of my Nature,
turn my Feet into the ways of thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and perswade me to go on Pilgrimage to
the Celestial <hi>Canaan,</hi> and hast enabled me
to make a Considerable Progress towards it
through the midst of many amazing difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to trample under Feet, and with ease
and facility pass over innumerable Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not only from those who were travelling
<pb facs="tcp:57376:5"/>
the contrary way, and with an Infernal
Eagerness directing their hasty Steps towards
the Sulphury Lake, from whom I expected no
fairer dealing, but even from my fellow Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
too, so thou wouldest please by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of thy Grace to inable me to persevere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
until thou hast safely carried me through
all the remaining Difficulties and Dangers of
my Journey, brought me within the Gates of
<hi>Zion,</hi> and given me an Actual Possession of a
perfect and everlasting happiness in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
enjoyment of thy self, and the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Visions of thy Face.</p>
            <p>And if in the mean while, I may by this
or any other means be an instrument of doing
good to my fellow Pilgrims, Increasing and
Advancing the Kingdom of Christ in the
World, and bringing Glory and Honour to
thy Name, then the End and Design will
be sufficiently obtained, which really is the
aim of him, who is not, would not, will not
be his own; but as innumerable Instances of
Divine Goodness hath infinitely Obliged me
to be seriously, so I solemnly promise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to be for ever thine, in Time, and to

            <head>THE
Authors Apology
FOR HIS
BOOK.</head>
            <p>IT hath been observed of late years,
that peoples minds are so vitiated and
debauched, that no books will please
them to read, but Novels, Romances and
Plays, with others of the like nature; which
have been bought up at a strange and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Rate, in vast and incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
whilst Tracts of Divinity are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wholly slighted and neglected;
and their stomachs turn upon them
with loathing, unless they contain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that's New and unusual, either for
Matter, Method or Stile: By which means
Debauchery is not only maintained and
continued, but hightened and increased
thereby, to the sensible discouragement
and decay of Piety and Religion: The
observation whereof put some eminent
and ingenious persons upon writing some
Religious Discourses, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb facs="tcp:57376:9"/>
for a General Use in such kind of
methods as might incline many to read
them, for the methods sake, which
otherwise would never have been
persuaded to have perused them, as
<hi>Bernard</hi>'s <hi>Isle of Man, Gentile Sinner,</hi>
&amp;c. Hoping that the Power of
those plain Truths which they thereby
delivered in so much plainess and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity,
that made them the more easy to
be understood by most illiterate persons,
and meanest capacities; and yet afford
pleasure, delight and satisfaction to the
most Judicious, Learned and Knowing
Reader. And this consideration was the
Motive which put the Author of the First
Part of the Pilgrims Progress, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and publishing that necessary and
useful Tract, which hath deservedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
such an Universal esteem and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
And this Consideration like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
together with the importunity of
others, was the Motive that prevailed
with me, to compose and publish the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Meditations in such a method as
might serve as a Supplyment, or a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part to it: Wherein I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to supply a fourfold Defect, which
I observe, the brevity of that discourse
<pb facs="tcp:57376:9"/>
necessitated the Author into: First there is
nothing said of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> in his
first Creation: Nor Secondly, of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of Man in his Lapsed Estate before
Conversion. Thirdly, a too brief pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over the Methods of Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in the Convincing, Converting,
and Reconciling of Sinners to himself.
And Fourthly, I have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the whole in such serious and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
phrases, that may prevent that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and laughter, which the reading
some passages therein, occasion in some
vain and frothy minds. And now that
it may Answer my design, and be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
Useful, I commend both it and
Thee to the Blessing of him whose Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power, Grace and Goodness it
is, that is only able to make it so: And
withal I heartily wish, That what hath
been formally Proposed by some well-minded
persons, might be more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and universally practised, <hi>viz.</hi> The
giving of Books of this nature, at Funerals,
instead of Rings, Gloves, Wine or Bisket;
assuring my self, that Reading, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and several Holy and Heavenly Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which may Probably be raised
upon the occasion of such presents as these,
<pb facs="tcp:57376:10"/>
would mightily tend to the making peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
serious, and furnish not only the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who Discourses, but the rest who are
present, and who would otherwise be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
their thoughts and tongues too,
in such foolish, vain and frothy Discourse
as is too too commonly used at such
times, with such frames of Spirit as may
be suitable to the greatness and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that occasion which then calls them
together, and even inforce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
their own frailty: And by imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their thoughts upon that sad object
which then lyes visible before their eyes,
read Lectures to themselves of their own
<hi>Mortality,</hi> and affect their Souls with
such serious, suitable contemplations as
this, Lord, This sad and dismal, this
mournful Tragedy, which is now
acted, and acting upon my deceased
Friend, and whereof I am now only a
Spectator, must shortly be acted by me,
or rather acted upon my self, and the
rest who are spectators hereof, by the
King of Terrors, now calls to us, and we
must all of us ere long, in the self same
manner, call to others to mind their
latter End, and consider that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
to prepare their great and
<pb facs="tcp:57376:10"/>
last Change, is or ought to be the chief
bufiness of our Lives. Lord my breath is
as liable to end, will be as certainly stoped
as his, and I find that my body likewise
is compounded, and made up of the same
mouldering and decaying principles,
which incline me, and render me sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to crumble into dust, and fall into
the Grave, to which I am now following
him; but Lord, I know not how sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my self may be followed thither.
Lord, here's his Body, but where's his
Soul! His departure is a sad occasion of
mourning and Grief to his sorrowful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
but Lord, what is it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self!
He is now got beyond the Grave,
and hath a clearer sight of, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
able to Judge more truly of unseen
and invisible things than when he was
here, he hath other thoughts of Sin and
Hell, of Holiness and Heaven, than us
poor mortals, who are yet Groveling
in the dark, in these lower Regions.
Lord, Sin was the great, the cruel and
barbarous Murtherer, that first brought
Death into the World and furnished him
both with the Dart and the sting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he wounds. O that Thou wouldst
therefore affect my Soul with that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:57376:11"/>
which thou art novv preaching ot
me by him; and O let not that Lecture of
Mortality which he is now reading to me,
ever be forgotten by me: Lord give me an
interest in thy Son, whereby I may escape
the sting, and despise the Dart, and
Triumph over the fear of Death!</p>
            <p>Amongst those few who haved practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
this, abundance of good hath been
observed to have been done by that means
and who knows were it more generally
used and become a custome amongst us
at our Burials, what good might be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby?</p>
            <p>And now, that the reading this small Tract
may promote thy present piety, and future
happiness, by making thee more sensible
of thy lost and undone condition by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and by bringing thy soul mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
out of love with sin, and more and
more into love with God, with Christ,
and holiness, is the desire of him who is
thy cordial friend, and hartily wishes the
Eternal wellfare of thy immortal Soul.</p>

            <p>THE Spring being far advanced,
the Meadows being Covered
with a Curious Carpet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Green, and the Earth
Cloathed in Rich and Glorious Attire, to
Rejoyce and Triumph for the Return of
her Shining Bridegroom: The Healthful
Air rendred more Pleasing and Delightful
by the gentle Winds then breathed from
the <hi>South,</hi> impregnated with the Exhile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Fragrancy of the Variety of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and odoriferous Plants over which they
had passed; and every Blooming Bush,
and Flourishing Grove plentifully stored
with Winged Inhabitants, who with a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57376:12"/>
delightful Harmony sweetly Sing forth
their Makers Praise, and Warble out their
Joyful Welcomes to the Gaudy Spring.
I one Day took a Walk in the Fields,
to Feast my Eyes with the variety of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Objects which that Season of the
Year, wherein the Universe bears the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
resemblance to the happy state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Immortal God at first created it,
liberally offers to the view of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
Beholders, and thereby lays an
Irresistible Obligation upon Heavenly
Minds, to Spiritualize the several Obiects
they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hold, and satiate their happy Souls
with Heavenly Meditations, by affording
them such innumerable occasions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the Divine Goodness. And
as I walked, the various Objects repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to my View, afforded divers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of, and furnished me with matter
for different Meditations. Sometimes I
would Contemplate the Divine Wisdom
in the curious Frame and Fabrick of the
World, stretching the <hi>North</hi> over the
Empty Place, and hanging the Circle of
the Earth upon nothing, when by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistable
Power of his Almighty Word,
he spake a Confused Chaos into Form
and Beauty, Commanding some part of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57376:12"/>
the Earth to raise it self into lofty Hills,
and aspiring Mountains; forming their
Concave Heads for Springs, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
their Bowels for the Production
of the Usefullest and the Richest Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and appointing other Parts of it
to subside into Humble Valleys, and be
Formed into Champain Plains, whose
Surface he Clothed with a Carpet, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
interwoven with various and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Flowers, and Adorned with a Natural
Landscape of stately Cedars, Shady Palms,
and Spreading Pines, Fruitful Groves,
Aromatick Plants, and Balsamick Shrubs,
Invironing the whole with the Liquid O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
Commanding the Sea to Compass and
Imbrace the Habitation of Man, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it as a perpetual store to Administer
Rain to the Bottels of Heaven, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
Liquor to the Bubling Fountains, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Mankind with the variety of Useful
and Delectable Creatures wherewith the
Almighty hath stored it, and serve him
for the use of Navigation and Commerce.
Replenishing the Earth likewise with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Rarities, and almost Infinite
Variety of Living Creatures; and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the Air with the most admirable and
Ravishing Musick, Establishing a Glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57376:13"/>
Cannopy, admirably Beautified with
Spangling Stars to cover all his Subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Works, Ordaining it to be a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
for the Sun, whose Influence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Conveys Heat and Vegitation, and
Measures Light and Darkness to all things
beneath his Sphere.</p>
            <p>And having thus finished and Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the World, and prevented the very
Wishes of Man by those admirable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for him, at last he Formed him
also, and from a Clod of Earth exalted
him to be the Head of the Universe, and
the Perfection of all the Visible Creation,
advanced him into the Throne, and gave
him Dominion over all the rest of the
Creatures, appointing him to be their
High Priest, to Offer up their Tribute to
their Great Creator, whereby the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness antedated his most Ample
Desires, rarified his Inlarged Heart,
and filled his Capacious Soul with Sacred
Wonder.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I would Expatiate in my
Thoughts upon the Reasonableness and
Easiness of that Law which God gave to
Man in the Primitive state of Innocency
and Happiness, as the Rule of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the Condition upon which he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57376:13"/>
should remain in the perpetual Possession
of all those Glorious Felicities wherewith
he was then Crowned.</p>
            <p>And then upon the Folly and Madness
of Man, that notwithstanding the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of the Homage he was Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to pay to the Great Monarch of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, he should so easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself to be puffed up with so much
Pride and Arrogancy, as to aspire after
an Equality to, and be prevailed upon,
and wheadled by the very first Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to fall into flat Rebellion against, and
Commence open War with his Soveraign,
whereby he lost at once the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and all the Happiness and Felicity
which was the Consequence thereof, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
himself out of <hi>Eden,</hi> and Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado'd
the enterance into the Celestial
Paradise, against him and his Posterity
for ever: Precipitated himself into a
Gulf of Desolation and Woe, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
himself obnoxious and liable to all
the Torments and Misery, which Abused
and Inraged Justice, in Conjunction with,
and Assisted by Almighty Power, was
able to Inflict.</p>
            <p>Then I could not but Meditate on the
Triumphs of Hell, and how the Devils
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57376:14"/>
rejoyced at their Victory, Priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that although they were not able
to revenge themselves upon the Great
God for Expelling them out of Heaven,
and Casting them down into Hell, to be
for ever Tormented in those unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Flames, yet they had wrakt their
Infernal Rage and Devilish Revenge upon
Poor Mankind, and thereby spoiled as
they thought the New Creation: Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
God of the Honour he designed to
himself thereby, and Involved <hi>Adam</hi> and
all his Posterity into equal Ruine with
themselves, who must now undergo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
just Condemnation, be equal sharers
with them of their Misery, and Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bear them Company in the Everlasting
burnings.</p>
            <p>And then methoughts I saw wretched
Man in a most Forlorn and Despairing
Manner, bitterly exclaiming against his
Madness and Folly, and pitifully bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and lamenting his deplorable and
wretched Condition; running into the
Woods, and striving to hide his Guilty
Head among the Thickets, from the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
search of the All seeing Judge,
who immediately followed him thither;
called him to the Bar, and Convicted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57376:14"/>
him of the Crime of Disobeying and
Rebelling against his Almighty Will, in
wickedly breaking, and perfidiously vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
his most Just and Righteous Law.
Upon which my trembling Ears diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
listned to hear the dreadful Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Fatal Sentence, Consequent to
the preceding threatning, <hi>in the Day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt die.</hi> But lo,
to my wonder and astonishment, Divine
Love produced a Reprieve before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and Mercy stept in and stayed the
Execution, Free-grace having from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
prepared a Propitiatory Sacrifice
to Compensate for the Crime, and restor'd
the Prisoner to the Favour of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
to the exceeding amazement of
Angels, those shining Courtiers of the
King of Glory, that continually reside in
his Celestial Palace, and perpetually attend
the performance of his Royal Command,
who were all of them hereupon filled with
a Divine Wonder, at the Infinite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable
Condescention of the great
Jehovah, in parting with his own Son, his
only Son, for the Redemption of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Ungrateful Man: To the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
Comfort and Consolation of the
Reprieved and Pardoned wretch, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57376:15"/>
was hereby instantly raised from the
depth of despair to the very Pinacle of
hope. And to the Grief and Confusion of
Hell, whose Tormented and Despairing
Inhabitants found themselves strangely
disappointed, by the admirable Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the Covenant of Grace made
between God the Creator, and God the
Redeemer from all Eternity, whereof they
had no Knowledge till now when the
sweet Effects of it began to appear in the
Expiation of that Mischief which their
Infernal Subtilty had effected; and the
advancing Man to a Happiness far more
Admirable and Glorious than that from
which he was fallen, in regard of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
stability thereof; it being so
firmly fixed by the Eternal Decrees of
God, and Confirmed by the Precious
Blood of the Mediator, to all those hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Souls who are of the Number of Gods
Elect, and for whom the Blessed Jesus
hath Bought and Purchased this Eternal
Happiness, that it is an utter Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for all the Rage of Earth and Hell to
rob them, or deprive them of it.</p>
            <p>And having thus in my Meditations run
through the Creation, the Fall and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Man, I reflected more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57376:15"/>
upon the sad and innumerable
miseries whereunto Fallen Man is now Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
as the Reward and Consequence of
his Depravation, revolving in my Mind
the Huge Slaughters, Cruel Maslacres,
and the Bloody and Inhumane Executions
which have happened in all Ages; the
Miseries and Calamities of Sickness, and
the Tormenting Pains wherewith many
of those Distempers to which he is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
are attended, as the Gout, Stone,
Strangury, Collique, and the like; the
many unseen Accidents which frequently
render the nearest Relations uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and displeasing, and imbitter the
sweetest and most desirable Enjoyments,
together with the various perplexities
which always accompany the most prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and flourishing Condition of Rich and
Great Men, and from which their Large
Possessions, Great Places, Honourable
Titles, and the Palaces of Princes cannot
secure them. Nor can even the Throne it
self exempt him that sits thereon from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the glittering Diadem wherewith his
Royal Temples are Incircled, attended,
and incumbred therewith, and rendred
always uneasy, and sometime unsafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
but chiefly upon the miserable and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57376:16"/>
deplorable Condition of Man in the Loss
of God's Image, and the Original Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
wherewith his very Nature is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
the Poisonous and Infectious steems
whereof are perpetually Bubling forth in
the many and horrid Acts of Prophaneness
and Debauchery, whereof his short and
transitory life is Composed, and at the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
and Conclusion thereof, sadly plunges
him into a Sea of Wrath and Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Misery: And that notwithstanding all
this, it is a Work of most incredible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to allure and prevail with this
wretched Creature to accept of and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Blessed Jesus in the Offers of the
Gospel, and thereby at once free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the intollerable slavery of Sin,
the Fear and the Danger of Hell, and be
Reconciled to, and enjoy the favour of
God with all the Delights and Glories
of Heaven as the Consequence thereof:
That nothing below an Infinite Power
can possibly effect it; the Consideration
whereof Clipped the Wings of my aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Soul, which till now had been Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
aloft, and Soaring above the Clouds,
and so overwhelmed it with Grief and
Melancholly, that I sat me down on a
Flowery Bank, when leaning on my Hand
in a kind of a sad and sorrowful Posture, I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57376:16"/>
fell asleep, and in my sleep I Dreamed,
and methoughts I saw at some distance,
an innumerable Company of Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children Dancing and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
abundance of Mirth and Jolitrie,
which begat in me an extream desire to
inform my self of the Quality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the occasion of their Rejoycing.
To which purpose I directed my steps
towards them, and as I drew nearer, I
found them to be vastly more in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than I at first conceived them, and
could perceive that there were Persons of
all Degrees and Ranks; and that Young
and Old, the High and the Low were all
of them ingaged in the same kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and that the Rich and the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
were Confusedly intermingled with
the Poor and the Despicable, wherefore
meeting with some stragling Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I got up to the great Heard, I inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of them with great earnestness, what
Countrey it was wherein I was then Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
What kind of People they were that
Inhabited it, and what was the occasion of
all that Mirth which I discovered in the
Company that I saw on yonder Plain?</p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>reply'd they,</hi> every one of your
Questions sufficiently demonstrate that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57376:17"/>
you are a Stranger in our Country, which
obliges us to give you as Positive and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
an Answer as possibly we can;
Wherefore, know Sir, the Country where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you now are, is called <hi>Wilderness,</hi> as
well for the Largeness and Barrenness of
it, as the innumerable Dangers which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
attend those who Travel in it. It
is Situated exactly between two vast and
mighty Countreys, each of which are far
longer and bigger than it self. There is
but one way into it, through which all
its Inhabitants have entred, and there are
but two ways out of it, through which,
all those who Travel to either of those
Countries Situated upon its Borders must
of necessity pass. And that fine, broad,
smooth and pleasant Path which you see
goes down there on the left hand, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and Adorned with many rare and
delightful Varieties, and which, as you see,
is throng'd with Passengers, is one of them,
and is known by the Name of <hi>Impenitency,</hi> it
leads directly to the Kingdom of <hi>Darkness.</hi>
And look up yonder Hill on your Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
wherein you see not above two or
three Travellers, is the other, and that is
usually known by the Name of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
it leads as directly to the Countrey
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57376:17"/>
which lieth on that side of the <hi>Wilderness,</hi>
and is called <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> as the
other does to the Kingdom of <hi>Darkness.</hi>
Now we suppose you cannot but wonder
by this time why the Path which leads
down to the Kingdom of <hi>Darkness</hi> is so
much Crowded with Passengers, and the
other which leads to the <hi>Celestial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
so seldom trod. But before we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with the Reasons, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that we inform you of the different
Entertainment those Travellers meet with,
as well in their Journey towards, as their
Reception into each of those Countries.
You must know therefore, that those
which Travel towards the <hi>Celestial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
by reason of the narrowness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenness
of the Way, have a very hard
and difficult Journey of it, are forc'd to
strive and struggle hard, and put forth
all their might and strength to get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
because the Road lies all the way
up Hill, besides which they are forced to
grapple with abundance of Difficulties and
Discouragements; and to Incounter with
mighty and powerful Enemies, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
sometimes by flattery to perswade
and allure them to forsake the way, and
at other times by open force and violence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57376:18"/>
to force and thrust them down, continually
molesting them some way or other, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
moreover continual Mockings and
Scoffings, deriding their Madness and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as it is termed by them) for walking
in such untrodden and forsaken Pathes.
But to make amends for the troublesome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and unpleasantness of the way, they
no sooner draw near to the Borders, and
get within view of the Countrey; but they
are met by some of the shining Courtiers
of the Great King, by whom they are
Congratulated for their safe Arrival with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the view of the <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> bearing
them Company, and assisting them in the
remainder of their Journey, and as soon as
they arrive there they are Welcomed and
Embraced by the King himself, by whom
they are immediately arrayed in Robes of
Majesty, Seated upon Thrones of Glory,
and their Victorious Temples adorned
with Crowns of Triumph; in which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they are to Live and Reign in the
Royal Palace, and with the rest of the
Blessed Inhabitants of the Place, be Kings
and Priests unto himself, and the Lamb
for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, those who Travel
towards the Kingdom of <hi>Darkness,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57376:18"/>
the way is broad, plain, and easy,
somewhat inclining down Hill, filled with
abundance of Passengers, and replenished
with many other Felicities, to render it
the more pleasing and delightful, and
thereby allure them to persevere therein,
their Journey thither is attended with
little or no trouble, opposition or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
but they march on Couragiously
in Triumph and Glory: But at the end
of the way, suddenly and at unawares, and
usually before they can imagine they are
got half way in their Journey, they fall
down into the Kingdom of <hi>Darkness,</hi> which
some have thus described.</p>
            <l>Rebellious Angels, tho' Heaven's Ancient Race,</l>
            <l>The Almighty thrust into the lowest Place,</l>
            <l>Which from the Earth so deep, and dark
doth lie,</l>
            <l>As we are distant from the Starry Skie.</l>
            <p>And being thus fallen into this dark
and dismal Place of Horrour, they are
there lost for ever, as it is said of them
in Holy Writ; <hi>I saw the Wicked flourish like
a green Bay-tree, but I looked, and loe sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
he was not.</hi> They are likewise evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Intreated, and made Slaves of by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57376:19"/>
King of that Place, which many of them
are not Ignorant of, and yet will not be
perswaded from walking in the Path that
leads thither, and therefore we shall next
give you the Reasons thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Some because they have Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Parents, were Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
and Educated in the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
suppose themselves born Heirs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to Celestial Happiness; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude that whatsoever way they
walk in, they shall certainly get thither
in the End. And that their Indulgeing
themselves in Prophaneness and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
will prove no impediment to their
obtaining that Eternal Happiness, which
they vainly Imagine to be their Birth-Right:
And therefore you may with as
much Confidence of prevailing speak to
the Mountains to remove, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a House to turn its Foundations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost,
as to convince them of their
danger, or perswade them to lay a better
Foundation for, or obtain a New Title
to everlasting Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some having Travelled many
Years in the ways of Sin, and found abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of delight and pleasure therein; and
having never so much as looked towards
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57376:19"/>
the ways of Religiou and Holiness, but
at a distance they fancy them to be far
more dismal and void of pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
than they really are, and therefore
cannot perswade themselves to leave a
pleasant Rode wherein they are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
for a loansom Path wherein
they are altogether Strangers. Or, if
they have ever adventured to enter a
little way therein, by the Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they meet withal, and the Revolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Minds, the sweetness of
their former Enjoyments, they have been
allured back; <hi>returning with the Dog to his
Vomit, and with the Sow that was washed to
her wallowing in the Mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The greater number are drawn
into it by their Ignorance and Folly, and
the Example of others; accounting it
safe enough to go to Hell with a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and esteeming a Popularity in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
better than a Singularity in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some walk in the Broad-way,
because all that they enjoy there is their
own, and the place which they receive,
at their End of it, they receive upon the
Score of Merit; but if they should go in
the Narrow Path, then both the necessary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57376:20"/>
Provisions for their Journey, and the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise</hi> at the end of it, must be
given them as a Free Gift, by the King
of the Country, which they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many refuse to walk in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way, because of its simplicity and
plainness, they must have their Glorious
Colledges, and their Splendid Ministers,
their Beautiful Quires, and Raised Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
Inclosed with Hangings of Arras and
Tapestry, and richly furnished with the
Finest Silver, and Adorned with the
Gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi> They must have a Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Pompous Worship, and a Ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Harmony of Vocal and Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Musick to delight and exhilerate their
Spirits, and if you will deny them this,
you may go to the <hi>Celestial Paradise</hi> alone
for them, for you shall be sure to have
none of their Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Abundance of those who walk
in the Broad-way have obtained some
knowledge of the <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
good thoughts of it, and would
fain procure an Interest therein; but it
being an hereafter Happiness, an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in Promise only, and they being
impatient Creatures, are unwilling to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57376:20"/>
stay so long for their Happiness, or tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for their Portion till the end of their
Lives: Wherefore closing with the desires
of those mentioned in Holy Writ; that
cry out, <hi>Oh, who will shew us any good?</hi> wholly
neglect that inestimable Treasure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
those happy Souls are enriched, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom the Son of the Blessed lifts up
the Light of his Countenance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
makes them to Rejoyce more than
others whose Corn, and Wine, and Oyl
increases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Many of those, who do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into, and make some Progress in the
way to Celestial Happiness, by reason of
some defects in their entrance, they after
a little time strike into some of those By
Paths which Border upon the way to Life,
and seem to run Parallel with it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
after some Miles Travelling they
Wind off, and by insensible degrees lead
into the Broad way again, and when they
arrive there, they Bless themselves to
find the way to <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> wherein
they confidently perswade themselves they
are yet Travelling, as free from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and replenished with as great or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Felicities than that wherein they For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
Travelled towards the Kingdom of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57376:21"/>
               <hi>Darkness;</hi> so that by this means the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
them of their dangerous mistake,
and the reducing them back again to the
way of life, is become far more hard and
difficult than it was at first, and many of
them never find they have lost their way
until it is too late to return.</p>
            <p>They having given me this Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Country, I found my Heart
exceedingly affected therewith, which put
me in mind of what the Disciples of
our Lord said to each other, viz. <hi>did not
our Hearts burn within us, when he talked with
us by the way, and opened to us the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
But perceiving one of them going
to proceed, I begged of them first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
me this Question concerning the
Narrow Way, which they called <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
whether there were no manner of
Pleasure and Delight therein, which may
in some measure allay the bitterness, and
Compensate the troubles of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?</p>
            <p>You must know, Sir, <hi>reply'd they,</hi> its so
far from being wholly without, that it is
the only Path in the whole Country, which
affords any True, Solid, and Real Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
In the other indeed they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
great many Carnal Pleasures, and Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57376:21"/>
Delights, but they afford no Real, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Imaginary Happiness; and therefore
although they express abundance of Mirth,
yet it is the Travellers in the Narrow
Way which have the only True and Real
cause of Rejoycing. But you must know
Sir, that they are Pilgrims, and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
and Treasure whereof they are Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
is such as is most agreeable to, and
convenient for such a Condition; were
they Clog'd and Laden as the others are,
what Progress would they make, do you
think, in their Pilgrimage; since the Path
is so narrow, lies up Hill, and is attended
with so much difficulty all the way till they
come to their Journeys End? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Treasure is chiefly within them,
so that all the Enemies in the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Rob them of it, nor do Strangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
therewith: Redeeming Love,
Pardoning Mercy, and Converting Grace
is their Happiness and Treasure: They
are Reconciled unto, and are become at
Peace with God; and the Great, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting,
and the Almighty <hi>Jehovah</hi> is
become their Portion and Inheritance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
fullness and Alsufficience it self is
the Ocean wherein they Swim, the Air
wherein they Breathe, and the Fountain
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57376:22"/>
whereat they Drink, the Streams whereof
refresh their Spirits, and make glad
their Souls, even in the midst of outward
Calamities. They have an assurance of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, and are filled with the Peace of
God which passes all Understanding. And
now I hope you are Convinced, Sir, <hi>said
they,</hi> that the Way is not without its
Comforts; but if it were, the sweetness
of the End would Compensate and make
amends for the bitterness of the Way. To
which I making no reply, they conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me satisfied by my silence, and therefore
proceeded.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, said he that spoke to
me at first, having thus Described unto
you the Country wherein you now are,
and my Friend having resolved your
Doubt concerning the Narrow Way,
which we call by the Name of <hi>Conversion.</hi>
I shall proceed to the Answer of your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Query, what kind of People they
are which Inhabit this Countrey: They
are, Sir, of the Generation of a certain
Man called <hi>Adam,</hi> a Native of the Land
of <hi>Eden,</hi> and being Expelled that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
for their Usurpation and Rebellion
against the Monarch thereof; they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in this Wilderness. They are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57376:22"/>
who are Naturally extream proud,
and yet both they and all their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
were Beggars from the Cradle,
and they are born to Trouble, Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Misery, as naturally and with as
much frequency as the Sparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Besides which they are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
danger of being taken in some or other
of those Snares which the Prince of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
hath placed all over this Wilderness
so secretly, and covered them with so
much Craft and Subtilty, that its a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Incredible difficulty to discern them,
and thereby fall into <hi>Tophet,</hi> the Place
where the Damned are Eternally Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
notwithstanding which it is their
constant custome to rush amongst those
Snares with as much eagerness and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
as the Horse rusheth into the
Battel; and put far from them the Evil
Day, until such time as it overtakes them
at unawares, and the Son of the Eternal,
when his Wrath and Indignation is stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up, suddenly tears and rends them
to pieces: And in order to this, putting
far from them the Evil Day, is the Intent
and Design of that Mirth and Jolitry
which you see expressed by the People
that Dance on yonder Plain, which may
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57376:23"/>
serve as an Answer to your Third and last
Query.</p>
            <p>The Discourse being thus finished, and
I having acknowledged my Obligations
to them for their Courteousness and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
returned them Thanks for their
gratifying my Curiosity, and taking my
Leave of them, I went towards the Plain,
and as I drew nearer, I perceived there
was a large hollow Circle or Cavern in
the midst of them; and because I could
not conceive what it should be, I pressed
in among them, and going to the Brink
thereof looked in, and lo to my Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Wonder, I then plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they were all of them Dancing
about a Pit that was bottomless, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Flames that never go out; and
as I stood there, methoughts I could hear
the horrible out-cries and dismal Screeches
of the Damned, and the Ratling of the
Chains, and the Fiery Shackles of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
of Hell, whereupon being much
astonished, my Spirits sinking within me,
and my very Flesh trembling for fear, I
suddenly started back, and fled for my life,
lest the Rowling Flame which flowed
like a stream of Brimstone, should have
Consumed me, or the Noisome Fumes of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57376:23"/>
the Burning Sulphur which came up into
my Nostrils should have Suffocated and
Choaked me; but being gotten some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from it, and as I thought out of
the danger thereof, I first lifted up my
Soul to God, returning Adoration and
Praise to him for delivering me from the
danger of the Horrible Pit; and then
turning my self towards them again, I
could not but stand and behold them
with Admiration and Pity, and found my
Heart touched with a sensible Commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their desperate Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in their wilful continuing to sport
themselves in a Place of so much hazard
and danger, notwithstanding the reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cautions they perpetually receive to
forwarn them of their danger, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them to flee from the wrath to
come. And behold as I looked earnestly
upon them, methoughts I saw sometimes
one, and sometimes another drop into the
Pit, and the Flames catched hold of them,
methoughts when they were falling they
struggled with all their might and main,
endeavouring if possible to make their
escape; but, alas, it was then too late,
and there was no remedy.</p>
            <p>But while I stood in this manner look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57376:24"/>
towards them, I saw several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Gowns standing up amongst them,
and thereupon I drew near and listned to
what they would say; and the truth is, I
there heard divers very Learned and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Discourses of the evil Consequences
of Sin, the Dreadfulness of <hi>Tophet,</hi> and the
Happiness of the <hi>Celestial Paradise;</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that I verily thought within my
self, that those Orations would certainly
make Converts of at least an half of the
Company, and prevail with them to go
on Pilgrimage to the Promised Land,
which had been so admirably Described
and Commended to them; and I waited
with a great deal of Patience to see them
begin; but all to no purpose, for not a
Man of them would stir a Foot, whereat I
wondered, and Reasoned thus within my
self. Good God, <hi>said I,</hi> shall all these Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Rational Discourses be spent in
vain, and prove like Water spilt upon a
Stone. Shall so many excellent Words,
and so many curious Sentences be lost
in the Air, and prove of none Effect?
Shall they Accomplish nothing to thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
nor the good of those to whom
they were directed? Shall so much Pains

               <pb facs="tcp:57376:25"/>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57376:25"/>
they not have one Soul added to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
as an Incouragement to them in their
Work, and to Demonstrate thy aprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof? Lord what can be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this, and where shall I fix the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thereof. And methoughts I found
my Mind wonderfully grieved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
because I could obtain no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
therein; but after some Pauses
and Serious Deliberation thereon, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that the Reason of it was, because
they Preached to them as if they were all
Converts, and had already begun their
Pilgrimage, and therefore stood in no
need of any Perswasions to enter into the
Narrow Way, but only a few short and
cursory directions for their walking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
And whilst I was musing on this
Matter, and bewailing the miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of so Fatal a Mistake, I sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
heard a Man speak with a loud
Voice like the Noise of Thunder, and
looking up, I saw a fine Grave Old Man,
whose Name as I have since learned was
<hi>Boanerges;</hi> he laid open their miserable
and undone Condition, and assured them
in the Name of the Eternal <hi>Jehovah, That
unless they repented they should all likewise Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish:</hi>
At the pronouncing whereof, I saw
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57376:26"/>
one of them began to change Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and look as if he were almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to become a Pilgrim; wherefore,
I drew near to him, to observe what he
would do, and methoughts I heard him say
thus to himself: The truth is, I now see
plainly that I am in a lost and undone
Condition, and that this Careless and
Prophane life which I now lead will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
undo me; to prevent which, I
must Repent and forsake my Sins, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to my finding Mercy. But, oh, <hi>said
he,</hi> the mischief of all is, that I must then
leave all my Delights and Pleasures, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
and bid an Eternal farewel to all this
Brisk and Jolly Company, with whom I
have hitherto spent my time in Mirth and
Pleasure, and abandon those beloved
Practices which always afforded me so
much Delight and Satisfaction, that I have
accounted them as dear to me as my Right
Eye, and as necessary as my Right-hand,
and the parting with them, will be as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
Displeasing, and Painful, as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynting,
nay Dis-membring of my Body;
and therefore, what wilt thou do, O my
Soul, wilt thou consent to a Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Parts; or wilt thou content
thy self with the Destruction of the whole?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57376:26"/>
Wilt thou yield to a Cutting off those Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Members, with which it is morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
thou shouldest ever enter into life,
or wilt thou resolve by a sparing of them,
to plunge thy self, Soul and Body, into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Death. And after a little pause,
he added, But suppose, O my Soul, that
thou couldest freely consent to part with
all these things which thou hast esteemed
as Precious as thy life, nay more precious
than thy self, yet thou must go further
and Submit to the doing and suffering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things very irksome and tedious to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as being Buffeted, Hated, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
by the World, the loss of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and Credit; Goods, and Estate;
the Imprisonment of thy Body, and it
may be the loss of thy Life too: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the whole way to this <hi>Celestial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
is attended with so much hardship
and danger, that even those who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it to thee, and perswade thee to
go on Pilgrimage thither, tell thee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that through many Tribulations thou
must inherit the Kingdom. Upon which
methoughts he began to shrink, and shrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Shoulders, was about to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
himself to his former Courses;
whereupon I saw a Grave Serious Old
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57376:27"/>
Gentleman, who stood by, the Gravity
of whose Countenance shewed him to be
a Judge, (and as I remember one of them
that that stood by, told me his Name
was <hi>Conscience,</hi> and he is, <hi>said he,</hi> the
Vicegerent of the great King) he boldly
struck him upon the Shoulder, and in a
kind of harsh and surly Dialect, told him
plainly, that since he believed not, he
was damned; and that by the rejecting
the Council of God, he had accounted
himself unworthy of Eternal Life, and
drawn upon him the Infinite Wrath of the
Eternal <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whio is thereby so much
inraged and filled with Anger against thee,
that he is coming forth in his Fury to
Revenge upon thee, wretched thee, all
that Scorn and Contempt wherewith thou
hast shamefully slighted, and wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the Sacred Charms of Redeeming
Love, and the Wonderful and Amazing
Offers of the Divine Bounty. Upon
this methoughts I saw him tremble and
look as if he were in a straight, and knew
not what to do; upon which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
began to speak again, and told him,
that it was no time for him to Debate,
lest before he came to a Conclusion, he
were overtaken by the hand of Justice,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57376:27"/>
and then I can assure you, <hi>said he,</hi> there
will be no possibility of escape. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I heard him say to himself, this
Wicked and Profligate course I see now
must be forsaken, or else this Old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will never let me alone, but will be a
perpetual trouble to me, which I am not
able to indure, for his Words are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as Thunder, and I dread his Reproof
more than an Earthquake; besides if
what he says be true, I shall be in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Condition, for as I remember, I have
somewhere read, that This Majesty of
Heaven and Earth against whom I have
been guilty of High Treason (having
lived in Actual Rebellion against him this
many Years, and whom Mr. <hi>Conscience</hi>
tells me, is now coming forth against me
Armed with Fury and Wrath to destroy
me, and Execute me as a Traytor) is a
Consuming Fire to the Workers of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
That his very Nostrils breathe Smoke,
and out of his Mouth comes devouring
Fire; and the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
told me, that he had seen him seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times, and that once he beheld him
seated upon a Throne which appeared to
him like the Fiery Flame, and his Wheels
as Burning Fire, and affirmed that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57376:28"/>
a Fiery Stream issue and come forth
from before him, and that thousand
thousands Ministred unto him, and ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before
him. And now, O my Soul, if all this
be true, and this great and terrible <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi>
be coming forth in this manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, as I fear he is, for I read the
other day a Passage in the Divine Law
which now comes fresh into my Mind, and
I verily believe it to be intended as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of War against me, <hi>viz. The
Lord trieth the Righteous, but the Wicked and
him that loveth Violence his Soul hateth, upon
whom he will Rain Snares, Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
and an horrible Tempest, this shall be
the Portion of their Cup: For his hand shall
search out his Enemies, and his right hand
shall find out all those that hate him, whom
he will make as a Fiery Oven in the time of his
Anger, he will swallow them up in his Wrath,
and the Fire shall devour them, their Fruit
he will destroy from the Earth, and their
Seed from among the Children of Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they intended Evil against him, and
imagined a mischievous Device, which they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wanted Power to perform; therefore will
he constrain them to turn their Backs when
he makes ready his Arrows upon his strings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57376:28"/>
against the Face of them:</hi> What wilt thou
do? It is impossible for thee to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, or defend thy self against him,
for he is too strong for thee, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
above thy match; neither hast thou
any other Forces to Muster up against
him, but Briers and Thorns which he
will easily go through and burn together;
nor can I see any probability of escaping
by flight; for whither wilt thou go from
his presence, or in what place wilt thou
hide thy self from his sight? Dost thou
know any place secret enough to exclude
thee from his search, or art thou acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with any Cavern so dark and remote,
and the way to it so intricate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing,
that Infinite Wisdom cannot
find it out, nor Omnisciency it self Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
it? Having thus reasoned with
himself he ceased, discovering by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedness
of his Countenance, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of his Mind; whereupon I saw a
brave solid Person step to him, as I
remember, his Name was <hi>Judgment;</hi> and
having first fixed his Eyes upon him, and
viewed him for a considerable time, he
spake to this, or the like purpose; Sir, I
am somewhat concerned to see you in such
a dreadful and deplorable Condition, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57376:29"/>
I would fain be instrumental for the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you out of it: I must acknowledge,
that of all Men in the World, I have
been the most mistaken in you; for the
truth is, I did verily believe you to be
in as good a Condition as any Man living,
and flattered my self into an opinion,
that as you were blessed with Outward
and Temporal Felicity, so you were in
a safe and sure way to obtain Everlasting
Happiness; nor had I yet been undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
had not the Son of the Blessed, who
is by Virtue of his Mediatorship, made
unto us Wisdom, as well as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Precious and Necessary things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we can never be happy, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Beams of Divine Light into me,
and by those enlightning Rays inabled me
to take a clearer prospect of your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than ever I did before, whereby I
plainly perceived, that your Condition
was far worse, and more dangerous and
dismal than I ever imagined; but I must
tell you for your Comfort, that at the same
time wherein I received this discovery of
your danger and misery, I received like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Information of your Remedy too. At
which Words methoughts the Man sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
revived and looked chearful, as if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57376:29"/>
the Power and Efficacy of some rich and
reviving Cordial had raised and exhile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
his drooping Spirits, and chased a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
those disponding thoughts which till
now had filled his fearful Breast with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Despair: And he cried out, Oh,
Sir, if you will do that, I shall esteem you
the best Friend I have in the World: Pray
what course must I take to prevent my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miserable for ever? Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> your
only way to prevent that, and to secure
your being Eternally happy; is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to fly for your Life, (for if you stay
here, there is no probability to prevent
our Ruine) and go on Pilgrimage to the
<hi>Celestial Paradise;</hi> for in the way thither
there stands a City, the Name whereof is
<hi>Refuge,</hi> and it is appointed and ordained
by the Eternal, to be a place of shelter
for all those, who, finding themselves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by the Avenger, will fly into it; and
he hath freely promised, upon the Word
of his Omnipotency, that from the very
Day and Hour of entrance thereinto,
we shall be Eternally safe from the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
nay, hath assured us, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
himself shall thereupon become
pacified, that his heart shall be molified
towards us, and his Indignation against

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57376:31"/>
us be appeased, and that he shall put on
Bowels of Compassion, and Cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Love and Tenderness of a
Father towards us, when speaking to us
in the most Melting and Compassionate
manner, he shall declare that Fury is not
in him, but Favour and Friendship, Love
and Good will is all that we may now
expect to find from him; that he would
Cloath and Beautifie our Souls with Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Inrich them with the Inestimable
Treasures of Glory and happiness, bestow
upon them the refreshing Dews of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
here, and the fulness of it hereafter;
by which Sweet and Comfortable Words,
he shall effectually perswade us to lay hold
of his strength, and make Peace with him,
Promising, that thereupon he will become
a Sun and a Shield to us, that Infinite
Love, and Divine Goodness shall be our
Inheritance, and Omnipotency it self our
Portion: Now the Gates of this City
stand open Day and Night to give conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Entrance to any who fly thither.</p>
            <p>But now, if ever you expect en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into this City, you must consent
to the being stripped of all those abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Rags and filthy Garments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you are now Cloathed; and you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57376:31"/>
must lay down all those Lusts and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which for the sake of an Imaginary
Happiness you have fancied in them, you
have hitherto with incredible Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
always carried about with you, and
Indulged them in your Bosom; but no you
must relinquish them for ever, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and turn from them with the greatest
hatred and detestation imaginable; nay
since they have Traiterously opposed your
subjecting your self to the Son of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and would not have him to Reign over
you, you must bring them before him, that
he may slay them: This indeed is hard and
irksome to Nature, and you will find some
difficulty in the performance thereof; but
yet, assure your self that this must be done,
or otherwise you will be Eternally undone.
Oh therefore, let me prevail with you to
consent to, and resolve upon the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
hereof. Consider I pray you, did
not the Eternal part with his own and
only Son for you, and will you then be
so ungrateful to deny the parting with
those Wretched and Cursed Companions
for him, which if not parted with, will
infallibly betray you to everlasting Ruine,
and Precipitate you into the deepest
Place of the Burning Lake? I say again,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57376:32"/>
let me perswade you to this, or else sit
down satisfied, and content your self to
spend your time in Mirth and Folly, and
your Eternity in Pain and Misery; and
therefore pray resolve what to do, and
let your Debates come to a final issue.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I saw a third Person come
to him, who seemed to be of a far more
brisk and Aiery Complexion, than the
two former, telling him, that he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
listned to all the foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse,
and found himself wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleased and delighted therewith, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believing, that at the very same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
when, and by the very same Act of
Grace whereby the Son of the Blessed
darted the Beams of his illuminating
Light into Mr. <hi>Judgment,</hi> whereby he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saw and discovered his Misery, together
with the way and means whereby you
may, <hi>said he,</hi> be saved from it: He dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into me likewise, a sense and feeling
thereof, making me to Sympathise with
you, and incline to help and assist you
in the performing the hard Task, and the
carrying you over all those Difficulties Mr.
<hi>Judgment</hi> hath Described, for I assure you,
that I begin to think so well of the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that if you will undertake it, I will
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57376:32"/>
go along with you and assist you with
Legs wherewith you shall Walk and Run
therein: Nay, to encourage you the
more, I promise and ingage my self to
furnish you with Wings for the inabling
you to sore aloft and fly above the Clouds.
The extraordinary Promises this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
made him of Assistance begat in me
a more than ordinary Curiosity to Inquire
his Name, and I was answered by some
who knew him, that his Name was <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now methoughts I heard <hi>Conscience</hi>
begin again to round in his Ears, the
greatness of his danger, the necessity of
his escape, and the incouragement he had
received from those two Persons for the
attempting thereof, demanding what he
intended to do. You may be sure Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
he,</hi> that by this time I am weary of
this dreadful and dismal Condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I now am, hanging as it were between
Heaven and Hell, without being able to
discern to which of the two places I am
most inclined, nor can I possibly discern
if Death should now put a period to my
Life, which of them would be my Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Home, and therefore you may well
imagine, that I am not without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57376:33"/>
to go on Pilgrimage to the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise;</hi> but there is a certain
Person in the World whose consent I
must first obtain for my so doing, or else
I must still remain as I am; for the truth
is, without his consent to, and help and
assistance therein, I can neither begin nor
perform my Journey; and yet I am afraid
he will not be perswaded to consent to,
and assist me therein, for I have found
him by woful Experience to be a cross,
stubborn, ill-natured fellow, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inclined to oppose and hinder eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing which is good, and by Custome
inured to the Practice of that which is
evil.</p>
            <p>Pray, <hi>said</hi> Conscience, who can that be
with whom you maintain so near a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respendence,
that without his consent you
will not be happy. It is, <hi>reply'd he,</hi> one
whom you know very well, and I think
you have some kind of acquaintance with
him, and when I have told you his Name,
I believe you'l be of my Mind, his Name is
Mr. <hi>Will,</hi> and I am confident that you know
him to be both a Wilful Headstrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
strongly bent against any thing that
is good, especially against this Pilgrimage,
and likewise, that he hath such an absolute
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57376:33"/>
Power and Dominion over me, that I
can do nothing without his Consent. Then
said <hi>Conscience,</hi> if that be the Man you
spake of, I acknowledge there is a great
deal of truth in what you say, yet I tell
you again, you must not make use of this
as an Argument for your delay, lest ruine
suddenly overtake you, and you Repent
when it is too late, and there be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:
You must send for him, and see if
you can get him to consent, and let your
two Friends, <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with him, and see if they cannot
perswade him to a Compliance.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I saw him return all alone
by himself, and being curious to know
what he was going to do, I followed
him, and saw him enter into a secret place
wherein he concealed and hid himself
from my sight, and indeed from the view
of every Mortal, which made me the
more desirous to inform my self what he
did there; to which end, methoughts I
crept as near to the place as possibly I
could without being discovered, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
I observed a profound silence, lest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
peradventure I might have been
an unhappy Instrument to disturb him in
his private Meditations: Being thus seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57376:34"/>
I hearkned diligently if I could hear
him speak; but notwithstanding all my
diligence he spake so low, that by that
means and my distance I could not hear
much, only sometimes when he was more
earnest than ordinary, he would exalt his
Voice a little, and then I could hear him
Expostulate after this manner: Lord
thou hast Convinced me, Oh that thou
wouldest Convert me too? Thou hast given
me a sight of my Sin, Oh that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
give me a hatred and detestation of it
too? Lord; that my Soul may abhor and
loath it, and that I might loath my self
because of it? Thou hast by the Terrors
of thy Law made me afraid, and by the
Threatnings of thine Anger, and the
Thunderings of thy Fury hast made thy
Wrath and thy Justice terrible to me; Oh
that thou wouldest now by a Powerful
and Effectual Application of the Promises
of thy Gospel, make my Soul to hope in
thy Mercy, rejoyce in thy Love, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in thy Favour? Thou hast given
me a sight of a Saviour; Oh that thou
wouldest give me an Interest in him too?
Now thou hast shewn him to me; Oh let
me not be put off without him; and since
there is such a Remedy provided, let not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57376:34"/>
my Soul perish for the want of it; since
there is such Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> let not my
Wound prove incurable, and since there
is a Physician there; Oh, oh, that my
Soul may be healed and recovered by
him.</p>
            <p>I am weak and feeble, ready to faint
and perish, and thou hast told me that he
is willing as well as able to heal me; Oh
make me willing to go to him? Thou
hast said, thy People shall be a willing
People in the Day of thy Power; Lord
Exert thy Power in me, and make me
willing to go to thy Son, since thou hast
made him willing to receive me? Thou
hast in the Gospel made a free Offer
and Tender of him to me; Lord make
me willing and able to accept of it and
imbrace it, by receiving him into my
Soul, and the making a Compleat and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Surrender and Resignation of my
self unto him.</p>
            <p>Lord thou hast informed my Practical
Judgment, and caused Light to shine into
my Understanding, and thereby in part
cured that Blindness and removed that
Darkness wherewith they were naturally
filled, making some of those Scales to fall
off which Original Corruption at first
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57376:35"/>
drew before them, and Actual Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
hath since thickned and increased,
until at length they were extended over
the whole Surface, and rendered it not
only Dark, but even Darkness it self:
Thou hast awakened my Conscience, and
in part cured it of the Plague of Hardness
and Unfaithfulness; and thou hast more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
regulated my Affections, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to better Order and Obedience.
And now, O Lord, hast thou done all this
for me, and yet shall I have no benefit
thereby? Hast thou brought to the Birth,
and wilt thou not give strength to bring
forth? Shall it stick here? Wilt thou
give me a glimpse of Mercy, only to make
me the more sensible of future Misery, and
afford me a prospect of thy Love, only
to let me know I am not an Object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Hast thou given a view of Heaven, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereby to precipitate me the deeper
into Hell: Indeed if all this should be,
yet I must acknowledge that thou art
Righteous when thou Judgest, and Just
when thou Condemnest: But Lord, so
long as there is so much Merit in thy
Son, and Bowels in thy Love, I will
still hope in thy Mercy, and from thence
plead with thee for the finishing that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57376:35"/>
Work which thou hast graciously begun
in my Soul? Subdue my Will as well as
inform my Judgment, and cure the Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornness
and Rebellion of the one, as
the Blindness and Darkness of the other?
And as thou hast Regulated my Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Love and admire thee; so bring
my Will to comply with, and make
choice of thee? Make it willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to, and aquiesce in that admirable
contrivance of Saving me by Jesus Christ?
Lord display the Riches of thy Grace,
and the Glories of thy Love so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before it, that it may be sweetly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
and allured to a Complyance; Oh
that by a Discovery of the freeness, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and redundancy of thy Grace thou
wouldest draw and attract it to thee, for
hereof I am Confidently assured, that if
thou dost begin to draw, my Will can do
no less than follow after thee.</p>
            <p>And now his Voice beginning to be low
again, I could hear him speak no more,
only I could sometimes hear him Sigh,
and now and then breathe forth an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Sentence, as, Lord how long; or, Oh
when wilt thou come unto me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
he had done, he came out, and I saw him
go into a little Walk not far from the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57376:36"/>
place, as soon as he came there, he met with
<hi>Will, Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> and so they
walked together, and as they walked, he
began to break the Matter to Mr. <hi>Will</hi> thus,
You know, Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> that you and I
have for a long time been loving friends
and Intimate associates, have maintained
an exact Correspondence, and with equal
consent have spent our time in Sin and
Wickedness: Raised an unreasonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against, and maintained an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
War with our Soveraign, and that
with such a preposterous Ingratitude and
amazing Folly, Madness, and Foolhardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that we have taken the very Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which we received from him, and
made Weapons of them wherewith to
fight against him, and in the mean time
laughed at our own Danger, and sported
with, and made light of his Power; nay,
we have even run upon the very Bosses of
his Buckler, and played at the Mouth of
his Roaring Cannon; and although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he hath laid hard at us, yet we have
refused to yield, and when he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
us a Truce, and proposed Terms
of Reconciliation, we have scorned them;
and yet you cannot but be sensible that he
hath infinitely the odds of us, for the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57376:36"/>
very Ground whereon we stand to fight,
is full of Pits and Snares, and Incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
with a Thousand Inconveniences,
besides which it borders upon an Unfadom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Precipice, on the very Brink where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have frequently played, and sported
our selves with the Rowling Fire, and
Unquenchable Flame wherewith it is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
You know likewise that our Feet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
slipt, and we had both of us like
to have fallen into it, especially one time,
when, if you remember, we were brought
down to the very Gates of <hi>Tophet,</hi> and
the shadow of Death covered us, it was
only the Effect of Divine Patience that
we then escaped it; but now I am In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
(nay and I am sure it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true too) that our Soveraign Armed
with Fury and Revenge, is Marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, and is resolved to tumble us
down into the Pit, as a Reward of our
Treason and Rebellion against him; to
prevent which, and in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my Peace with him, I am Advised
to fly to a City that stands in yonder nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way, the Name whereof is <hi>Conversion,</hi>
and I think they say the Name of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is <hi>Refuge,</hi> through which lieth the way
to Celestial Happiness; they give such an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57376:37"/>
admirable Description of the City, and
such Convincing Reasons why I ought to
repair to it, that I am inclined to yield
to their perswasions, and in regard there
is so near a Relation between us, I would
fain have you to go with me; <hi>nay</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go without you; and therefore, pray
Sir, be so kind to your self and me, as
to Consent to go with me; for the truth
is, I must not, I cannot, I dare not take
a denial from you. When he had done,
<hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> seconded him, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down divers weighty and excellent
Arguments why he was obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with a Motion founded upon such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Reason, and by the Complying
with which he might reap such an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
advantage.</p>
            <p>I perceived by the Countenance of the
Man, that the Lectures which had been
read to him were very distasteful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant,
and no way suitable to his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Inclinations; for scornfully throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his deformed and Mis-shapen Head,
Rowling about his Luxurious and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
Eyes, and holding up his Sturdy
and Rebellious hand, he began to Huff
and Hector at a strange Rate, and cried
out to them after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57376:37"/>
Pray, Sirs, leave off your Canting, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with your whining, I cannot indure
it; if you love me, give over your Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and let me alone, leave me
to my Sensual Delights, and the Pleasure
of my present Injoyments, for I assure
you, you shall not prevail with me to
part with or relinquish them. Tell not
me of Danger; I see none, fright me not
with <hi>Tophet,</hi> I feel it not; nor terrifie me
with your Stories of Infinite Justice and
Divine Vengeance, for I fear them not;
you shall impose none of your Melancholly
Fancies upon me, nor will I believe any of
your Chimera's; you tell me of a Strange
kind of Happiness, you know not where nor
when; you tell me of strange kind of Horror
and Torments, but where, or what they are,
you know no more than my self: You tell
me likewise of Death and Judgment,
which indeed is of most weight with me,
and I acknowledge my self most affected
therewith; because I have Daily Objects
of Mortality before my Eyes, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Emblem or Effigies of Death is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represented to my view in the Death
of my Relations and Friends; nay, the
fading Flower, and the withering Grass
read me perpetual Lectures of my frailty;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57376:38"/>
and the Tolling Bell often brings News,
that the Destroyer is abroad, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
me with Alarms of his approaching
towards me; but yet this also seems at
a great distance, for Death is not yet
come within view of me. I am young,
and in my strength, and injoy the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Verdure of my Youth, the Prime
of my Days are not half spent, and I
have many Years to pass over before I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at Old Age, some of which, at least
I resolve to spend in my present Courses,
and lay out on my sinful Dalsiances; its
time enough to Repent hereafter, when I
have satisfied my Soul with Pleasure, and
glutted my self with the Creature, then I
will begin to think of Heaven; for I think,
that when Death, Judgment, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
with the other terrible things
whereof you tell me begin to mend their
pace, and make more speed in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
towards me; it will be the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
time for me to fly to this City of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi>
and till then, pray let me alone, for
I am yet free, and am resolved not to
bring my self into a Voluntary Bondage.</p>
            <p>Having given this cross and untoward
Answer to what they had proposed: He
turned about, and was going away in a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57376:38"/>
Rage, but methoughts I saw <hi>Judgment</hi> lay
hold on him, and cry, pray Sir turn again,
and let us Debate this Matter with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more Consideration and less Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
lay aside your Heat and your Prejudice,
and attend with Patience to what we have
further to offer, and when you have heard
it, then Judge of it with a Mind, not
Predetermined against it, but resolving
within it self to be Convinced by it, and
yield to it if it be backed with sufficient
Authority, by its agreeableness to and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with the Rules of Scripture
and Reason.</p>
            <p>I perceive that what we have Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
has angered you, and put you into a
fume; but pray sit down and consider a
little, whether notwithstanding all that
Confidence and Fearlesness you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and that Couragious and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
temper of Mind you boast your self to
be the Master of, you can indure without
any kind of Concernment or Grief to think
of being everlastingly shut from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Eternal, and Banished the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Vision of his Face: Can you take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
think you in being for ever Banished
the Presence of the Lamb, whose Person
is so Comely and Glorious, and his Face
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57376:39"/>
Cloathed with such admirable and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
Smiles, that it contains in it, and
conveys unexpressible Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and inconceivable Joy and Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to those happy Persons who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the beholding and contemplating
thereof: Can you, I say, indure to think
of the loss of all this, together with the
loss of the Company of the Holy Angels
and Glorified Souls, who there Celebrate
an Eternal Marriage, and keep an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Sabbath: And being raised to the
highest Pinacle of Admiration and Joy,
with Exalted Voices and a Divine Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
sweetly Sing forth, and perpetually
Breathe out their Praises and Adorations
of him, who having died for them, and
washed them from their Sins in his own
Blood, hath now made them Kings and
Priests unto God, and to himself for ever.
Or, admit you can think of all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being concerned or grieved for your
loss, yet tell me, can you as easily indure
the Vengeance of Eternal Fire? Are you
willing to exchange your stately House,
your pleasant Fields, and your delightful
Orchards for everlasting Burnings? Can
you consent to have your Merry and your
Jovial Company, which you now keep, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57376:39"/>
for that of the Damned; or those
Musical and Harmonious sounds wherewith
you are so much delighted, for the Hideous
roaring, and dismal Out-cries and Shrieks
which the Extremity of their Pain, and the
Depth of their Despair extort from them?
Are you willing to have that Sweet Air
wherein you now breathe, and which you
suck in with so much complacency, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Nauseous and Offensive Fumes
that flow from burning Brimstone, or to
have this Pleasant Light, and Delightful
Day which you now injoy, turned into an
Eternal Night? What think you, will a
Burning Oven, or a Glowing Furnace be
an easie Lodging for thee? canst thou feed
upon devouring fire, and satiate thy
Thirst with Boiling Oyl? or canst thou
swallow Scalding Lead, and Drink down
Burning Brimstone with as much eagerness
and delight as now thou doest Wine in
thy Rioting and Drunkenness? Thou
now accountest the Duties of Religion
hard and unpleasing; how then wilt
thou suffer all those Torments? Thou now
deridest Hell as a Scare-Crow, because
thou hast not felt its Pangs, nor met with
any, who having made their escape thence,
could with their Flaming Tongues relate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57376:40"/>
to thee the Terrours thereof; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it seems to thee now, Oh how will
it appear to thee then, when thou findest
thy self really sinking, and the Day is
come when thou must actually descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and feelest thy self wrapt up in the
Flames of it: Oh how terrible it will
then be to thee, when thou must bathe thy
self in a Sea of Wrath, and Welter out
thy Eternity in a Burning Flame, without
being able by all thy Crying and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
complaining, and lamenting, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
for one drop of Water to cool thy
Flaming Tongue, or obtain the least Miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the extremities of thy Pain and
Torments: Oh think with thy self how
will thy Fleshly Delights, and Dalliances
wherein thou now indulgest thy self, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
with thee then, when they are thus
seasoned and sauced.</p>
            <p>Methoughts at this Discourse I saw him
begin to shrink, and could perceive him
to shake and tremble exceedingly, crying
out, Oh Sirs, what shall I do to be saved?
you have by this Discourse very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
me out of the deadly Sleep, and
Fatal Lethargie whereinto <hi>Lucifer,</hi> by the
consent of my own wretched and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
(as well as deceived) Heart, had hushed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57376:40"/>
me; you have convinced me of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and dreadfulness of my Condition,
and now I am freely willing, and give my
consent that he should go on Pilgrimage,
and Promise that I will bear him Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and assist him in his way to <hi>Celestial
Paradise,</hi> and to Morrow we will begin
our Journey thither.</p>
            <p>Having thus prevailed with <hi>Will,</hi> and
got his Consent to go on Pilgrimage, the
time likewise being so very near wherein
they were to set out towards the Place
where his Blessed Redeemer Resided, and
kept his Celestial Court: He went away
wonderfully pleased, being in a kind of
Rapture upon the account of his Victory,
and the Happiness he expected as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
thereof; and methoughts I could
do no less than rejoyce with him too.
But as I lifted up my Eyes, I espied a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Person coming towards the Place
where we were, and although when I first
espied him, he seemed to be at so great a
distance, that I could but just discern
him, yet he came forward with such swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that in less time than a Minute he
was got just by the place where the Man
stood; his Person was so deformed and
ugly, and his Countenace so grim and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57376:41"/>
terrible, that I presently fancied he was
no Mortal, but rather some Malicious
Devil, who envying that any should be
happy, since he was Damned to be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Miserable, for when I looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
upon him, I could perceive a kind
of Blew Sulphury Flame come out of his
Mouth, and he breathed Fire out of his
Nostrils as out of a Furnace, the Smoke
whereof Infected and Putrified the very
Air, impregnating it with such an often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and Sulphury smell, that it almost
suffocated me, and his Eyes seemed to be
so swelled with fury, that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to burst, and as they rolled about,
they sparkled like a Burning Coal, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Ruine to all upon whom they were
fixed: Well, thought I, this poor Man is
beset by this Fiend, what will he do, or
how will he defend himself against him;
how will he be able to grapple with him,
since he is so strong and powerful, that
he did in the very first Battel that ever he
fought, after his coming into the Infernal
Regions, by his own proper strength,
without any kind of help, or Auxiliary
Forces, overcome and Conquer the whole
Humane Race, yea struck them Dead,
and laid them at his Feet at the very first
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57376:41"/>
blow. And Holy Writ terms him the
<hi>Power of Darkness, and the Prince of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Air.</hi> Besides if he could defend
himself against his Power and Strength,
so that he could not overcome him by open
Force, yet he is so great a Politician, and
Master of so much Subtilty, that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
for the Ruine of poor Mortals are
innumerable, and his Wiles for the whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
and Wiredrawing them into his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Snares, so many and various, that
without an extraordinary care, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
watching and eyeing of them, it
is impossible for the most careful and pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul to trace or discern them, for if
they neglect their Watch but an hour or
two, they unawares fall into such a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
and find therein so many Crosses
and difficult Paths, wherein are so many
turnings and windings, that they find it
the most difficult and intricate matter ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to get out again; and some never
find the way out, but are lost therein for
ever. Now methoughts, I said to my
self, alas, poor Man, what wilt thou do,
how wilt thou be able to resist this Strong,
and this Subtle Adversary, since thou
art but a poor thing, but just now, nay
hardly yet escaped out of his base and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57376:42"/>
slavish Vassalage, and hast not had time
to recover thy Strength, make Provision
of Forces for thy Assistance, or cast up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Breast Works to defend thee from his
Assaults; and just as I had done speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Words, I saw him lay hold of
the Man, and with a furious Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
demand of him what he did there,
why he was not with the Company he was
wont to keep? and many such like Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
telling him he was a <hi>Traitor,</hi> a <hi>Rebel,</hi>
a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> a <hi>Puritan,</hi> a <hi>Precisian;</hi> that he
was <hi>Headstrong, Stubborn, Disobedient</hi> to
the Church, and what not; and therefore,
said he, I command you upon your Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
to go back again, and wholly lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all thoughts of the Pilgrimage you had
designed, for I will assure you its a very
silly Contrivance to forsake such pleasant
Company, and relinquish so Sweet and
Pleasant Injoyments whereof you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in present possession, for something
which you have never seen, felt, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
and so cannot possibly be assured
that they are certainly true, or supposing
them to be true, yet there are several
Discouragements attending your Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> which are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to disswade any Wise and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57376:42"/>
Man from attempting of it. As
First, you'l meet with but little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
upon that Road, and what you do
meet with, will be but mean and odd kind
of Persons, you will find them all Pevish
and Froward; some Loose and Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
others Rigged and Censorious, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to catch at, and quarrel with you for
the meanest trifles; you will likewise, if
you prosecute your intended Journey, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
your self to abundance of Perils and
Dangers; therefore, pray go back to
your Company: There is at the Tavern
in yonder High way, a meeting of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of your acquaintance to Drink Healths,
and Huzza's: I charge thee to go thither
to them, and by imploying thy self in
those Exercises wear out of, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
from your Mind those idle Fancies,
and Groundless Whimsies which hath of
late crept into it: There is likewise a
little further, about three or four steps
beyond the Tavern a spacious Theatre,
where there will be a Commedy Acted this
Afternoon, being exactly at three of the
Clock, I Command you to go thither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for the same purpose; so that you
may see all my Commands are easie to be
performed, agree exactly with your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57376:43"/>
Inclinations, and afford as much
pleasure and satisfaction to your self as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to me.</p>
            <p>It's true, <hi>reply'd he,</hi> you have ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to a Soveraignty over me, and
have with a Tyrannous and Arbitrary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency
commanded my Thoughts, and
disposed my Actions, and it is as true,
that I have yielded an absolute Obedience
to all your Commands; made my self
a Slave and Vassal by the doing your
Drudgery, and provoked my Rightful
Soveraign against me, only to gratify
your Hellish Revenge, and give you an
opportunity of insulting over the Wretch
you have by your Subtilty and Malice made
Eternally miserable: Yet I absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that ever you had any true and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Power over me, but you were a cruel
Tyrant and Usurper; nor had I any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to dispose of my self to you, but was
guilty of as great Usurpation in suffering
my self to be so imposed upon, as you were
in attempting it, since I was His, by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Obligations. Besides I am informed
that your Work, as hard and difficult as
it is, will be rewarded with nothing but
Death; wherefore I found my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to leave your Service, and enter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57376:43"/>
my self a Servant to the Eternal, who is
my Leige Lord, and do resolve to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
so for ever, in defiance of thee and all
thou canst do. Hereat methoughts the
Fiend stormed exceedingly, and with a
fierce and terrible Countenance, he roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a most hideous Manner, breathing
forth immediate Ruine and Destruction
to the poor trembling Wretch, if he did
not yield, so that I looked when he should
be Slain and Trampled under Foot by
his proud and insulting Foe. But whilst I
stood thus doubtful what would be the issue
of that great Combate; lo as I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
earnestly upon them, I saw the poor
thing pluck up his Courage, and very
nimbly draw a Sword which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
received out of the Sacred-Armory,
wherewith he began to lay about him
wonderfully; crying, Oh, <hi>how shall I do
this great Wickedness and Sin against God;</hi>
and charged so home upon his Adversary
with that Sword, that notwithstanding
all that force and strength wherewith he
made resistance, he found himself under
a necessity to give back and flee; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I perceived that what is said of him in
Holy Writ, is certainly true; <hi>resist the
Devil and he will flee from you.</hi> And now
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57376:44"/>
methoughts I saw the Man look very
chearfully, and discover much briskness
and agility in his walking, as being in a
Rapture of Joy for his Victory; but as I
afterward perceived the Fiend by this
means took advantage against him, for
seeing his Enemy fled, and himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Master of the Field, he was now
more secure, being altogether void of
any dread or fear of his adversary's rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again, when indeed he only retreated
to take breath, and contrive some new
Stratagem for the renewing the Battel
with better advantage to himself; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I saw that when he was got a little
way out of sight, he made a stand, and
having paused a little, he turned about,
and presently advanced towards the late
Victor, whose thoughts were so taken up
with his Conquest, that he never saw the
return of his Adversary; whereupon I
heard him say thus to himself; well now
I have him sure enough, he overmatched
me in Strength, by reason of his Sword,
the keenness whereof I cannot indure,
nor have I any Armour that will defend
me from the Fatal Effects of it, when it is
wisely used by those that have it; but I
shall overmatch him in Craft, and bring
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57376:44"/>
about that by Subtilty, which I could
not do by Violence. I began now to
wonder in my self, what Method he
would take next in Assaulting him, but
he soon resolved me by putting his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in practice; and first, I saw him beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
a Person who was in the Mans Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(I think they call him <hi>Phansie)</hi> to
come to him, he presently went upon the
first call. Well Friend, <hi>said he,</hi> you and
I have been old Acquaintance, and we
have been always very Familiar together,
upon which score I make bold to desire
your Company at this time, to acquaint
you how you may do me an extraordinary
kindness, and I request your ready in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to accomplish it. You need not
question it, Sir, <hi>reply'd</hi> Phansie, for I am
naturally inclined to Froth and Vanity,
and am in my Element when Actually
imploy'd in your Service, wherein I have
found more sweetness than in any thing
else whatsoever. I am glad to find you so
plyable, said the Fiend to him, and now
therefore I will tell you the thing I would
have you do for me; you see that Man
which walks yonder is turned Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, has cast off my Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and is removing himself and all that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57376:45"/>
he has quite out of my Territories, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to go and settle himself in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise;</hi> I know that if ever he
get within that place, he will be far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my reach, and there will be no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of ever coming at him, or revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self upon him, and therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to use my uttermost indeavour to
withdraw his thoughts from thence, and
prevail with him to return to his former
Pleasures and Delights. I know likewise,
that the chief Man with him is one Mr.
<hi>Heart,</hi> I think they now call him Mr. <hi>New-Heart,</hi>
although when they were both in
my Service, this <hi>New-Heart</hi> was then an
Old Man, he was then very familiar with
me, and I made him my Confident, and
one of my Council; and he used to lodge
me in his best Room; but of late he is
grown wonderful shie, and will not by any
means come at me, nor suffer me to
come at him, but I know that you have
so much Power with him, and such an
influence upon him, by reason of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy
and Familiarity, that you can
prevail with him to do any thing; and if I
can draw him over to my side, he will bring
the rest along with him. Now therefore
take these fine, sweet and pleasant things
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57376:45"/>
which I now give you, and lay them just
before him, and let them be displayed by
you to the best advantage, and by the
strength of your imagination the injoyment
of them must be represented as the best
and most desirable Happiness he can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
obtain: And now, Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> if
you will undertake it, and do your best for
the performing of it, I do not question
but I shall succeed and reduce him to my
Obedience again. Now I understood that
the Man was altogether ignorant of this
Conspiracy which was thus strongly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binated
against him, nor did he in the
least perceive the Snare which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
laid for his Eternal Ruine, which made
me burst forth into the following Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for the dangerousness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
Alas, poor Man, <hi>said I,</hi> I find
thee to be in a far worse condition now
than thou wast before, although then it
was bad enough with thee, for thou hast
not only a Strong and Subtile Adversary
to fight with, but thou hast those about thee
too, who Conspire to betray thee into his
Hands; and that which is yet more sad,
and I fear will prove more Fatal to thee,
is, that thou art ignorant of all this, and
so in the more danger of being insnared
and ruined thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57376:46"/>
               <hi>Phansie</hi> being thus instructed, went
his way, and managed the business so
sliely, that Mr. <hi>Heart</hi> was intoxicated
therewith; whereupon I saw the Fiend
send one of his Companions, whose
Name as I understand was <hi>Asmodai,</hi> to lay
some pleasing Object in the Mans way, in
hope that he would be taken therewith,
and accordingly he having planted himself
in a certain way through which he knew
the Man would pass; he dropt down
something just before him as he passed by;
it is not convenient for me to tell you
what it was, but thus much I may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to tell you, it was something which
he had formerly been very much in Love
with, and was so suitable to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
bore such an exact resemblance to
his Complexion; and was so ingrafted
into, and interwoven with his very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that you would have taken it for
an Essential part thereof; when he First
saw it, he gave a little start, seeming
much amazed to find it there, concluding
as I understood, that he had left it so far
behind, that he should never have seen it
more; after a little pause he turned his
Head away and would not give it a look,
but went forwards as fast as he could.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57376:46"/>
well, thought I, this Man will not be so
easily insnared as I was afraid he would
have been; but I was not long in that
Mind; for I found that notwithstanding
his seeming resolution at first, yet he
began to flag and yield, for although he
turned away from the Object it self, yet
Mr. <hi>Phansie</hi> so ordered the matter, that
he had the perfect Image and Idea of it
continually before his Eyes, and imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so firmly in his Mind, that he could
not possibly rase it out, and remembring
the former Love he had for it, and the
sweetness of those Pleasures the injoyment
thereof had yielded him, he began to find
himself somewhat pacified towards it, and
his indignation against it to cease; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he first admitted it into his sight,
then adventured to play with it, and at
last (although not without some reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
he consented to a perfect Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and admitted it to the same famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
and indearness wherewith he had
formerly imbraced it, and so fell insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
into the Snare which was laid for him
by the Fiend, who was as I am informed
the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> himself. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
I found my self very much
grieved and troubled thereat, concluding
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57376:47"/>
that he had by this means put an end to
all his Conviction, and banished the
thoughts of his Pilgrimage to <hi>Celestial
Paradise,</hi> fearing lest being thus Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
into the Labyrinth whereof I told
you before, he should be Eternally lost
therein, without being ever able to find the
way out, or free himself from the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies
and perplexities thereof; and that
which increased my fear, and confirmed
me the more strongly in my Opinion, that
there was a final period put to all further
proceedings in his intended Pilgrimage,
was the seeing of him after he had dallied
and sported sometime with this lately ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
but now reconciled Darling, turn
again to his former Company, and dance
with them as eagerly as ever about the
bottomless Pit, only with somewhat more
Caution than formerly; this made me
think of what I had formerly read in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ, which says of some Persons, <hi>that
their goodness is like the early Dew which
quickly passes away:</hi> I could not chuse like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
but observe, that how strong soever
Convictions are, if the Heart be not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and throughly changed, and the Will
subjected to, and melted into the Divine
Will, our Sense of Sin, and our dread
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57376:47"/>
of Danger will by little and little wear
off, and we shall become as vain and as
loose as ever: Now you must know that
this alteration opened the Mouth of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and made him Roar again, and
Thunder more loud than ever, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceing
the Judgments of the Eternal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him now as an Apostate; telling
him, that it had been far better for him
never to have known the Ways of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
than thus basely and shamefully
to turn out of them again to the Ways of
Sin and Wickedness; all which he had
learnt to Answer, by acknowledging the
truth of what Mr. <hi>Conscience</hi> said, and
crying, I wish it were better, and I would
I could do otherwise, if I were to begin
again I would be more careful, and watch
more against the Devices of the Prince
of <hi>Darkness,</hi> that so I might not be thus
easily betray'd by him into his Snares and
Gins; but alas, now it is too late, and
having been deluded thus far out of the
way, I may as well venture over Shoes over
Boots; it is now too late to return, I
would to God it were not so. Nay, <hi>said</hi>
Conscience, now you talk very foolishly,
for the farther you have gone from your
Happiness, more haste you ought to make
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57376:48"/>
your return towards it, and the more you
have offended that Divine Goodness which
hath condescended so far, and stooped so
low as to offer you terms of Mercy and
Pardon, Reconciliation and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
the more speed you should make
to Confess and acknowledge the same, and
the more Hearty should you be in your
lamenting and mourning over it; and
when you have so done, then you must
turn to him, who never, never, never
changes, and whose Love is like himself,
an unchangeable and an unalterable Love.
Oh that I could do so, <hi>said he,</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
I have now multiply'd my iniquities
against him, and my Sins are increased
as the Stars of Heaven, or the Sands on
the Sea Shore. What though they be,
said one, whose Name to the best of my
Remembrance was <hi>Hope,</hi> who now began
to speak, and of whom I had taken no
notice till now, they are not too great
for Almighty Power to conquer, nor yet
too many for Divine goodness to forgive,
he hath Strength enough to subdue all
your Corruptions, and Mercy enough to
Pardon all your Crimes; your Sins are
great indeed, but his Mercies are greater,
for they are Infinite; your Sins are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57376:48"/>
and increased to a great number, but
his Mercies are more, for they are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless;
the cry of thy Sins are reached
up to Heaven, but his Mercies are above
the Heavens; now therefore take courage
and adventure to cast thy self at his Feet,
and lie at his Mercy, and do as the Church
we Read of in Divine Story did, cry after
him, <hi>my Father, my Father,</hi> the hope of
his Youth. Oh, <hi>said he,</hi> this is good
Council, and I would to God I could do
according to it, but I cannot, Oh I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it. Nay then, <hi>said</hi> Conscience, I
denounce thee to be a Wicked and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
Wretch, Cursed in time, and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Eternity, for the great Lawgiver,
whose Vicegerent I am, hath declared in
the Records of his Law, that <hi>whosoever
continues not in every thing that is written
in the Book of the Law to do them, is accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
and I who being a Witness of, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Recorded all thy Wicked and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Actions, am impowered with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from him to pass Judgment upon
thee, do declare that thou hast not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in all things that are written in the
Book of the Law to do them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art the Man which the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Judge of Heaven and Earth hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57376:49"/>
Accursed; nay, if it be possible,
thou art more than Accursed; for first,
thou hast not only, not continued in all
things written in the Book of the Law
to do them, but thou hast continued in
nothing that is written in the Book of the
Law to do it; there is not one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the whole Book of the Law, but
what thou hast violated and broken; thou
hast wickedly and wilfully acted contrary
to all its Rules, and Rebelled against eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Precept contained therein. And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
thou hast not only done all this,
but when the Offenced Majesty of Heaven
and Earth, had out of the good Pleasure
of his Will Graciously provided a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in the Person of the Redeemer, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that he should by his Infinite Merits
make a full satisfaction to Divine Justice
for the wrong which thou hadst done,
and which was so great, that you as a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Creature were not able to satisfie,
any otherwise than by suffering the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of Eternal Fire, and that you
should moreover upon your accepting of,
and imbraceing this offered Redeemer,
become reconciled to him, and injoy all
the Felicity and Glories of Heaven, you
disdainfully scorned and slighted them,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57376:49"/>
rejecting the Council of God against thy
self; now therefore, if those who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ignorant of this Saviour, and by
reason of their living in Heathenish or
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Regions have never received
the offer of a Blessed Redeemer, are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and must suffer the Sentence of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Damnation: How much sorer Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
think you, will you be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, who have spurned against the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bowels of Mercy, trampled under
Foot the Offers of Pardon, and spit in
the very Face of a Tender and Compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Saviour. Ah, Sir, <hi>said he,</hi> all that
you have said I acknowledge to be true,
and it all helps still to aggravate my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
and heighten my Offence, and makes
my Crimes too great to be Pardoned.
But, pray Sir, <hi>said Mr. Hope,</hi> let me
prevail with you to cast your self on the
Merits of our Saviour, and lye at the
Fountain of Mercy. In the Condition
wherein you now are, you must of necessity
be for ever Miserable, you can be no more
if we suppose the worst, that you should
not be accepted; Oh therefore resolve,
that if thou must Perish thou wilt Perish
at the Fountain of free Grace, and if
thou must be cast away, tell him whose
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57376:50"/>
goodness is as large as his power, and
knows no other limits than his own Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency,
that thou art resolved it shall
be upon the very Shore of that Ocean
which is so full of Mercy, that its Depth
is unfathomable, and its Breadth unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable;
and let me tell thee for thy fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incouragement, that although thou
canst hear nothing from the Eternal now,
but <hi>Vengeance is mine and I will repay it, saith
the Lord; I will tear you in pieces, and there
shall be none to deliver; there is no Peace to the
Wicked, saith my God; and although the Sinner
live to be an hundred years old, he shall be
accursed; so are the Paths of all them who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God, and the hope of the Hypocrite shall
perish;</hi> yet if you will fly to the City of
<hi>Refuge,</hi> and get the Son of the Blessed to
Interceede for thee; thou wilt then find
him speaking to thee in another kind of
Dialect, and he will tell thee that he was
indeed angry with thee, but his Anger
is now appeased; he was thine Enemy,
but he is now become thy everlasting
Friend; his Hatred, and his Vengeance,
his Justice and his Fury was to have been
thy Portion, but now his Goodness and
his Love shall be thine Eternal Inheritance,
you shall be an Instrument of my Honour
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57376:50"/>
in this World, and I will make thee a
Vessel of Glory in the other; I will Bless
you with my special presence in thy Soul,
and that shall both fit and prepare thee
for, and be an assurance and earnest of
the injoyment of my immediate Presence
in Heaven, I will teach thee so to order
thy Conversation aright, that at the end
of it I may shew thee my Salvation; the
fulness of my Son, and the Alsufficiency
of my self, shall be an inexhaustible and
overflowing Fountain to thee. Now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee
tell me, <hi>continued he,</hi> is not all this
worth the adventuring for? Yes, <hi>reply'd
he,</hi> it is, and Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I could follow your
Advice, but there are so many Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
that I cannot adventure. No,
<hi>said</hi> Conscience, then I tell thee that thou
art the most hardned and impenitent
wretch that ever I met with in my whole
life; I tell you your danger; Mr. <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
hath informed you how to prevent
it, and here is your good Friend Mr. <hi>Hope,</hi>
gives you all the incouragement that can
possibly be expected or desired to make
tryal of his Advice: Pray let me have
your Answer what you do intend to do in
this Case, for I must not, nor will not be
thus put off with delays any longer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57376:51"/>
and rouse up thy self, thou hast been
often complaining of, and lamenting thy
Base, Vain, and Earthly Heart, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
Exclaimed against thy Sloathful,
Lingering, Careless, and Delaying Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
hast often been wishing that things
were, and hoping that they would one
day be better with thee, promising thy
self that it will not be always thus with
thee, but that thou shalt some time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
get rid of thy intanglements, and go
thy Pilgrimage; but Oh, what if thou
shouldest after all this wishing, and would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hoping, and expecting it to be
better with thee, let things run on thus
from Day to Day, and so from one Year
to another, until thou art surprized by
the King of Terrors, and be by him hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away before ever thou art come to a
point, or made any resolution what to
resolve on, or hast gotten thy Heart to a
through, and a saving closing with the
Redeemer; Oh now consider what will
become of thee if the Case should be so
with thee; dost thou think that thy Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
or Silver Key will open the Gates of
Heaven, and shut the Gates of Hell to
thee, or purchase thee an Inheritance in
the Promised Land; or canst thou be so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57376:51"/>
Vain and so Foolish as to imagine that
the remembrance of thy ease, thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or thy plenty here, will alleviate thy
Pain, or procure thee any kind or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ease in thy Eternal Dolours, or
yield any Comfortable or Refreshing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
to thy miserable Soul when it lies
<hi>Broiling</hi> upon the Hot and Scorching
Coals of Divine Fury, and <hi>Frying in the
Burning Flame.</hi> Thou art by this shuffle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and procrastinating Guilty of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Madness and Folly, and art so Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesly
cruel to thy self, that the very
Angels blush at thee, and are ashamed of
thy Brutishness, and even the Heavens
and the Earth are Amazed, and all the
Creatures stand Astonished at it. This
Discourse made him Tremble exceedingly,
and very much revived his Convictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and he solemnly promised Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that he would now resolve to go on
Pilgrimage, and promised to begin his
Journey on the Morrow, protesting that
he did really intend to do as he said,
wherewith <hi>Conscience</hi> being satisfied held
his Peace for that time. I looked still
when Mr. <hi>Affection</hi> should have appeared,
and have Contributed something towards
so good a Work, since he had formerly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57376:52"/>
been so much for, and promised such
large Assistance in the performing the
Pilgrimage to <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inquiring into it, I found he was
wholly taken off, and diverted by the late
Reconciled Companion, and so fallen in
Love, and taken up with him, that he
had not time or leisure to look towards,
or so much as think of <hi>Paradise,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, as soon as he saw <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
and the Man was parted, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stept to him, and indeavoured to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from it, telling him what new
Delights and Sweetness their Friend <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
had found out in other Objects, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in that which you wot of, <hi>said he,</hi>
to which I perceive you are by his means,
together with some little Assistances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
towards it by my self and Mr.
<hi>Heart,</hi> almost wholly reconciled again.
And <hi>Phansie</hi> being by, seconded him, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
and Guilding things over with
such Artificial Glosses and Smooth Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of Delight and Advantage, that
the poor Man, was absolutely bewitched
and Inchanted thereby, so that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
forgot all the Terrors of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and all the Solemn Promises and
Protestations he had made but just before
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57376:52"/>
of beginning his Pilgrimage the next Day,
which made me think of what I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
read in <hi>Drexelius</hi> his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of Eternity.</p>
            <l>I will to morrow, that I will,</l>
            <l>I will be sure to do it;</l>
            <l>To morrow comes, to morrow goes,</l>
            <l>And still thou art to do it;</l>
            <l>And thus Repentance is deferr'd</l>
            <l>From one day to another,</l>
            <l>Until the day of Death doth come,</l>
            <l>And Judgment is the other.</l>
            <p>But yet the free Grace and Goodness
of him whose Name is <hi>I am,</hi> whose Love
is unchangeable, and Mercy so unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that it is past finding out, and who
doth whatsoever he pleases, being moved
and inclined to do all that he doth, only by
the Dictates of his own Counsel, and the
good pleasure of his Will, would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to be so with this Man; resolving,
as I did perceive, that the Prince of
<hi>Darkness</hi> should not make a Prey of him,
nor would he permit him to erect Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of Honour and Triumph to himself
upon this Mans Overthrow and Ruine;
notwithstanding the poor wretch himself
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57376:53"/>
was freely willing to be a Slave and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
with quiet, rather than be a King with
some little hazard and danger, in the
Way through which he must pass to his
Coronation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he sent <hi>Boanerges</hi> to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Commanding him to Preach ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lecture about the danger and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of his Condition, and to denounce
Judgment against him, if he did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
Repent, and fly to the City of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:</hi>
Having received this Command, he
presently obeyed, and thus he began;</p>
            <p>Thou Wicked, Vile, and Miserable
Wretch, <hi>said he,</hi> that hast been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
as to slight and refuse the Offers
of Mercy and Pardon, and hast like an
hardened wretch, made the Son of the
Blessed, whose Countenance is White and
Ruddy, and his Person altogether Lovely,
being the chiefest of ten thousands; and in
point of Excellency, infinitely beyond
Comparison, stand knocking at thy Door,
Intreating, Perswading, and Wooing thee
for admittance into thy Heart, and a Grant
of thy Love, until his Head was wet with
the Dew, and his Locks with the Drops
of the Night: The Prince of Peace will
shortly therefore appear against thee as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57376:53"/>
a Rageing and a Devouring Lion, and shall
come from Heaven with his Mighty Angels
in Flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on
thee, because thou knowest not God, nor
wilt yield Obedience to the Gospel, and
shall punish thee with an everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from the presence of the Lord,
and from the Glory of his Power; and
Oh, how amazing and cuttingly will the
very first appearance of the Son af Mans
coming in the Clouds with Power and
great Glory, strike into thy Guilty and
Self Condemned Heart, then thou wilt
begin with inexpressible Grief and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit to sigh and say within thy
self. Oh that strong and Terrible Judge
whom I now see sitting down upon yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Flaming, White, and Glorious
Throne, accompanied with all the Blessed
Inhabitants, and Shining Courtiers of
Heaven, is that same Blessed Redeemer,
and Mighty God, the Prince of Peace,
that sweetest Lamb, who did most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
power out his most precious Blood
like Water for me, that I might thereby
have been Washed, and Cleansed, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and Saved; and he it was, who so
fairly and frequently Invited and Wooed
me with the most Powerful and Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57376:54"/>
Arguments, and Tearms of Dearest
Love, but only to abandon my Lust,
and bid Adieu to the Prince of <hi>Darkness,</hi>
who was my implacable Enemy, and then
sought, and hath now together with my
own wilfulness accomplished my utter Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;
promising that if I would give my
Consent, he, even he, would become my
Alsufficient and Everlasting Husband, and
if I had then accepted it, he would
now at this very time have placed an
Immortal and Splendid Crown of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bliss and Matchless Glory upon my
Head with his own Almighty Hand: But
wo, and alas, I like a wilful, foolish, and
desperate wretch neglected this great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
forsook my own Mercy, and so
judged my self unworthy of Eternal Life,
and like a Cruel and Bloody Butcher to
my own Soul, I have Inhumanly Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Destroyed my self; and therefore
happy were I now, if I could Intreat
some Rock to fall on me, or perswade
some vast and mighty Mountain to cover
me, under the Ruines whereof I might
lie everlastingly hid from the Face of
him that sits on the Throne, and from
the Wrath of the Lamb; Oh that I might
now be turned into the Meanest, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57376:54"/>
Basest, and most Despicable Beast, might
be changed into a Bird, a Stone, or a
Tree, or any other thing how Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
soever: Oh that I might by all
my Supplications and Tears obtain the
favour only to Evaporate into Air, or
be quite Annihilated, and put into the
same state wherein I was before ever I
had any Being; I should now account my
self Blessed and Happy that ever I was
Born, if I could now be unborn; Ah that
my Soul might now become Mortal, that I
might die in Hell, and not welter Eternally
in those Fiery Torments to which I am
now to be Damned by a Just, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
and an Irreversible Sentence;
which Torments are too excessive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
that I am not able to abide them,
and yet so certain and infallible, that there
is no possibility for me to avoid them: I
might indeed in the Day of my Gracious
Visitation have escaped them, but now I
must lie down in Sorrow, and Eat the
Fruit of my own doings; But all thy
Lamentings and Complainings, thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
and Mourning thy self, nor all
thy Supplications and Tears, thy Crys,
nor thy Prayers will then avail thee any
thing; thy Punishment shall then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57376:55"/>
to thy Crime now; thou now
refusest to hear the Charming Invitations,
and the Melting Intreaties of the Blessed
Jesus, and then he will refuse to hear
thine; thou now hardenest thy Heart
against him, he will then harden his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee; thou art now deaf to the
Calls of the Gospel, and the Offers of
Grace and Salvation, for which the very
Rocks thou callest on, and the Mountains
whose help and assistance thou vainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
to fall on thee, and hide thee from
the dreadful Face of the Judge, and the
Penetration of his Fierce and Terrible
Eyes, shall then tacitely flout and upbraid
thee for thy folly and madness therein, by
standing deaf to all thy Complaints, and
letting thee Beg, Intreat, and Implore
their help in vain and to no purpose, and
after all thy reluctancy and unwillingness
thou shalt be compelled to stand before
the Flaming Judgment Seat, and then,
and there at that most impartial, strictest,
and last Tribunal give an exact account
of every Act of thy Life and Word of thy
Mouth, every thought of thy Heart and
glance of thy Eye, and all the Brutish and
Impure Abominations of thy Filthy Heart,
all thy Secret Sins and Closet Villanies,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57376:55"/>
which no Eye ever saw, but that which is
ten thousand times brighter than the Sun,
shall then be disclosed and laid open to
the view of all the innumerable Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Heaven, Earth, and Hell, to thy
unspeakable and everlasting shame; thou
knowest thy self to be secretly Guilty
of many hateful and abhorred Crimes,
which thou wouldest not should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
for the whole World, or known
to any but thy self, or it may be to two
or three of those filthy and prophane
Wretches, who are thy accursed Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Partners therein; but assure thy
self, that at that Day all shall be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and thou shalt be display'd and laid
out in thy Colours in the Face of Heaven
and Earth to thine Eternal Confusion.
In what a woful case thinkest thou will
thy heavy Heart then be, what amazing
Terrors and desperate Rage and Despair
will then tear and rend it, if it were
possible, into ten thousand pieces? Ah,
how will thy Spirits Faint, and thy Heart
Sink within thee? How will thy Flesh
tremble, and thy Head shake, when thou
shalt hear the unalterable and irreversible
Sentence pronounced upon thee; <hi>depart
ye Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57376:56"/>
the Devil and his Angels;</hi> every Word
whereof breathes out Fire and Brimstone,
Vengeance, and Misery, and every Silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bites deeper, and terrifies more than
ten thousand Scorpions Stings. The very
departing from the Glorious Presence of
him who is Life it self, were Hell enough;
but thou shalt go with a Curse, and not
only so, but thou must go into Fire, and
that Fire must be Eternal and Everlasting
too, fed continually with infinite Rivers
of Brimstone, and kept in perpetual
Flame and Fierceness by the unquenchable
Wrath of the justly Inraged God to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>And if the very Pronouncing this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be so amazing and dreadful; Oh,
how will thine Heart-strings crack, and
thine Eyes burst with Tears, when thou
shalt behold this killing Sentence, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into Execution, and seest the Devils
Actually laying Hands on thee, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee from the presence of the Judge
into that Infernal Prison which is to be
thine Eternal abode, and where all thy
Imployments shall be weeping and wailing
and gnashing of Teeth!</p>
            <p>Now I could perceive that this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
startled and terrified him more
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57376:56"/>
than any he had formerly heard, and that
which helped to increase it, was his fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he felt the Ground sink, and
the Earth whereon he stood fall from
under him, when turning hastily to see
what the Matter was, he thought he saw
the Bottomless Pit opening and extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self to receive and swallow him
up; with the fright and amazement
whereof he suddenly gave a very great
start and ran for his Life, and as he ran,
he looked often behind him, as if he
apprehended himself still in danger, and
was afraid the Hand of Justice was pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to throw him down in that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
place, but being got a pretty way
from the place, he made a stand, and
looking back to see and admire the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the danger he had escaped, and
adore that Divine Goodness which had
sent him so many Warnings of Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to flee from it. And now he began
to consider with himself what he should
do, and whither he should repair for safety.
The City of <hi>Refuge,</hi> to which he had been
directed, he saw lay up the Hill of <hi>Self-denial,</hi>
a Hill very hard and difficult to
be climbed up to, and seeing there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Refuges nearer at hand, and easier
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57376:57"/>
to come at, and with all as much or more
frequented than the other, <hi>viz.</hi> The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Confession, Prayer, Amendment of
Life, Holy Duties and Ordinances,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
more which are all Situated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
he presently fled thither, and took
Sanctuary in them, but notwithstanding
innumerable others whom he had found
there, were altogether in Peace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a perfect quietness in their Spirits,
being absolutely free from any fears or
apprehensions of the Burning Lake, yet
he could find no such safety and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as others fancied they did, and he
expected he should have found there;
but they all cried out to him, Salvation
is not in us, nor is Peace with God, or
safety from his Wrath and Indignation
within our borders, and therefore unless
you intend go through a by way to <hi>Tophet,</hi>
and Perish as certainly as if you had never
set a step, or moved a foot towards Paradise,
look beyond us, and flee to the only
Refuge that can secure you from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger
of Blood, who is still in pursuit
of thee, and will certainly and suddenly
overtake thee if thou stayest here; Oh
therefore be advised before he lay hold
of thee, and Sheath the Sword of Justice
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57376:57"/>
thy Bowels. You may well imagine that
the hearing those terrible, unpleasing,
and unexpected Lectures, where he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find nothing but Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
and a perpetual safety from that
Desolation and Wo which he found
himself notwithstanding still subject to,
and was threatned and denounced against
him with as much terror and fiereeness as
ever, filled his very Soul with trouble
and grief, and almost overwhelmed his
Spirits with sorrow; the Arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
stuck fast within him, and the
Poison thereof had almost drank up his
Spirits, all which brought him into such
inconceivable and inexpressible perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that I can far better conceive of
them my self, than I can relate them to
you; the truth is, the poor Man knew
not what to do, being almost at his Wits
Ends, and upon the very Brink and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Despair; whereupon I saw him
rouse himself, and fall more roundly to
Work, with Prayer and fasting, keeping
the Sabbath, and hearing of Sermons, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
of Lectures and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and like the Marriners in a
Storm, and ready to Perish, he cast away
and abandoned many of those things
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57376:58"/>
which hitherto had been pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
but now he found them to be
burdensome and dangerous to him: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all which, no Peace, Comfort,
or Consolation could he obtain; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he followed hard after them, they
fled so fast from him, that he could not
possibly overtake them; whereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to expostulate with himself after this
manner: Unhappy Man that I am, while I
remained in my Course of Sin and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I could not be at quiet for <hi>Conscience,</hi>
who harrased me continually to leave my
danceing about the Pit, which was as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
(and as I am apt to believe) Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless,
and now I have complyed with his
Advice, I cannot as yet obtain any Peace
in my Soul; what can possibly be the
reason or occasion thereof? I wish I have
not mistaken the Way which I was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take, and am got into some other Path
which leads not to <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> but
to some other place, but I certainly think
it cannot be so, for I remember that I
have always been told by those who have
been well acquainted with the Way, and
are appointed by the King of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to be Guides to those who Travel
thither, that Praying, Hearing the Word,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57376:58"/>
and other such like Holy Exercises where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I now Employ my self, lead directly
towards Paradise, and yet my Heart mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
me that this cannot be the Way,
because I remember also that they used
to describe the Ways of Paradise to be
Ways of Pleasantness, and all the Paths
therein to be Paths of Peace; But to the
trouble and disquiet of my Soul I can find
no such thing by those ways wherein I now
am: And then directing himself to the
Eternal, <hi>he said,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thine Anger, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chasten me in thy hot displeasure, for
thine Arrows stick fast in me, and thy Hand
presseth me sore; there is no soundness in my
Flesh, because of thine Anger, neither is
there any rest in my Bones because of my Sin,
for thou hast brought all mine Iniquities upon
my Head as a heavy burden, they are too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
for me to bear; my Wounds stink and are
corrupt because of my Foolishness, I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
I am bowed down greatly, I go Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the day long, my Loins are filled with
a loathsome Disease, and there is no sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in my Flesh; I am feeble and sore broken,
I have roared by reason of the disquietness of
my Soul; but thou, O Lord, knowest all my
desires, and my groanings are not hid from
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57376:59"/>
thee; my Heart panteth, and my Strength
faileth me, as for the light of my Eyes also,
it is gone from me, I am ready to halt, and
my sorrow is ever before me, wherefore I will
declare my Iniquities and be sorry for my Sin,
and I will hope in thy Mercy, O Lord; the
sorrows of Hell hath compassed me about,
and the floods of desolation make me afraid;
the sorrows of Hell hath invironed me, and
the snares of Death prevented me; but in my
distress I will call upon thee, O Lord, and
cry unto thee, O God, thou God of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to whom alone is all my desire, and in
whom alone is all my relief and succour; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me, O God, my strength, guide me
into the way of Holiness, and lead me into the
Path wherein thou wouldest have me to walk:
I am feeble, do thou uphold me; my Feet are
ready to slip, but do thou establish me; for
thou, O Lord, art my Rock upon which I
lean and stay my self, thou art my Strength
and my Redeemer: I am, O Lord, like a
weaned Child, aukward and unskilful to tread
in these Paths which are altogether new and
unusual to me, but do thou graciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
according to thy promise, to lead me
by the Hand, and teach me to go; Oh leave
me not until thou hast conducted me into the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57376:59"/>
way of Life, which leads to the Heavenly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise:
and lest there should be any thing
in me that may peradventure occasion my fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
short of that blessed place, do thou enter
into me, and search my Heart, and try my
Reins, O God, and if thou findest any evil
way in me, purge it away with the Blood of thy
Son, and guide me into the way everlasting.</hi>
After this, I saw that he was somewhat
more chearful than before, but it lasted
not long, for as he afterwards told one
of his Friends in my hearing, he had
something within him which continually
cry'd unto him, Away Man and flee for
thy life, for thou art not yet safe from
the Avenger, who is yet in pursuit after
thee, and if thou escape not quickly, he
will certainly lay hold on thee, and thou
shalt Perish as surely and much more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
than if thou hadst never made any
one step towards an escape; which did
terrifie him exceedingly, and made him
rore out, and cry for help to him, who
has stiled himself the God of help, and
promised to be a present help in time of
trouble, saying, <hi>In the day of trouble call
upon me and I will deliver thee, so shalt thou
glorifie me: Cast thy Burden upon the Lord,
and he shall sustain thee; commit thy way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57376:60"/>
to the Lord, and he shall direct thy Paths:
Trust thou in him, and rely on him only,
and he also will bring it to pass.</hi> Here
<hi>Conscience</hi> interrupted him somewhat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly,
and said, I cannot but wonder
at thy desperate madness and folly, in
that thou still abusest the Divine Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and by continuing in thy Obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
darest the Almighty to do his worst,
fancying to thy self, that thou hast by
thy Repentings and thy Tears, thy Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and thy Prayers, and a little forced
partial and imperfect amendment, stopped
all his proceedings against thee, and so
tied up his Hands, that he cannot hurt
thee, when, alas! thou art still in the High
Way to ruine; thou now endeavourest
to set thy self to keep the Law, but I
must still pronounce thee Accursed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou continuest not in all things
written in the Book of the Law to do
them, nor indeed art thou able to do so;
but admit thou wert, yet that will not
make satisfaction to Justice for the wrong
thou hast already done it, the keeping the
Law now, will not compensate, or atone
for thy former Breaches of it; nor must
thou expect to put God off with good
Words, or fair Promises, plausible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57376:60"/>
and faint Resolutions; nor will
he admit that thou shouldest have any
other Saviour than his Son, nor that thou
joyn any thing with him, for he will have
the whole Honour of saving thee, or
else he will leave thee still to Perish in
thy Sins. At this I could perceive him
to be exceedingly troubled and terrified,
which was much increased by his espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Avenger Marching against him,
Cloathed with Vengeance, and Armed
with Fury, Brandishing a Flaming Sword
in his Al-conquering Hand; wherefore he
fuddenly cried out to Heaven for help,
looking every way, as if he would run,
but knew not whither, for he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
no place which promised him more
security than that wherein he then was,
and seeing the Avenger was then almost
got up to him, and ready to lay hold of
him, he fainted and even despaired of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping;
but just as he was in the very
depth of extreamest danger, I looked to
see what would become of the poor
thing, and loe suddenly one stept to him,
and with a brisk and cheerful Voice, cried
to him, Oh Sir, why ly you here and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
within view of the remedy, you have
but a little way further to the City of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57376:61"/>
               <hi>Refuge,</hi> where the Son of the Blessed
stands waiting for you, and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, if you will but go to him.
This welcome and unexpected Message in
the very Minute of the lowest extremity
strangely revived his desponding Soul,
and made so great and sudden an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in him, that I can compare it to
nothing so well as to the Prophets Vision
of dry Bones, for as one dead he revived,
and his Spirits came into him again;
when looking up upon him, he cried,
Sir, that which you say hath a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
my Spirits, and I find a strange
kind of sweetness and delight therein,
but pray whereabouts stands this City of
<hi>Refuge</hi> which you spake of, I have heard
much of it, and have been advised to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
thither, as the only place where I
could be safe; and to tell you the truth, I
did think I had been got into it; and
although Mr. <hi>Conscience</hi> and several others
indeavoured to convince me of it, yet I
could not be perswaded; but now I see
by woful experience, that I am more
than a Mile short of it, and in as much
danger of Perishing as before I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Why, <hi>said the Gentleman,</hi> it stands
a little further there right before you in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57376:61"/>
that middle Path between that wherein
you now are, and that from which you
lately came; whereupon he looked that
Way with great eagerness, but could
not discover it. I have, <hi>said the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
a Box of Eye Salve which I received
from our Lord himself, wherewith if you
please I will Anoint your Eyes to make
you see the more clearly. Ah, with all
my Heart, Sir, <hi>said he;</hi> And when he
had so done, he bid him look towards
the place which he pointed to. Do you
not see, <hi>said he,</hi> a litle Narrow Ruged Path
that goes up there? Yes, <hi>said he,</hi> I can
see it now, although before I could not
discern it so well: Why that Path is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by divers Names, but they all signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the same thing; some call it by the
Name <hi>Repent and be Converted that your Sins
may be blotted out, when the times of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall come from the presence of the Lord;</hi>
others call it by the Name, <hi>Believe and
ye shall be saved;</hi> with many more, as,
<hi>Turn and Live; the way of Rigtheousness,</hi>
and <hi>the way of Peace; the Heavenly Path,</hi>
&amp;c. Now therefore do you look streight
through it, and you will see a very small
and narrow Gate, that Gate goes direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the City of <hi>Refuge;</hi> the Man could
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57376:62"/>
not see it at first, but having fixed his
Eyes very steadily, and looked earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for some time, he espied it, which I
could perceive by his Countenance, and
the Joy he discovered thereat, to be the
Pleasantest and most Blessed sight that
ever his Eyes saw; for there he beheld
the Glorious Sun of Righteousness begin
to arise upon him, with healing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Wings, discovering the Son of
the Blessed to stand there with extended
Arms and a smiling Countenance, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with Goodness and Love, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mercy and Pardon from his Divine
Lips, ready to receive and embrace him,
and calling to him, O poor Soul, who
art weary and heavy laden, come unto me
and I will give thee rest and ease; this
sight presently convinced him that he was
yet really far short of the City of <hi>Refuge,</hi>
cured him of all his unwillingness to go
further than those Mountains where he
then was, and effectually removed all that
aukwardness which was upon his Soul,
and set his feet at Liberty to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this place of safety: Upon which I
saw him presently throw away several of
those things he had about him, Gird up
his Loins, and run towards it, and being
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57376:62"/>
arrived there, attempted to enter, but
could not; for, by reason of the straitness
of the Gate, he could not possibly croud
in, by reason of many things he had yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him which never pass that Gate,
and are of such a Nature, that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who has any of them about him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter there, nor go through it to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise,</hi> neither is there any other
way to go to it than through that Gate:
He attempted to enter divers times, but
all in vain, until looking behind him, he
saw the Avenger just at his Heels, ready to
lay hold on him, and Sheath his destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sword in his Guilty Bowels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he gave a very great start, threw
off those things which impeded his getting
in at the Gate, striping himself of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Garments, which were all torn, ragged,
and defiled, so that they were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of covering the shame of his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and he appeared a very filthy and
loathsome kind of Creature whilst he had
them on; being thus stript, he entred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
into the Gate, striving with all
his might to go through it, and finding
much difficulty in the Passage, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who had shewn him the Gate,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57376:63"/>
whose Name I think was <hi>Faith,</hi> and was
a Stranger to the Man till that time when
he shewed him the Gate, and directed
him the Way to it, helpt him to lay hold
of a certain Post placed there on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
for the help and stay of all those
who pass the Gate; the Name of it is,
<hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise
cast out:</hi> And I saw as he passed through
the Gate, he received new Garments,
wherewith being arrayed he seemed like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Man, appearing much more Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Comely than before; But that
which appeared to me to be most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and strange, I beheld while his Heart
was taken out, and another which was a
new one put into him, which although
the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> supposed to have
been done before, when the Man first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think of forsaking his Service, and
turning out of the broad way, yet it was
not really changed and renovated until this
very Moment: The Old Heart which was
taken out of him was a perfect Stone, as
solid as a Rock, and as hard as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Milstone; But the New Heart, was
a Heart of Flesh, being tender, soft, and
pliable, and thereby fit to receive the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57376:63"/>
Sacred impressions of the Divine Will, and
made capable of receiving and retaining
the Image of our sweet Redeemer, which
I then saw the Eternal stamp upon it
with his own Almighty Hand. And I
saw him as soon as he was got through
the Gate, bow himself down to the Earth,
and Worship the Son of the Blessed, and
lying prostrate on the Ground before him,
he said as follows;</p>
            <p>Almighty and Eternal God; thou King
of Kings, and Prince of Peace, whose
Greatness and Power is Infinite; whose
Glory and Majesty is Incomprehensible;
whose Goodness and Mercy is unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
upon thy frequent and often reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
gracious Invitations to come unto thee,
and thereby be at once secured from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Ruine and Misery, and Intituled
to, and assured of Eternal Salvation and
Happiness, I am now come in according
to thy Command, and in the most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
manner imaginable, prostrating my
self before thy Footstool; I acknowledge
my self by Nature to be a most Wicked,
Filthy, Polluted, and Undone Wretch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born a Stranger, an Enemy, and a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to thee, and by that Original Guilt
which I contracted in the very Womb,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57376:64"/>
inclined to do Wickedly, and Sin against
thee, as naturally as Fire produces heat,
or the Sparks fly upwards; and that I
was therefore bound over by a most Just
(and otherwise than by thy Merits Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible)
Sentence, to Eternal Damnation,
and I found by woful experience, that I
as Naturally tended to, and as freely
moved towards the Burning Lake, as the
Stone doth towards its Center, having
moreover by my Wicked course and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
continued my Rebellions against
thee, and thereby rendred my self ten
thousand fold more the Child of Hell, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by rushing into Sinful Courses and
Working Wickedness with both Hands
greedily heaped up unto my self Wrath
against the Day of Wrath; and as if all
these Offences were not enough, I have
committed a far greater, by Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Remedy, and refusing tenders of
Grace and Mercy, Pardon and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which thou wert pleased to make me
preposterously resolving rather to be a
sordid Slave to my own Lusts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
a miserable Vassal to the Prince
of <hi>Darkness,</hi> an Heir of everlasting Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and an Eternal Companion for the
Damned, than admit to be made free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57376:64"/>
a Son of the Eternal, an Heir of
the Heavenly Glory, and an everlasting
Associate with an innumerable Company
of Angels and Glorified Saints, that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Assembly and Church of the First Born
which are written in Heaven, basely and
bitterly opposing thy Blessed Kingdom,
indeavouring to hinder the promoting
thy Interest, the Purity, Spirituallity,
and Holy Preciseness whereof I abhorred
and detested, as quite contrary to my Vile,
Base, Carnal Heart, and those Sensual
Pleasures and Worldy Contentments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which I had most desperately cast my
self, cruelly Persecuting all thy Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
and trampled under Foot the
Blood of the Covenant, which should have
Sanctified and Saved me: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all which, such is thy astonishing Grace
and Goodness, so unparallel'd thy Love,
that thou still declarest thy self willing to
become my Saviour and Redeemer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the Anger, and satisfie the Fury
of the Eternal against me, and reconcile
me to him, if I would but give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereunto; wherefore I call Heaven
and Earth to record, and conjure all the
Creatures therein to Witness this Day,
that I do here with all the Powers of my
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57376:65"/>
Heart give my full and free consent to
the same, accepting of thee as the only
New and Living way, whereby I can
possibly obtain access to the Father; and
upon the bended knees of my Soul, I do
here freely and willingly give up, and
joyn my self to thee in a Marriage Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Obligation whereof shall be
perpetually unalterable.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, O thou Anointed of the
Father; I now come to thee a Hungry, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
Thirsty Soul; a Poor, Wretched,
Miserable, Blind, and Naked Creature, a
most Filty, Loathsom, and Poluted Wretch,
a Guilty, and Condemned Traytor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the meanest Office in thine House,
and unworthy to wash the Feet of the
very lowest of thy Servants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Infinitely more unworthy and unfit
to be Solemnly Contracted, and Married
to the Majesty of Heaven and Earth: But
yet since such is thy unparallel'd Love,
and unmerited Goodness, that thou wilt
have it so, I do here with all possible
Veneration, and with the firm and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Resolution of my Heart, accept thee
to the utmost of my Power, freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to, and acquiescing in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Contrivance of Divine Wisdom to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57376:65"/>
save me by thy Righteousness and Merit,
and take thee for my Head and Husband,
my Hope and my Happiness, my Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and my Shield; and I do declare my
self freely content to take thee for better
for worse, for Richer and for Poorer; for
all times and Conditions whatsoever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
both in Prosperity and Adversity
to Love, Honour, and Obey thee before
all others, and that to the very Death:
I accept of, and Imbrace thee in all thine
Offices; I disown my own Merit, and
freely declare my self empty of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of worthiness, and do here avow thee
to be the Lord my Righteousness: I do
renounce my own Wisdom, and do here
take thee for my only Guide: I renounce
my own Will, and do here take thy Will
for my Law, and the only Rule of my
Faith and Life.</p>
            <p>And since I am perfectly satisfied, that
suffering is the way to Reigning, the Cross
the way to the Crown, and that I must
through manifold Tribulations inherit the
Kingdom; I do here oblige my self by
this Covenant to take my Lot as it falls,
and resolve by the Assistance of Divine
Grace to run all manner of hazzards with
thee, verily supposing and assuring my
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57376:66"/>
self, that neither Life nor Death, nor
any Afliction or trouble whatsoever, shall
ever be able to part between thee and
me.</p>
            <p>And because thou hast graciously given
me thy Holy Laws and the Commands of
thy Gospel as the Peaceful Way and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and Delightful Path, in and through
which, I must by thy Assistance walk to
thy kingdom; I do here willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my Neck to thy Yoke, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
all thy Laws to be Holy, Just, and
Good; I do Solemnly take them as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of my Happiness, and the
Rule of my Thoughts, my Words, and
my Actions; promising, that although
thou knowest, and I find by dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that my Flesh will Contradict
and Rebel, yet I will indeavour to order
my whole life according to thy direction
therein, and will not knowingly allow my
self in the neglect of any thing which is
my Duty.</p>
            <p>Only in regard, that through the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my Flesh I am subject to many fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
I humbly presume to protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee, that unallowed miscarriages,
contrary to the settled bent and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Heart, shall not annul this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57376:66"/>
which I am the more bold to assert,
because thou thy self hast promised and
assured me that it shall be so.</p>
            <p>And now my sweet Redeemer, thou
who penetratest into the Heart, and hast
all things open and naked before thee,
knowest that I make this Solemn Contract
of accepting and imbracing of thee, and
dedicating and giving up my self to thee
freely without hesitation, fully without
reservation, and sincerely without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
to the best of my knowledge; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
imploring, that if thou espiest any
kind of flaw or falshood herein, thou
wouldst discover it to me, and help me
to do it with more uprightness and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
            <p>And now, Glory, and Honour; Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and Praise be ascribed by my Soul,
to the great Creator and Conserver of all
things, whom I shall be bold from this Day
forward to look upon as my God and
Father, and shall account it my Happiness
as well as my Duty, that I may sweeten
my Pilgrimage through the Wilderness of
this World, by Contemplating the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Effects of thy Infinite Wisdom
and Love, in finding out such a way for
the recovery of undone Sinners: And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57376:67"/>
Glory be to thee, O thou Compassionate
and Indulgent Mediator, who hast loved
me, and washed me from my sins in thine
own Blood, and art now become my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and Redeemer: And Glory, Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Praise be given likewise unto thee,
O thou Eternal Spirit, who hast by thy
Powerful and Gracious Operations apply'd
to me the Precious Merits of my Sweet
Redeemer, and by the Finger of thine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power Effectually Changed and
Converted my Soul from the World to
God, from self to Christ, and from a
Course of Sin to the Practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>And now, O thou Infinite, Eternal,
and Alsufficient Jehovah, the Lord God
Omnipotent, Father, Son, and Spirit, who
art a Fountain of Mercy and Pardon, and
an Ocean of Goodness and Love: Thou
art now become my Covenant Friend, and
hast through thy wonderful Grace and
Goodness permitted me to become thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Servant, <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> And let the
Contract which I have this day made on
Earth, be Ratified by thee in Heaven.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had thus expressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
I saw him pluck a Paper out of his
Bosom, wherein I supposed the substance
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57376:67"/>
of what he had said was written, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
opened it, he spread it before the Son
of the Blessed, Subscribed his Name to it,
and then presented it as his Act and Deed
to him, who received it with such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
and Complacency, that plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the greatness of that delight he
took therein; and stretching forth his
Hand, he lifted him up from the Earth,
and imbraced him with the greatest love
and tenderness imaginable, spake Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
unto him, kist him, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to love him with an everlasting love,
which is better than life it self, assuring
him likewise that he would present him
before his Father without spot and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in love; and that he would send him
a perpetual supply of all things necessary
for his Pilgrimage, at the end whereof he
would receive him into the Eternal Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Bliss, and place a Crown of Glory
upon his Head: And as for your Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<hi>said he,</hi> who would not that I
should Reign over you, I will now slay
them before me: Now therefore Gird up
the Loins of thy Mind, watch and be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and hope to the end; run without
weariness, and walk without fainting; <hi>be
thou faithful to the death, and then I will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57376:68"/>
give thee a Crown of life;</hi> I will likewise
write your Name in the Book of Life;
and therefore tell me, <hi>said he,</hi> what is
your Name. Ah Lord, said the Man, my
Name is so bad, wretched, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that I am ashamed to tell it. I
would, <hi>said he,</hi> have you be ashamed of it,
and never own it more; but yet you must
tell it me, for I intend to change it, and
give you a New Name, a precious and an
honourable Name, for I will give you in
my House, and within my Walls a Place,
and a Name far better than that of Sons
and Daughters; I will give you an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Name which shall not be cut off.
Lord, <hi>said the Man,</hi> thou knowest that I
have always hitherto been known by the
Name of <hi>Reprobate.</hi> Its true, <hi>said he,</hi>
but thou shalt be called so no more, but
<hi>Believer</hi> shall be now thy Name, by which
Name I will enter thee in the Book of
Life: And I will give thee a White Stone
with this New Name inclosed in it,
which shall not be so legible and easy to
be read by any other Person as thy self,
who receivest it; and that thou mayest
have Life, and have it more abundantly,
thou shalt receive of my fulness, and
have Grace for Grace: I will give thee to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57376:68"/>
Eat of the Tree of Life which is in the
midst of the Paradise of God, whereby
thou shalt be put out of all possibility of
being hurt by the Second Death: I will
feed thee with the Food of Angels, and
give thee hidden Manna to eat; I will
shut the Door of Hell against thee, so
that no Man shall be able to open it, and
open the Gate of Heaven to thee, so that
no man shall be able to shut it against
thee; and when thou art cast out of the
Synagogue, by those who call themselves
<hi>Believers,</hi> and are not, and art by them
Excommunicated and delivered over to
the Prince of <hi>Darkness,</hi> with an express
Command to him to take thee, and
when he will not (or rather cannot, for
because I give unto you Eternal Life, you
shall never Perish, nor shall Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
Earth or Hell pluck you out of my
Hands; my Father which gave you to me
is greater than all, and no Man is able
to pluck you out of my Fathers Hand: <hi>I
and my Father are one;</hi> and as such we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves for thy Defence) then it
may be the Gaol shall; but if so, yet be
not dismayed, for I ingage to make that
and all things else to Work together for
thy good; and assure thy self, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57376:69"/>
those things may not at present
be pleasant but grievous, yet they shall
afterwards appear to have in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of them the peaceable Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
and if thou wilt take care to
keep the Word of my Patience, I also
will ingage to keep thee from the hour of
Temptation which shall come upon all
the World, to try them that dwell upon
the Earth, and when thou hast overcome,
I will make thee a Pillar in the Temple of
my God, and thou shalt go no more out,
and I will write upon thee the Name of
my God, and the Name of the City of my
God, which is, the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> that
cometh down out of Heaven from my
God, and I will write upon thee my New
Name; and I will Grant that thou shalt
sit down with me on my Throne, even as
I also overcame and am set down with my
Father on his Throne; in the mean time
I will be your Mediator to my Father,
and when the Accuser of the Brethren
shall bring any Accusation against you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Court of Heaven, I will be your
Advocate, I will appear for you, and
plead my Merits in Bar of any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he shall Imprecate against you for the
same. I am and will be your High Priest,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57376:69"/>
and as I have already offered up my self
to the Father as an Acceptable and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
Sacrifice for you, whereby I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
at once your Sacrifice and your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
whereon your Sacrifice was Offered,
so I will now perform the other part of
my High-Priesthood, and I will Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
for you to my Father, and my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
will be prevalent enough, and
sufficient for thee, and I will thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
thee whatsoever thy Heart desires,
for the Father can deny me nothing: In
fine, my Merit and my Fulness, and all
that I am and have, shall be thine; and
whatsoever I am to my self, that I will
be to thee. Now therefore be of good
Courage, go on thy Pilgrimage with an
Holy Resolution to be Faithful, and cleave
to the Lord with full purpose of Heart
all the Days of thy Life; thou wilt meet
indeed with abundance of Enemies, and
innumerable Discouragements; but fear
thou none of these things, for God shall
be thy Leader, and the strong God thy
Captain; he shall teach thy Hand to fight,
and thy Fingers to War; nay he shall
fight all thy Battels for thee, give thee
Victory over all thine Enemies, and make
thee more than a Conqueror overthe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57376:70"/>
of Darkness, and all the rest of thy
Adversaries, both within and without
thee. Wisdom it self shall be thy Guide,
Almighty Strength thy Support, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Goodness thy Reward at the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of thy Pilgrimage, when thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from me the end of thy Faith, the
Salvation of thy Soul.</p>
            <p>And then taking him by the Hand, he
led him to his Store-House, the Sacred
Armory, where he hath always in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
all kinds of Armor and Arms, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
Designed and fitted for the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Warfare; and from thence he furnished
him with a Sword, a Shield, a Helmet
a Brestplate, and Sandals, together
with a well contriv'd Engine of such
mighty force and efficacy, that with it he
afterwards did wonders, and so did some
of those who had formerly made use of
it, for they did by it shut and open Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Battered down the Walls of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Conquered their Conquerours, and
put their insulting and Victorious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to flight; for of such force and
prevalency it is, that in less than a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
it is able to bring into our assistance
so many Auxilliary Forces, as may be able
to defend us against, and inable us to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57376:70"/>
Conquer more than 10000 times 10000 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies;
which occasioned a certain Queen,
who was a Soveraign Princess, to say, that
she was more afraid of the Prayers of a
certain Pilgrim, who was her Subject,
than of many Regiments of Armed Men;
and yet this Engine, as mighty as it is, is
no bigger than a Man may carry always
about him, which is somewhat signified
by its Names, which as I was told, are
two, <hi>Pray always, and with all manner of
Prayer:</hi> I was told likewise, that those
who have it not are liable to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of danger and misery, and have not
any manner of defence against it; nay it
hath a Voice too, and imprecates Ruine
and Misery upon all those that have it
not, for I my self heard it often call out
to Heaven, saying, <hi>Lord pour out thy fury
upon the Heathen that know thee not, and the
Families who call not on thy Name.</hi> But
seeing that all those Pieces of Armour
were design'd for Front Pieces, and that
he received none for the defence of his
Back-parts, he humbly inquired the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thereof, and was told, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Nature of the War wherein you
are to ingage, is such, that you must
stand fast, fight manfully, and resist to the
very death and spilling your Blood, rather
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57376:71"/>
than yield or flee; and therefore bear it
always in your Thoughts, and let it be
written in your Memory, that if ever you
turn your Back, you thereby lay your self
open to be Mortally wounded by your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Adversary, having no Armor given
you to defend those parts. Then said he,
Lord, is there no Case wherein I may
turn my Back and flee? Yes, reply'd he
that is fairer than the Children of Men,
in some extraordinary Cases it will be
both your duty and your safety too, to flee;
as when the Sin you are tempted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
hath such a likeness to, interest in, and
Correspondency with your Flesh, and the
very Complexion of your Nature, that
the very standing to contend with it may
prove your overthrow, and the very yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fight only, lay a sure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for its obtaining the Victory; the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
wherewith thou intendest to wound it,
may stab thy self, and those very thoughts
and considerations wherewith thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to choak and strangle it, prove Cordials
to revive and strengthen it, adding more
Fewel to the Fire, and proving like Oyl
to increase those Flames which burn with
too much vehemency and violence already.
<hi>I say,</hi> in those cases you must flee, and you
have a Paragraph in the Sacred Statute-Book
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57376:71"/>
to Warrant your so doing, <hi>viz. flee
also youthful lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus Harnessed, the Son of the
Blessed, Blessed him, and sent him away;
and I saw him go forward in his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
with abundance of Chearfulness and
Agility; and as he walked in the Narrow
Way, he thus discoursed to himsef; Oh,
how Beautiful and Comely is my Beloved?
His Aspect was sweet, and his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was pleasant, he was arraied with
Flames of Love, and filled with Bowels
of Compassion; in his Right-Hand he had
plentious Redemption, and in his Left-Hand
multiplied Pardons: methinks I
could see his Sacred Brest swelled with
Mercy and Love, and by their pantings,
discovering themselves uneasy and even in
Pain until they were eased by the sucking
of my Hungry and my Thirsty Soul;
wherefore wonder, O my Soul, and all the
Powers within me, be ye amazed and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at the greatness of the thing, for the
Tabernacle of the most High is with me,
and he will dwell with me; he will be mine,
and I shall be his; I shall be his Son, and
he will be my Father; be astonished and
even ravished with wonder, O my Soul;
for the Infinite Breach which Sin had made
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57376:72"/>
between God and thee is now made up, the
difference Composed, and the Offender
received to Mercy; so that God and thee
are now reconciled, and have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Covenant of Peace, Heaven and Earth
having agreed upon the terms, struck their
Hands, and Sealed the Indenture: O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Conclusion! O Blessed Conjunction! If
the Stars should condescend to dwell with
the Dust, if Fire and Water could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
or the North and South Poles
be brought to meet and mutually imbrace
each other, this were much; but yet this
Agreement and Conjunction wherewith
thou art now Blest is much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and strange, for the terms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
were infinitely greater: Rejoyce
therefore, O ye Angels, and shout ye Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims;
and let all the glorious Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Celestial Mansions prepare
an Epithalamium, and stand ready with
the Marriage Song, for loe here is
a wonder of wonders, the great Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah
hath given himself to a Worm, and
the King of Kings hath Contracted a
Marriage with his hopeless, helpless Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Publickly acknowledging and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it before the whole World, freely
declaring that he is become one with me,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57376:72"/>
and I with him, and that he hath given
me the Fulness of Heaven for my Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Fatness of the Earth for
my Substance, having kept back nothing
from me.</p>
            <p>And now, O Lord, thou art that God,
and that <hi>I AM,</hi> and thy Words they are
truth it self; wherefore having made all
these Promises to thy Servant, so that
thou hast prevented my very wishes, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plust
my desires, and left me nothing
to ask at thy Hands but what thou hast
already freely granted and bequeathed to
me, and all that thou hast left me to do,
being to accept and imbrace thy kindness,
adventure my self upon thy Fidelity, and
trust my whole happiness both here and
hereafter upon these thy Promises, I
only request that the Word which thou
hast spoken concerning thy Servant thou
wouldest establish for ever, and do as thou
hast said, that so thy Name may be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
for ever, and the freeness of thy
Love in the choice of thy Servant be the
Matter of my Praise and Adoration
through the Days of Eternity.</p>
            <p>And now adieu vain World, and all the
empty and imaginary Pleasures of Sin,
I bid you all an Eternal farewel; nay, I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57376:73"/>
will now tread you under Foot, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon you as the basest Dross and
Dung; the vain Threats of an Insulting
World shall no longer terrify me, nor
shall thy salse and deceitful Promises any
more delude or flatter me to fall in Love
with a Strumpet, or Adore a Painted I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
to forsake the everlasting Spring,
the overflowing Fountain, and the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible
Ocean, to drink of thy impure
puddles, or attempt to satiate my Thirst
at thy broken and empty Cisterns: And
although the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> dress the
Harlot in all her Pomp and Bravery, and by
Painting and Patching her deformed Face,
make her appear to be a Beautiful and
Lovely Object, in hope thereby to allure me
to fall in love with her, and return to her
imbraces again; yet his pains therein shall
all be lost, and prove labour in vain, for I
bid thee defience, O thou incorrigible and
implacable Enemy of my Souls Salvation,
resolving in the Divine Strength, that all
thy Subtil Wiles, nor thy Tempting Baits
shall ever be able to prevail with me for
the changing my present choice, unless thou
art able (as I am sure thou art not) to
shew me such a Crown, and such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as the Almighty hath settled upon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57376:73"/>
me, or at least give me something which
may ballance the loss of an Infinite and
an Alsufficient God, who hath now given
himself to me; but I know you cannot do
that neither, and therefore take notice, that
I do from this Day forward, and for ever
Banish you, and all those filthy and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lusts and Pleasures which are thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
Companions and Attendants, out
of my Heart; get you gone, get you hence,
I will have no more to do with you, I
have enough in God, in Christ, and the
Promises, to fill and satisfie my Soul; these
have I lodged within my Heart, and there
is now no more Room for such Guests as
you are, nor shall you ever again be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a peaceable entrance within these
Doors.</p>
            <p>And thus I saw him go on rejoycing in
the Lord, and triumphing in the happiness
of his present Condition, continually
looking forwards and reaching forth his
Hand towards the mark of the prize of
the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,
fixing his Eye always upon the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was going, in the midst whereof
he saw the Son of the Blessed, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Darling and Glory of his Father, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
far above Angels and all Created
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57376:74"/>
Powers, and seated upon a Bright and
Glorious Throne, admirably framed of
Majesty and Mercy, Justice and Love;
and strongly supported by Almighty
Strength and Unchangeable Goodness, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
on his Sacred Head a Royal and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Crown, the Riches, Splendor, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whereof so far excceds all expression,
that I am no way able to relate it; nay the
Tongues of Angels would fail, and the
Pen of the most Dexterous and Florid
Scribe be nonplust, should they attempt
the Description thereof; and his Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Temples justly encircled and richly
bedecked with Wreathes of Victory and
Triumph; Angels, and Thrones, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minons
being Subjected to him, who is
the everlasting Heir of all things; and
Cloathed from Head to Foot with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of unapproachable Light; which
made him break forth into an Extasie of
Admiration and Joy. And I after heard
him, with his Hands and his Eyes lifted up
to Heaven, utter these and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
O my Soul, with how much
Shining Glory and Lustre dost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy Beloved Array'd? O how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
is the Beauty of his Face? How
Ravishing are the smiles of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57376:74"/>
and how attractive the Glances of
his Eyes? How delightful are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of his Love to thee, and the Kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his Rosey Lips affords thee a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that far excedeth even life it self.
And at other times, when he lay down
to Rest and Repose his weary Limbs, tired
with the difficulties and hardships of his
Journey, he would break out suddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heavenly and Ravishing descriptions
of the <hi>Celestial Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what raised Affections and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Love, would he say, do I review
thee, O thou City of God, thou Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
of Delight, and Region of Peace
and Tranquility. Joy and Happiness,
Glory and Honour, Beautify thy Palaces.
O, with what breathings and longings
of Soul after thee, do I now think of thee,
and of those Glorious Inhabitants who
dwell within thy Saphir Walls, and whose
Holy Feet trace thy Jasper Streets! O
how Glorious art thou, O <hi>Jerusalem!</hi> So
splendid is thy Brightness, an so redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
thy Glory, that Kings shall come
and lay down their Crowns before thee,
and account all their Pomp and Glory as
Dust in Comparison of thee.</p>
            <p>And still as he walked he would keep
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57376:75"/>
his Eyes so fixed upon the recompence of
Reward, that the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi>
with all his Wiles could not prevail with
him to cease viewing of it, nor perswade
him to turn out of the Way towards it:
whereat being exceedingly enraged, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed
the whole World with the News
thereof, telling them that they were like
to lose a Companion, and stirring them
up against him to Revenge his abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Company, and either bring
him back by fraud or force, or else make
his Pilgrimage as bitter and unpleasant to
him as possible. They presently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Counsel, and Earth and Hell uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together, listed themselves under
his Banner, and marching against the
poor Pilgrim, they Attaqued him all at
once, but all in vain, for he made such
resistance, and defended himself so well
with his Helmet and Shield, that they were
not able to stand before him, but fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place from whence they came,
and he went forward in his Pilgrimage,
and as he went, he Sang,
<q>
                  <l>All Glory, Honour, Laud, and Praise,</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Lord I'll yield;</l>
                  <l>For giving me against these Foes</l>
                  <l>The Honour of the Field.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57376:75"/>
But whilest he was thus rejoycing upon
the account of his Victory, they rallied
again, and returning upon him ere
he was aware, they Charged him with so
much Resolution and Fury, that they
wounded him in divers places, beat his
Sword out of his Hand, and so disabled
the Arm which managed the Shield, that
it became in a manner useless to him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that his Spirit began to flag, his
Heart fainted, and his hopes were just gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up the Ghost, and himself falling a
Victim to their Rage and Malice; when
suddenly calling to Mind the great things
which the Son of the Blessed had-told
him might be effected by the Engine he
delivered him, he presently roused up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as one inspired with New life, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to play it upon them, and as soon as
he began to play, I heard a Voice saying
to him, Pluck up thy Spirits Man and be of
good Courage, for more are they who are
with thee, than those which are against
thee, <hi>my Grace shall be sufficiont for thee,
and my strength shall be made perfect in thy
weakness:</hi> Whereupon I lifted up mine
Eyes, and lo I saw an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Horses and Chariots of Fire round
about him, and a whole Army on their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57376:76"/>
March from the Eternal to his rescue;
by whose Help and Assistance the Prince
of <hi>Darkness</hi> and all his Irreligious Rout
were put to flight, not one of them being
able to stand before him; which gave him
new occasion of Rejoycing and Singing
Praise to him by whose Assistance he was
now a Conquerour.</p>
            <l>O Lord, <hi>said he,</hi> thy Strength and Grace</l>
            <l>I ever will admire,</l>
            <l>For by thy sending me relief</l>
            <l>Thou'st taught me to aspire</l>
            <l>To love thee more, and strive to have</l>
            <l>Thine Image so imprest</l>
            <l>Vpon my Soul, that thou mayest dwell</l>
            <l>For ever in my Breast,</l>
            <l>Vntil at last thou shalt Conduct</l>
            <l>My Soul to <hi>Zion</hi> Hill,</l>
            <l>Where I for ever shall be free</l>
            <l>From all the Craft and Skill</l>
            <l>Of Earth and Hell, and all their Strength</l>
            <l>And Rage, wherewith they fain</l>
            <l>Would work my fall from God and Christ</l>
            <l>Into Eternal pain.</l>
            <l>Then there for ever I shall sit</l>
            <l>In safety from all those</l>
            <l>Who envy now my happiness,</l>
            <l>And do the same oppose;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:57376:76"/>
Yea, then my self I will imploy</l>
            <l>In nothing but to praise,</l>
            <l>Exalt and laud the Name of him</l>
            <l>Who doth me help always.</l>
            <p>Methoughts after this Victory he went
forward with more speed and swiftness
than before, and Travelled so fast, that
in a few hours he was got many Miles
from the Bottomless Pit towards his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
End. Now this way wherein he
walked lay exactly between two Walls,
which the <hi>Eternal</hi> had placed on each
side of it; the Name of that Wall on the
Right-hand, was called by the Name of
<hi>General Calling;</hi> and the other was named
<hi>Particular Calling,</hi> to teach Pilgrims, that
neither of them must be neglected by
them, and yet intimate to them, that
they ought always to give <hi>General Calling</hi>
the chief Place, and the upper Hand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they must not suffer it wholly to
justle out the other. In his Travels I
saw two Pilgrims overtake him, they
both set out after him, but having
gotten into the Way, not through the
Strait Gate, but through a certain
Gap which was in the Righ-hand Wall
near adjoyning to the Gate, and by that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57376:77"/>
means met with less sensible trouble and
opposition from the Prince of <hi>Darkness:</hi>
When they came up with <hi>Believer,</hi> they
saluted him, telling him they were glad to
find any Travellers in that Despised Road,
and hoped that since they were so happy
to meet in so pleasant a Path, they might
keep Company together, and be helpful
to each other in their Pilgrimage. <hi>Believer,</hi>
you may well imagine, was as glad as they
to find others travelling towards Paradise,
and was as well pleased likewise to have
Company thither, since Experience tells
Men, that it is not good for them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
wherefore being exceedingly pleas'd
with their Motion, especially to hear them
talk so sensibly of their Pilgrimage, he
answered them, he wished it might, and
hoped it would be as they desired, for <hi>said
he,</hi> if any of us after we have entred this
Path, and travelled so many Miles herein,
should look back and return again to the
Broad Way, we shall thereby not only
make our selves unfit for, and unworthy
of the <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> but likewise list
our selves in the number of those whom
the Son of the Eternal hath assured us
shall have greater Damnation. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, <hi>said one of them,</hi> and O that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57376:77"/>
it may be none of our cases, and that we
who have Walked together, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
together in the means of Grace
and the Sacred Ordinances of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
may not after all this be Eternally
separated, and whilst some of us shall be
received with Joy, and welcomed into
the Promised Land, others of us should
be for ever excluded out of it, and thrust
down into a Sea of Wrath. <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi>
said <hi>Believer:</hi> Then he inquired of them
of what Country they were: They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
they were born in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which lieth below this Hill, and at
the end of this Narrow Way wherein we
are now Travelling, it is called by some,
the <hi>Howling Wilderness,</hi> by others the <hi>Land
of Rebbels,</hi> the <hi>Bewitching World,</hi> the <hi>False
and Deceitful Paradise,</hi> &amp;c. A Country,
<hi>said he,</hi> which I know very well, I was born
in it my self: I dwelt in it many years,
and continued there untill Divine Fury
had overtaken me, torn me to Pieces, and
tumbled me down into the Bottomless
Pit, had not Everlasting Goodness warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me of my Danger, and put it into my
Heart to go on Pilgrimage as you see. And
pray my Good Friends, <hi>said he,</hi> how
came you to leave it? Why, to tell you
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57376:78"/>
the truth, answered they, as we were
Danceing about the Brink of the Pit, we
saw divers of our Companions fall in, and
moreover one <hi>Boanerges, said they,</hi> was sent
by the King of Kings, and was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him to denounce War against us, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
us, that unless we presently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
our Evil Courses and Repented, we
should all likewise Perish: Whereupon
we presently fled for our Lives into this
Way, and do resolve to go on Pilgrmage
to <hi>Celestial Paradise.</hi> Pray, <hi>said he,</hi> which
Way did you come into this Way? I hope
you will not be offended at my inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for I do assure you, it is in Love and
Tendernerss to your precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls that I make this Inquiry; for
if there be an Error in our Entrance into
the Way, it is very improbable we should
ever persevere therein, since there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common, than for those who
begin in Hypocrisie to end in Apostacy;
but admit that by reason of the prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of our fears of <hi>Tophet,</hi> and to pacifie
a Bawling, Chiding Conscience, we do
make a shift to keep drudging on to the
End of our Lives, yet, if then we are
not found to have entred through the
strait Gate into this Narrow Way, we
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57376:78"/>
shall for that Error in the beginning of our
Pilgrimage be denied entrance into the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Paradise;</hi> and that which is yet
much more dreadful (and therefore should
induce us to look back and inquire if
our beginning be right, and such as will
bear us out at the Tribunal of him whose
Eyes are infinitely brighter than the Sun,
and therefore able to penetrate into, and
look through all our Disguises and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences, so that there will be no
deceiving of him) if there be an Error
there, and by that means we run our Race
and do our Work amiss, we shall never be
permitted to return again to mend it; for
as the Tree falls so it must lie for ever,
without any possibility of removing or
exchanging its place. All this we know
to be true, <hi>reply'd they,</hi> and have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from one of the Disciples of our Lord,
that we ought to render a reason of our
Faith to every Man who shall make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the same, and therfore I am,
(and I hope my Brother too) so far from
being angry, that I return you Thanks,
and am ready to give you a satisfactory
account as far as I can. You must know
therefore, that being sore frightned by
<hi>Boanerges,</hi> we presently repaired this way,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57376:79"/>
easily ascended the little Hillock we
found a little below the Narrow Way, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of which we met with a
very strait Passage, through which with
some small difficulty we passed into this
Road. Having given him an account of
their Country, and the Reason why they
left it, and the Way whereby they came
out of it, he was indifferently well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that they were sincere and resolved
Pilgrims. Only, <hi>said he to himself,</hi> the
Eternal granted them an easier passage
than I found. But notwithstanding their
seeming willingness to render an account
how they got into the Way to Paradise,
yet they were really unwilling, were glad
when the Scrutiny was over, and all the
time they walked together, they found
one means or other to shuffle off all further
Discourse upon that point, for it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a little then, but more afterwards, that
although they fancied the place in the
Wall through which they came into that
Path was the Strait Gate which leadeth
into the way of Life, yet they had many
doubtings and misgivings of Heart, that
it was not; but however being unwilling
to be at the pains of going so far back,
and very desirous to appear at least to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57376:79"/>
other Pilgrims to be real Converts, and
to have entred in a Regular Way and
Manner into their Pilgrimage, they
thought it the best way to prevent as much
as possible its being too much inquired into.
As they went along the Road he asked
them what were their Names. My Name,
<hi>reply'd one of them,</hi> is, <hi>Desire to be Good,</hi> and
mine, <hi>said the other,</hi> is, <hi>Would be Happy.</hi>
Very well, <hi>said he,</hi> I wish you may both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
your Names and somewhat more.
And thus I saw them go forward talking
together until they came to a place where
there was a Passage through each Wall,
the one exactly opposite to the other, and
each of them lead into a path that lay
just without the Walls, and ran close by
them as far as they could see, and both
of them replenished with many though
different Pleasures, and yet not so much
different in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ives, as they vary in the
Tempets and Apprehensions of those who
walk therein. Now when they had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into those by-Paths, the two Pilgrims
declared their Opinions to be, that they
were made by the Kings Order, as Foot-Paths
for the ease of Pilgrims, and to
make their Pilgrimage the more pleasant
and delightful, and therefore were for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57376:80"/>
walking in them, lest, <hi>said they,</hi> we be
found to put a slight upon the Favours
the Divine Goodness hath hereby offered
to us. No, said <hi>Believer,</hi> I dare not, nor
would I have you to go into them, for
they seem to me to be By-Paths, and I am
very suspitious that all By-Paths lead out
of the Way of Life. Its true, <hi>said they,</hi>
they do so, but these can be no By-Paths,
for you see that they run all along by the
Walls side, so that if we find occasion,
we may turn out of them into this Path
again at our Pleasure. I will not, <hi>said he,</hi>
and, O do not you venture that; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they seem to run so as far as you can
see, yet who knows how they run farther
off, or whither they will lead you in the
End; as for the Way wherein we now
are, I am sure that is the right Way, and
that Eternal Glory is at the End of it,
because the King himself set me into it,
charging me withal, that I should not dare,
as I loved my Soul, esteemed his Favour,
or vallued Everlasting Happiness, to turn
out of it either to the Right-hand or to the
Left, so that if you will not be perswaded
to go along with me and be happy, I must
not, nor I will not be Wheedled and
Wiredrawn to go along with you to be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57376:80"/>
Miserable: Pray remember what you were
saying when you first overtook me, <hi>viz.</hi>
How dreadful it will be if any of us who
have Conferred, and Prayed, and Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, should after all this Miscarry,
and be Eternally Separated and Doomed
to Everlasting Misery; if it fall out so with
either of you, you will be forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when it is too late, that you were
forewarned thereof by me. Having thus
told them their Danger, and finding them
notwithstanding Obstinate and Head-strong
in their way, he left them to their
own Devices, and went forward on his
Journey. Now I saw that when he was
gone, the two Pilgrims could not agree
which of the Paths they should take,
wherefore <hi>Desire to be Good</hi> took the
Right-hand Path, and <hi>Would be Happy</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the other on the Left-hand, which
<hi>Believer,</hi> (who looked back to see which
of the Ways they would take) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding,
he said thus to himself; Lord,
what a strange Creature is Mankind?
How willing is he to be Miserable? How
unwilling to be Happy? How easily Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
into the Path of Danger; and how
hardly perswaded to enter into, or when
entred to continue in the Way of Life?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57376:81"/>
And now, O Lord, what is thy Servant,
that thou shouldest be so loving and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to me, and bring me into the
Way of Life, when thou hast left so many
others to Perish in the Paths of Death?
and be so unwearied in thy care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and keep me therein, when thou
permittest so many others to be Wheedled
by the Prince of <hi>Darkness,</hi> and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
yielding Heart, foolishly to turn out of
it into the Ways of Sin and Death again?
Lord, let the consideration hereof inflame
my Heart with more love to thee, teach
me to be more Faithful and Obedient, and
lead my Soul to a nearer and a more
universal Compliance with the Divine
Will.</p>
            <p>Now methoughts seeing the three Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
thus parted, I became strangely
concerned thereat, and it created in me
an extraordinary desire to know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of them all, and whither the two
By-Paths led; to which end I would get
upon the Walls, sometimes on one Wall,
and sometimes on the other, and look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, yet so as not to lose the sight of
my Pilgrim, who continued still in the
Narrow Way. And I saw that the Way
on the Left-hand which <hi>Would be Happy</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57376:81"/>
took, was a Road of so much Business,
that the Imploy and Management there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ingrossed so much of his Time, and
kept him in such a perpetual hurry, that he
not only lost his Way to the <hi>Celestial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi>
but he quite forgot also, that there
was any such place, or at leastwise that
ever he had been Travelling toward it,
or had any kind of Business there; and
at length it brought him into the Broad
Way again, where he returned without
any Reluctancy or Notice, being not at
all concerned thereat: Well, thought I,
I may now say of thee, Farewell for ever,
for there is now an end of thy Pilgrimage,
unless the Eternal, who is the Father of
Mercies, should by a Miracle of Mercy
revive thy Convictions again. And as
for <hi>Desire to be Good,</hi> I saw, that not long
after his entrance into the Path, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
one whose Name was <hi>Intend well,</hi>
who was got over into the Path not long
before him, fancying as the other, that
now they had nothing to do, but to mind
and follow their General Vocation, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Imagining that the Eternals command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to forsake the World, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
themselves to be Carnal, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
minded, have their Conversation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57376:82"/>
in Heaven, and that they should set their
Affections not on the things which are
seen, but on the things which are not seen,
because the things which are seen are
Temporal, but the things which are not
seen are Eternal; I say, they thought that
those Commands warranted their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but, as I afterwards learned, they
were grosly mistaken therein, and that
this mistake was almost as mischievous and
as fatal as the other into which <hi>Would be
Happy</hi> fell: Now I saw them walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a long time in that Way, every Day
frequenting of Sermons, and Lectures, and
Christian Conferrences, or else keeping of
Days of Fasting and Humiliation, in all
which they seemed to take a great deal of
Delight and Pleasure, and manifested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Heat, Warmth, and Zeal.
Well, thought I, I hope better things of
these two Pilgrims than I did of the other
that took the Left-hand Way; but at
length I perceived them to be perfectly
glutted and clogged with their Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and by the Constancy of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
thereon, their fervour began
to flag, and by degrees they grew exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
weary and tired thereof; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I understood that was the Design of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57376:82"/>
the subtle Serpent, in perswading and
drawing them into that Path, that so by
being Righteous over much, they might
be surfeited with the Duties and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Religion, and turn from them with
loathing, and thereupon return again to
his Service, or at least put them to the
trouble of going back again as far as the
Strait Gate, in order to their getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Way of Life again, and so it fell
out in those two Pilgrims, for I saw <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
well</hi> at length fall into a certain
Path which led back again into the Broad
Way, and I never heard that there was
ever any farther Enquiry made by him
after the <hi>Celestial Paradise.</hi> And <hi>Desire
to be Good</hi> beginning now to be sensible of
the Error he had been Guilty of, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the Way wherein the King
had appointed him to go on Pilgrimage
to the <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
overwhelmed with sorrow, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with Grief and Shame to the Strait
Gate, whereat <hi>Believer</hi> had entered, which
he was not able to pass without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and Striving, nor was he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with those Sweet Soul-Affecting and
Heart-Ravishing Intimations and Assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Redeemers Love, wherewith
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57376:83"/>
               <hi>Believer</hi> was blest; nor did the Son of
Righteousness arise upon him with so
much Brightness and Splendor as upon
the other; but instead thereof, he was
forced through a long tract of time to
Walk alone in a mournful and disconsolate
manner, bitterly exclaiming against his
former folly, and ever and anon lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the absence, and declaring how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
he longed for the presence of the
Beloved of his Soul, who did at last gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
Condescend to Visit him with his
Salvation, and refresh his Spirits with
his loving kindness and his tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions,
which have been ever of Old.</p>
            <p>And now I think it is time to return
to our Pilgrim again, who by this time
was got a great way on his Journey, and
had joyned him in Company with a great
many Pilgrims, who were going likewise
the same way, and intending for the same
place with himself, having all of them
their Faces set <hi>Sion</hi>-ward. And lo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
an Ambassador come from the King
of Kings, and inviting them in his Name
to a Royal and Plentiful Feast, where
they all sate down at a well spread Table,
Richly furnished with all manner of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties,
and plentifully stored with all the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57376:83"/>
Delicacies of the Gospel, all which were
served up in several Dishes, and the first
which I saw set on the Table was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of a Broken, a Bleeding,
and a Dying Jesus, whose Face although
it were fairer than the Children of Men,
was defiled with Spittle, bruised with
Blows and Buffetings, and covered over
with a Purple Gore; whose Head which
was white as Snow, and like the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Wool, was Crowned with Thorns,
the points whereof wear beaten down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Head with Reeds, and thereby
both Head and Hair Died in a Sanguine
Red, whose Eyes which used to be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
brighter than the Flames of Fire,
and sparkle more than the Richest Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
now swam in Tears, were dim
with Blood, and darkened at the approach
of Cruel Death; whose Mouth and Lips,
although they were wont to speak as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Man spake, were now grown Pale
and Wan with strokes, grim with Death,
and imbittered by the Gall and Vinegar
which he Drank; whose Arms wherewith
he used to Fathom the World, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
all the Powers of the Universe,
were now distrained and stretched on the
Cross; and his Shoulders, by the strength
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57376:84"/>
whereof he upheld the tottering Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
was beaten and lashed with Knotty
Cords and Whips, and when so Bruised
and Wounded thereby, that it would have
drawn Tears from the Dryest Eyes, and
have moved the Hardest and most Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Heart to Pity and Commiseration to
behold it, he was inforced notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to bear a Heavy Cross, whereon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was to be Crucified; whose Hands,
whereby the Worlds were made, and
with which he formed the curious Frames
and Fabricks of Heaven and Earth; and
his Feet, which used to move so swiftly to
bring Pardon and Relief to the Condemned
and the Miserable, were now Bored and
Pierced through, and by Inhumane and
Salvage Traytors Cruelly Nailed and
Tenter'd on the Cross; whose Heart,
which was never polluted nor defiled, and
was the very Spring and Fountain of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Love, was now pierced and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Spear; and those Bowels, which
Yearned with Pity, and Rouled with
Compassion towards others, when in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
and Misery, were now dried up for
want of Moisture, and Pained and Tortured
with straining pulls, and the extrremity
of his Torments, and even broken and rent
a sunder by his dying pangs. So that from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57376:84"/>
Head to Foot, there was no part free; but
methoughts he appeared covered all over
with Blood; his Face was sadly Mortified,
and numerous streams of Blood flowed from
the several Wounds the Crown of Thorns
had made in his Guiltless Head; his Eyes
looked Watery and Red, his Mouth Wan
and Pale, his Arms were Distorted, and
his Flesh beat and torn from his Shoulders,
his Hands and his Feet were Boared, his
Heart-strings broken, and his Bowels dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and clung together; his Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Side ran like a Fountain of Blood, the
Sacred Streams whereof was indued with
such a Cleansing Virtue, that being
sprinkled on the Pilgrims, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
washed thereby from all their Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and adorned with a wonderful Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and Comliness; and withal, so Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
and Perswasive, that upon the very
sight thereof, the Eternal forgave them
their Iniquities: The Wound in his Side,
from whence this Fountain of Blood issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was so large and open, that as some
of the Guests afterwards told me, they
could through it look into his Breast, and
see the pantings of his Heart, the whole
whereof they assured me, was Composed
of Love. The next Course I saw served
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57376:85"/>
up, was a Dish of Gospel Mysteries, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one whereof contained and had inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in it a Sacred Wonder, the number
whereof was so great, that my Memory
was not able to contain them, and having
forgotten many of them my self, I cannot
relate them to you; but such of them
whereof I took a more particular notice,
and wherewith I found my Heart more than
ordinarily affected, were as follow: The
First Mystery I remember which offered it
self to view, was <hi>God manifested in the
Flesh,</hi> which being opened by the Steward
of the Feast, the Sacred Wonders inclosed
therein (for there was more than one
contained in this Mystery) plainly offered
themselves to the view of the Beholders.
And it contained, first, as Wonder of
Righteousness, Justice, and Severity, in that
the Eternal would not spare but punish
Sin, although upon his own and only Son,
notwithstanding the Guilt thereof was not
contracted by him, but only imputed to
him. The Second Wonder, was a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Wisdom, whereby the Eternal
had made Light to spring out of Darkness,
Life out of Death, Gain out of Loss,
Blessing out of a Curse, and Victory out
of an Overthrow, and brought about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57376:85"/>
other glorious and incredible things by
absolute Contrarieties; As the rising of the
World by the fall of its Upholder: The
riches of his People by the poverty of their
Inricher; and the fulness and glory of the
Saints, by the emptiness and shame of the
King of Saints. The Third Wonder,
was a Wonder of Mercy, in that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
notwithstanding he shut his Ears,
and hardened his Heart against the Cries
and Intreaties of his own Son, when he
submissively begged of him, <hi>Father if it be
thy Will let this Cup pass from me,</hi> should yet
open his Ear to, and receive the Cries of
Sinners, who had Conspired and Rebelled
against him. The Fourth Wonder was a
Wonder of Love: A Wonder of Love! Ah
that was a Wonder indeed, and there was
more Wealth and Sweetness contained
therein, and the sight of it afforded more
satisfaction and delight than the Bluntness
of my Pen will permit me to Describe. First,
The wonderful Love of the Eternal, the
Everlasting Father of the Prince of Peace,
in providing such an admirable way for
the Saving of Sinners, and the making
them who were by Nature Children of
his Everlasting Wrath, Children of his
Dearest Love by Grace, and the parting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57376:86"/>
with, and giving up his own Eternal Son,
who had never offended him, to become
a Sacrifice and a Ransome for lost and
undone Mankind, who were Strangers and
Enemies, and had ever Rebelled against
him. Secondly, the Wonderful Love of
the Blessed Redeemer in consenting to
give himself, his Blood, his Life, his Soul
a Ransom for his People, to Ransom
them from Everlasting Misery, buy them
out of the Hand of Justice, purchase for
them an Eternal weight of Glory, and an
Everlasting Inheritance with the Saints in
Light; but that which added to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the Wonder beyond all expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nay, beyond conception it self, was,
that all this should be done for Worms
and rottenness, for Dust and Ashes, for the
most filthy and polluted, for the most
worthless and despicable Creatures, who
were not capable of meriting, or any way
deserving this Redeeming Love before,
or answering and Compensating of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed upon them. The
Fifth Wonder, was a Wonder of Divine
Patience, Long-suffering, and Forbearance,
in that the Eternal did not speedily Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Vengeance upon those Ungrateful
Wretches who had slighted his Mercy,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57376:86"/>
abused his Love, and scornfully refused
and trampled upon his Son, affronting
him for the kindness he offered them, and
spitting in his Face for the Reward of his
Love, in tendering them Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.
Now although those Dishes
which were already placed on the Table
were Admirable and Splendid, yet those
which followed far exceeded them in
Sweetness, and afforded infinitely more
delight and satisfaction to those who fed
thereon; and the First of them was, A
particular and Effectual Application of
Electing, Redeeming, and Converting
Love to the Souls of the Redeemed, by the
Hand of the Spirit in the preaching of
the Gospel; which Mystery likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it several Wonders; as, that
Divine Goodness should chuse them and
neglect others, making them to be the
Heirs of Life, whilst others were left to
Inherit the Paths of Death, that he should
Embrace them in his Arms, and bestow
upon them the Kisses of his Lips, whilst
others are not permitted so much as to
behold his Face; but were by a Sentence
of Banishment for ever excluded from his
presence; that he should Indulge them in
his Bosom, when others were Trampled
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57376:87"/>
under his Feet; that they should be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and accepted by him, notwithstanding
they had neglected and stood out so long
against him, and had refused and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so many offers and tenders which had
been made by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next
Course was of Multiplied Pardons, and
Plentious Redemption, ready prepared
for, and freely bestowed upon Relenting
and Returning Sinners, and reiterated
Pardons and Forgivenss for those unwary
Pilgrims, who had through oversight neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to keep up their Watch, and by
reason of the prevalency of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Corruption, fallen into some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Practices against the King, contrary
to the settled bent and inclinations of
their Hearts, which were always Constant
and Loyal to him. The last Course which
I saw served up, was Unchangeable Love,
brought to the Table, and Handed down
and Conveyed to them in an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and an Everlasting Covenant, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in all things and sure. And for the
better pleasing of the Eye, as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
and satisfying of the Heart of
the Guests, the Dish was covered over
with Promises of an inestimable value,
and garnished round with such Assurances
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57376:87"/>
as these, I will not Violate my Covenant,
I will not alter my Love, nor suffer my
Faithfulness to fail; my Covenant will I
not break, nor alter the thing which is
gone out of my Mouth.</p>
            <p>Besides these Dishes which I have told
you of, there were many others which I
cannot so well remember, and every Dish
which came to the Table, was Saused
with Eternity, and Garnished with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness
and Instability; neither
was there wanting Variety of Delectable
Liquors for the satiateing of the Thirsty,
as well as the satisfying of the Hungry
Soul, for there was plenty of Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Honeyed Milk, and Spiced Wine in
abundance; and indeed the Glory as well
as the Plenty of the Feast was such, that
I fear nothing more than that I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from and lessen it by my attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to describe it, and therefore I would
have you Guess at it, not so much by my
Description, as by the Wealth and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the Bounty and Love of the
King that made it, and the Quality of
the Persons whom he invited to it. Now
you must know, the King who made this
Feast is the Lord of Life and Glory, the
Eternal God, the Everlasting Jehovah,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57376:88"/>
the Mighty and the Uncontrolable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the Universe, who says of the
Earth it is mine, and all the fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and is the owner and absolute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
of all that the Heaven of Heavens
can produce; and whensoever he makes a
Feast, he makes it like himself, that so he
may thereby shew forth and declare to
them who are his happy Guests, the
Wealth, and Riches, and Glory, and
Fulness, and Love of him who hath Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to, and Entertains them at his
Table. And the Persons who were the
invited Guests to this Royal and Kingly
Feast, were all or most of them Princes
and Princesses, the Sons and Daughters of
the Majesty of Heaven and Earth, and
by the Glory of their Countenance and
the Majesty of their Port and Carriage,
they each of them resembled the Children
of a King.</p>
            <p>Now the Table being thus Spread and
Furnished, the Guests Seated, and the
Steward of the Feast having Implored a
Blessing from Heaven upon the Rich Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
wherewith it was Stored, the King
himself Arrayed in Royal Robes of Love
and Majesty, Girt about with Truth and
Faithfulness; and having his Crown on
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57376:88"/>
his Head, and bravely attended on by
an innumerable Company of his Glorious,
Splendid, and Shining Courtiers, came
in amongst them, and Saluting them all,
bid them welcome to his Table, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
First to one, and then to another;
he invited them to Eat Heartily of the
Bread which he had prepared, and Drink
freely of the Wine which he had Mingl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
crying out unto them, and saying, Eat
O Friends, and Drink, yea, Drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
O my Beloved! You are now at a
Feast where you have Provisions enough
to fill and satisfie you, therefore Eat and
spare not, and let your Souls Drink free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Cup of Salvation which I have
provided you. You need not fear your
Eating of my Table empty, nor shall the
Fountain whereat you now Drink ever be
Exhausted; O therefore, Feed and Feast
your Souls; for assure your selves, that
the more you Eat at my Table, the more
you shall have to Eat, and the welcomer
you shall be; and the more you Drink
at the Ocean of my Love, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of my Goodness, the more you shall
have it overflowing to you; and therefore
I charge you that you rise not before you
are satisfied, and that none of you go
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57376:89"/>
Empty from my Table. O Create not
an occasion to your selves, to reflect
with shame and sorrow hereafter upon
your Madness and Folly in going from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
fulness without being filled, and from
Alsufficiency it self, without being satisfied.
I am sure you do not, or at least you
need not Question your welcome to my
Table, and the Provisions I have there
provided for you, nor my willingness to
make you so, since I have by many and
Irrefragable Arguments given you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Demonstrations thereof.</p>
            <p>The King having made this Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
methoughts I saw <hi>Believer,</hi> (who had
before he would adventure to approach
the Table, or participate of the Feast
to which he was invited; plucked out of
his Bosom (which was the place where he
used to keep it) the Memorials of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and having read the Conditions
thereof, and Considered with himself
how he had answered the Obligations he
had thereby laid upon him, and finding
himself saulty in some Particulars, he
mightily bewailed his folly and oversight
therein, and in the most humble manner
imaginable upon his Knees, with shame
and blushing, acknowledged and confessed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57376:89"/>
it, and craved Pardon for the same, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
the sincerity of his Intentions to
amend, and promising to yield better O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
for the future, and having so
done he set his Hand and Subscribed his
Name to it, as he did before when he
first entred into Covenant, and so fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it up, he put it into his Bosom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and kept it there as a perpetual
Memorial of the Matter,) now pluck
the Memorial of the Covenant between
him and the Son of the Blessed out of his
Bosom, and with a most profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Veneration Humbly presented
it to the King, intreating him to set his
Seal to it; which I saw the King take
into his Sacred Hand, and having read
it over, and perused the Contents of it,
I heard him declare himself highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and delighted with that Faith in his
Promises, Hope in his Mercy, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Trust in his Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
which <hi>Believer</hi> had by that Act
discovered himself to be possessed of, and
therefore willingly affixed the Broad Seal
of Heaven to that Memorial of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and Certificate of his Marriage.
And then Methoughts I heard <hi>Believer</hi> sing
softly to himself the following Himn.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:57376:90"/>
Thou'st brought my Soul into thy Courts,</l>
            <l>And Chambers of thy Love,</l>
            <l>To be refresht and feasted here</l>
            <l>With dainties from above.</l>
            <l>The Heavens thou hast open set,</l>
            <l>And rent the Vail, that I</l>
            <l>May upwards look, and thy dear So</l>
            <l>With Glory Crown'd espie,</l>
            <l>Who Crowned was for me with Thorns,</l>
            <l>And Scourg'd with Cruel Hand,</l>
            <l>When on the Cross he died for me</l>
            <l>With sad and torturing pangs;</l>
            <l>Tears then ran down his Rosy Cheeks,</l>
            <l>And Sweat bedew'd his Face,</l>
            <l>Blood from his Sacred Hands and Feet,</l>
            <l>And Side in Streams apace</l>
            <l>Did flow, to purge and wash my Soul,</l>
            <l>And purchase at thy Hands,</l>
            <l>The Pardon of my Wickedness,</l>
            <l>And freedom from my Bands:</l>
            <l>His dying Groans were strong and loud,</l>
            <l>When thou on him did'st lay</l>
            <l>The Punishment of all my Sins,</l>
            <l>Which he did freely pay;</l>
            <l>And for my Soul he purchase did,</l>
            <l>Both Grace and Glory too,</l>
            <l>The one to be my portion here,</l>
            <l>The other when I goe</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:57376:90"/>
From this frail state and mortal life,</l>
            <l>To be possess'd above</l>
            <l>With those delights which there do flow</l>
            <l>In plenty from thy Love.</l>
            <p>And after they had all of them Eaten
and Drank their fill, and the Steward of
the Feast had in their Names, and on their
behalf returned Praise and Thanksgiving
to the King for the Bounty and Love
wherewith he had Treated them at his
Table; they all sang an Himn to the Praise
and Adoration of him, who was both the
Maker and the <hi>Matter</hi> of their Feast; and
then the Steward standing up, he Blessed
them in the Kings Name, and so they
departed; and I saw them go forward on
their Journey, Talking and Discoursing
together of the great things which they
had seen, and felt, and participated of at
the Kings Table, and saying one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
certainly we shall never forget the
Glorious sights which have been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to our view this day, especially,
that Blessed and Glorious Mystery which
was so full of Wonders, and those Wonders
so great and Transparent, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Mystery of God Manifested in the Flesh;
Ah Blessed Mystery! and thrice happy
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57376:91"/>
we who have had our Eyes Blessed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and have had Hopes and Assuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
given us, that we have an Interest
therein, and shall both here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Time and in Eternity, injoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
thereof.</p>
            <p>But after some time, I saw <hi>Believer</hi>
overtaken by one of his old Companions,
with whom he admitted to talk a little,
which brought up former Injoyment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Remembrance, which he found created
some kind of delight to him; upon which
the poor Man was presently seized with
the Plagues of Spiritual Laziness and Auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness,
so that he became in a manner
altogether indifferent whether he went
forward or not, and the Plagues increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and grew so much upon him, that in
a little time, he neither cared whether he
did, nor knew how to set one Foot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
nay, I perceived he had, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all that he had formerly suffered
thereby, the trouble and sorrow it had
procured him, the Comforts it had Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him of, marred his Confidence in the
Eternal, and made him both afraid and
ashamed to repair to his Throne of Grace,
or once dare to lift up his Face before him)
some little Inclination to go back again
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57376:91"/>
with him; whereby the Blessed and the
Holy Spirit which was sent into his
Heart by the Redeemer, to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
and Comforter, and Reliever of
his Soul, and as such had indeavoured to
perswade him against having any thing
to do with this Old Acquaintance, or
once stop to speak to him; and when he
could not prevail for that, but the poor
overtaken, and wilful Man had resolved
notwithstanding all that was said to the
Contrary, to buy Repentance at the dear
rate of parting with all these Assurances
he had of, and all the delight and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
he took in, the Favour of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and for any thing he knew to the
contrary his Soul too, to purchase it: Then
he perswaded him to Repent of his Folly,
told him the danger he had brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into by this relaxation from, and
prevarication in his Covenant, advising
him to stop before he was gone so far that
he would not be able to stop, nor would
be peradventure accepted by the Eternal
if he did, but now he was grown more
wilful and obstinate than before; nay, he
was so taken up, that he heard not, or at
least minded not what was said to him,
whereat the Holy Spirit was offended,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57376:92"/>
grieved, quenched, and finding all his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
slighted, and all his Dictates oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and disobeyed, he withdrew, but I
saw that he did not absolutely leave him,
but only retired out of sight, forbore the
sensible performance of his Visible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
whereby the poor Man was left
in a sad and dismal Condition. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at first it should seem only to speak
to it, or so, without any Design of Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with, or imbracing of it, but the
Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> perceiving that he
stopped to speak with it, and knowing that
the Original Corruption which he had
within him, was of the Nature of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and thereby apt to take Fire upon
the least occasion, he presently laid hold
of the opportunity, and flying swiftly
through the Air with a little spark of Fire
in his Right-hand, which he brought with
him out of the Bottomless Pit, he came
close by him, and having ordered the
Object that had at first stay'd him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
just as he came to him, the Man see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it coming lift up his Eyes to gaze at it,
and thereupon the Wicked Fiend, who
only watched for, and desired that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
threw the burning Spark which
he brought in his Hand for that purpose
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57376:92"/>
in at those Windows or Casements of
the Soul, which meeting with a Nature
that was no other than Tinder to this
Spark, he was presently set all on a
Flame. Now when I saw things go thus
with him, I still expected when he should
by an absolute Compliance have turned
his Back upon the <hi>Celestial Paradise,</hi> and
have declared his resolution then and there
to have put a final period to his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and return again into the Broad
Way; but notwithstanding my fears, I
perceived that all the Wiles and Devices
which the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> was Master
of, was not able to effect that; not but
that <hi>Believer</hi>'s Inclinations to do so, were
strong and powerful enough, but because
the Seed of the Eternal remained in him,
and the Prince of <hi>Darkness</hi> could not find
out or Devise any expedient to force or
steal that out of him, however he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to keep him as long as possible in that
posture, wherein he found him, hoping
to effect that by length of time, which
he could not accomplish at present, and
resolving since he could not steal away, or
force the Seed out of his Heart which the
Eternal had Sown there, he would Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguer
and Besiege it so close as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57376:93"/>
the Eternals sending any relief or
succour to it, and thereby starve it out,
or force it to a Surrender: And in this
sad kind of Condition the Man continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a long time, hanging as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heaven and Hell, and halting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Opinions, until at last he came
to a place where one of those Temples
stood which the Eternal had placed in the
Road for Pilgrims to do their Homage
and Worship, and Adore him in. Now
when he came to the Door, I could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive him to be indifferent whether
he went in or passed by, but being entred
he there met with an Embassador from
the King, who assured the Pilgrims which
came there to Worship, that if any of
them sinned wilfully after the receiving
the knowledge of the Truth, <hi>there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no more sacrifice for Sin, but a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
looking for of Judgment, and Fiery Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which shall devour those Adversaries;
for if those who despised Moses Law, died
without Mercy, of how much sorer punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall you be thought worthy, who have
trodden under Foot the Son of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Blood of the Covenant wherewith
you were sanctified an unholy thing, and done
despite to the Spirit of Grace:</hi> And I will
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57376:93"/>
assure you, said he, you will find it a dreadful thing
to fall thus into the Hands of the living God, <hi>for our
God is a consuming Fire to all of you, who are Workers of
Iniquity:</hi> Now <hi>Believer</hi> looking back, and reflecting
upon what he had done, found, that if it were not
his very case which had been Treated of, yet at
least it came somewhat near it, looked like it, and
led directly towards it; whereupon he presently
applied all that had been said to himself, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was all directed at, and intended for him;
and that which made him the more confident it
was so, was this, he fancied that the Embassadour
looked on him, and pointed at him all the time
he was delivering his Embassy; whereupon he
roared in the bitterness of his Soul, and cried out,
O, wo, wo, and ten thousand woes unto me, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, deluded and deceived me, for I am now
lost and undone, my hope is cut off from the Lord,
and the everlasting God hath forsaken me; the
Blessed Redeemer hath now ceased to interceed for
me, and the Holy Spirit is withdrawn from me.
After this manner he lamented and bewailed his
backsliding, nor were his fellow Pilgrims, divers of
whom attempted it, able to fix any Comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; they told him of the Mercy of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
the Merits of the Redemer, the certainty and
firmness of those Promises, and the unalterable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Covenant wherein they had made over
and given themselves unto him: They told him,
that the everlasting Jehovah was not as a Man,
that he should Repent; nor as the Son of Man,
that he should Change; all which he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be good Plaisters for a wounded Soul: But O,
said he, they will not stick upon me. And thus he
went mourning from them, and I saw him retire
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57376:94"/>
into a secret place all alone by himself, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
himself on the Earth, before the Eternal
with a dejected Countenance, a sad Heart, a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eye, and a doubting Spirit, having his Face co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with shame and blushing, not daring to
look up to Heaven, as unworthy to behold that
place, he only laid his Hand upon his Guilty
Breast, and sighed out <hi>Lord be merciful to me a
Sinner:</hi> He would have proceeded further, but
was not able, so that he was forced to sigh out
the rest in silent Groanes, which he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to utter, or form into Words. Now after
he had lain thus grovelling on the Ground for
some time, I saw him a rise, and taking the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Sacred Law into his Hand, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it just about the middle, and the very first
thing that he fixt his Eyes upon, was the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Promise; <hi>He that confesseth and forsaketh his Sins
shall find Mercy:</hi> His Eyes were so dim and blared
with weeping, that he could not see to read it
plain at first, so that he was forced to look on
it again, and again before, he could read it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
then turning towards the latter end of it,
he found another, which was not only more full
and sweet in it self, but also directed him how
to make use and improve the other, <hi>viz. If
any Man sin we have an Advocate with the Father,
even Jesus Christ the Righteous;</hi> from which two
places of the Divine Law, he Extracted abundance
of Comfort and Hope, and resolved presently to
put them in practice.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Addressing himself in the most
humble manner imaginable upon his Knees to
the Eternal, he uttered himself after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:57376:94"/>
Lord (said he) I have sinned against
Heaven, and before Thee, and am not
worthy to be called thy Son; wherefore
Thou hast almost consumed me in thine
Anger, because of my Backsliding: And
thy wrath hath troubled me, because of
my sin. Mine iniquities are ever before
Thee, and Thou hast set my secret sins
in the Light of thy Countenance. Thou
makest me to spend my daies in sorrow,
and pass away my nights in despair. Lord,
who knows the power of thy Anger?
according to thy fear, so is thy wrath;
the sense wereof lyeth so heavy upon me,
That I am like one going down into
the pit, and like a man that hath no
strength, thy fierce wrath goeth over me,
and thy Terrors have cut me off; so that
my daies are consumed as smoke, and my
bones are burned and consumed within
me: My heart is smitten and withered,
like grass, so that I forget to take my
bread; and yet all this I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to be Just, because I have sinned
against Thee. I am destroyed indeed,
but it is by my self; I am wounded, but
is by my own weapon of my own forming,
and an arrow out of my own Quiver. I
am Poisoned but it is by a draught of my
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57376:95"/>
own Composing. I am Robbed and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of all my enjoyments, but it was not
without my own consent: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou maist justly refuse to Heal or
Relieve me, Pardon and forgive me;
But Lord, didst not thou tell me, that
thou wert an Everlasting God; that thy
Love was unchangeable. I have indeed
slighted thy Love, abused thy Patience,
trampled upon thy Son, despised thy
Grace, and greived thy Spirit. And have
not only sinned against, and broken and
violated all those obligations which thou
hast been perpetually laying upon me
by the infinite and uncontroulable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of thy Love and thy Bounty: But
likewise against all those obligations that
I have been laying upon my self too,
I have violated all my Covenants, my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and my vows, and sinned against
my own prayers, lamentations and Tears:
And wilt thou therefore, O Lord, prove
as changeable as my self! Wilt thou take
an advantage against me! Wilt thou
cut me off for ever! or wilt thou resolve
to be favourable no more! Is thy mercy
clean gone for ever! And shall thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
fail for evermore! Hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to be gracious! Or wilt thou in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57376:95"/>
anger shut up the Bowels of thy tender
compassions! Wilt thou who art the
God of Grace, refuse to be gracious!
The Fountain of Mercy, cease to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful!
Hast Thou not said in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of thy Law, that Thou wilt not be
alwaies Wrath, neither wilt Thou keep
Thy Anger for ever, lest the spirit
fail before Thee, and the Soul which
Thou hast made?</p>
            <p>And then applying himself to the Son
of the Blessed, Lord, said he, Didst not
Thou assume me in the day when Thou
enteredst into Covenant with me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittedst
me to enter into Covenant with
Thee; That Thou wouldst become my
High Priest and Advocate; and that as
Thou hadst shed thy most precious Blood,
as a Sacrifice to Attone for my sins;
so Thou wouldst appear before thy
Father, as my Advocate, and plead that
Blood, and the Merits of it, to appease
his Anger, and turn away his displeasure
against me, and Procure me Pardon and
forgiveness from him, and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with him. And wilt Thou now,
when I am confounded in my self, and
even environed and overwhelmed with
Despair, having no hope or possibility
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57376:96"/>
of finding relief any where but in thy
self, forget thy Promise, and prove
worse then thy Word? Wilt Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I have wickedly and most perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
broken my Covenant, break
thine too? Sure it cannot be, for thou
art the same for ever, and canst not
change: wherefore thou Blessed Jesus,
thou sweet Redeemer of my Soul, I will
by thy own Assistance, (for without it
I am sure I shall not be able) resolve
with an humble boldness, to act Faith
in thy Promises, lay hold on thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and hang upon the words of thy
lips, as the Bee doth on the flower,
from whence she extracts a sweetness
wherewith the dews of Heaven hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd
it. And according to thy own
directions, I will now take unto my self
words, and say unto thee, Lord, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
thou my iniquities, and receive me
graciously: Heal thou my Backslidings,
and love me freely. And do thou who
art so Eloquent and Powerful an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
that thy Father can deny thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
Who art so wise an Advocate
that none of thy Clients did or shall
lose their Cause; so prevailing an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,
that whatsoever thou Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedest
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57376:96"/>
for, and what request soever thou
makest on the behalf of thy Members,
is fully and immediately granted; go
to the Eternal, and plead my Cause at
at his Bar, and when Thou hast there
procured Pardon and Reconciliation for
me; then send thy Spirit to convey the
knowledge and comfortable Assurance
thereof, unto my Soul, that so thou
maist cause my heart to sing for joy, and
put a new song of Praise and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
into my mouth, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in the Lord, and triumph in God
my Saviour, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And methoughts, I saw him rise from
his knees in a most Humble, Serious,
and sedate Frame, having his heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
lifted up to Heaven in Holy and
desires, and yet his eyes cast down to the
Earth, as being both ashamed for his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so shamefully Backsliden from, and
prevaricated with the Infinite <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
the Eternal Majesty of Heaven and Earth;
and withal not absolutely freed as yet
from all manner of fear, diffidence and
doubtings, whether the Eternal would
be reconciled to him, or whether the
Blessed Redeemer would intercede for
him, and endeavor to prevail with the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57376:97"/>
Eternal to consent to a reconciliation:
having as he afterwards told some of his
fellow Pilgrim, many mis-givings of
Heart, that they would never give him
credit or trust him more, since he had
falsified his word, violated his promises,
and broken his Covenant with them so
often before; wherefore plucking the
memorial of his Covenant out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
he first read it over, and then
began to examine himsef what parts of
it he had broken, and tried, convicted
and condemned himself for the same:
And having so done, I heard him say
thus to himself, Well! since it is
so that I have been so foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
as to suffer my self to be thus
wheadled by my subtle Adversary, to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and play with that which I thought I
had Eternally shaken hands with, and
had firmly resolved to have no more to
do with it for ever; and <hi>I</hi> am not
able to obtain any Assurance within my
self, whether I am in a state of Grace, nor
yet whether I am Pardoned by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
for thus Backsliding from him; I
will now therefore, resolve to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant anew as if I had never
done it before; I will give up and make
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57376:97"/>
a Resignation of my self to the Blessed
Redeemer, as tho' all I had hitherto
done in that respect, were false and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
And when I have done this, then
<hi>I</hi> will see if I can take more heed to
my ways, be more careful to maintain
a stricter and more Spiritual Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over my thoughts and affections.</p>
            <p>Whereupon kneeling down before the
Eternal, he opened the paper, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spread it before him, he first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed
with shame and sorrow his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation</hi>
thereof, freely acknowledging,
and confessing his Guilt, and that he had
thereby justly deserved to be Eternally
forsaken by, and banish'd the Presence of
the Eternal for ever. And then he si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
sighed out his humble Request,
<hi>That Free Grace might notwithstanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve
and Pardon him, and the Divine
Goodness Heal and Restore him.</hi> Then <hi>I</hi>
heard him read over the Conditions of his
Covenant and saw him when he had so
done, in the most Solemn manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
present it to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as his act and deed, setting his
hand and subscribing his Name to it, as
he had done at the first.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:57376:98"/>
               <hi>Whereupon methoughts</hi> I <hi>looked up,
and saw</hi> The Son of the Blessed, stand by
the Golden Altar, which was erected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Throne of God, having a Golden
Censor in his hand, which was full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
wherewith he offered up the Prayers
and Desires of Believers, upon the Golden
Altar, which was before the Throne, and
the smoke of the Incense which came with the
Prayers of Believers, and ascended up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Eternal, out of the hand of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Redeemer who is the compassionate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
and merciful High Priest of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
and returning <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Eternal was to exceedingly well
pleased, that all his frowns were thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
changed into smiles, his Anger into
Love, and his indignation into Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so that he now spake kindly to believers;
returning the words of Peace and Truth,
and comforting him that was cast down,
<hi>saying unto him,</hi> Behold I have called thee
as a man calleth a Woman that was forsak'n
and greived in spirit and a wife of youth,
when thou wast refused, saith thy God, for
a small moment, have I forsaken thee, but
with great mercy will I gather thee, in little
wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment,
but with Everlasting kindness will I have
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57376:98"/>
mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
And the Covenant between us shall be,
as the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> shall no more go
over the Earth, so have I Sworn that I would
not be wrath with thee, nor rebuke thee.
The Mountains shall depart and the Hills
they shall be removed, but my kindness shall
not depart from thee, nor shall the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of my Peace ever be removed, saith
the Lord that hath mercy on thee. Thou hast
indeed played the Harlot, gone a whoring
from me and embraced strangers, whereby
thou hast deserved no better at my hands
than that I should write thee a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement,
put thee away and resolve never
to own thee again: But yet fear not, for I
have Pardoned thee and have covered thy
shame with the skirt of my Love, so that
thou shalt forget thy shame, thy unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and shalt not remember the reproach
of thy Widowhood any more; for thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
is thy Husband, the Lord of Hosts is
his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One
of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose Truth is established for
ever, and his Faithfulness to all generations;
wherefore art thou afflicted, tossed with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
and not comforted? Behold I will lay
thy Stones with fair Colours, and thy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
with Saphires. And now if thou
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57376:99"/>
wilt take care to keep close to me, and be
unfaithfull no more, then will I also resolve
never to withdraw the sense of my Love and
the Light of my Countenance from thee any
more for ever.</p>
            <p>And now I saw upon this Reconciliation,
the Eternal Spirit, who was the Director,
Reliever and Comforter of his Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to him again, being sent from the
Redeemer, to acquaint him with, and
assure him of that Reconciliation, which
he had by his efficacious and prevailing
Mediation procured for him, with his
Father, and to fill and feast his Soul
with comfort, joy and consolation upon
that account, and assist him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
himself in the Divine favour for
the future; whereupon I heard him break
forth into such sweet and Heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
as these, Lord, said he, how
infinite is thy Condescention, and how
wonderful is thy Love! How unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable
is thy Mercy! And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
is thy Patience! O that ever
such a Backsliding wretch, such a worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Worm, such a Rebel, Traytor and
Prodigal as my self, should be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to Mercy! O what a wonder
'tis, that ever such Backslidings as mine
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57376:99"/>
were, should be healed! That ever
such unfaithfulness should be Pardoned!
That ever such Ungratefulness should
be forgiven; but since thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that it is so, and hast assured
me of the Truth and certainty thereof,
both by the Word and Oath of him
that cannot lye, I Believe, Lord, help
thou my unbelief. And now, O my
God and my Father, I do with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Boldness, lay hold of, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive these renewings of thy Love,
and fresh assurances of thy Favour and
Friendship, which thou hast at this time
graciously sent me, and do as the most
suitable return which my poverty is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of making to thy Infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited
Love, subject my Soul and all
the powers of it, to thee, to be disposed
of as thou pleasest; and ordered, and
directed in all things, according to the
pleasure of thy will: In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
I do with all humble Boldness and
firm Resolution, lay hold of thee, O
my God! and of that Covenant which
thou hast made with me, both as my
happiness, and my safety, my portion
and my strength too. And thou, and
the Covenant, which thou hast made
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57376:100"/>
with me, and now renewed to me, shall
be that Rock whereon I will build all my
confidence and hopes; and make the
stay of my Heart and the support of
my Soul; that shall be the very life of
my joyes, and the joy even of my life
it self; where I will for ever sit and
Sing, under the Shadow of thy branches
with great delight, and thy fruit shall
be sweet to my tast. There, even there,
I will behold the Glory of thy Face, and
veiw the ravishing Beauty of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and satiate my Love-sick Soul
with the matchless Greatness and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
freeness, sweetness, and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
of thy Joy.</p>
            <p>And now methoughts I saw him go
forward in his <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> with more
speed and diligence than ever, and with
such an addition of strength, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he met with innumerable
discouragements, and every step brought
him into new and more threatening
dangers, both from Earth and Hell, which
with one accord united and banded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to obstruct and retard his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
yet he couragiously trampled them
under foot, and with ease and facility,
passed through them towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57376:100"/>
Land. And now after he had
marched thus rejoycing and triumphing
in God for some time, I saw an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
come from the King of Kings,
and invite him, with many other <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,</hi>
whom he had now overtaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
to a noble and splendid Feast, at
the Kings Table: A Feast of fat things,
and wine on the Lees; fat things full of
marrow, and wine on the Lees well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.
He gladly accepted of and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Invitation: But yet I observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he durst not adventure to go to the
Kings Table, before he had first read
over the Memorial of his Covenant, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
himself how he had kept it, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
his prevarications with sorrow and
Repentance, and then protesting the
Resolutions of his Soul to be more strict
and yield better obedience for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
again set his hand and subscribed
his name to it as before. And having
thus renewed his Covenant with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
he went and sate down with the
rest, at the King's Table, where I saw
him present the same to the King, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that he might have the Seal of it
Renewed likewise, which was presently
granted. And now methoughts I could
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57376:101"/>
discern him to eat more heartily, and
drink more freely at the Kings Table,
then I had seen him do at other times,
when he was invited thither; and when
the Feast was over, he went away like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
filled with a Joy as far exceeding
what he had formerly expressed, as the
Joy of Harvest exceeds that of the Seed
time; or the Joy of Marriage transcends
those that flow only from the first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures
of it: And as I afterwards heard
him acknowledge in a Conference he had
with some of the Pilgrims, it was the
most ravishing and transforming Glimpse,
and the sweetest, and the most satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Taste of that Eternal Felicity and
Delight that is to be had in the Celestial
<hi>Paradice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this sweet and Heavenly Frame
he continued a long time, still calling
to his fellow <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and telling them
the greatness of those Joys, and the
sweetness of that pleasure which the
Eternal poured into his Soul; and would
frequently say, O what a wonder it is
that Divine patience hath born with me
thus long. Methinks it is a wonder that
the Eternal should not feed me with
Wrath, with Gall and Wormwood,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57376:101"/>
with fire and Brimstone, and that he hath
not Cloathed me with fury and flames,
with indignation and Vengeance! But
O it is yet a greater, nay an infinitely
greater wonder that he should feed me
with Mercy and Love, Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Cloath me with pardon and
and forgiveness! That he should give
himself to me, as my happiness and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and give me leave upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to make use of him as my Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Treasure! And that rather
than I should want, he should Bountifully
make me a continual and perpetual Feast;
of which Feast he himself is the matter
as well as the Maker! O that ever a
poor worthless, forlorn and despicable
Wretch, who was cast out in his Blood,
and no eye pitied him, should be thus
Dignified and Advanced! That ever I
should be permitted to feed, and feast, and
live even upon Omnipotency it self!
O come unto me all ye that fear the
Eternal, and I will tell you what he hath
done for my Soul: He that is Mighty
hath done for me great things, and Holy
is his Name! O that I could love him,
please him, and Delight in him more!
That I could rejoice and triumph in him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57376:102"/>
more! And O that the whole imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my life, may be to admire and
boast of the Sweetness and Glory, Riches
and Plenty of my Portion! And that
my Tongue may speak Good of his
Name, and exalt and sing forth his
praise, so long as I have a tongue to
speak or sing withal.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Discourse, I understood he was not
yet perfect, for afterwards, I perceived
his heat and fervour begin to abate,
and by reason of the remainder of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
the power of his Indwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
and the deceitfulness of his treach'rous
Heart, he was thereupon prevail'd with
to meddle a little too much with take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in some things, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
lawful in themselves, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him by the Eternal, for
the Comfort and ease of his <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi>
in a moderate enjoyment thereof. But
the least excess in Love to, and Delight
therein, hath ever been accounted (and
he found by woful experience, that it
was so to him) a wonderful hindrance
to <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in their Journey toward
Celestial <hi>Paradice;</hi> so that he began to
grow very cold, dull and indifferent,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57376:102"/>
and by that means lost much of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Joy which he had been possessed
withal, but as soon as he perceived it,
he presently ran to a certain mountain
which stands in that Road, and is so
exceeding high, that <hi>Pilgrims</hi> were used
to climb up thither, and take a Veiw
of Celestial <hi>Paradice,</hi> formerly called
<hi>Pisgah,</hi> but I think they now call it
Contemplation. The delightful and
ravishing Sight whereof very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
towards the recovering them out
of those fits of carnal Security. And
when he came to the foot of the Mount,
he encouraged himself to get up to it
by the sweetness of those pleasures, the
conveniency of its height would afford
him a prospect of, saying to himself,</p>
            <l>Mount up my Soul, and on this Mountain stand,</l>
            <l>A taking prospect is the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>And having thus encouraged himself, up
he went, but by reason of its height
and steepness, it was not without some
difficulty that he reached the top of it;
But being once there, it gave him a fair
prospect of the whole Universe. And
the first thing he fixt his eyes upon,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57376:103"/>
was the Wilderness, where he saw a
World of Sin and Wickedness, Cursing,
Swearing, and Blaspheming God, Theft,
and Rapine, and murther, Irreligion,
Breaking the Sabbath and prophaning
every thing which was Sober and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
And as the consequence hereof,
great variety of tormenting pains and
perplexing misery, attending of, and
falling on the Inhabitants thereof: Then
casting his eyes a little lower, he saw
<hi>Tophet,</hi> the place which the Eternal had
made for the Reprobate: A pla ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
deep and large, the pile where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was Fire, and much Wood, and the
Breath of the Lord, like a perpetual
stream of Brimstone, doth kindle it:
Where he saw an innumerable company
of vain and impertinent Wretches,
weeping and wailing, and gnashing their
teeth, and bitterly bemoaning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
themselves and howling in those
dismal flames. Then he lifted his eyes
to <hi>Eden,</hi> where he took a Veiw of the
happy place, where the Eternal first
made Proclamation of mercy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the Riches and Glory of his free
Grace and Love, in the choice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of a Redeemer, saying, <hi>The Seed
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57376:103"/>
of the Woman shall break the Serpents head.</hi>
Then he removed his eye to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
where he beheld the Temple, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
and all the other Types and
Figures that were lively representations
of the promised Messiah. After this he
directed his eyes towards, and took a
veiw of <hi>Bethelem, Egypt, Nazareth, Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
Jerusalem,</hi> and the rest of the Cities
of <hi>Judah,</hi> the Mount of Tranfiguration,
the upper Room, where the Blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
Instituted his last Supper, the
Garden beyond the brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> where
he endured his Agony, and was Betrayed,
the High Priest's Hall, where that blessed
Face which was fairer then the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men, was Spit on, and in scorn
and derision covered and buffetted; the
the Judgment Hall, whither he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by those ungrateful <hi>Jews,</hi> and where
he was Condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
First to be in a most inhumane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Cruelly Scourged with Whips, and
beaten with Reeds, and then his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Head to be barbarously Crowned
with a Diadem of Thorns: And after
all this, by a most unjust Sentence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to be Crucified, only to gratifie
the importunity and clamour of a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57376:104"/>
From thence he directed his eye
to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where he saw him as an
Eternal High Priest, after the order of
<hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> offer up himself as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to Divine Justice; and then to the
Sepulchre, where he saw him lye three
days, as a Testimony that he was really
dead, &amp; on the third day rise again, as an
assurance that he had paid the uttermost
farthing that Justice could demand, and
that the Eternal was fully and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Satisfied. And from hence he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him through several places to
Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> whence he saw him As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the Celestial Paradice, there
to prepare a place for him. And now
methoughts I could easily discern him
to be exceedingly filled with admiration
and wonder, at this blessed and glorious
Sight, following him with his eyes to
the very entrance of Paradice, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in after him, he beheld a little
glimpse of the surprising Beauty and
inexpressible Glory and splendor of the
place.</p>
            <p>Now you may well imagine that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such transforming Sights as these,
he was able to trample under foot all
that coldness, deadness and indifferency
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57376:104"/>
which he carried up with him, and by
that means was Enabled to Walk
without weariness, and ran without
fainting, like a man whose Fetters
were just now knockt off, and all those
cloggs wherewith he was wont to be
hindred, were removed. And yet after all
this I could perceive he lost sight of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and thereby he lost much of that
comfort and consolation which the sight
of it yielded him; and indeed the whole
way, both before and after this, lay
over Hills and Dales, sometimes on the
Mount, and sometimes in the Valley, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he could behold the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
arising upon him, with healing
under his wings, darting his glorious
Beams, and conveying his refreshing and
and exhilerating Influences into his Soul;
and at other times he was so benighted,
and such sable Clouds interposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and Paradice, that he was
so far from seeing the Sun, that he
was not able to discern either Moon or
Stars. Sometimes he would be walking
with the Son of the Blessed, who was the
beloved and the darling of his Soul, in
the Gardens of Spices, satiating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with Love, and the mutual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57376:105"/>
and enjoyment of each other;
and yet at other times his Beloved
would withdraw and hide himself behind
the wall, so that he could not find him,
altho' he enquired after him, and it may
be, when he did appear he would only
vouchsafe to look on him through the
window, or shew himself through the
Lettice.</p>
            <p>Yet towards the latter end of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
when he drew nearer to Paradice,
the path wherein he walked, became
more smooth and fruitful; and the little
winged Choristers, wherewith the
blooming and fragrant Groves on either
side of it, were replenished, sang more
sweetly than they were wont to do,
and the Air likewise became more serene
and clear, the reason of all which was,
because the Beloved of his Soul was more
frequent in his Visits, and longer in his
Stays then formerly, yet not so, but that
he had some intermissions, some ups and
some downs, some Sun and some Cloud,
some Light and some darkness still.</p>
            <p>And thus I saw that through abundance
of those vicissitudes and changes, he
came at last to a certain River or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Sea, which parts between the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57376:105"/>
and Paradice: Through which
he was of necessity to pass, in regard
there was no other way to go it. Now
the Name of this River was anciently
called <hi>Jordan,</hi> but more modernly known
by the name of <hi>Dissolution;</hi> he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
sorrowful, when he first saw the River
and begun to shrink and tremble for fear,
and was ready to wish that the passing
through that River, which was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to nature, were not the way to
Paradice. But considering with himself
that there was no other way, that he
was unworthy of a Crown, if he would
not willingly adventure through a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
straight, difficult passage to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, especially since it was so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
short too, and the greatest difficulty
and danger thereof taken away by his
Redeemers passing through it before
him, he pluckt up his Spirits, and
rouz'd up his two Friends <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi>
to assist him in, and bare him company
through the River, telling them that this
was the last time that ever they could
possibly have an opportunity to afford
him any assistance; for said he, so soon
as ever I reach the further shore, I must
there take my Eternal leave of you;
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57376:106"/>
for I shall no sooner have set my foot on
that Blessed Land, but Faith shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
turned into Vision, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perefect
Hope changed into perfect Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition;
and then couragiously entered
the River, saying, <hi>O Death where thy sting!
O Grave where is thy Victory!</hi> The Sting
of Death is taken away, and Victory of
the Grave obtained for me, by the Son
of the Blessed, who hath Redeemed my
Soul from both, in the day of his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,
when and where he erected Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of his own and my Victory, upon
their ruine and destruction, spoiling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities
and Powers, and leading cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
captive. When he first entred, he
only waded therein, but after a little
while it proved so deep, that he was
forced to swim, wherein he took abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of pains, and laboured hard to
keep himself above Water, still lifting
up his face towards, and fixing his eye
on the Recompence of Reward, the
sweetness and Glory of which Sight, did
very much alleviate the pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesomeness
of his passage, and made it
easie to him, and made him speak much
of the sweet effects of Divine Goodness
and Love, and of the Beauty, Order and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57376:106"/>
Glory, Quietude; Peaceableness, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the place to which he was going;
And he continued to go until he came
to the other side, when drawing nearer
the shore more plain, and getting a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Glory of the Heavenly
Country, he did witsh a delightful smile
give a sudden start, and leaped on shore
saying, Farewel forever thou dangerous
and stormy Sea, for I have now passed
thee, and am arrived in a safe, a still, and
an Eternal Harbor; When he first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the River, he had still about him
some Remainder of Corruption, and was
cloathed with Mortality and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all which he left behind him in the
River, and so soon as ever he was got on
the other side, I could plainly perceive
that he had nothing remaining in him,
or cleaving to him, but what was perfect,
pure, and immortal.</p>
            <p>Now I saw, that as soon as ever he
came on shore, he was received, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
by a great number of the shining
Courtiers of Heaven, who had waited on
and incompassed him all the time of his
Passage through the River of <hi>Dissolution,</hi>
although then they were not visible to
him: They congratulated his safe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57376:107"/>
telling him how welcome he would
be to, and how joyfully received by
the King of the Caelestial Paradise, who
is, said they, the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and the
absolute Monarch of the Universe, adding
moreover that they were sent by him, to
be his Life-guard, and attend him in state
through the rest of his Journey, to the
place of his Coronation, which lieth, said
they, throw the very midst of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Country, and when he was come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half way thither, he was met by a
far greater number of those Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
every one of them declaring
the greatness of that Pleasure which his
Arrival afforded them, and joyned with
him in singing praises and Hallelujahs to
him who having washed him from his
sins in his own Blood, and espoused him
to himself, had now consummated the
marriage, and Crowned the Nuptials with
a full, a perfect, and an Eternal Injoyment
of each others Love, and that the joy and
delight of that happy Marriage might be
the more full and Compleat, they even
then began to Celebrate it by playing on
their Musical Instruments, the sounds
whereof yeild such an Heavenly Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Divine Harmony, that it Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57376:107"/>
exceeded those Descriptions which
some have given of the Musick of the
Spheres, although that is said to be so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
and delightful, that should it but
strongly touch the ear, it would tempt
the ravished Soul to forsake its mortal
Habitation. And thus he passed on to
the Gate of the City, which he found
wide open, and through it an abundant
entrance was administred unto him, into
the Everlasting Kingdom. As soon as he
was arrived within the Gate, the blessed
Redeemer stood with extended Arms rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receive and embrace him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first arrayed him in White, and shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Garments, placed a Crown of Glory
on his head, and palms of Triumph in his
hands; he then lead him towards, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the promise he had formerly
made him in the day when he entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant, with him, he presented him
to his Father without any kind of spot or
Defilement, being blameless in Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him for ever in the Beatifick Vision,
of whose blessed face, and the familfar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
and full fruition of whose Glory
and Love he is to live and Reign for ever
and ever, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now methoughts when I saw the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57376:108"/>
Gates opened to give admittance to
this happy Pilgrim, I took that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to look in and take a delightful view
of that blest and glorious place, which is
so much famed in sacred Story, and I
found the Prospect of it to afford such an
abundance of Pleasure and Satisfaction, I
think <hi>I</hi> shall never forget it. And I hope
I shall never sit down satisfied until I also
have obtained the Possession thereof:
This sight being so Pleasant, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of its Glory being so ravishing and
Delightful to me, I would willingly give
you a Description of the Country, in
hopes thereby to make you in Love with
it. But yet I must do it with a caution,
and beg that you would not expect I
should give you an exact and perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of a place which <hi>I</hi> only know
my self by report, or at best by that short
and transient Glimpse at a vast and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
distance, which I then obtained, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
since its extent and largeness,
its glory and sweetness <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not only
more then can be any way expressed by
the Tongue of men or Angels, or descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the most florid and ingenious
Pen, but even above, and infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all possibility of Conception too,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57376:108"/>
when the Soul most expatiates and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges
it Thoughts and Contemplations
thereon; however, assure thy self that
what I do say of it, is really true, and
infinitely more than I can either write or
think; The full Prospect and Knowledge
whereof thou must be content to stay for
till thy self shall be admitted as an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
thereof.</p>
            <p>Celestial Paradice is a place admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
scituated in a most incomparably
sweet Serene and delectable Air, infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exceeding the fairest and the best sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
place, which this World wherein
we now live can possibly produce; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advanced by the Almighty <hi>Jehovah,
who contrived and formed it by his Wisdom,
and fixed and established it by his Power,
far above the heavy Earth, whereon we walk,
and the thick foggy Air wherein we breathe,
it aspires into the purer Sky, where the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Jehovah himself ever shines, and is that
Glorious Sun whose Bright and Illustrious
Rays fill those happy Regions with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Confluence of Light, and thereby main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
an Eternal day by the help whereof,
and the Advantage of its Scituation,</hi> the
whole Universe presents it self at once to
the admiring view of its blessed Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57376:109"/>
And the whole Circumference
thereof seems to make their prying Souls
the happy Center, wherein all its Beauty
and Glory Conspires to meet; no noysom
or offensive scents can possibly penetrate
or infect that sweet and Blissful Place,
for there is nothing affects that Air, but
what is pure and Odoriferous, and serves
only to perfume the Heavenly Mansions
with the more exhilerating Fragrancy,
and moreover, a perpetual Calm and
Quietude reigns in that happy Region,
and therewith Eternally crowns all its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Felicities.</p>
            <p>For there you shall hear nothing but
what will infinitely delight and charm
thy ravished Soul into sweet and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
contemplations. And when thou shalt
hear the infinite praises of thy great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
sung forth by all his works of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and every Creature thou beholdest
with Chearful Hyms and Seraphick Songs,
Celebrate the Admirable Wisdom and
the Infinite Goodness of him that Created
it; The Harmony thereof will be so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing,
and their imploment so pleasing,
that thou thy self wilt jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and dance in
company, and rejoyce and sing together
with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as the Situation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57376:109"/>
is delightful and pleasant, so are
its Dimension, large and extensive, its
Buildings stately and glorious, and all
those varieties wherewith it is beautified
and adorned, are splendid and rich, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where becoming the Majesty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that Palace, which is the Royal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Palace of the Great King. The
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Universe, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
and Seat where the Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of Heaven and Earth, whose Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is an everlasting Dominion, and who
extends his Reign throughout all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
keeps his Court, and whlther his
happy subjects repair to behold the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of his Glory, stand before him as his
devoted Servants, and worship and adore
the Soveraign of the World, to view and
admire the Wisdom and Righteousness of
his Government, the Goodness and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Laws, the strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
methods of his Grace, the admirable
continuance of his works, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
care he takes of every Creature, the
Infinite extent of his Providence, the
greatness of his Power, and his absolute
and unaccountable Authority whereby he
unites those things which were in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the greatest distances, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57376:110"/>
the combinations and confederacys
of those who are enemies to his interest
and people, when they are most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and closely united, and renders all the
<hi>Matchiavillian</hi> designs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
barren &amp; unfruitful, or else makes
them prove abortive jnst when they are
ready to bring forth, and the disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the devices of the crafty, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the subtilty of the wise, makes the
adversaries of his Church become the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of their own ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
And there likewise his blessed sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
satiate their Ravisht Souls with
the delightful and satisfying views of the
Beauty of his Holiness, the brightness
and extent of his Understanding, the
riches and the freeness of his Love,
Righteousness and equity of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
the inexhaustibleness of his Goodness
and the Immutability of his Faithfulness
and Truth.</p>
            <p>Then next to the King himself there sits
the Kings Son, the Blessed Redeemer and the
Mediator of the new Covenant, upon a
Throne of Glory at the Right hand of
the Father, whose Glorified Body being
now in the Meridian of his Glory, Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Triumph, is filled with greater
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57376:110"/>
light &amp; shines with infinitely more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and splendor then the Sun, vvhen shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningin
its strength. And there the eternal
Spirit performs his Divine Operations in
the Souls of the Redeemed more fully
and perfectly &amp; constantly, more sensibly
&amp; feelingly, and therefore more Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to them, and vvith a perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
that admits of no intermission, but
he is ever inlarging and disposing, fitting
and capacitating their happy souls to
drink in those eternal pleasures and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
delights whereinto they are plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and wherein they bathe themselves;
And is ever conveying into, and more
absolutely then when they vvere in their
imperfect state, filling them vvith the joys
of the Holy Ghost, and the peace of <hi>God</hi>
vvhich passes all understanding. Then
you have the holy Angels vvhose bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and splendor likevvise very much
conduces to beautify, &amp; adorn the place:
And there also dwell the <hi>Redeemed,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one being placed upon a Throne of
Majesty, vvith Imperial Crovvns on their
heads, and Palms in their hands, shine like
the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,
in vvhich station they ever behold the
face of <hi>God</hi> in Righteousness, and obtain
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57376:111"/>
such an understanding and <hi>knowledge</hi> of
him as perfectly turns them also into the
nature of him that they behold, and
transforms them into the likeness of that
holy and pure <hi>Being which</hi> they eternally
<hi>delight</hi> to be viewing of, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of <hi>whose Glory and Goodness doth
as it were overshadow their inamoured souls,</hi>
and by living animates them into the
same <hi>Disposition with its self.</hi> And that
<hi>Divine Beauty whereon they everlastingly
feed and feast their eyes, imprints its
own form upon their souls,</hi> and renders
them fair and Beauteous <hi>with</hi> the <hi>very</hi>
same lovely Excellencies <hi>which</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to behold in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now methought when I had taken
this view of the Caelestial Paradice, I
wished that I might have been permitted
to enter into it likewise. But whilst I
was thus wishing with my self,</hi> the
place began to appear more bright
than before, and the <hi>Glory</hi> and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of it increased to such a <hi>degree,</hi>
that my eyes <hi>were</hi> too <hi>weak</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it, nor could my Mortality
longer endure the sight of its <hi>Glory
which now</hi> so <hi>ovewhelmed</hi> me, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts
I sunk <hi>down</hi> and fainted <hi>away;</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:57376:111"/>
Whereupon I awoke, and found my self
still grovling on the earth, in the same
wicked and prophane, and carnal, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
and secure World, wherein I lived
before I fell asleep and dreamed this
Dream.</p>
