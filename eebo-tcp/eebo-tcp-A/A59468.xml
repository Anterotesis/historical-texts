            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PRINCIPLES
OF THE
Cyprianic Age, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Acknowledge you have performed your Promise. The
Author of the <hi>Defence of the Vindication of the Church of</hi>
Scotland, <hi>in Answer to an Apology OF</hi> (he should have
said <hi>FOR) the Clergy of</hi> Scotland, has indeed said so
as you affirmed: And I ask your Pardon for putting you to
the trouble of sending me his Book and Pointing to <hi>Sect. 39.
Page</hi> 34. where he has said so. But now, after all, what thô
he has said so? And said so, so boldly? Do you think his
bare saying so is enough to determine our Question? Don't
mistake it. That which made me so backward to believe he
had said so, was not any dreadful Apprehension I had of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Reason or Authority; but a Perswasion that none of
his Party would have been so rash, as to have put their being
or not being <hi>Schismaticks</hi> upon such a desperate Issue. And
that you may not apprehend my Perswasion was unreasonable,
I shall first take to Task what he hath said; and then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
add something concerning our main Argument. His
Words are these.</p>
            <p>Arg. 5. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Notion of <hi>Schism</hi> is, when one separateth
from his own Bishop. This the Presbyterians do: <hi>Ergo. A.</hi> All
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100833:4"/>
the strength of this Argument lieth in the sound of Words. A
Bishop, in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was not a <hi>Diocesan,</hi> with sole <hi>Power</hi>
of <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Ordination.</hi> If he prove that, we shall Give
<hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>him</hi> leave to call us <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> A Bishop, then,
was the <hi>Pastor</hi> of a <hi>Flock,</hi> or the <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
If he can prove, that we separate from our <hi>Pastors,</hi> or from the
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> with their <hi>Moderator,</hi> under whose Inspection we
ought to be, let him call us what he will: But we disown the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in <hi>Scotland</hi> from being our Bishops; we can neither own their
Episcopal Authority, nor any Pastoral Relation that they have to us.
<hi>Thus he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, if one had a mind to catch at Words, what a Field
might he have here? For Instance; Suppose the Word <hi>Diocess</hi>
was not in use in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, as applied to a particular
Bishop's <hi>District;</hi> Doth it follow, that the Thing now signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by it, was not then to be found? Again; What could
move him to insinuate, that we assign the <hi>sole Power</hi> of <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
and <hi>Ordination</hi> to our <hi>Diocesan Bishop?</hi> When did our
Bishops <hi>claim</hi> that <hi>sole Power?</hi> When was it ascribed to them
by the Constitution? When did any of our Bishops attempt
to Exercise it? When did a <hi>Scotish</hi> Bishop offer, e. g. to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain</hi>
or <hi>Depose</hi> a Presbyter, without the Concurrence of other
Presbyters? When was such a <hi>sole Power</hi> deem'd <hi>Necessary</hi>
for Raising a Bishop to all the due Elevations of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Authority? How easie is it to distinguish between a <hi>Sole
and a Chief Power?</hi> Between a <hi>Power Superiour</hi> to all other
<hi>Powers,</hi> and a Power <hi>Exclusive</hi> of all other <hi>Powers?</hi> Between
a Power, without, or against which, no other <hi>Powers</hi> can Act;
thô they may, in Conjunction with it, or Subordination to
it: And a <hi>Power,</hi> destroying all other <hi>Powers,</hi> or disabling
them from Acting? Once more, How loose and Ambiguous
is that part of his Definition of a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time,
in which he calls him, <hi>The Pastor of a Flock?</hi> May not a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and his Diocess, be called a <hi>Pastor</hi> and a Flock, in as great
propriety of Speech, as a <hi>Presbyterian Minister</hi> and his <hi>Parish?</hi>
Sure I am, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Contemporaries thought so, as
you may learn hereafter.</p>
            <p>How easie were it, I say, for one to insist on such Escapes,
if he had a mind for it? But I love not Jangle; and I must
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100833:4"/>
avoid Prolixity: And therefore considering the State of the
Controversie between our Author and the Apologist, and
supposing he intended (however he expressed it) to speak
home to the Apologist's Argument; the Force and Purpose
of his Answer, as I take it, must be this.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That an Argument drawn from such as were called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, to such as are now so called in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> is not good. That a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time,
was nothing like one of our modern <hi>Scotish</hi> Bishops; i. e. a
Church Governour superiour to, and having a Prelatick
Power over, all other Church-Governours within such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict
as we commonly call a <hi>Diocess.</hi> That a Bishop then was no
more than a <hi>Single Presbyter, or Pastor</hi> of a <hi>single Flock,</hi> (such
a Flock as could conveniently meet together in one Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
for the Publick Offices of Religion; such a Flock as
the People of one single Parish are, in the modern Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Notion of a Parish,) acting in <hi>Parity</hi> with other
<hi>single Pastors</hi> of other <hi>single Flocks</hi> or Parishes. Or, at most,
That he was but the <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> taking both
Terms in the modern current Presbyterian Sense; i. e. as
<hi>Moderator signfies One, who, as such, is no Church Governour,
nor hath any Iurisdiction over his Brethren: One, whose Power
is meerly Ordinative, not Decisive; To be the Mouth of the
Meeting, not to be their Will or Commanding Faculty: To keep
Order in the Manner and Managing of what cometh before
them; Not to Determine what is Debated amongst them.</hi> And
as <hi>Presbytery signifies</hi> such a Number of <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi>
Presbyters living and having their Cures within such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict;
meeting together upon Occasion, and acting in
<hi>Parity</hi> in the Administration of the Government, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church. That therefore our <hi>Scotish Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
cannot be called <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Notion of
<hi>Schism,</hi> unless it can be proved, That they <hi>Separate</hi> from
their Pastor, or <hi>Teaching Presbyter,</hi> who has such a Parish
assigned to him for his Charge: Or, (not from the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> who is not; but) from the <hi>Presbytery</hi>
(which is the Principle of Unity) with their <hi>Moderator.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This, I say, I take to be the Purpose of our Author's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Apologist's Argument; on the Force whereof he
ventures his Parties being, or not being, <hi>Schismatick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> If I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100833:5"/>
have mistaken his Meaning, I protest I have not done it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
I am pretty sure, I have not, in the Definition of a
Moderator; for I have Transcribed it, Word for Word, from
one whom I take to be a dear Friend of his, intirely of the
same Principles and Sentiments with him; and whose Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I am apt to think, he will not readily Reject. I mean,
the Author of <hi>The Vindication of the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>in
Answer to the Ten Questions<note n="a" place="margin">Ad Quest. 1. Sect. 5.</note>. And doth not our Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in this same 39th <hi>Section,</hi> (part whereof I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,)
affirm, That <hi>Fifty Years before the first Council of</hi>
Nice, (i. e. some 17 or 18 Years after St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,)
<hi>the Hierarchy was not in the Church?</hi> And that however
some of the Names might have been, yet the Church-Power and
Dominion, signified by them, was not then in Being?</hi> Plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting,
that the Church then was Governed by Pastors
acting in <hi>Parity,</hi> after the Presbyterian Model. In short,
what our Author hath said, when duly considered, will be
found to be no Answer at all to the Apologist's Argument,
if it is not to be understood in the Sense I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</p>
            <p>Taking it for granted, therefore, that I have hit his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I hope you will not deny, that, If I shall prove that a
<hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was more than a <hi>Pastor</hi> of a <hi>Flock,</hi>
or the <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in the Presbyterian Sense of
the Terms: If I shall prove, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> then had really that
which cannot be denied to have been true, Genuine <hi>Episcopal</hi>
or <hi>Prelaiick Power:</hi> If I can prove, that he <hi>acted</hi> in a Real
<hi>Superiority over,</hi> not in <hi>Parity with</hi> other Church-Governours,
even <hi>Pastors:</hi> If I shall prove these Things, I say, I hope
you'l grant, our Author is fairly bound by his Word to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that he and his Brethren <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.</hi>
Let us try it then: And now, Sir,</p>
            <p>Before I come to my main Proofs, consider if it may not
be deemed a shrewd Presumption against our Author in this
matter, That generally the great Champions for Presbytery,

our Author not only builds much on his Authority<note n="c" place="margin">Sect. 32. p. 28.</note>, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours

Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his famous Epistle to <hi>Fabius</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> Recorded by <hi>Eusebius</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Hist. Ecd. lib. 6. cap. 43.</note>, positively affirm, That there
were then in the Church of <hi>Rome 42 Acolyths,</hi> and <hi>52 Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists,
Lectors,</hi> and <hi>Door-keepers?</hi> But this, as I said, only by the
way.</p>
            <p>That which I am concerned about at present, is, That
when these great Patrons of Presbytery, these truly Learned
Men, whom I named, have all so frankly yielded, that
there was real <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the Church in, and before, St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s
time; yet our Author should affirm, so boldly, that
there was no such Thing: That there was no <hi>Hierarchy</hi> in
the Church <hi>then,</hi> nor for many Years after. Has our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
been a more <hi>diligent Searcher</hi> into <hi>Antiquity,</hi> than those
great <hi>Antiquaries</hi> were, that he was thus able to contradict
their Discoveries? I am not apt to believe it. However, as
I said, let this pass only for a Presumption against him. I
proceed to other Arguments. And,</p>
            <p>1. I observe, that, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, every Church all
the World over, at least, every Church, Constituted and
Organized, according to the Principles which then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
had a <hi>Bishop, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> by whom
she was Ruled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100833:6"/>
Thus, for Example, we find express Mention of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
Presbyters, and Deacons, of the Church of <hi>Adryme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Presbyteri &amp; Diaconi in <hi>Adrum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ep. 49. p. 91.</note>; for <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells <hi>Corneius,</hi> That when <hi>He</hi> and <hi>Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
came to that City, <hi>Polycarpus</hi> the Bishop was absent, and
the Presbyters and Deacons were ignorant of what had been
Resolved on by the Body of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops, about wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus</hi> should be more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and at the same time
there were, in that City, 8 Presbyters at sewest: For we read
of three, <hi>Rogatianus, Britius,</hi> and <hi>Numidicus,</hi> who adhered
to him<note n="i" place="margin">Ep. 43.</note>. And five who took part with <hi>Felicissimus</hi> against him,
when that Deacon made his Schism<note n="k" place="margin">Ep. 59.</note>. I hope I need not be at pains to prove, that there were Deacons then in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Church.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Cornelius,</hi> in the afore-mentioned Epistle to <hi>Fabius,</hi>
tells him, That while himself was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> there
were in that City no fewer than 46 <hi>Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>byters,</hi> and 7 <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
&amp;c. A most flourishing Clergy,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls it<note n="l" place="margin">Ep. 59. p. 139.</note>.
Whoso pleases, may see the like Account of the Church of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the same Times, in <hi>Eusebius</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">H. E. lib. 7. cap. 11.</note>, Indeed,</p>
            <p>If we may believe St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> there was no Church then

His Argument is, That there is but <hi>One Church,</hi> and <hi>One Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,</hi>
all the World over; and that Catholick and Orthodox
Bishops were regularly planted in every Province and City,
and therefore <hi>Novatianus</hi> could not but be a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> who,
<hi>contrary to Divine Institution, and the Fundamental Laws of
Unity, laboured to super-induce false Bishops into these Cities, where
True and Orthodox Bishops were already planted.</hi> And he Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons again upon the same Supposition, in the beginning of

Such Presbyters they were, I say, who were then,
contra-distinguished from the Bishop: For, as for your <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Elders,</hi>
your <hi>Ruling,</hi> contra-distinct from <hi>Teaching, Presbyters,</hi>
now so much in vogue; there is as profound a Silence of
them in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Works and Time, as there is of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>The Sanquhar Declaration:</hi> And
yet, considering how much he has left upon Record about
the Governours, the Government, and the Discipline of the
Church, if there had been such Presbyters, then, it is next
to a Miracle that he should not, so much as once, have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
them.</p>
            <p>3. I observe, that the Bishops Power, his Authority, his
Pastoral Relation, (call it as you will,) extended to all the
Christians within his District. <hi>E. g. Cornelius</hi> was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
and directly <hi>Superiour</hi> to all the Christians in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and they were his <hi>Subjects.</hi> So it was also with <hi>Fabius,</hi> and
the Christians of <hi>Antioch; Dionysius,</hi> and the Christians of
<hi>Alexandria; Cyprian,</hi> and the Christians of <hi>Carthage, &amp;c.</hi>
The Bishops prelation, whatever it was, related not solely
to the Clergy, or solely to the Laity, but to both, equally
and formally. How fully might this Point be proved, if it
were needful? Indeed, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> defines a <hi>Church</hi> to be
<hi>A People united to their Priest,</hi> and <hi>A Flock adhering to their
Pastor.</hi> And that by the Terms <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Pasto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Bishop,</hi> is plain from what immediately follows; for he
tells <hi>Florentius Pupianus</hi> there, That from that common and

<hi>That the Bishop is in the Church, and the Church in the Bishop;</hi>

            <p>And now, Sir, thô the Monuments of the <hi>Cyprianic</hi> Age
could afford us no more than these three Things which I
have proved from them, they would be of sufficient force to
overthrow our Author's <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>Bishop</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100833:8"/>
time, as to both Parts of it; and demonstrate to every think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Man's conviction, That he was neither <hi>The Pastor of the
Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck,</hi> nor <hi>The Moderator of a Presbytery,</hi> in our Author's sense
of the Terms.</p>
            <p>1. Not the <hi>Pastor</hi> of a <hi>Flock, i. e. a single Presbyter,</hi> having
the Charge of a <hi>single Parish,</hi> after the Presbyterian Model:
For, a Bishop, in those Times, had many such Presbyters
under him. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself: (whatever he had more) had
no sewer than Eight under him in the City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the adjacent Villages. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was over Forty six in
the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> I know not how many <hi>Dionysius</hi> was over
at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Polycarpus</hi> at <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </hi> but it is certain,
they were in the <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ral</hi> Number. So it was all the Christian
World over, as I have proved. A <hi>Bishop</hi> then, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
time, was a <hi>Pastor</hi> indeed, but it was of a <hi>Diocess; i. e:</hi> all the
Christians within such a <hi>District</hi> were his <hi>Flock;</hi> and he had a
direct, formal, and immediate <hi>Pastoral Relation</hi> to them all,
thô at the same time, within the same <hi>District,</hi> there were
many <hi>inferior Pastors</hi> who were subordinate and subject to
him.</p>
            <p>2. He was as little a meer <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in our
Author's sense of the Terms. A <hi>Presbyterian Moderator, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
such, is no Church Governour at all:</hi> A <hi>Bishop,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
time, as such, was <hi>Chief Pastor, Iudge, Head, Master, Rector,
Governour,</hi> of all the Christians within his <hi>District.</hi> A <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rator, as such, has no direct, immediate, formal Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the People,</hi> but only to the <hi>Presbytery. He is the Mouth,</hi>
and <hi>keeps Order</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>managing</hi> of the <hi>Affairs</hi> of
the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> not of the <hi>Church,</hi> or rather <hi>Churches,</hi> within
the Bounds of that Presbytery. But a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
time, was quite another thing: His <hi>Prelacy,</hi> whatever it was,
<hi>related</hi> to the <hi>Laity,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s,
<hi>e. g.</hi> to as many Christians as required the subordinate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of, at least, Eight Presbyters: <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s to as many
as required the subordinate Labours of <hi>Forty Six:</hi> To a Body
of Christians, in which, besides Forty six <hi>Presbyters,</hi> Seven
<hi>Deacons,</hi> Seven <hi>Sub-Deacons,</hi> Forty two <hi>Acolyths,</hi> Fifty two
<hi>Exorcists, Lectors</hi> and <hi>Door-keepers, there were more than
Fifteen hundred Widows and poor People who subsisted by Charity:</hi>
And, besides all these, <hi>a mighty and innumerable Laity,</hi> as

                  </gap> Apud Eusib. H. E. Lib. 6. cap. 43.</note>. These Things, I say, might be sufficient in
all Reason to confute our Author's Notion. But then, this is
not all, for let us consider,</p>
            <p>II. How a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was Promoted to
his Chair, to that <hi>sublime Top of the Priesthood</hi> (as he calls
it)<note n="k" place="margin">Sacerdotii sublime fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium. Ep. 55. p. 103.</note>. And we shall easily collect another Demonstration
against our Author's Notion. For, by the Principles of those
Times, it was plains,</p>
            <p>I. That there could be no Lawful nor Allowable Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of One to a Bishoprick which had been Possessed before,
unless there was a Clear, Canonical, and Unquestionable
<hi>Vacancy.</hi> It was a received Maxim then, That there could be
but <hi>one Bishop at once in a Church.</hi> When a <hi>See</hi> was once Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically
filled, whosoever else pretended to be Bishop of
that <hi>See,</hi> was not a <hi>second Bishop,</hi> but <hi>none</hi> at all, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Judgment<note n="l" place="margin">Et cum post primum secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus esse non possit, quisquis post unum, qui solus esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat, factus est, non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Transcribe only One from Ep. 69. because he fully reasons
the Case in it. There was a Controversie between <hi>Cornelius</hi>
and <hi>Novatianus,</hi> whether was Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> decides it. <hi>The Church is one</hi> (says he);
<hi>and this one Chuch cannot be both within and without: If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the True Church is with</hi> Novatianus, <hi>She was not with</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius.
<hi>But if She was with</hi> Cornelius, <hi>who succeeded to Bishop</hi>
Fabianus <hi>by lawful Ordination, and whom God honoured with
Martyrdom, as well as with the Episcopal Dignity,</hi> Novatianus <hi>is
not in the Church; nor can he be acknowledged as a Bishop, who,
contemning the Evangelical and Apostolical Tradition, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
to none, hath sprung from himself, He can by no means
either have or hold a Church, who is not Ordained in the Church;
for the Church cannot be without Herself, nor divided against Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
&amp;c. And a little after, <hi>Our Lord recommending to us the
Unity which is of Divine Institution, saith,</hi> I and my Father are
One; <hi>and again, Obliging the Church to keep this Unity, he
saith,</hi> There shall be One Flock, and One Pastor: <hi>But if
the</hi> Flock <hi>is</hi> One, <hi>How can he be reputed to be of the Flock, who
is not numbred with the Flock? Or how can be he deem'd a</hi> Pastor,
<hi>who (while the</hi> True Pastor <hi>lives and rules the</hi> Flock <hi>by a succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100833:9"/>
Ordination) succeeds to none, but begins from himself?
Such an one is an Alien, is Profane, is an Enemy to Christian
Peace and Unity. He dwells not in the House of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the
Church of God: None can dwell there but the Sons of Concord and
Unanimity</hi>

               </gap>, I think
we have our Author's Definition of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
time, fairly routed a second time: For,</p>
            <p>How could the Maxim of but <hi>One Bishop, at once,</hi> in a
<hi>Church</hi> hold, if that <hi>Bishop</hi> was nothing but a <hi>single Presbyter?</hi>
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was but <hi>One Church;</hi> so was the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Carthage:</hi> And yet, in each of these <hi>Churches,</hi> there were
many <hi>single Presbyters.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was no more than a <hi>single
Presbyter,</hi> in the Presbyterian Sense, what needed so much
work about him? Why, <hi>e. g.</hi> convene all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of a
<hi>Province,</hi> such as <hi>Africa or Numidia</hi> was, for the <hi>Election</hi> and
<hi>Ordination</hi> of a <hi>single Presbyter</hi> in <hi>Carthage,</hi> where there were
Presbyters <hi>more</hi> than <hi>enough</hi> to have performed all the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
What needed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to make such work
about supplying such a Vacancy as was there, before <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
was Promoted? Why a Convention of <hi>Sixteen</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Bishops</hi> to give him Holy Orders? Might not the
<hi>Forty Six,</hi> who lived in <hi>Rome,</hi> have served the <hi>turn?</hi> Might
not these <hi>Forty Six,</hi> I say, have filled <hi>Fabianus</hi> his <hi>Room</hi> with
far greater <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Expedition?</hi> If they made such work,
and had such Difficulties, (as we find they had about a <hi>Bishop,</hi>)
in setling <hi>One single Brother Presbyter,</hi> when, according to our
Author's Principles, they had the full Power of doing it, what
had become of them, if <hi>Thirty, nay Twenty,</hi> nay <hi>Ten</hi> of the
<hi>Forty six,</hi> had all died in one Year? Sure, they had never
got so many Vacancies filled. And then,</p>
            <p>Were not <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatianus</hi> Presbyters of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of that City? If so, what need of a <hi>new Election,</hi> and a
<hi>new Ordination</hi> for making them <hi>Presbyters</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> of
which they were <hi>Presbyters</hi> already? Had it not been pretty
pleasant, in such a grave, serious, persecuted State of the
Church, to have seen two eminent Men, already <hi>Presbyters</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> making so much work about being made <hi>Presbyters</hi> of
<hi>Rome?</hi> And all the Clergy and Christians of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay sooner
or later, of all the Christian World, engaged in the Quarrel?
What had this been other than the very <hi>Mystery</hi> of <hi>Ridiculousness?</hi>

Again,</p>
            <p>How often did the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> meet, in the Interval
between <hi>Fabianus</hi> his Death, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Promotion?
How many excellent Epistles did they write to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Bishops and Churches, and these, about the most
weighty and important Matters during that Vacancy? They
wrote that which is the <hi>Eighth</hi> in Number, amongst St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Epistles to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Clergy, and, at the same time, <hi>One</hi>
to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> then in his Retirement, which is lost, They
wrote that notable Epistle, which is the <hi>Thirtieth</hi> in Number,
in which they not only mention other of their Epistles which
they had wrote to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and which are not now extant;
but also Epistles, one or more, which they had sent to <hi>Sicily.</hi>
They wrote also that considerable Epistle, which is in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the <hi>Thirty sixth.</hi> It is not to be doubted that they wrote
many more. How many Meetings and Consultations had
they, during these <hi>Sixteen Months,</hi> about the Affairs of the
Church, and particularly, the Case of the <hi>Lapsi,</hi> which was
then so much agitated? Is it probable, that they wanted a
<hi>Moderator; a Mouth</hi> of their <hi>Meeting;</hi> One to keep <hi>Order</hi> in
the <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>managing</hi> of the Affairs were brought before
them all that time, and in all those Meetings? How could
they, without one, handle Matters with Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency?
And what was there to hinder them from having
<hi>one,</hi> if they had a mind for him? Might they not have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<hi>one</hi> as safely as they met? Might they not have chosen
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100833:11"/>
               <hi>one</hi> at every Meeting, according to the Principles of <hi>Parity?</hi>
Farther:</p>
            <p>What need of so much Parade about the <hi>Election</hi> of a
<hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as was then about the <hi>Election</hi> of
a <hi>Bishop?</hi> Why the <hi>People chose</hi> him, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of those, who think that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was for <hi>Popular
Elections?</hi> What was the <hi>People</hi>'s Interest? How was it their
Concern, who was <hi>Moderator</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery?</hi> What was
his Influence, <hi>De jure,</hi> at least, in the Government of the
Church, more than the Influence of any other Member of
the Presbytery? Nay, is it not confessed, that, as <hi>Moderator,</hi>
he was <hi>no Church-Governour</hi> at all? That he had no <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
over his Brethren? That his <hi>Power</hi> was only <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
not <hi>Decisive?</hi> To be the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Meeting,</hi> not to
be their <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Commanding Faculty?</hi> To keep <hi>Order</hi> in the
<hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Managing</hi> of what came before them, not to
<hi>determine</hi> what was <hi>Debated</hi> amongst them? Why then were
the <hi>People</hi> so much concern'd about him? What Benefits, or
what Harm, could redound to <hi>them</hi> by ones being <hi>Moderator</hi>
of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> whatever he was? Besides, as I have shewed
before, as <hi>Moderator</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> he had <hi>relation</hi> only to
the <hi>Presbytery:</hi> At least, he had none directly, immediately,
and formally to the <hi>People.</hi> What pretence, then, could the
<hi>People</hi> have to Interest themselves in his <hi>Election?</hi> Nay, say,
(as I am apt to think it ought to be said, I am sure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
cannot be made appear from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>) that he was
not chosen <hi>by</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> but only <hi>in</hi> their <hi>Presence;</hi> and the
same Argument will take place, as is obvious to any body.
Farther yet.</p>
            <p>What need of Convocating so many from the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
for managing the <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Moderator, E. g.</hi> for the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> If a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was
nothing but a <hi>Presbyterian Moderator,</hi> then the <hi>Bishops</hi> convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
for managing the <hi>Election</hi> of a <hi>Moderator,</hi> were <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
too: And so, by consequence, <hi>Sixteen Moderators</hi> of other
<hi>Presbyteries</hi> met at <hi>Rome</hi> to constitute a <hi>Moderator</hi> for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Presbytery.</hi> And might not the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have
<hi>chosen</hi> their own <hi>Moderator</hi> without the Trouble or the Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>so many Moderators</hi> of other Presbyteries? Once
more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100833:12"/>
What Necessity, nay, what Congruity, of a <hi>new Imposition
of Hands,</hi> of a <hi>new Ordination, a new Mission</hi> for constituting
<hi>One a Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery?</hi> And this too, to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>none</hi> but <hi>Moderators</hi> of other <hi>Presbyteries?</hi> Thus, <hi>e. g.</hi>
it behoved <hi>Six Moderators</hi> to meet at <hi>Capsis,</hi> to <hi>Ordain a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator</hi>
for the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Capsis;</hi> and <hi>Sixteen</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
a Moderator</hi> for the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And, after he was
<hi>Ordained,</hi> it behoved <hi>Novatianus</hi> to be at so much pains to get
together <hi>Three Moderators,</hi> to <hi>Ordain</hi> himself an <hi>Anti-Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
Who can think on these Things without smiling? But
perhaps you may think, I have insisted on this Argument
more than enough; and therefore I shall leave it, and proceed
to other Considerations. To go on, then.</p>
            <p>A Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, thus Elected, Ordained,
and Possessed of his Chair, did bear a <hi>double Relation, One to
the particular Church</hi> over which he was set, and <hi>another</hi> to the
<hi>Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catholick,</hi> an integrant part whereof, the particular
Church, was, of which he was Bishop. The consideration
of each of these <hi>Relations</hi> will furnish us with fresh Arguments
against our Author's <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> I shall begin with the <hi>Relation</hi>
he bore to his own <hi>particular</hi> Church. And,</p>
            <p>FIRST: The first Thing I observe about him, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
shall be, That he was the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to <hi>Her.</hi>
Whosoever adhered <hi>to</hi> him, and lived <hi>in</hi> his Communion, was
<hi>in</hi> the Church a Catholick Christian. Whosoever separated
<hi>from</hi> him, was <hi>out</hi> of the Church, and a <hi>Schismatick.</hi> He
was the <hi>Head</hi> of all the Christians living within his <hi>District;</hi>
and they were <hi>One Body, One Society, One Church,</hi> by depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him, by being subject to him, by keeping to his
Communion. He was the <hi>Sun,</hi> and they were the <hi>Beams;</hi>
he was the <hi>Root,</hi> and they were the <hi>Branches;</hi> he was the
<hi>Fountain,</hi> and they were the <hi>Streams;</hi> As St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> explains
the Matter<note n="a" place="margin">Unit. Eccl. p. 108.</note>. This is a Point of great Consequence, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering that it is the Foundation of the Apologist's
Argument, our Author's Answer to which I am examining:
and therefore, give me leave to handle it somewhat fully.
And I proceed by these Steps.</p>
            <p>I. There was nothing St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Catholick Bishops,
his Contemporaries, valued more, reckoned of higher Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100833:12"/>
or laid greater Stress upon, than the <hi>Unity</hi> of the
Church: And there was <hi>no Sin</hi> they represented at more
Heinous, or more Criminal, than the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In their reckoning, <hi>Unity</hi> was the great <hi>Badge</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
God heard the <hi>Prayers</hi> that were put up in <hi>Unity</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Unit. Eccl. p. 112.</note>, but
not those that were performed in <hi>Schism.</hi> Christian Peace,
Brotherly Concord, and the Unity of People in the true
Faith and Worship of God, was accounted of greater value
by them, than all other imaginable Sacrifices<note n="c" place="margin">Sacrificium Deo majus est Pax nostra, &amp; fraterna con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, &amp; de unitate Patris &amp; Spiritus Sancti plebs adunata. <hi>Cyp.</hi> de Orat. Dom. p. 149.</note>. Nothing

Names,</hi> and what <hi>horrid Notions,</hi> these Primitive Worthies
gave them, and had of them? <hi>Schism,</hi> to them, was the
<hi>Devil's Device</hi> for <hi>subverting</hi> the <hi>Faith, corrupting</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi>
and <hi>cutting Unity</hi>

            <p>Such, I say, were the Notions the Holy Fathers, in those
early Times of the Church, had of Schismaticks; and such
were the Names they gave them. And certainly whoso se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
considers how much <hi>Schism</hi> is condemned in Holy
Writ; what an <hi>Enemy</hi> it is to the <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Power,</hi> and the
<hi>Propagation</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and how much it stands in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the <hi>Holy, Humble, Peaceable, Patient, Meek,</hi> and
<hi>Charitable Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> Whoso considers, that our
Blessed Savious's great Errand into the World, was to <hi>Unite
all</hi> his <hi>Disciples</hi> here into <hi>one Body,</hi> and <hi>one Communion,</hi> that
they might Eternally be Blessed in the full Enjoyment of <hi>one
Communion</hi> with the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> in Heaven
hereafter: Whoso, I say, considers these Things, cannot but
confess, that <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks deserve</hi> all these <hi>hard
Names,</hi> and <hi>answer</hi> all these <hi>terrible Notions.</hi> Now</p>
            <p>2. That, for the Preservation of Unity, and the Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Schism, in every particular Church, all were bound
by the Principles of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Age to <hi>live</hi> in the <hi>Bishops
Communion;</hi> and to own and look upon him as the <hi>Principle of
Unity</hi> to that Church of which he was <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Ruler,</hi>
might be made appear from a vast Train of Testimonies.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100833:13"/>
But I shall content myself with a few. Thus, for Example,
when some of the <hi>Lapsed</hi> presumed to write to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and design themselves, without a Bishop, by the Name of a
<hi>Church;</hi> How did the Holy Man resent it? Consider how
he begins his Answer to them. <hi>Our Lord,</hi> (says he) <hi>whose
Precepts we ought to Honour and Obey, Instituting the Honour of a
Bishop, and the Contexture of a Church, saith thus to</hi> Peter <hi>in the
Gospel;</hi> I say unto thee, thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this <hi>Rock</hi>
will I build my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not
prevail against it: And I will give unto thee the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. From thence by the Vicissitudes of
Times and Successions, the Ordination of Bishops, and the Frame of
the Church, are transmitted so, as that the Church is built upon the
Bishops, and all her Affairs are ordered by them as the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
And therefore, seeing this is God's appointment, I cannot but
admire the bold Temerity of some, who, writing to me, call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Church; when a Church is only to be found in the Bishop,
the Clergy, and the faithful Christians. God forbid, that a number
of Lapsed should be called a Church,</hi> &amp;c. Consider how he
Reasons. By Divine Institution, there cannot be a Church
without a Bishop: The Church is founded on the Bishop:
The Bishop, as Chief Ruler, orders all the Affairs of the
Church: Therefore, those Lapsed ought not to have called
themselves a Church, seeing they had no Bishop, no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

And, as I observed before, in his Epistle to <hi>Florentinus Pupia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
he defines a <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>a People united to their Priest, and
a Flock adhering to their Pastor,</hi> &amp;c. and from thence tells <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus,</hi>
That he ought to consider, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> is in the
<hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Bishop:</hi> So that if any are not
<hi>with</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> they are not <hi>in the Church</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Vide supra, pag. 8.</note>. And how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly
doth he Reason the Case in his Book of the <hi>Unity of
the Church? Can he seem to himself,</hi> says he, <hi>to be with Christ,
who is against Christ's Priests? Who separates himself from the
Society of Christ's Clergy and People? That Man bears Arms
against the Church: He fights against God's Ordinance: He is an
Enemy of the Altar: A Rebel against Christ's Sacrifice. He is
Perfidious, and not Faithful; Sacrilegious, and not Religious. He
is an Undutiful Servant, and Impious Son, an Hostile Brother,
who can contemn God's Bishops, and forsake his Priests, and dares to
set up another Altar, and offer up unlawful Prayers</hi>

4. By the Principles of those Times, the Bishop was so
much the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to the Church which he Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
the whole Society had such a Dependance on him,
was so <hi>Vircuaily</hi> in him, and represented by him; that what
he <hi>did,</hi> as Bishop, was reputed the <hi>Deed</hi> of the whole Church
which he Ruled. If he was Oxthodox and Catholick, so
was the Body united to him reckoned to be. If Heretical
or Schismatical, it went under the same Denomination. If
he <hi>denied</hi> the Faith, whoso adhered to him, after that, were
reputed to have <hi>denied</hi> it. If he <hi>confessed</hi> the Faith, the
whole Church was reckoned to have <hi>confessed</hi> it in him Thus,</p>
            <p>We find, when <hi>Martialis</hi> and <hi>Basilides,</hi> two <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops,
committed Idolatry, and so forfeited their Bishopricks, and
yet some of their People inclined to continue in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with other 36 Bishops, tells those Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That it behoved them not to flatter themselves, by
thinking, that they could <hi>continue to Communicate with Polluted
Bishops, and withal, themselves continue Pure and Unpolluted:
For all that communicated with them, would be Partakers of their
Guilt: And therefore,</hi> (as they go on,) <hi>a People obeying and
fearing God ought to separate from Criminal Bishops, and be careful
not to mix with them in their Sacrilegious Sacrifices</hi>

5. Neither was this of the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s being the <hi>Principle of
Unity</hi> to the Church which he govern'd a Novel Notion,
newly <hi>Minted</hi> in the <hi>Cyprianic</hi> Age: For, besides that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
was generally believed, <hi>then,</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Institution;</hi>
besides, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> still Argues upon the <hi>Supposition</hi> of a
<hi>Divine Institution,</hi> as particularly, in the same very Case of
the <hi>Bishops</hi> being the <hi>Principle of Unity,</hi> as may be seen in his
Reasoning against the <hi>Lapsed,</hi> which I have already cited
from <hi>Ep. 33.</hi> and might be more fully made appear, if it
were needful. Besides these Things, I say, we have the
same thing frequently insisted on by the Holy <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who
was Contemporary with the Apostles, in his Genuine Epistles.
Thus, for Instance, in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
he tells them, That <hi>that is only a firm and solid Communion which
is under the Bishop, or allowed by him;</hi> and, <hi>That the Multitude
ought still to be with the Bishop</hi>
               <note n="v" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Edit. Lond. 1680. p. 6.</note>. Plainly importing this much
at least, That there can be no True Christian Communion,
unless it be in the Unity of the Church; and there can be
no Communion in the Unity of the Church, in opposition
to the Bishop. And, in his Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphians, These
who belong to God, and Iesus Christ, are with the Bishops; and
these are God's that they may live by Iesus Christ, who, forsaking
their Sins, come into the Unity of the Church</hi>
               <note n="vv" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> p. 40.</note>. And again, in
that same Epistle, <hi>God doth not dwell where there is Division and
Wrath: God only Pardons those, who, Repenting, joyn in the
Unity of God, and in Society with the Bishops</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. p. 43.</note>. And he has
also that same very Notion, of the Bishops being so
much the Principle of Unity, that, as it were, the whole
Church is represented in him. Thus he tells the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
that <hi>he received their whole Body, in their Bishop</hi> Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus<note n="y" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. p. 17.</note>.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100833:16"/>
And in his Epistle to the <hi>Trallians,</hi> he tells them, that
in <hi>Polybius</hi> their Bishop, <hi>who came to him at</hi> Smyrna, <hi>he beheld
their whole Society</hi>
               <note n="z" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. p. 47.</note>.</p>
            <p>6. Indeed, this Principle, of the Bishop's being the <hi>Center</hi>
of Unity to his Church, was most reasonable and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in it self. Every particular Church is an <hi>Organiz'd Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Body;</hi> and there can be no Unity in an <hi>Organical Body,</hi>
whether <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> without a <hi>Principle of Unity,</hi> on
which all the Members must hang, and from which, being
separated, they must <hi>cease</hi> to be Members: And who so fit
for being this <hi>Principle fo Unity</hi> to a Church, as he who was
<hi>Pastor, Ruler, Governour, Captain, Head, Iudge, Christ's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,
&amp;c.</hi> in relation to that Church? This was the True
Foundation of that other Maxim which I insisted on before,
<hi>viz.</hi> That there could be but <hi>One Bishop,</hi> at <hi>once,</hi> in a Church?
Why so? Why? Because it was Monstrous for <hi>One Body</hi> to
have <hi>Two Head,</hi> for <hi>One Society</hi> to have <hi>Two Principles of Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what I have said does not satisfie you, (thô, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
it ought, it being scarcely possible to prove any thing
of this Nature more demonstratively,) then be pleased
only to consider the necessary Connexion that is betwixt
this Principle, and that which I am next to prove; and
that is,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, That by the Principles of those
Times, a <hi>Bishop,</hi> Cononically Promoted, was <hi>Supreme</hi> in his
Church; <hi>immediately subject</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> independent on
any, unaccountable to any Earthly Ecclesiastical <hi>Superiour.</hi>

nothing more fully, or more plainly, or more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on by St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> than this Great Principle. I shall
only give you a short view of it from him and his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries. And,</p>
            <p>I. He lays the Foundation of it in the <hi>Parity</hi> which our
Lord instituted amongst his <hi>Apostles. Christ,</hi> says he, <hi>gave
Equal Power to all his Apostles when he said, As my Father hath

And again, <hi>The rest of the Apostles were the same that St.</hi> Peter
<hi>was, endued with an Equality of Power and Honour</hi>

               </note>. Now
St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> on all occasions, makes Bishops <hi>Successors to the
Apostles,</hi> as perchance I may prove fully hereafter. Thus, I
say, he founds the <hi>Equality</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and, by consequence,
every <hi>Bishop's Supremacy</hi> within his own <hi>Diocess.</hi> And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
he Reasons most frequently. I shall only give you a

            <p>2. Then, in that excellent Epistle to <hi>Antonianus,</hi> discoursing
concerning the Case of the <hi>Lapsed,</hi> and shewing how, upon

as he shall be accountable to God</hi>

and thereupon sent some of their <hi>Partisans</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> toi inform

<hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote to him also, and thus Reasoned the Case with
him. <hi>To what Purpose was it for them to go to</hi> Rome <hi>to tell you,
that they had set up a false Bishop against the Bishops? Either they

con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Wickedness, and are pleased with what they have
done; or they are Penitent, land willing to return to the Churches
Unity: If the latter, they know whither they may return: For
seeing it is determined by us all, and withal, 'tis just and reasonable
in it self, That every one's Cause should be examined where the Crime was committed; and seeing there is a Portion of Flock</hi> (the
Catholick Church) <hi>assigned to every Bishop to be Governed by
him, as he shall be accountable to God, our Subjects ought not to
run about from Bishop to Bishop, nor break the Harmonious Concord

we have these Things plain: 1. That, by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Principles, evey Bishop was judge of his own Subjects; of
all the Christians who lived within his District. 2. That no
Bishop, no not the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was Superior to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishop; nor could receive Appeals from his Sentences.
And, 3. That this Independency of Bishops, this Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableness
of one Bishop to another, as to his Superiour,
was founded on every Bishop's having his Portion of the
Flock assigned to him, to be Ruled and Governed by him,
as he should answer to God; <hi>i. e.</hi> upon his visible <hi>Supremacy</hi>
in his own Church; his being immediately Subordinate to
God only. To the same purpose he writes to <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> also: For having told him his Mind freely concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those who should return from a State of Schism, to the
Unity of the Church; how they ought to be Treated, and
how Recceived, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he concludes thus: <hi>We know that some
are tenacious, and unwilling to alter what they have once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and that they will needs retain some Methods peculiar to
themselves; but still with the Safety of Peace, and Concord with
their Collegues: In which case, we offer Violence, we proscribe
Laws to no Man, seeing every Bishop has full liberty in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Affairs of his Church, as he will answwer to God</hi>

And how do both St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian</hi> resent <hi>Stephen</hi>'s
Extravagance, in threatning to refuse his Communion to
those who had not the same Sentiments with himself about

was in <hi>Senate;</hi> all the Christians within his District
depended on him for Government and Discipline, and he
depended on no Man: So that I may fairly conclude this
Point with that famous Testimony of St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s in his
Epistle to <hi>Evagrius: Wherever a Bishop is, whether at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi>
Eugubium, Constantinople <hi>or</hi> Rhegium, Alexandria <hi>or</hi> Tani,
<hi>he is of the same Merit, and the same Priesthood. Neither the
Power of Riches, nor the Humility of Poverty, maketh a Bishop
higher or lower; but they are all Successors of the Apostles</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ubicunque fuerit Episcopus, sive <hi>Romae,</hi> sive <hi>Eugubii,</hi> sive <hi>Constantinopoli,</hi> sive <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gii,</hi> sive <hi>Alexandriae,</hi> sive <hi>Tanis,</hi> ejusdem Meriti est, &amp; ejusdem Sacerdotii, potetia divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum &amp; Paupertatis humilitas, vel sublimiorem vel inferiorem Episcopum non facit. Caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum omnes Apostolorum Successores sunt. <hi>Hieron.</hi> ad <hi>Evagrium.</hi>
               </note>. 'Tis
true indeed, St. <hi>Ierom</hi> lived after the <hi>Cyprianic</hi> Age: But, I
suppose, our Author will pretend to own his Authority as
soon as any Father's in the point of Church-Government.
Let me represent to you only <hi>one Principle</hi> more, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the Days of St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> And that is,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, That whatever the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> among
the Jews, was to the <hi>other Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Bishop</hi> was the same to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons, &amp;c.</hi> and
the same Honour and Obedience was due to him. This was
a Principle which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> frequently insisted on, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
from. Thus in his Third Epistle, directed to <hi>Rogatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu,</hi>
he tells him, That he had <hi>Divine Law</hi> and <hi>Warrant</hi> for
Punishing his Rebellious and Undutiful Deacon. And then
cites that Text, <hi>Deut. 17. 12. And the man that will do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100833:19"/>
and will not hearken unto the Priest, or unto the Iudge,
even that man shall die: And all the people shall bear and fear, and
do no more presumptuously.</hi> And confirms it farther, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how God punished <hi>Gorah, Datham,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
against <hi>Aaro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Numb. 16.</hi> 1. And when the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
weary of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Government, asked a <hi>King to judge</hi>
them, <hi>The Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
People in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me that I should not reign over them: 1. Sam. 8.</hi> 7. Therefore, he gave them <hi>Saul</hi> for a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was challenged for reviling
God's <hi>High Priest,</hi> he excused himself, saying, <hi>He wist not
that he was the High Priest:</hi> Had he known him to have been
so, he would not have Treated him so, for it is written, <hi>Thou
shalt not speak evil of the Ruler of they People:</hi> Act. 23. 4, 5.
And.(as he goes further on) <hi>Our Lord Iesus Christ, Our God,
King, and Iudge, to the very hour of his Passion paid suitable
Honour to the Priests, thô they neither feared God, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Christ: For when he had cleansed the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>per, he bade him
go shew himself to the Priest, and offer his Gift:</hi> Matth. 8. 4.
<hi>And at the very instant of his Passion, when he was beaten, as if
he had answered irreverently to the High Priest, he uttered no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Thing against the Person of the Priest, but rather defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his own Innocence, saying, If I have spoken Evil, bear witness
of the Evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?</hi> John 18. 22, 23.
<hi>All which Things were done humbly and patiently lby him, that we
might have a Patern of Patience and Humility proposed to us; for
he taught us to give all dutiful Honour to true Priests, by behaving
so towards false Priests</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ep. 3. p. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Reason'd, and these were his Arguments
for obliging all Men, <hi>Clergy</hi> as well as <hi>Laity,</hi> to Honour and
Obey their <hi>Bishops.</hi> To the same purpose he wrote in his
Fourth Epistle to <hi>Pomponius,</hi> concerning some Virgins and
Deacons that lived Scandalously. <hi>Let them not think they can
be saved,</hi> says he, <hi>if they will not obey the Bishops, seeing God
says in Deuteronomy,</hi> and then he cites <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 12<note n="b" place="margin">Ep. 4. p. 9.</note>. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
on the same Arguments in his 59th Epistle directed to
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> when he is giving him an account of the Rebellion,
and Schismatical Practices of <hi>Fortunatus</hi> and <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> the
<hi>one</hi> a Presbyter, and the <hi>other</hi> a Deacon<note n="c" place="margin">Ep. 59. p. 128.</note>. He insists on them
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100833:20"/>
over again, in his 66th Epistle to <hi>Florentius Papianus</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ep. 66. p. 166.</note>. He
insists largely on the Argument drawn from the Punishment
inflicted on <hi>Corah</hi> and his Complices for Rebelling against
<hi>Aaron;</hi> and makes it the same very Sin in Schismaticks, who
separate from their lawful Bishop, in his 69th Epistle directed
to <hi>Magnus</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ep. 69. p. 183.</note>; and in his 73d Epistle, directed to <hi>Iubaianus</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ep. 73. p. 201.</note>.
And <hi>Firmilian</hi> also, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Contemporary, insists on the
same Argument<note n="g" place="margin">Ep. 75. p. 225.</note>. Indeed, the Names, <hi>Priest, Priesthood, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
Sacrifice, &amp;c.</hi> so much used those Times, are a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Argument of the Notions Christians had then, of the
<hi>Christian Hierarchy</hi>'s being Copied from the <hi>Iewish.</hi> Neither
was it a Notion newly started up in St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, for
we find it in express Terms in that notable Epistle written to
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by St. <hi>Clement</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was not
only contemporary with the Apostles, but is by Name men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as one of his Fellow-Labourers, <hi>whose
Names are in the Book of LIfe,</hi> Philip. 4. 3. For he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those <hi>Corinthians</hi> to lay aside all Animosities and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Dispositions, and to pursue and maintain Unity and
Peace, above all things; proposes to them as a proper Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for this, that every Man should keep his Order and
Station; and then enumerates the several Subordinations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which sufficiently proves, That the
Hierarchy was still preserved in the <hi>New.</hi> His Method of
Reasoning, and the Design he had in hand to compose the
Schisms that arose amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> make this evident
beyond all Contradiction, That a Bishop in the <hi>Christian</hi>
Church was no less than the High Priest among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
else he had not argued from the <hi>Precedents</hi> of the Temple to
perswade them to Unity in the Church. <hi>The High Priest</hi>
(saith he) <hi>has his proper Office, and the Priests have their proper
Place or Station; and the Levites are tied to their proper Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and the Layman is bound to his Laick Performances</hi>

                  </gap>. Clem. Epist. ad cor. p. mihi, 53.</note>.</p>
            <p>Having thus demonstrated, that these were three current
and received Principles in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, <hi>viz.</hi> That a
Bishop was the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to his Church, to all the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100833:20"/>
Christians within his <hi>District;</hi> That he was <hi>Supreme</hi> in his
<hi>Church,</hi> and had no Earthly Ecclesiastical Superiour; and,
That he was the <hi>same</hi> amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> which the <hi>High
Priest</hi> was amongst the <hi>Iews:</hi> Let me try a little, if our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Definition of a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with them. I am afraid, it can consist with none of them
singly, much less with all these together.</p>
            <p>I. Not with the first; for, if a <hi>Bishop,</hi> then, was the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Unity</hi> to a Church, in which there were <hi>many Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as Cyprian, e. g.</hi> was to the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and
<hi>Cornelius</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> to the Church of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> to the Church of <hi>Alexandria, &amp;c.</hi> If
thus it was, I say, then, to be sure, a <hi>Bishop</hi> was another
thing than a meer <hi>single Presbyter</hi> of a <hi>single Parish</hi> in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
sense: For, if a <hi>single Presbyter</hi> could have been the
<hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to a Church in which there were, <hi>e. g.</hi> 46
<hi>single Presbyters,</hi> he must have been it as a <hi>single Presbyter,</hi> or as
something else: Not as a <hi>single Presbyter,</hi> for then there should
have been as many <hi>Principles of Unity</hi> in a Church, as there
were <hi>single Presbyters;</hi> for Instance, There should have been
46 <hi>Principles of Unity</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Which, besides
that 'tis plainly Contradictory to the Notion of <hi>One Bishop,</hi>
at <hi>once,</hi> in a <hi>Church;</hi> what is it else, than to make a Church
such a Monster as may have 46 <hi>Heads?</hi> Than by so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
the <hi>Principles of Unity,</hi> to leave no <hi>Unity</hi> at all? Than,

A <hi>single Presbyter</hi> then, if he could have been the <hi>Principle of
Unity</hi> to such a Church, mut have been it, as <hi>something else</hi>
than a <hi>meer single Presbyter.</hi> But what could that <hi>Something else</hi>
have been? A <hi>Presbyterian Moderator?</hi> Not so neither; for by
what Propriety of Speech can a <hi>Moderator</hi> of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as
such, be called the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to a Church? How
can he be called the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to a Church, who, as
such, is neither <hi>Pastor, Head,</hi> nor <hi>Governour</hi> of a Church?
Who, as such, has no direct, immediate, or formal <hi>Relation</hi>
to a Church? Who, as such, is only the <hi>Chair-man,</hi> the <hi>Master-Speaker,</hi>
not of the <hi>Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Presbytery?</hi> Nay, who
may be such, and yet no Christian? For however inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100833:21"/>
or indecent it may be, that an <hi>Heathen</hi> should, on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
be the <hi>Moderator, i. e.</hi> the Master-Speaker of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;</hi>
yet it implies no Repugnancy to any Principle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
But however this is, 'tis certain, that, according
to the Presbyterian Principles, (not the <hi>Moderator,</hi> but) the
<hi>Presbytery</hi> is the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> or rather
<hi>Churches,</hi> within the Bounds of that <hi>Presbytery.</hi> And, to do
our Author Justice, he seems to have been sensible of this,
as a I observed already: And therefore, he said not, <hi>If he</hi> (the
Apologist) <hi>can prove, that we separate from our Pastors, or from
the Moderator of the Presbytery;</hi> but, <hi>from our Pastors,</hi> or <hi>from
the Presbytery with their Moderator.</hi> Neither,</p>
            <p>2. Can our Author's Definition consist with the second
Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Bishop was <hi>Supreme</hi> in his Church,
<hi>Independent,</hi> and <hi>not Subordinate,</hi> to any Ecclesiastical Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
on Earth. To have such a Supremacy, such an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency,
such an Unaccountableness, is notoriously incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the <hi>Idea</hi> of either a <hi>single Presbyter,</hi> or a <hi>Presbyterian
Moderator.</hi> How can it be consistent with the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>single
Presbyter</hi> acting in <hi>Parity</hi> with his Brethren Presbyters, that
of 46, for Example, <hi>One</hi> should have a <hi>Primacy, a Supremacy,
a Plenitude of Power, the Sublime</hi> and <hi>Divine Power of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
the Church, an <hi>Unaccountable and Eminent Power,</hi> as St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
himself calls it<note n="i" place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the <hi>Independency</hi> of <hi>single Presbyters</hi> is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously

In what sense can he be called <hi>Supreme,</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> or <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable?</hi>
In what sense can he be said to be <hi>raised to the

Church?</hi> Is he, as such, raised to the <hi>Sublime Top of the Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
who, as such, may be <hi>no Priest</hi> at all? For why may

            <p>3. But what shall I say to the Consistency of our Author's
Definition with the third Principle I named? Even no more
than that I have proved it to have been one of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s,
and one that was generally received in his time; and that I
can refer it to our Author himself to Determine, Whether
the <hi>High Priest</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> bore no higher Character than that
of a <hi>single Presbyter,</hi> or a <hi>Presbyterian Moderator?</hi> And so I
proceed to another Head of Arguments, which shall be,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, To give you, in a more particular <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,</hi>
some of the Branches of the Episcopal Prerogative in
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. And I think I shall do enough for my
purpose, if I shall prove these three Things:
<list>
                  <item>I. That there were several considerable <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Power</hi>
relating to the Government and Discipline of the
Church, which belonged <hi>solely</hi> to the Bishop's seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Powers</hi> lodged in his Person, which he could
manage by <hi>himself,</hi> and without the Concurrence
of any <hi>other</hi> Church-Governour.</item>
                  <item>II. That in every Thing relating to the Government
and Discipline of the Church, he had a <hi>Negative</hi>
over all the other Church-Governours within his
District. And,</item>
                  <item>III. That all the other <hi>Clergy-men</hi> within his District,
<hi>Presbyters</hi> as well as others, were <hi>subject</hi> to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and <hi>obnoxious</hi> to his Discipline and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. I say, there were several considerable <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Government and Discipline of the Church,
which belonged <hi>solely</hi> to the Bishop; several <hi>Powers</hi> lodged
in his Person, which he could manage by <hi>himself,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Concurrence of <hi>any other</hi> Church-Governour. Take
these for a Sample. And,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100833:22"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> He had the <hi>sole Power of Confirmation;</hi> of imposing
Hands on Christians, for the Reception of the Holy-Ghost,
after Baptism. For this, we have St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s most express
Testimony in his Epistle to <hi>Iubaianus,</hi> where he tells, It was
the Custom <hi>to offer such as were Baptized to the Bishops, that,
by their Prayers, and the laying on of their Hands, they might
receive the Holy-Ghost, and be Consummated by the Sign of our
Lord, i. e.</hi> by the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> as I take it: And he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
founds this Practice on the Paterm of St. <hi>Pater</hi> and
St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> mentiond <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14. &amp;c.<note n="k" place="margin">—Et. ic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circo quia legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticum Baptisma con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuti fuerant (<hi>quos</hi> Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus <hi>tinxerat</hi>) Baptizari cos ultra non opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebat; sed tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo quod deerat id a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro</hi> &amp; <hi>Joanne</hi> factum est; ut Oratione pro iis habita, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu imposita, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocaretur &amp; infundaretur super eos Spiritus Sanctus: Quod nunc quoque apud nos Geritur, ut qui in Ecclesia Baptizan ur, Praepositis Ecclesiae offerantur, &amp; per nostram Orationem ac manus impositionem, Spiritum Sanctum consequantur, &amp; signaculo Dominico Consummentur. Ep. 73. p. 202.</note> 
               <hi>Firmilian</hi> is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
in his Epistle to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> saying in plain Lanugage, That
<hi>the Bishops, who Govern the Church, possess the Power of Baptism,
Confirmation, and Ordination</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Omnis potestas &amp; Gratia in Ecclesia est, ubi Praesident <hi>Majores Natu,</hi> qui &amp; Baptizandi &amp; Manum imponendi &amp; Ordinandi possident potestatem. Ep. 75. p. 221.</note>. 'Tis true, he calls them <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores
Natu, Elder:</hi> But that he meant <hi>Bishops,</hi> as distinguished
from <hi>Presbyters,</hi> cannot be called into Question by any Man,
who reads the whole Epistle, and considers his Stile all along;
and withal, considers what a peculiar Interest, by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of these Times, the Bishop had in these three Acts he
names. But whatever groundless Altercations there may be
about his Testimony, as there can be none about St. <hi>Cprian</hi>'s,
so neither can there by any shadow of Pretext for any about
<hi>Cornelius</hi>'s, who, in his Epistle to <hi>Fabius,</hi> (so often mentioned
before,) makes it an Argument of <hi>Novatianus</hi> his Incapacity
of being a Bishop; that thô he was <hi>Baptized,</hi> yet <hi>he was not
Confirmed by the Bishop</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He had the <hi>sole Power of Ordination,</hi> and that of
whatsoever Clergy-men within his District. <hi>Ordinations</hi> could
not be performed without him; but he could perform them
Regularly, without the Concurrence of any other Church-Officer.
This has been so frequently and so fully proved by
Learned Men, that I need not insist much on it. Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore to adduce the Testimonies of such as lived after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100833:22"/>
St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, such as <hi>Ambrose, Ierom, Chrysostom,</hi> &amp;c.

Toi begin with St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, so humble and condescending he was, That
when he was made Bishop, he resolved with himself to do
nothing by himself, concerning the Publick Affairs of the
Church, without consulting not only his Clergy, but his
People<note n="n" place="margin">—Solus rescribere nihil potui, quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It wa a thing he was not bound to do by any Divine
Prescript, or any Apostolical Tradition, or any Ecclesiastical
Constitution. His very Words import so much, which you
may see on the Margin. And yet, for all that, we find him
not only in extraordinary Junctures, <hi>Ordaining</hi> without asking
the Consent of his Clergy or People; but still insisting on it
as the <hi>Right</hi> of all Bishops, and particularly his own, to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and <hi>Ordain</hi> Clergy-men, of whatsoever Rank, by <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
and without any Concurrence. Thus,</p>
            <p>In his 38th Epistle, having <hi>Ordained Aurelius</hi> a <hi>Lector,</hi> he
acquaints his Presbyters and Deacons with it, from the Place
of his Retirement: Now consider how he begins his Letter.
<hi>In all Clerical Ordinations, most dear Brethren,</hi> says he, <hi>I used to
Consult you beforehand, and to examine the Manners and Merits of
every one with common Advice</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">In Ordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus Clericis <hi>SOLEMUS</hi> vos ante consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere, &amp; mores ac merita sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni Consilio ponderare. Ep. 38 p. 74.</note>. And then he proceeds to
tell them, How, that notwithstanding that was his <hi>ordinary</hi>
Method, a <hi>Rule</hi> he had observed for the <hi>most part;</hi> yet, for
good Reasons he had not observed it in that Instance. In
which Testimony, we have these Things evident: 1. That
his Power was the same, as to all <hi>Ordinations,</hi> whether of
Presbyters or others: For he speaks of them all indefinitely;
<hi>In Clericis Ordinationibus.</hi> 2. That he used only to ask the
Counsel and Advice of his Clergy, about the <hi>Manners</hi> and
<hi>Merits</hi> of the Person he was to <hi>Ordain,</hi> but not their <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Ordination;</hi> not one word of that: On
the contrary, That they used <hi>not</hi> to <hi>Concurr,</hi> fairly imported
in the very Instance of <hi>Aurelius.</hi> 3. That it was intirely of
his own <hi>Easiness</hi> and <hi>Condescension,</hi> that he Consulted them in
the Matter: He USED to <hi>do</hi> it, but needed not have <hi>done
it:</hi> He <hi>did it not</hi> in that very same Case. Which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Truth of what I said before, <hi>viz.</hi> That
his Resolutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, which he had made when he entred to his

Bishoprick, was from his own <hi>Choice,</hi> and absolutely <hi>Free</hi> and
<hi>Voluntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have another remarkable Testimony to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

               </hi> in the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and by <hi>False Bishops</hi> in a
<hi>State of Schism.</hi> 2. That to <hi>Ordain</hi> Presbyters and Deacons,
was so much, and so acknowledged by, the Bishop's <hi>Work,</hi>
and peculiar to him, that, herein, even <hi>Schismaticks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
oberved the <hi>Common Rule.</hi> They found their <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were indispensibly to be performed by <hi>Bishops,</hi> that they

            </p>
            <p>So clear and full is St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> on this Head: And not only
he, but <hi>Firmilian,</hi> as I have cited him already. Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet,</p>
            <p>Our Martyr's Practice was always suitable and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to these Principles. He not only <hi>Ordained Aurelius a

of his Clergy; but also <hi>Saturus a Lector,</hi> and <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus a

In which we have also a most considerable Evidence of the
Bishops <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Ordinations,</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Celerinus:</hi> For there he tells his Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

St <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Words, I say, do not import, that
<hi>Novatus</hi> Ordain'd <hi>Felicissimus:</hi> They import no more, than
that <hi>Novatus</hi> his <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> prevailed to get <hi>Felicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

thing can be made, from what immediately follows, that
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> designed them for no more. For he goes on, and

Reason, That it matters not what <hi>Novatus</hi> did, seeing what
he <hi>did</hi> was <hi>done</hi> in <hi>Schism?</hi> One Thing indeed we learn from
this Matter, and that is another Argument of the Bishop's
peculiar Interest in the matter of <hi>Ordination;</hi> For St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
most plainly imputes it to <hi>Schism,</hi> that, without his Allowance,
<hi>Novatus</hi> should have presumed to have got <hi>Felicissimus Ordained a Deacon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Word more: The Bishops being thus possessed of the
<hi>sole Power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, and his Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
suitably, was exactly agreeable to the <hi>Second</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi>

               </note>. A <hi>Canon,</hi> without doubt, universally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Unity,</hi> and <hi>Supreme Ecclesiastical Magistrate</hi> within his <hi>District.</hi>

St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, it was appointed by the <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> That
<hi>Presbyters</hi> should <hi>concurr</hi> with the Bishop in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of
<hi>Presbyters:</hi> But then, I say, it was many Years after St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s
time; and it was for new emergent Reasons; That
<hi>Ordinations</hi> might be performed more deliberately, or with
the greater Solemnity, or so; but 'tis evident, that nothing
of the substantial <hi>Validity</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> were to depend
upon it. And so much, at present, for the Bishop's <hi>Power</hi> of
<hi>Ordination.</hi> But this is not all. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He had <hi>full Power,</hi> without asking the Consent or
Concurrence of either Clergy or People, to <hi>settle</hi> Presbyters
within his <hi>District.</hi> Of this, we have a most remarkable
Instance of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s planting <hi>Namidicus</hi> a Presbyter of
the City of <hi>Carthage:</hi> Our Martyr wrote to his Presbyters,
Deacons, and People, to receive him as such, (probably he
had been Ordained before,) and there was no more of it: It
was instantly done<note n="y" place="margin">Ep. 40.</note>. As we learn from the very next Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle<note n="z" place="margin">

at least of his Leaving, in it, to his People, by way of

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, the Bishop had the <hi>disposal</hi> of
all the <hi>Revenues</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> All the Churches <hi>Incomes,</hi> then,

            <p>In the first place, he had his own <hi>Quantitas Propria,</hi> His

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:100833:25"/>That he had his <hi>own Portion,</hi> and that a Liberal One, is

were <hi>ask'd,</hi> about any thing relating to the Church. All
Learned Men (even <hi>Spanhemius</hi> himself, our Author's <hi>diligent
Searcher into Antiquity,</hi>) confesses this. Indeed, this was a
Point on which the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> did so much depend,
that it could not but be a necessary Branch of his <hi>Prerogative,</hi>
who was the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to, and was intrusted with,
the <hi>Supreme</hi> Government of the Church. And, agreeably, we
find <hi>Cornelius</hi> accounting about it in an Epistle to <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
For there he tells, how the <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> who had
sided with <hi>Novatianus,</hi> turning sensible of their Error, came
(not streight to himself, for it seems they had not the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to do that, or rather, they would not have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that freedom so suddenly; but) to his Presbyters, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
their Offences, and humbly supplicating that
they might be Pardoned, and their Escapes forgotten: How,
when all this was narrated to him, <hi>He was pleased to Convocate
the Presbytery:</hi> How <hi>Maximus, Urbanus, Sidonius,</hi> and <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
being allowed to appear, made their Acknowledgments
and humble Addresses; and then, how after they were <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
in the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the whole matter was <hi>Communicated</hi> to
the <hi>People;</hi> and they again renewed their Acknowledgments
before the People, confessing as I shewed before, <hi>viz. That
they were convinced,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was chosen by the Omnipotent
God, and our Lord Iesus Christ to be Bishop of the most Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

                  </gap> sanctissimae Ecclesiae, &amp;c. Ep. 49. P. 92, 93.</note>. Here, I say, was a Noble Instance of a Bishop's
<hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Convocating</hi> his Presbyters at pleasure, and managing
the Affairs of the Church like a <hi>Chief</hi> Governour. The
whole Epistle is well worth perusing. But I shall only desire
you to take notice of one Thing by the way, it is, That <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalius</hi>
sought not the <hi>People</hi>'s Consent for their Reception; no,
he first received them again into the Communion of the
Church, and then acquainted the <hi>People</hi> with it. I observe
this, because it is another Demonstration, That what St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
determined from the beginning of his <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> was
meerly the effect of his own Choice, and Arbitrary Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension,
<hi>viz.</hi> To do nothing without his Peoples Consent:
This, I say, was not a Thing he was <hi>bound</hi> to do by the <hi>Rules</hi>
of his <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> for then <hi>Cornelius</hi> had been as much <hi>bound</hi>
as he.</p>
            <p>After these Persons were so solemnly Reconciled to the
Church, they themselves, by a Letter, gave an Account of
it to <hi>St. Cyprian;</hi> an Account, I say, which might bring more
Light to the whole Matter, if it needed any. <hi>We are certain,</hi>
say they, <hi>most dear Brother, that you will rejoyce with us, when
you know, that all Mistakes are forgotten, and we are Reconciled
to</hi> Cornelius <hi>OUR BISHOP, and to all the Clergy; to the
Great Contentment and Good Liking of the whole Church</hi>

            <p>But you may say, Did not the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbytery Conveen,
during the <hi>Vac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

not the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> meet frequently, during the
time of <hi>St. Cyprian's Secession?</hi> How then can it be said,
That the Bishop had the <hi>sole Power</hi> of <hi>Convocating</hi> Presbyters?
I answer, 'Tis true, it was so in both Cases: But how? To
begin with the latter; There was no Meeting of the Clergy
at <hi>Carthage,</hi> during <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>Secession,</hi> without his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
And therefore we find, when he <hi>retired,</hi> he left a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100833:27"/>
               <hi>Delegated Power</hi> with his Presbyters and Deacons, or an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
call it as you will, to meet and manage the Affairs
of the Church, as occasion should require; but still, so as that
they could do nothing of <hi>Moment</hi> without first <hi>Consulting</hi>
him; and nothing, but what was of <hi>ordinary Incidence,</hi> is
<hi>Regulated</hi> by the <hi>Canons.</hi> This we learn from many of his
Epistles: Thus, in his <hi>Fifth Epistle</hi> directed to his Presbyters
and Deacons, Because he could not be present himself, he
required them <hi>Faithfully and Religiously to discharge both his Office
and their own</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Et quoniam mihi inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ented it, when some of them ventured beyond the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the Allowance he had given them; when they began
to encroach on his Prerogatives; when they presumed to
meddle in Matters for which they had no <hi>Allowance,</hi> and
which were not in the common <hi>Road,</hi> nor <hi>Regulated</hi> by the
<hi>Canons,</hi> you shall hear to purpose by and by. And from what
I have already said, the other Case, That of the <hi>Presbytery</hi>'s
<hi>Meeting</hi> in the time of a <hi>Vacancy,</hi> may be easily cleared also;
for thô they might <hi>meet,</hi> yet all they could do, was to <hi>provide</hi>
all they could for the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the Church, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
in <hi>Ruled Cases;</hi> just as may be done by <hi>inferiour
Magistrates</hi> in all other <hi>Corporations,</hi> or Societies, in the time
of an <hi>Inter-Reign;</hi> but they could make no <hi>new Rules:</hi> And
there were several other Things they could not do; as I shall
also shew fully within a little. In the mean time, having
mentioned how <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> in his Absence, gave a <hi>Delegation</hi>
to his <hi>Clergy,</hi> and Constituted them his <hi>Vicars;</hi> let me give
you one Example of it, which may well deserve to pass for
another Instance of <hi>Acts</hi> that were <hi>peculiar</hi> to himself: And
that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> His <hi>Delegating,</hi> not his Presbyters in common,
but <hi>two</hi> of them only, <hi>viz. Rogatianus</hi> and <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>two</hi> Bishops, <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Herculanus,</hi> not only to consider
the State of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and of the <hi>Clergy</hi> at <hi>Carthage;</hi> but to

pronounce his Sentence of Excommunication against <hi>Felicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus</hi>
and <hi>Augendus,</hi> and all that should joyn themselves to

accepted of, and the Sentence put in Execution, as
we learn by the Return, which these four <hi>Delegates,</hi> together
with another Bishop called <hi>Victor,</hi> made to our Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr<note n="q" place="margin">Caldonius <hi>cum</hi> Herculano &amp; Victore <hi>Collegis (i. e.</hi> Episcopis) <hi>item cum</hi> Rogatiano &amp; Numidico <hi>Presbyteris,</hi> Cypriano <hi>salutem. Abstinuimus communicatione</hi> Felicissimum &amp; Augendum, <hi>&amp;c. Ep. 42. P.</hi> 81.</note>. I might have easily collected more Instances of <hi>Powers</hi>
and <hi>Faculties</hi> which were peculiar to a <hi>Bishop</hi> in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s
time, and which could not be pretended to by <hi>Presbyters:</hi>
But these may be sufficient for a Sample, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that more, perhaps, may be discovered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of the next Thing I promised to make appear, which
was,</p>
            <p>II. That in every thing relating to the Government and
Discipline of the Church, the Bishop had a <hi>Negative</hi> over all
the other <hi>Church-Governours</hi> within his <hi>District.</hi> He had the
<hi>Supreme Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys.</hi> No Man could be admitted into
the Church; no Man could be thrust out of the Church;
none Excommunicated could be admitted to Penance, nor Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
nor Restored to the Communion of the Church; no
Ecclesiastical Law could be made, nor Rescinded, nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed
with, without him. In short, all Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
depends upon the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and neither <hi>Sacrament</hi>
could be Administrated without his <hi>Allowance.</hi> If this Point,
well proved, does not evince, That a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s
time, was a <hi>real Prelate,</hi> and stood in a <hi>real Superiority</hi> above
all other <hi>Church Officers,</hi> I must despair of ever proving any
thing. And I must despair of ever proving any thing, if I
prove not this Point.</p>
            <p>1. To begin with <hi>Baptism,</hi> the Sacrament by which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are <hi>admitted</hi> into the Church: That no Man could be
<hi>Baptized</hi> without the Bishop's Consent, has as much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as can be well required for any <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100833:28"/>
               <hi>First, St. Cyprian</hi> could not have expressed any thing more
fully, or more plainly, than he has done this. To omit that
Testimony which he gives in his <hi>Exhortation to Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yrdom,</hi>
where he says, <hi>Bishops, by our Lord's Allowance, give the first
Baptism to Believers</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Nos tantum qui D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mino permittente pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Baptisma credentibus da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. P. 168.</note>. Let us turn over to <hi>Ep.</hi> 73. in which
he insists directly to this purpose. The Question was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Baptism</hi> performed by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> was
<hi>Valid? St. Cyprian</hi> affirmed it was not. His <hi>Conclusion</hi> was
such, as required some other Argument to support it, than
his own Authority. It was therefore needful, that he should
attempt to <hi>prove</hi> it; and that from received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<hi>Principles.</hi> Now consider his Argument, I shall give
it in his own Words as near as I can Translate them. <hi>'Tis
manifest,</hi> says he, <hi>where, and by whom, the Remission of Sins can
be given, which is given in Baptism. For, our Lord gave, first,
to</hi> Peter (<hi>on whom he built his Church, thereby instituting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating
the Original of Unity,) that</hi> Power, <hi>That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he should loose on Earth, should be loosed in Heaven: And
then, after his Resurrection, he gave it to all his Apostles, when he
said,</hi> As my Father hath sent me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Joh. 20. v. 21, 22, 23.)
<hi>Whence we learn, that none can</hi> Baptize <hi>Authoritatively, and give
Remission of Sins, but the BISHOPS, and those who are
FOUNDED in the Evangelical Law, and our Lord's Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
And, that nothing can be Bound or Loosed out of the
Church, seeing there's none, there, who has the</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Binding
<hi>or</hi> Loosing. <hi>Further; Dearest Brother, we want not Divine War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for it, when we say, That God hath disposed all Things by a
certain Law, and a proper Ordinance; and that none can USURP
any thing against the BISHOPS, all being subject to them:
For</hi> Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>attempted to assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a Priviledge of Sacrificing against</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>the

Thus <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> argued; and the force of his Argument lies
visibly in this, That <hi>Baptism performed</hi> by <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
cannot be <hi>Valid,</hi> because not <hi>performed</hi> by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> nor

Neither was <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> singular in this, for <hi>Firmilian</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> is as plain, saying, (as I have cited
him before) That <hi>the Bishops, who Govern the Church, possess the

in the Christian Faith, had first fallen from it in time of
Persecution, and then into a deadly Sickness: How, after
he had been dumb and senseless for some Days, recovering
some use of his Tongue, he called quickly for one of the
<hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (for he lived in that City) that he
might be Absolved, and have the Sacrament, being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he should not die till he should be Reconciled to the

            <p>Let me only add one Testimony more from <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>
concerning both Sacraments; but such an one as ought not
to be neglected. It is in his 69th Epistle written to <hi>Magnus.</hi>
The great Purpose he pursues in it, is to represent the Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Guilt of <hi>Schism,</hi> and the forlorn Condition of <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi>
that they cannot have <hi>Valid Sacraments,</hi> and that all
their <hi>Acts</hi> are <hi>Nullities, &amp;c.</hi> Amongst many Arguments to
this effect, he insists on that famous one; Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi>
Abiram, <hi>were of that same Religion that</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>were
of, and served the same God whom</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>served:
But because they transgressed the Limits of their own Stations, and</hi>
Usurp'd <hi>a</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Sacrificing <hi>to themselves, in opposition to</hi>
Aaron <hi>the Priest, who was only legally Invested with the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
by God's Vouchsafement and Appointment: They were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
punished in a miraculous manner; neither could their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be Valid or Profitable, being offered Unlawfully and Irreligiously,
and against the Divine Ordinance.—And yet these Men had made
no Schism: They had not departed from the</hi> Tabernacle, nor rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
another Altar, <hi>&amp;c. which now the Schismaticks do,</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Novatians,) who dividing the Church, and rebelling
against Christ's Peace and Unity, are bold to Constitute an</hi> [Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal]
<hi>Chair, and assume to themselves a Primacy,</hi> an Episcopal
Authority, <hi>and a POWER OF BAPTIZING and
OFFERING,</hi> that is, Celebrating the Holy Eucharist.
What can be more plain than 'tis here, That no Sacraments
could be Administred but in <hi>dependance</hi> on the <hi>Bishop</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100833:30"/>3. Considering that, as I have fully proved, a <hi>Bishop</hi> was,
then, the <hi>Principle of Unity to</hi> the Church; that he was <hi>Chief</hi>
Governour <hi>of</hi> the Church; and that, by consequence, the
<hi>Supreme Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys</hi> could not but belong to him:
Considering that the <hi>Church</hi> was a <hi>Visible Society;</hi> that he was
the <hi>Visible Head</hi> of that <hi>Visible Society;</hi> and, by consequence,
that it belonged to him as such, to take care that <hi>Society</hi> might
suffer no <hi>Detriment:</hi> Considering these Things, I say, it was
highly reasonable, that he should have the <hi>Chief Power</hi> of
<hi>Dispensing</hi> the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> Such a <hi>Power,</hi> as that <hi>neither</hi> might
be <hi>dispensed</hi> without him. What can be more <hi>Detrimental</hi> to
a <hi>Society,</hi> especially such a <hi>Society</hi> as a Christian Church, than
<hi>admitting</hi> Unworthy Persons to the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of it? Or <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi>
them to <hi>continue</hi> in it? Or <hi>restoring</hi> them to their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership
in the <hi>Society,</hi> after they have been <hi>justly thrust</hi> from
it, without considering whether they have given any Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of a serious Reformation? And who so proper to <hi>judge</hi>
of these Matters, as the <hi>Chief</hi> Governour of the Society?
And now,</p>
            <p>Having thus made it evident, that a <hi>Bishop,</hi> in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s
time, had a <hi>Negative</hi> over all other Church-Officers within
his District, in the grand Concern of Dispensing both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that neither could be Administred without him,
or against his Authority, I might fairly supersede the trouble
of making either a Minute or a laborious Demonstration of
his Sovereign Interest in the <hi>Acts</hi> of Excommunication, or
injoyning Penances, or reconciling Penitents, or making, or
rescinding, or dispensing with Ecclesiastical Laws or Canons;
in a word, in every thing relating to the Government or
Discipline of the Church. All these <hi>Acts depend</hi> upon the
<hi>Sacraments.</hi> His <hi>Negative</hi> therefore, about the <hi>Dispensation</hi> of
the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> had been <hi>in vain,</hi> and to no purpose, if he
had not had a Negative likewise about all these <hi>Acts.</hi> Besides,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100833:31"/>
you will not readily say, I think, that he could have had a
<hi>Greater Trust</hi> by having a <hi>Negative,</hi> in any other Matter than
in the Dispensing of the Sacraments. Having that, therefore,
he might well be <hi>intrusted</hi> with a <hi>Negative</hi> in all other Things,
either of <hi>equal</hi> (if any such can be imagined) or <hi>lesser</hi> Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
on which, the Order, the Subsistence, the Unity, the
Peace, the Purity, the Prosperity, or whatsoever Interest of
the Church could any way depend. Yet that I may give you
all possible satisfaction, I shall proceed a little further, and
give you, by way of Historical Deduction, such an account
of <hi>Powers</hi> lodged, <hi>e. g.</hi> in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s Person, as you may
fairly judge thereby, concerning the Preheminences of Bishops
in his Time.</p>
            <p>The most current Account we have about him, is, that
he was not Converted to Christianity, at least, not Baptized,
till the Year 246. That he was Ordain'd a Presbyter, <hi>Anno</hi>
247; and Bishop of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 248. Chronologists do
generally agree in this last Step of his Preferment. Now, as
we learn both from himself, and from <hi>Pontius</hi> his Deacon,
some of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Clergy were mighty Enemies to his
Promotion<note n="a" place="margin">Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Faith, so lately made a Presbyter, should have
been preferred to themselves. However it was, certain it is,
as I said, that they appeared against him with all their might
and main. But the People were so Generally and so Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
for him, to have him their Bishop, that these his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were overpowered. Made Bishop he was; and he was
a Person so well Qualified, so Eminent in every Virtue, and
withal so Strict and Cautious in his Life and Government,
after he was made Bishop, that it was not easie for the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
to wreck their Malice on him: But this was so far from
softening them, and bringing them to a better temper, that,
on the contrary, it imbittered them the more, and made
them the more watchful of all Opportunities to breed him
Troubles, and disturb his Government. At last, they catch'd
hold of one, and that a very dangerous one, in the time of
the <hi>Decian</hi> Persecution.</p>
            <p>This Persecution beginning towards the end of the Year

himself, commanded by God, had retired from <hi>Carthage</hi>
till there should be some Relentment of the Fury of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
Here, I say, his subtle Enemies found their so long
wished Opportunity: For, the <hi>Lapsed,</hi> so soon as the Hazard
was over, resumed their Christian Profession, and turned
mighty forward, if not furious, to be restored to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church. 'Thô they knew full well, that they
were bound by the <hi>Canons</hi> to have continued, for a long
time, in the state of <hi>Penitents;</hi> yet they thought their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and perhaps their Qualities, might overpower the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
and claim <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Dispensations.</hi> With them
struck in those Clergy-men, who had still retained the old
Grudges against <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s Promotion, encouraging their
Presumptions. They knew, he was a Man of Principles,
and had a mighty Zeal for the real Interests of Christianity;
and, by consequence, that he would stand Resolutely by the
Canons of the Church, and be clear, that the <hi>Lapsed</hi> should
perfect their <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Penance:</hi> They saw the Eagerness of
the Lapsed to be sooner reconciled, than the Canons allowed:
They resolved therefore to fall in with them, thinking that
thereby they should effectually put a Thorn in his Foot;
they should enflame the Lapsed, and their Relations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
the great Body of the People against him. But this
was not all.</p>
            <p>It was not enough for them themselves to encourage the
<hi>Lapsed</hi> in their Petulancies: The Bishops <hi>Prelation</hi> over Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
was then so Notorious, that, as malicious as they were,
they had not Impudence enough to set up <hi>theirs</hi> in opposition
to <hi>his</hi> Authority, and Reconcile the <hi>Lapsed</hi> to the Church,
meerly upon the score of their <hi>own Credit,</hi> against his <hi>Will</hi>
and <hi>Orders;</hi> and therefore, they fell upon another Project.
If it was possible for any <hi>other</hi> to stand up against the <hi>Bishops</hi>
Authority, it was <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors.</hi> These,
for their Faith and Patience; their fervent Zeal, and fragrant
Graces; their glorious Courage, and good Example; that
they might Persevere themselves, and others might be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to follow their Patern; were held in mighty Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
They were reputed as dearer to God, and in a closer
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100833:32"/>
Communion with him, and nearer Approximation to him,
than Christians of the common size: And their Intercessions
had been in use of being much regarded in former Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
These, therefore, as the only Persons whose Credit
could be feasibly put in the Ballance with the Bishops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the Holy Man's Supplanters instigated to espouse the
Quarrel of the Lapsed; to become their Patrons, for having
themselves Absolved against the Bishop's Resolutions. And
truly, some of them were so far wrought upon, as to turn
Zealous for it: And, armed with their Authority, these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
Presbyters adventured to <hi>Absolve</hi> and <hi>Lapsed,</hi> and
receive them to the Sacrament, without the Bishop's <hi>Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
Now consider what followed, and speak your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and tell me, if <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> was not more than either
<hi>Single Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian Moderator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thô he was one of the mildest and most humble Men that
ever lived; yet, so soon as this was told him, where he was,
in his Retirement, he was not a little alarm'd: The Practice
was surprizing, and the Presumption, <hi>new,</hi> as well as <hi>bold:</hi>
The like had never been done before in any Christian Church:
And such preposterous Methods clearly tended to shake all the
Foundations of Order and good Discipline: And therefore
he thought it high time for him, if he could, to give the
Check to such irregular and unexampled Methods. In short,
he drew his Pen, and wrote Three notable Epistles; <hi>one</hi> to
the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors; Another</hi> to his <hi>Clergy;</hi> and a <hi>third</hi>
to his <hi>Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> Insisting, in each of them, upon the Novelty
and Unwarrantableness of the Course was taken; the Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Indignities were done himself by it; and the great
Mischiefs and fatal Consequences might, nay would, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
follow upon it, if it were not forborn. More
particularly,</p>
            <p>In that to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> he told them, <hi>That
his Episcopal Care, and the Fear of God, compelled him to Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them, That, as they had devoutly and couragiously kept the
Faith, so they ought, suitably, to be observant of Christ's Holy
Laws and Discipline: That, as it became all Christ's Soldiers to
obey their General's Commands; so it was their Duty, in a special
manner, to be Examples to others: That he had thought, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
and Deacons, who were with them, might have taught them
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100833:32"/>
so much: But that now, to his extream Grief, he understood, they
had been so far from doing that; that, on the contrary, some of them,
especially some Presbyters, neither minding the Fear of God, nor
the Honour of their Bishop, had industriously misled them.</hi> He
complain'd mightily of <hi>the Presumption of such Presbyters, that
against all Law and Reason, they should have dared to Reconcile
the Lapsed without his Consent. That herein they were more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
than the Lapsers themselves: That it was somewhat Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
in the Lapsed to be earnest for an Absolution; considering the
uncomfortable State they were in, so long as they were denied the
Communion of the Church: But it was the Duty of Office-bearers
in the Church to do nothing rashly, lest, in stead of Pastors, they
should prove Worriers of the Flock,</hi> &amp;c. And then he told these
Martyrs and Confessors, how far their Priviledges reached:
All they could do, was, <hi>by way of humble Supplication, to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Bishop for a Relaxation of the Rules of Discipline: But
they had neither Power to Command him, nor Grant Indulgences
without him</hi>

<hi>Presbyterian Moderator:</hi> Especially if we consider the very
next, written to his Presbyters and Deacons upon the same
Principles, still. He had written to them several times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
from the Place of his Retirement, but had received no
Answer from them. Now consider how he Resents this, and,
Resenting it, asserts his own Episcopal Authority; his own
Sovereign Power in Ecclesiastick Matters: For thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;
<hi>I wonder, dear Brethren, that you have returned no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to the many Letters I have sent you; especially considering,
that now, in my Retirement, you ought to inform me of every
thing that happens; that so I may, advisedly and deliberately, give

these four Letters together, and weigh them impartially, and
then let him judge if <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> wrote in the <hi>Stile</hi> of <hi>Parity,</hi>
if he claim'd not a <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> a <hi>Negative,</hi> to himself,
over all the Christians, Presbyters as well as others, living
within his District.</p>
            <p>But did not <hi>Cyprian</hi> shew <hi>too much Zeal in this Cause? Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
he attempted to stretch his Power a little too far; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
many did: He was a Holy and Meek Man, but such may
be a little too High.</hi> So I read, indeed, in a late Book<note n="g" place="margin">Rational De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Non-Conformity, P. 179.</note>.
But it seems, the Author has found himself very sore put to it
when he said so: For how can one not be fore put to it, when
he cannot escape but by seeking for Refuge in a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Huffyness and Humility, Carnal Height and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Such a Person was <hi>Cyprian;</hi> And yet to <hi>Proud</hi> was he, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
for doing his Duty; for asserting his Episcopal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when most undutifully trampled on by his presuming
Presbyters.</p>
            <p>What I have said, methinks, might be enough in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
for defeating for ever that Uncharitable, shall I say,
or Ignorant Suggestion, That it was <hi>Pride,</hi> perhaps, that
prompted <hi>Cyprian</hi> to write so Magisterially to the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
Presbyters; yet, because a farther Discussion of it may
contribute not a little for clearing up the Bishop's <hi>Negative,</hi>
in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s time, I shall not grudge to give it you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> had three sorts of People to deal with in that
Controversie, which bred him so much Trouble. He had
the <hi>Lapsed</hi> themselves; the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors;</hi> and these
<hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> who had encroached so much on his
Episcopal Authority.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think, the Author himself, with whom I have
now to do, will not be shy to grant, That <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
incurring the <hi>Reputation</hi> of either <hi>Proud</hi> or <hi>Presumptuous,</hi>
might have chided the <hi>Lapsed,</hi> as we find he did: They had
Cowardly renounced their Christianity, to save their Lives
and Fortunes; and the Canons subjected them to a strict and
a long Penance for it: And I think, without the <hi>imputation</hi>
of either <hi>Height</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> one in <hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s Station might
have put them in mind of the Respect they owed to the
Canons of the Church, and the Governours of it. Indeed,
all the <hi>Lapsed</hi> were not engaged in the disorderly Course.
There were some of them who were sensible of their Duty,
and subjected themselves to their Bishop, resolving to wait his
time, and intirely to depend upon him for their Absolution,
as we learn from his 33d Epistle.</p>
            <p>His Difficulty was greater with the <hi>Martyrs and Confessors,</hi>
who appeared as Patrons to the Prejudicating Lapsed; but
neither need I insist on that, nor how he conquered them
in point of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Argument:</hi> For, this Author told
Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet, He was wholly out of the way in medling with
that Matter, seeing none ever imagined that every Martyr had
Church Power.</hi> Thô I must tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> That whoso reads
<hi>St. Cyprian</hi>'s Works, and particularly observes the State and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100833:35"/>
Management of this whole Controversie about the <hi>Lapsed,</hi>
cannot but be convinced, that the Reputation and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confessors,</hi> made a far greater Figure
in it, than the Reputation or Authority of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> To
come therefore to that which is the main Point with this
Author,</p>
            <p>Let us try, if St. <hi>Cyprian stretch'd his Power too far in his</hi>
Treatment of the Presbyters, who appeared against him
in this Controversie. Consider the following Steps, and
then judge.</p>
            <p>I. Consider that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not fall <hi>a buffing</hi> or <hi>hecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
or running them down by Noise or Clamour. No, <q>He
Reasons the Case with them, and Reasons all along from
known and received Principles. He tells them plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
That in Presuming as they had done, they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
both the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and their own <hi>Station:</hi> That he was
their <hi>Superiour:</hi> That they did not pay him the <hi>Honour</hi>
that was <hi>due</hi> to his <hi>Chair</hi> and <hi>Character:</hi> That the <hi>like</hi> had
never been attempted before by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> under any of
his <hi>Predecessor-Bishops:</hi> That it was a <hi>Factious, Selfish</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and too great <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Popularity</hi> that prompted them
to Measures so in no wise Presidented: That he knew the
Secret of the Matter, and that it was the <hi>old Grudge</hi> against
his being preferred to the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> that byass'd them to
their Insolencies: That is belonged to him as having the
<hi>Chief Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> as being <hi>Bishop, i. e.</hi> as having the
<hi>visible Sovereignty</hi> in Church Matters, to <hi>straiten</hi> or <hi>slacken</hi>
the Sinews of Discipline; to <hi>prolong</hi> or <hi>shorten</hi> the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Penance; to <hi>grant</hi> Absolutions, and <hi>reconcile</hi> Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That such Presumptions were Encroachments
upon the very Foundations of the Church, to the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof, their pretending to any <hi>Power,</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> tended: In short, That such Practices
were against Christ's <hi>Institution,</hi> and the Analogies of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and all the Laws of Order, Peace and Unity:
And they deserved the sharpest Censures for them.</q>
These, I say, are a Sample of the Arguments St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on against those <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and most of them were
founded on <hi>Matter of Fact:</hi> And now, suppose St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100833:35"/>
had considerable <hi>Doses</hi> of <hi>Pride,</hi> yet if you will but allow
him, withall, to have had some <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Common Sense</hi> or
<hi>Honesty,</hi> can you so much as imagine he could have used such
Arguments, if they had wanted Foundation? Would he not
have been ashamed to have used them, if <hi>he,</hi> and not <hi>his</hi>
Presbyters, had been guilty of the <hi>Usurpations</hi> he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning?
But what needs more? Have I not fully proved
already, That a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Unity</hi> to all the Christians, Presbyters as well as
others, within his District? And that he was a Sovereign
and <hi>Peerless</hi> Governour of the <hi>Church</hi> which he <hi>Ruled.</hi> And
were not all his <hi>Reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nings</hi> founded on these <hi>Principles?</hi> But
this is not all; for,</p>
            <p>2. Consider that they were not all the Presbyters of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
who were engaged in the Quarrel. No: <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gatianus,
Britius, Numidicus,</hi> and, perhaps, many more, whose Names
are not trasmited to us, would never joyn with those of the
<hi>Faction;</hi> but still continued in their Duty to St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And
can we think, they would not have joyned with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for the Maintenance of their <hi>own Rights</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi>
if <hi>Cyprian</hi> had been the <hi>Usurper?</hi> If he had been
Claiming a <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> without any <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> to
it? If he had been driving at a <hi>Prelacy,</hi> when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church belonged to Presbyters acting in <hi>Parity?</hi>
We learn from St. <hi>Cyprian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> himself, That, in those Times, <hi>it
was a mighty Wickedness for Men to part tamely with their Rights

(not to his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fetulancy,</hi>) that he had been pleased to
communicate his Measures to them: They approve the Course
he had taken with the <hi>Lapsed:</hi> They compare him to the

(and pray take notice of it,) <hi>That, wanting a Bishop,</hi> they

<hi>since the Death of</hi> Fabianus <hi>of most Noble Memory, through the

they had not got a Bishop Constituted; who only could define in

Indeed, in all this, they gave him a true Account of their
Real Sentiments and Principles, as we learn from another

on that Occasion; for <hi>Fabianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was dead,
and <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> was retired; and so it was
written by <hi>Presbyters</hi> who had <hi>no</hi> Bishop, to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the
<hi>absence</hi> of their Bishop: And yet, in that Epistle, they were
so far from having any such Notions, that they said expresly,
That both Themselves who wanted One, and those of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
who wanted the Presence of One, <hi>were only seemingly
the Governours of those respective Churches; and only kept the

            <p>And now, let any of Common Sense determine, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there was Ground, or shadow of Ground, for insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> shewed <hi>too much Zeal in this Cause, or
attempted to stretch his Power a little too far,</hi> (indeed, it had not
been a <hi>little,</hi> but <hi>very much,</hi> nay <hi>monstrously</hi> too far, had those
of <hi>Parity</hi> been then the current Principles,) <hi>or was a little too
high in this Matter?</hi> But if there was no Ground to say so, if
it was contrary to all the then current Principles, and to the
common Sentiments of all Catholick Christians, nay, even to
the Convictions of all Honest, Orderly, Dutiful, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
Presbyters, who then lived, to say so: If thus it
was, I say, and 'tis hard to prove any Matter of Fact more
evidently than I have proved that it was thus; then, I think,
it follows by good Consequence, not only that this Author
was a little in the wrong to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when he said so; but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100833:39"/>
also, that, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, a Bishop had fairly a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
over his Presbyters, which was the Thing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.
And so I proceed to the next Thing proposed,
namely,</p>
            <p>III. That all the other Church-Governours within his
District, Presbyters as well as others, were, in St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s
time, <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Bishop's Authority,</hi> and <hi>obnoxious</hi>
to his <hi>Discipline;</hi> I do'nt think you very sharp sighted, if
you have not seen this already. Yet that I may give you
all reasonable Satisfaction, I shall insist a little further on
it. And,</p>

            <p>Such was the Language of those Times. Now, I say, by
what Propriety of Speech could a Bishop have been called
<hi>Praepositus,</hi> Superiour to his Clergy? Could they have been
called HIS Clergy? Could he have been said to have been
<hi>Their</hi> Bishop? <hi>Their</hi> Ruler? <hi>Their</hi> Governour? By what Rule
of either Grammar or Rhetorick, Logick or Politick, could
he have been said to have been <hi>set over</hi> them, or <hi>they</hi> to have
been <hi>his Subjects</hi> or Inferiours, if he had no <hi>Power</hi> nor <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
over them? If they were not <hi>Subjected</hi> to his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
nor <hi>Obnoxious</hi> to his <hi>Discipline?</hi> But let all this pass for
meer Prolusion if you will. I am not pinch'd for want of
Arguments. For,</p>
            <p>3. The three great Principles which I proved so fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>viz.</hi> That a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, was the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Unity</hi> to the Church which he Govern'd; that he had
a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in it; and that by the Principles which then
prevailed, he was the <hi>same</hi> in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> which the
<hi>High Priest</hi> was in the <hi>Iewish;</hi> and the last Thing I proved
also, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had a <hi>Negative</hi> over his Presbyters; Each
of these is demonstration for the present <hi>Conclusion,</hi> and you
need not <hi>Artificial; Natural Logick</hi> is enough to let you see
the <hi>Consequences.</hi> Indeed,</p>
            <p>4. We find <hi>Cyprian</hi> all along both Reasoning and Practising
to this purpose. Thus, he told Bishop <hi>Rogatianus, Ep. 3.</hi>
That the Case was plain between him and his Deacon: <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we learn from his 34th Epistle.</p>
            <p>But you may say, These Instances extend no further than to
Deacons, or more inferiour Clergy-men; but, What is this to
Presbyters? Why? Sir, indeed, the Instances are pat and
home; and you must acknowledge so much, if you consider,
that, by the Principles of those Times, there was no Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
between Prebyters and Inferiour Orders in this respect:
But the Bishop's Power extended equally to all; just as a
King can censure his Chancellor, as well as a Sub-Collector
of his Customs; a Justice-General, as well as a Justice of
Peace: Nothing clearer from the above-mentioned Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But that I may leave you no imaginable Scruple, I shall
even account to you about Prebyters also.</p>
            <p>5. Then, I have told you already, how some of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Presbyters conspired against St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and used
their utmost Arts to hinder his Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erment to the Bishoprick.
Now, if we may believe either himself, or <hi>Pontius</hi> in his Life,
whatever it was they did on that Occasion, he might have
punish'd them for it; punish'd them not only with Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but with Excommunication, had he pleased. Take
first his own Account in <hi>Ep. 43.</hi> there he tells his People, That
through the Malignity and Perfidiousness of some of his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
he durst not adventure to return to <hi>Carthage</hi> so soon as
he would: And he describes those Presbyters thus; That
being mindful of their Conspiracy, and retaining their old
Grudges against his Promotion, they reinforced their ancient
Machinations, and renewed their Attempts for Undermining
him, by siding with <hi>Feliciss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceeds thus; I neither willed nor wished their Punishment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100833:41"/>
for their Opposition to my Promotion; yea, I Pardon'd them,
and kept my Peace: And yet, now, they have suffered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
Punishment: Thô I did not Excommunicate them then,
their own Guilty Consciences have done it now: They have
Excommunicated themselves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Lay these two Accounts together, and then tell me, if these
Presbyters were not Obnoxious to his Discipline? If his
Power over them might not have extended to their very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
for their old Tricks against him, had he
been willing to have put it in Execution? But this is not
all. For,</p>
            <p>Have I not accounted already, How, when they first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Controversie concerning the Lapsed, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
them, that if they should continue to Absolve and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
any more of them without his Allowance, he would
Suspend them from their Office, and inflict severer Censures
on them when he should return to <hi>Carthage?</hi> And have I
not justified him in this, and made it manifest to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that herein he did not stretch his Power too far?
That he took not too much on him? Further yet.</p>
            <p>When they resumed their Impudence, and, after a little
Interruption, would needs be Absolving the Lapsed, thô he
was then in his Retirement, and by consequence, had few or
none of his Clergy to Consult with; yet he gave out this

            <p>I might easily have proved this more fully, but, I think, I
have said enough. And now, Sir, lay these three Things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were several considerable Acts of
Church Power peculiar to a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, and
which those in the Order of Single Presbyters could not
meddle with: That a Bishop, as such, had a Negative over
all the Presbyters within his District: And, That they were
all Subordinate to him, and Obnoxious to his Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipline:
And then I can refer it to your self to determine, Whether
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100833:42"/>
a Bishop, then, was not quite another thing than either Single
Presbyter, or Presbyterian Moderator.</p>
            <p>Thus, I think, I have sufficiently defeated our Author's
Definition of a Bishop, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, by giving a fair
and just Account of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he stood <hi>related</hi> to his own <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church</hi> which he Govern'd. I come now to consider
him as he stood <hi>related</hi> to the <hi>Church Catholick.</hi> And here
also I am very much mistaken, if I shall not find Matter
enough for another Demonstration against him. I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to dispatch this Point with all possible Brevity.</p>
            <p>I. Then, by the Principles of the <hi>Cyprianic</hi> Age, all Bishops
were <hi>Collegues,</hi> and made up <hi>One College.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls them
so, and speaks of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Sacerdotal College</hi> so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
(no fewer than 6 or 7 times in one Epistle, and
4 or 5 times in another<note n="l" place="margin">Ep. 55, &amp; 68</note>) that I need not adduce Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
Indeed, being all Men of the same Character, the
same Order, the same Dignity; being all of them equally
<hi>Supreme,</hi> and <hi>First</hi> in their own Churches; and all standing
<hi>Collateral</hi> to one another; they were most properly called
<hi>Collegues,</hi> and their <hi>Society,</hi> a <hi>College,</hi> if we may rely on
<hi>A. Gellius</hi> his Skill in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, or rather <hi>Messala</hi>'s
cited by him<note n="m" place="margin">Lib. 13. c. 14.</note>. And it is observable to this purpose, That
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> no where calls <hi>Presbyters</hi> his <hi>Collegues.</hi> He calls
none so, but <hi>Bishops.</hi> And the Notion of the <hi>Episcopal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi>
had such an Impression on him, it was so Common and
Received in those Times, that speaking even of <hi>Schismatical
Bishops,</hi> who run one course, he calls them a <hi>College</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. As the <hi>One Bishop</hi> was the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church,</hi> so this <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> was the <hi>Principle of
Unity</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Unity</hi> to the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Bishops.</hi> I hope, not being a
<hi>Romanist,</hi> you will not require that I should prove the Highest
Step of this Gradation. All that remains then, is to Explain
how the <hi>College</hi> of Bishops, by the Principles of those Times,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100833:42"/>
was the <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to the <hi>Church Catholick;</hi> or, the
One great <hi>Aggregated Body,</hi> consisting of all the <hi>particular
Churches</hi> all the World over, whereof, their <hi>particular Bishops</hi>
were the <hi>particular Principles of Unity.</hi> Neither needs this be
a Laborious Task. For all that's necessary for it, is, To shew
how they were so <hi>United</hi> into <hi>One College,</hi> as to make them
capable of being justly denominated <hi>One Principle of Unity.</hi>
Now, they were thus United by the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Fundamental
Laws</hi> of <hi>One Faith,</hi> and <hi>One Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>One Holy Catholick Faith</hi> is Essential in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the <hi>One Holy Catholick Church,</hi> is, even to this day,
a received Principle, I think, amongst all sober Christians.
But then, I say, That the Christians, in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time,
reckoned of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>One Communion</hi> as every whit as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and indispensible to the Being of <hi>One Church,</hi> as the
<hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>One Faith.</hi> It was a prime, a fundamental <hi>Article</hi>
of their <hi>Faith,</hi> That there was but <hi>One Church;</hi> and they
could not understand how there could be but <hi>One Church,</hi>
if there was <hi>more</hi> than <hi>One Communion.</hi> By their Principles
and Reasonings, a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of <hi>Communions</hi> made, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of <hi>Churches:</hi> And by consequence,
seeing there could be but <hi>One True Catholick Church,</hi> there could

<hi>Churches</hi> or <hi>Communions</hi> were <hi>False, i. e.</hi> not at all <hi>Christian
Churches</hi> or <hi>Communions.</hi> These Principles, and suitable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
from them, are so frequently and so fully insisted on
in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Writings, that to Transcribe his Testimonies
to this purpose, were almost to Transcribe his Works. Now
from these Principles, it follows clearly,</p>
            <p>3. That the Grand Concern of the <hi>Episcopal College</hi> was,
to Preserve and Maintain this <hi>One Communion:</hi> To Guard
against all such <hi>Doctrines</hi> as <hi>destroyed,</hi> or tended to <hi>destroy,</hi> the
the <hi>One Holy Catholick Faith;</hi> and all <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Schismati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al</hi>
Methods which <hi>destroyed,</hi> or tended to <hi>destroy,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of the
<hi>One Church.</hi> These being the Great and Fundamental <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests</hi>
of the <hi>One Church;</hi> and they being her <hi>Supreme</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
they could not but be chiefly bound by the most <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws</hi> of their <hi>Office</hi> to be Conscientious <hi>Conservators</hi>
of these Great and Fundamental <hi>Interests.</hi> And indeed, so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100833:43"/>
they believed themselves to be, as will evidently appear from
the following Considerations. And,</p>
            <p>I. They look'd upon themselves as bound indispensibly to
maintain the Peace, the Unity, the Concord, the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the Honour, (they are all St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Words) of the
<hi>College</hi> it self. Every <hi>Error, every Defect,</hi> every Thing <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or out of <hi>Tune</hi> in it, tended naturally to endanger
the great <hi>Interests,</hi> for the Conservation and Procuration of
which it was instituted. For this End,</p>
            <p>2. Because every Man, by being Promoted to the <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Dignity,</hi> was, <hi>Eo ipso,</hi> a <hi>Principle of Unity</hi> to a <hi>particular
Church,</hi> and so a Member of the <hi>Episcopal College;</hi> all possible
Care was taken, that a fit Person should be promoted, and
that the Promotion should be Unquestionable. Therefore,
he was not to be Promoted, as I have proved, but where
there was an <hi>Unquestionable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vacancy.</hi> Therefore, he was not
to be Promoted, if there was any thing <hi>Uncanonical</hi> or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeable
in his <hi>Baptism,</hi> or his <hi>Confirmation,</hi> or his <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hewn also in the Case of
<hi>Novationus.</hi> Therefore he was Solemnly <hi>Elected</hi> in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
of the <hi>People, That either his Crimes might be detected, or
his Merits published; because the People was best acquainted with

            </p>
            <p>3. Being thus <hi>Canonically</hi> Promoted, his first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to
send his <hi>Communicatory Letters</hi> to all other Bishops, to give

in the <hi>Faith,</hi> his <hi>Fraternal Disposition,</hi> &amp;c. Thus, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius

Digression. <hi>Novatianus</hi> also, thô Illegally and Schismatically
<hi>Ordained,</hi> found it necessary to send his <hi>Communicatory Letters</hi>
to St. <hi>Cyptian;</hi> as if he had been <hi>Ordain'd</hi> Canonically, and
in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
               <note n="t" place="bottom">Ep. 44. p. 83.</note>. So also <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> when made

to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
               <note n="u" place="bottom">Ep. 59. p. 135.</note>. Indeed, this was never
omitted.</p>
            <p>4. If there was no Competition, no Controversie in the
Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e; the Matter was at an end. The <hi>Promoted</hi> Bishop's
<hi>Communicatory Letters</hi> were sufficient, and he was forthwith
<hi>faithfully joyned with all his Collegues,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> words it<note n="v" place="margin">Collegis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus fidelit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But if there was any Competitor, any Debate, then the rest
of the <hi>College,</hi> before they received him as a <hi>Collegue,</hi> made
further <hi>Enquiries.</hi> Sometimes they sent some from the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood</hi>
to examine the Matter: Sometimes the <hi>Ordainers</hi>
were obliged to Account for the <hi>Person Ordained,</hi> and the
whole Procedure of the <hi>Ordination:</hi> Sometimes both Methods
were practised. We have a famous Instance of both Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
in one Case; the Case of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novationus.
Cornelius,</hi> as I have said, upon his Promotion wrote to St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:</hi>
So did <hi>Novatianus.</hi> Here was a <hi>Competition. Cyprian</hi>
therefore, with his <hi>African Collegues,</hi> sent <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi>
two Bishops, to <hi>Rome,</hi> that upon the Place it self,
where they might have the surest Information, they might

               <note n="w" place="margin">Ep. 45.</note>.
And on the other hand, the <hi>Sixteen Bishops,</hi> who
<hi>Ordain'd Cornelius,</hi> wrote to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the rest of the
Bishops of <hi>Africa,</hi> and satisfied them upon the whole Qve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,

But then,</p>
            <p>5. There was <hi>equal</hi> Care taken to <hi>purge</hi> him out of the

If he swerv'd from these, he was forthwith refused the
<hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>whole College.</hi> Therefore, (says St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
to <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Case of <hi>Marcianus</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Arles,</hi> who had joyned with <hi>Novatianus,) The Corporation

            <p>6. So long as a Bishop, worthily, and legally Promoted,
kept the <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> he was <hi>Treated,</hi> he
was <hi>Encouraged,</hi> he was <hi>Consulted,</hi> he was <hi>Corresponded</hi> with;
in a word, Every way used as became the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church,</hi> and a <hi>Fellow-Member</hi> of the <hi>College.</hi> All the rest
of the <hi>Members</hi> were bound, by the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the
<hi>College,</hi> to <hi>Ratifie</hi> all his <hi>Canonical,</hi> nay, <hi>Equitable Acts</hi> of
<hi>Priesthood, Government,</hi> and <hi>Discipline.</hi> Whosoever was <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
by himself, or by his Clergy, with his <hi>Allowance</hi> was to
be <hi>owned</hi> as a <hi>Baptized Christian,</hi> a True Denison of the
Church, and to have the Priviledges of such all the World
over. Every Bishop of the Christian Church, living at how
great a distance soever, was bound to <hi>Communicate</hi> his <hi>Dutiful
Subjects,</hi> duly attested by him; and to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates.</hi>
Thus, for Instance, <hi>Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
rejected <hi>Felicissimus,</hi> and all his <hi>Retainers;</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and
all his; and would not grant them his <hi>Communion,</hi> because

               <note n="b" place="margin">Ep. 59. p. 126.</note> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> rejected <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatianus</hi>
and all his Party, because not in <hi>Communion</hi> with
<hi>Cornelius.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ep. 44</note> In short, By the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>College,</hi> he that was
Injurious, Undutiful, or Disobedient to <hi>his Bishop,</hi> was <hi>such</hi>
to all the <hi>Bishops</hi> on Earth: He that set up an <hi>Altar</hi> against his
<hi>Bishop's Altar,</hi> set up his <hi>Altar</hi> against all the <hi>Altars</hi> of the <hi>whole
College:</hi> If a Bishop <hi>Deposed</hi> or <hi>Excommunicated</hi> any of his
<hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> it was not lawful for any other Bishop
to <hi>Receive</hi> him, nor to <hi>Absolve</hi> him: He was still to be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for that, to his <hi>own Bishop,</hi> so long as he lived. He that
was <hi>Reconciled</hi> to his <hi>Bishop,</hi> (whether he was of the <hi>Clergy</hi> or
<hi>Laity,</hi>) and <hi>Restored</hi> by him to the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Church, was

of the <hi>Church Catholick.</hi> And of this we have a

was a Bishop then, as he stood related to the Catholick
Church. Let me only add one Thing more in pursuance of
his Dignity, as to this Relation; and that is,</p>
            <p>7. That so long as Bishop continued a <hi>sound</hi> Member of

            </p>
            <p>All the great Concerns of both the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and
the <hi>Episcopal College,</hi> were, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se Times, transacted by
<hi>Letters.</hi> There was no possibility of <hi>General Councils</hi> then:
All that could be done, was either to meet in <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi>
upon great Emergencies; or, if that could not be
neither, to transact Matters, and bring them to a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Determination,</hi> by <hi>particular Letters</hi> from <hi>Bishop</hi> to
<hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> were ordinarily kept twice a Year; and
by them, in the ordinary Course, all Matters of Moment
were Determined; and so by the Reciprocation of Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Letters, Matters came sometimes to such a General Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Determination, as, in the Result, was fully Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to the <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>General Council.</hi> We have several
Instances of such Transactions by <hi>Provincial Synods.</hi> Thus
in the Grand Case of the <hi>Lapsed,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Decian
Persecusion,</hi> the Matter was so managed by <hi>Provincial Synods</hi>
in <hi>Africa, Rome, Alexandria, Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch, &amp;c.</hi> that at last, as
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, it was brought to this <hi>General Conclusion,</hi>
That the <hi>Lapsed should complete their Terms of Penance, and
should not be restored to the Peace of the Church before the Time
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100833:45"/>
appointed by the Canons, unless it was in the case of Deadly Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ep 55. p. 102, 103.</note> Thus, without doubt, also that considerable Canon
mentioned by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the <hi>Synodical Epistle,</hi> which is the
67th in Number, amongst his Epistles, <hi>viz. That the Lapsed,
however they might be restor'd to the Communion of the Church,
should never be received into Holy Orders.</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ep. 67. P. 174.</note> And that other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
mentioned by him also, <hi>That no Clergy-man should be Tutor
to Minors.</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ep. I. p. I.</note> Thus also, long before St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the great
Controversie concerning the Observation of <hi>Easter,</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in many <hi>Synods,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us.<note n="h" place="margin">Vide Euseb. H. E. l. 5. a c. 23. ad c. 28.</note> And a few Years
after his Martyrdom, the Case of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus.</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Euseb. l. 7. c. 30.</note> These
Instances are only for a Sample.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> could not be kept, or emergent
Matters of Consequence could not be conveniently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
in them, then Recourse was had to the only remaining
Method, <hi>viz. particular Letters</hi> from <hi>Bishop</hi> to <hi>Bishop.</hi> And to
make this Method both sure and effectual, all possible Pains
was taken. It was necessary that each <hi>Bishop</hi> should <hi>sign</hi> his
<hi>Letter,</hi> and send it, not by every <hi>common Carrier,</hi> but by a
<hi>Clergy-man.</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Et quoniam oportuit me per Clericos scribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re—Ep. 29. p. 55.</note> In short, They had such Marks, that it was
not <hi>easie,</hi> if <hi>possible,</hi> to Counterfeit them. And the Bishop
who received it was bound by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>College</hi> to
transmit it, for his Share, to the rest of the Members. And
so it went through, and the <hi>whole College</hi> was acquainted
with the Accident, the Case, the Controversie, whatever it
was that had Emerged, we have many Instances and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Method and Diligence in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Writings.
Thus, e. g. When <hi>Caldonius</hi> writes to <hi>Cyprian</hi> concerning
some <hi>Lapsed</hi> within his District, <hi>Cyprian</hi> returns him an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
telling him, He had written his Mind to that purpose
already, and so sends him Copies of five Epistles concerning
the Case, requiring him to <hi>transmit them to as many Bishops as
he could;</hi> adding this as the Reason, <hi>That One Course, One Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
might be kept by all the College.</hi>

the World over<note n="m" place="margin">Ep. 55. p. 102.</note> Thus, I say, sometimes the greatest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the Church were managed: And, 'tis plain, this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was every was <hi>Equivalent,</hi> if not <hi>Preferable,</hi> to a <hi>General
Council:</hi> So that the <hi>Christian Church</hi> might have still <hi>subsisted,</hi>
and its <hi>Unity</hi> been <hi>provided</hi> for, and preserved in all Ages,
without such <hi>Councils,</hi> as it was, effectually, during the First
<hi>Three Centuries.</hi> Now, that which I am principally concern'd
for in all this Matter, is,</p>
            <p>That all these <hi>Circular Letters,</hi> of whatsoever Nature, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
either, to the great Interests of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> or
of the <hi>Episcopal College,</hi> were regularly directed only to the
<hi>Bishops,</hi> as being the <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Principles of Unity</hi> to their
respective Churches, as well as written and sent by those of
the same <hi>Order.</hi> And we have a notable Account of this in
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s 48th Epistle directed to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> for there we
learn, That the Presbyters and Deacons of the Church of
<hi>Adrumetum,</hi> having received <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Communicatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
directed to <hi>Polycarpus</hi> their Bishop; and, seeing their
Bishop was absent, finding it necessary that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
an Answer, in his Name, as having his presumed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
for it, they wrote to <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the common Form,
acknowledging him as <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and subjoyning <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus</hi>
his <hi>Name</hi> to the <hi>Letter:</hi> A clear Evidence, That where
there was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> it behoved all the <hi>Letters</hi> that concerned
the publick State of the Church to be <hi>subscribed</hi> by him, no
<hi>other Name</hi> but <hi>his</hi> could give them Force, and make them
Current. Well! but there was one Thing amiss: St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
and the rest of the <hi>African</hi> Bishops having Intelligence of the
Competition that was at <hi>Rome</hi> between <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi>
and being unwilling to do any thing rashly, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to continue to write only to the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters
and Deacons, as before, during the Vacancy; till <hi>Cornelius</hi>
his <hi>Title</hi> should be fully <hi>cleared</hi> to them. This the Clergy of
<hi>Adrum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tum</hi> were ignorant of when they wrote the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Letter. And being afterwards told it by <hi>Cyprian</hi>
and <hi>Liberalis,</hi> they directed their <hi>next Letter</hi> not for <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
but for the <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters and Deacons. Hereat <hi>Cornelius</hi>
was not a little stumbled, and, according to the then current
Principles, interpreting it to be a <hi>disowning</hi> of him as <hi>Bishop</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> he wrote a Letter of Complaint to <hi>Cyprian</hi> about
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100833:46"/>
it, who was then <hi>Metropolitan</hi> of that <hi>Province.</hi> In Answer
to which, our Holy Martyr wrote a full Apology to him,
shewing him what was true Matter of Fact: Upon what
Reasons the Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> had taken the aforesaid Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
How it was in consequence of that Resolution, that
the Clergy of <hi>Adrumetum</hi> had changed their Direction:
And how, by the whole Method, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ng was less intended
than to <hi>disown</hi> him as Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or Invalidate his <hi>Title.</hi>
And was there not here as clear an Evidence, that <hi>Regularly,</hi>
and in the <hi>current</hi> Form, all <hi>Letters</hi> were <hi>directed</hi> to the <hi>Bishop?</hi>
Shall I give you another History to clear this Matter further?
When <hi>Maximus</hi> and <hi>Nicostratus</hi> retaining to <hi>Novatianus,</hi> and
so separating from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> did thereby cut themselves off
from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church; <hi>Cyprian</hi> wrote to them,
as well he might, considering that his Design was to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
them to their True Bishop <hi>Cornelius.</hi> But how did he
write? Why? so, as that his <hi>Letter</hi> should not be delivered
till <hi>Cornelius</hi> should see it, and judge whether it was proper
to deliver it<note n="n" place="margin">Ep. 47.</note> Such a special regard was then paid to the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> as being <hi>Supreme</hi> in it, and the <hi>Principle of
Unity</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>If all this doth not satisfie you, then listen a little further,
and resist this Evidence if ye can: Because, by the <hi>Fundamental
Principles</hi> of <hi>One Faith,</hi> and <hi>One Communion,</hi> every <hi>Heretical</hi> and
<hi>Schismatical Bishop</hi> was, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> out of the Church; and all who
<hi>retain'd</hi> or adhered to him, whether <hi>Bishops, Clergy, or Laicks,</hi>
did run the same Risque with him: Therefore, so soon as
any Bishop turned <hi>Heretick</hi> or <hi>Schismatick,</hi> the Catholick
Bishops of the <hi>Province,</hi> especially the <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> formed
<hi>Lists</hi> of all the <hi>True, Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Bishops,</hi> within
their respective <hi>Provinces,</hi> and sent them to other <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans:</hi>
And so they were transmitted all the World over.
That their <hi>Communicatory Letters,</hi> and theirs <hi>only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> might be
received, and their <hi>Communion,</hi> and theirs <hi>only,</hi> might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
and that all <hi>Heretical</hi> or <hi>Schismatical,</hi> or <hi>Retainers</hi> to
Heretical or Schismatical <hi>Bishops,</hi> might be rejected, and
their Communion refused. And for this we have two notable
Testimonies from St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the one is in his 59th Epistle
directed to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> where he tells him, That upon <hi>Fortuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
his starting out of the Church, and pretending to be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100833:47"/>
Bishop of <hi>Carthage, He had sent him the Names of all the Bishops
in</hi> Africa, <hi>who Govern'd their Churches in Soundness and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi>
and that it was done by <hi>common Advice:</hi> But to what

of all <hi>Bishops</hi> one towards another. It had been easie
to have collected more Particulars, as well as to have insisted
more largely on these I have collected: But from the small
Collection I have made, I think I have laid Foundation
enough for another Demonstration against our Author's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Bishop in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. For,</p>
            <p>How could either <hi>Single Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
taking the Terms in the Presbyterian Sense, have born
such a <hi>Part,</hi> in relation to the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>

<hi>College</hi> of Bishops, in those Times, is still considered and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on, as consisting of Church Governours notoriously
distinguished from <hi>Presbyters:</hi> Besides, that in all St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s

Writings, or in any Monument of those Times, you shall

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100833:48"/>
How could one raised to such a Post, I say, have been no
other than a <hi>Single Presbyter,</hi> or a <hi>Presbyterian Moderator?</hi>
Doth not his very bearing such a <hi>Part,</hi> his having such a
<hi>Trust,</hi> his being Cloath'd with such an <hi>Eminence,</hi> argue him
Demonstratively to have been something <hi>other,</hi> something
<hi>Greater,</hi> something <hi>Higher</hi> and more <hi>Honourable</hi> than <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have considered a <hi>Bishop</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, as
he stood related to his own Particular, and to the Church
Catholick; and, in both respects, have discovered a vast
Discrepance betwixt him, as he was really, and our Author's
Notion or Definition of him. Let me only add one Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
more; and that is,</p>
            <p>What Character he bore, what Figure he made, in the
<hi>Eye</hi> of those who were <hi>without;</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours and Magistrates. And here I
need not be at much Pains; the Thing is Obvious: The
Christian Bishops, as being the <hi>Chief Rulers,</hi> the <hi>Supreme</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
the <hi>Heads</hi> of their respective Churches, were the
<hi>Chief Butts</hi> of all the Heathen <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> Take these
few of many Evidences.</p>
            <p>After St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had retired from <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the time of
the <hi>Decian</hi> Persecution, he wrote to his Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
and told them how earnest he was to return to the
City, but Prudence would not let him. When he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Publick Peace of the Church, and how much he, <hi>as
Bishop,</hi> was concerned to Provide for it, and for the Quiet
and Safety of the Brethren, he found it necessary for him,
thô with mighty Grief, to forbear returning for a time, <hi>lest</hi>
HIS PRESENCE <hi>should provoke the Rage and Fury of
the Gentiles.</hi> So he wrote, I say, in his 7th Epistle.<note n="q" place="margin">Oportet n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his 14th Epistle written to his Presbyters and Deacons,

value, had seriously advised him to be <hi>Calm</hi> and <hi>Cautious, and not

and so much Reason had St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to say, <hi>That it
mattered not, whence</hi> (whether from Heathens <hi>without,</hi> or

Terrors or Perils threatned a Bishop, seeing,</hi> as such, <hi>he was still

allowing them to rely upon it, as full Security against all
Molestation for the future.<note n="c" place="bottom">

stopping the Current of a fierce Persecution, and
designing Favour and Security to Christians, directed his
Letters to the <hi>Christian Bishops,</hi> as the Persons who were
<hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> and in all <hi>Persecutions</hi> had wont
to be <hi>exposed</hi> to the <hi>greatest Hazards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have examined our Author's <hi>Definition</hi> of a
<hi>Bishop</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; and, if I mistake not, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by many solid Arguments, that he was neither
<hi>Single Presbyter,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyterian Moderator,</hi> in the <hi>Presbyterian
Sense</hi> of the <hi>Terms;</hi> but a <hi>True Prelate</hi> in the strictest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of Speech. Consider my Arguments thoroughly, and
weigh them only in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> without <hi>Prejudice,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100833:50"/>
and without <hi>Partiality,</hi> and try whether <hi>Each</hi> of them <hi>singly,</hi>
and much more, <hi>all together</hi> do not <hi>Conclude</hi> irrefragably
against him. And if they shall be found to be <hi>Concludent,</hi> I
leave it next to <hi>you</hi> to <hi>Determine,</hi> whether our Author is not
both <hi>fairly</hi> and <hi>formally bound</hi> by <hi>his Word</hi> to <hi>confess</hi> himself a
<hi>Schismatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I first put Pen to Paper, I had in my Project to have
proceeded further, and made it appear as evidently, as what
I have now dispatched, That the <hi>Episcopal Preheminence</hi> which
was so notoriously and unquestionably <hi>Prelatical</hi> in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
time, was no <hi>Novel Usurpation,</hi> no <hi>Late Invention,</hi> not at all
the <hi>Production</hi> of the <hi>Cyprianic Age,</hi> nor any <hi>Age later</hi> than
the <hi>Apostles:</hi> That St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and all his <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> firmly
<hi>believed</hi> it to be of <hi>Divine Institution;</hi> That they had not <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained</hi>
it, having so little <hi>Temporal Encouragement,</hi> nay, so
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>many Temporal Discouragements</hi> to <hi>Entertain</hi> it, if
they had not so <hi>believed:</hi> That they had <hi>great Reason</hi> for
this their <hi>Belief;</hi> as <hi>fairly</hi> founded on our Saviour's own <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi>
and <hi>fully handed</hi> down to them in the <hi>constant Practice</hi>
of the <hi>Universal Church</hi> from the <hi>First Plantation</hi> of <hi>Christian
Churches:</hi> That it pass'd amongst them as a <hi>common Principle,</hi>
That <hi>Bishops,</hi> as I have represented them, Bishops, as <hi>they</hi> were
<hi>then,</hi> that is, clearly <hi>contradistinct</hi> from <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Superiour</hi>
to them, <hi>Bishops</hi> as the <hi>Heads of,</hi> and <hi>Principles of Unity to,</hi>
their respective <hi>Churches,</hi> were the <hi>Rightful, True,</hi> and <hi>Genuine
Successors</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> in the <hi>Supreme visible Ecclesiastical Power</hi>
of <hi>Governing</hi> the <hi>Churches,</hi> whereof they were <hi>Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Things, I say, I had once in my Prospect; but this
<hi>Letter</hi> has swell'd to such a Bulk already, as, perhaps, may
fright you from Reading it: And you may Command me to
Prosecute what is lest undone, when you will: And what I
have written, as I said, seems to me sufficient, in Point of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
for bringing your <hi>Author</hi> to a <hi>Sense</hi> of his <hi>State,</hi> as
well as a <hi>Candid Confession</hi> of it, when 'tis thus plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him: And therefore I Conclude with my Best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
