            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

innocent people, as much as hee may.
In conſideration whereof God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made vs to be deſcended of a very
famous, couragious &amp; Chriſtian race
euen as the Kinges our predeſeſſors
haue excelled in godlineſſe and vertue,
ſo we imitating them, are deſirous to

moderate them in the end, through our
ſufferance, and the equitie of our cauſe,
which was approued and warranted
of God by many ſpeciall graces and

care he hath of maintaining religion, his
owne credite, the defence and protection of his
ſubiects, whereof hee maketh more reckoning
than of his owne life, as he hath often hazarded
willinglie, and is ſtill readie to hazard his life
for their good: for neither the kings turning to
the ſame religion with the Spaniarde aboute
three yeares ſince, nor the preſent danger that
threatneth all chriſtendome (which euerie man
knoweth to haue riſen through the diſcords, and
iuſt gelouſie that the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath bred euery where: none of theſe things
could moderat his malitious mind againſt this
realme, the kings maieſties perſon, his good and
faithfull ſubiects, the people of <hi>Cambray,</hi> whom
his maieſtie hath taken into his protection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> and his people
vſe all hoſtilitie daily continuallie aſſaulting
them violently on euerie ſide, battering and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
townes, leading away priſoners, putting
them to ranſom, killing his ſubiects, raiſing tax<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es
and fines vpon them, and dealing in al things
<pb facs="tcp:9020:8"/>
as a ſworne enemy: yea ſo far, as hee hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
attemptes to be made of taking awaie his
Maieſties life, by trecheries and villainous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
meanes: as appeared not many daies
paſt: and worſe had it happened, to the greate
woe of <hi>France,</hi> had not God the true protector of
kings, wonderfullie turned aſide that horrible
ſtroke, offered by the hand of a Frenchman (an
abhominable and monſtrous matter) but dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to that act by a ſpirit moſt voide of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and indeed Spaniardlike, euen againſte the
kings ſacred maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The king therfore herevpon giueth notice to
all thoſe vnto whome it ſhall appertaine: that
he will no longer forbeare the maintaining of
his honor, the protection of his ſubiects to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he is bound, &amp; of the people of <hi>Cambray</hi> (whoſe
part he would defend, though he did yet longer
with patience forbeare the going forward with
the attempts) ſeeing thoſe of <hi>Artoys</hi> and <hi>Henault</hi>
make ſmall account (to the greefe of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie)
of exhortations that he by his letters was
about to make them, that they ſhould putte to
their helping hand with him, to turne awaie or
appeaſe the furie of war, raiſed by the ſaid Spa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niards,
being no leſſe noyſome and pernitious
to thoſe of <hi>Artoys</hi> and <hi>Henault,</hi> than to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:)
he hath determined and is reſolued, from
henceforth to make open warre againſt the ſaid
king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> his ſubiects, vaſſals &amp; countries,
for to be reuenged vpon them, of wrongs, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and offences, that hee and his haue ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at their hands, like as other kings his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
haue done vpon the like occaſions: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb facs="tcp:9020:8"/>
truſting that God who knoweth the
ſecrets of his hart, and the equitie of his cauſe,
will alwaie aſſiſt him with his diuine power, &amp;
will bleſſe him and make him proſper and al his
armie, with the helpe of his good ſubiects.</p>
            <p>In regard whereof the kings maieſtie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
and moſt ſtraightly enioyneth al his
ſaid ſubiects, vaſſals and ſeruants, to make war
hereafter againſt the ſaid king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by ſea,
and by land, and againſt his countreys, ſubiects
vaſſals and adherentes, as againſt enemies to
the kings perſon and his realme: and for the ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>compliſhing
hereof, that they go with forces in
to his ſaide countries, to aſſault and ſurpriſe
townes, Fortes, and places that are vnder his
obeiſance: and there to leuie taxes, fines &amp; ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes:
To take his ſubiects and ſeruants pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
and put them to ranſome, and to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
them like enemies, euen as they doe and would
doe with his Maieſties ſubiectes and friendes.
Therefore his Maieſtie hath forbidden, &amp; dooth
by theſe preſents ſtreitly prohibit and forbidde,
all manner of communication, entercourſe of
Merchandiſe, giuing intelligence, company kee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping,
or dealing with the ſaide king of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
his adherents, Seruauntes and Subiectes,
vpon paine of being taken and adiudged Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
He hath alſo reuoked, and doth by theſ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents

after fifteene daies expired after the publiſhing

            <p>Which decree he hath therefore cauſed to be
