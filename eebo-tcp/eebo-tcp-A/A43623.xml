            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know very well that every Book-ſellers Stall groans under the burthen of <hi>Sermons, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi>—Sermons as common (and as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cryed about the Streets) as <hi>Ballads;</hi> Sermons before his Majeſty, before the Judges, before the Right Honourable, the Right Worſhipful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Court, in City, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, in the Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sermons of <hi>good</hi> uſe, Sermons of <hi>little or no</hi> uſe, Sermons of <hi>great</hi> uſe, (eſpecially to thoſe reading Don's of the Pulpit, that tranſcribing other Men's Works, make a ſhift to read them, tho many times as much out of the Story, as hard to get in again when they are out, as having never been either in their Heads or Hearts;) Sermons of <hi>Learned</hi> Compoſure both for Matter and Style; and Sermons <hi>given,</hi> and Sermon's <hi>ſold</hi> (over and over again) and ſome Sermon's (perhaps) publiſhed out of meer Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Itch to be ſeen in print.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe, or <hi>whether any of theſe</hi> cauſed the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Country-Sermon, (neither contriv'd, devis'd nor intended for the Preſs, but) preach'd in my ordinary Courſe in my own Pariſh, I do not think my ſelf concerned to give thee any account; for they that like it not, may let it alone; yet the

            </p>
            <p>Some Men are ſo crafty as in neglect of their Duty to God, to their King, the Kingdom, and their own Souls, they dare not preach againſt this Sin of Man-catching, or Trepanning Men by Sham-Evidence, Falſe Witneſſes, Sham-Plots, the Sin of the <hi>Text,</hi> (I had almost ſaid) of the <hi>Times:</hi> in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unſwearing, lying, ſlandering, and for ſwearing, and ſo ſetting Snares to catch Men, Body and Goods, Life and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: whilſt the World is the worſe, but never the better for thoſe Preachers, thoſe <hi>Chips in Broth,</hi> whoſe God is their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and are only ſwayed by that Kitchin-Maxime, <hi>It is good ſleeping in a whole Skin;</hi> whilſt I chuſe to follow that <hi>Plain-Dealer</hi> and Martyr, Biſhop <hi>Latimer,</hi> who preſented the King for a New-Years Gift,

            </p>
            <p>I know not what thanks he got for his New-Years Gift, but he prov'd a true Prophet in one of his Sermons, where he ſays, We Miniſters cannot ſay <hi>Vae Vobis,</hi> but preſently we are called <hi>coram Nobis:</hi> We cannot reprove Sin in the Pulpit, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we may be reprov'd for it by the Bench. But (Bleſſed be God) we do not live (as <hi>Latimer</hi> once did) in Popiſh-Times, nor in Times where Popery has the greatest Sway: Or if we ſhould, It is the greateſt Honour, as well as greateſt Piety, to follow <hi>his Fate,</hi> as well as <hi>his Honeſty and Plain-dealing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Sin of <hi>oppreſſing Men,</hi> or <hi>catching Men in Snares</hi> by falſe Witneſſes, is that crying Sin, that brings God's heavy Judgments upon a Nation; that made him to <hi>withhold the former and the latter Rain</hi> in its Seaſon; that always ruins a Kingdom, at leaſt, it brings ruine at length upon the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, upon ſuch <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s, upon <hi>Ahab</hi>'s; for ſo it follows in the Prophet <hi>Micah;
<note place="margin">Mic. 2.3.</note> Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, againſt this Family do I deviſe an evil, from which ye ſhall not remove your Necks;</hi> No, no, <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s Neck was broke out of a Window preſently after that Sin of Murder and Oppreſſion <hi>under colour of Law;</hi> ſhe did not long enjoy the Fruits of <hi>her Subornation of Perjury,</hi> but was thrown to the Dogs.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94091:5"/>
            <p>For it is God's Truth,
<note place="margin">Prov. 22.16. Ezek. 22.29.</note> That <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor to increaſe his Riches, and he that giveth to the Rich ſhall ſurely come to want.</hi> For <hi>Oppreſſion and Robbery</hi> are ſo <hi>near of kin,</hi> that the Spirit of God puts them together, and makes them ſignify <hi>the ſame thing</hi> and the <hi>ſame Men:</hi> Only, the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor robs <hi>by</hi> Law, the Robber robs <hi>against</hi> Law; the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor robs in the Gate <hi>under colour of Law,</hi> the Robber robs on the Kings High-Way <hi>in deſiance of Law; both of them</hi> always (or at leaſt moſt commonly) come to <hi>an ill end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe latter are <hi>little, Retail-Rogues</hi> in reſpect of the former, that rob (ſafely they think, and) by <hi>whole-ſale,</hi> and brought God's heavy Judgment of <hi>Drought</hi> and Dearth upon the Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Text.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>High-way-Man</hi> lyes at catch but for a <hi>ſmall parcel</hi> of Money, but theſe (like the Grave) ſwallow all; the good, the bad, Life, Liberty, Eſtate, Family and Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, root and branch in one day. I mean, ſuch as are <hi>Trepanners, or Countenancers of them,</hi> Sham-Evidence, Falſe Witneſſes, whoſe Tongues can ſwear and unſwear, whoſe Tongues perhaps have cut the Throats of many a poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent already, and ſtill want <hi>more work, more work;</hi> Men of no Honour, no Honeſty, no Religion, (except of that notorious and bloody Religion that is worſe than no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) you may have more Truth, more Kindneſs, more Fidelity, fairer quarter from Inſidels (I know it) than from ſuch Bigotted-Catholicks, that think <hi>it is Religion</hi> (and pleaſing to God) <hi>to cut Men's Throats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which yet they do not, they dare not do always in the down-right <hi>Godfrey-way</hi> of murdering; that (has and may) prove dangerous; no, the Devil is crafty, and his Agents and Emiſſaries can improve in <hi>Wit</hi> as well as <hi>Malice;</hi> They ſhall do the Feat, lay their Snares, catch Men, (not, <hi>in the Night and be hang'd</hi>) but at Noon-day and <hi>by Law;</hi> not with <hi>cruel hands,</hi> but (a way worth two on't) with <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tongues,</hi> Tongues of a Serpent, <hi>the Poyſon of Aſps is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94091:6"/>under their Lips,</hi> they kill ſure, no Law can hinder them; nay, they'll make the Law Pimp to them, and aſſiſt them in the Aſſaſſinate:</p>
            <p>And that by falſe Oaths, falſe Tongues, ſwearing <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con;</hi> as if thoſe that will ſwear you twenty Oaths in an hour for <hi>God-have-Mercy,</hi> will ſcruple at one Oath for Money, and to have all their other Oaths and Sins pardoned into the Bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atheiſm, Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Bigottiſm</hi> is now ſo epidemical and common, that therefore the <hi>wary Hollanders</hi> in their Courts of Judicature pump out the Truth, <hi>not by Oath,</hi> but <hi>croſs</hi> and ſudden <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> in which (by uſe) their Judges are as dextrous as happy.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>Falſe Oaths,</hi> wicked Men can <hi>do the Buſineſs,</hi> do their <hi>own Buſineſs,</hi> get <hi>Rewards</hi> for catching innocent Men, and not always (though <hi>ſometimes) the Gallows</hi> alſo for their Pains, in ſetting <hi>Snares to catch Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Men that <hi>can alſo do any Man's Buſineſs,</hi> how innocent ſoever; of theſe the Prophet <hi>David</hi> had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, woful Experience, though he was <hi>a Man</hi> (for Integrity) <hi>after God's own Heart:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the good Man was <hi>at his Wits end almoſt,</hi> and knew not well how to deal with theſe Men-catchers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts the queſtion, as if he knew not how to reſolve it, Saying—<hi>What ſhall be given unto thee?
<note place="margin">Pſ. 120.3.</note> or what ſhall be done unto thee, thou falſe Tongue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if he ſhould ſay; How ſhould <hi>I ſtop</hi> thy Mouth, thou falſe Tongue?
<note place="margin">Pſ. 120.4.</note> anſwering in the next Verſe, <hi>ſharp Arrows of the Mighty with Coals of Juniper:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay;</p>
            <p>Except the Mighty God with <hi>Coals of Juniper</hi> (the hotteſt Coals) <hi>ſtop</hi> the Mouth of theſe ſlanderous Tongues by his All-ſeeing Power (ſome unexpected Providence) vain is the help of Man.</p>
            <p>Therefore he adds—<hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Meſech</hi>— amongſt a Pack of Rogues,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 120.5.</note> that will ſay and ſwear any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94091:6"/>thing; what hlep? He flys to God therefore and prays— and crys in this Diſtreſs—<hi>Deliver my Soul, O Lord,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 120.2.</note> from lying Lips, and a from deceitful Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Method he uſes againſt theſe Trepanners, and Men-catchers, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.141, 142. making <hi>theſe three Pſalms</hi> againſt theſe dangerous Fellows,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 140.1.</note> falling to his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and beginning with the <hi>Letany—Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil Man, preſerve me from the violent Man,</hi> (or the Men of Violence) <hi>which imagine Miſchief in their Heart,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 140.2.</note> continually are they gathered together</hi> (or conſpiring or plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) <hi>for War:</hi> And what War? what Bloodſhed? not that of the Sword, but wicked Tongues, a ſharper Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and kills as ſure; for he adds—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They have ſharpened their Tongues like a Serpent,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 140.3.</note> Adder's Poyſon is under their Lips.</hi> Selah; or, mark that.</p>
            <p>And Verſe 5. <hi>The Proud have hid a Snare for me,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 140.5.</note> and Cords, they have ſpread a Net by the way-ſide; they have ſet Grins for me.</hi> Selah. Theſe are the Snare-layers, that watch for Men's Words to catch at them, that watch for Men's halting, as they did for the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s, when he heard <hi>the defaming of many;</hi> Fear <hi>on every ſide, Report,
<note place="margin">Jer. 20.10.</note> ſay they, and we will report it;</hi> with advantage no doubt, a Lye (like a Snow-Ball) ſeldom loſes any thing in the tumbling up and down.</p>
            <p>Thus, in anſwer to the firſt Query, I have given you <hi>the Character</hi> of a <hi>Man-Catcher;</hi> and though I have not skill enough to pourtray and limn <hi>this Limb</hi> of the Devil, that would <hi>Harraſs</hi> Men out of their Lives and Eſtates, yet by what I have ſaid, you cannot but look upon him as the <hi>worſt of Villains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. <hi>Of what</hi> do theſe Men-catchers make their Snares?
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This Queſtion is not ſo eaſily anſwered; for the Devil and <hi>his Emiſſaries tutor</hi> them and find them ſtuff to work upon, and if one Snare <hi>break,</hi> they'll to work again, and will try if <hi>another will hold.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94091:7"/>
            <p>They work with <hi>Head and Heart,</hi> Hand and Tongue and Pen, but always privily, in <hi>private-Cabals</hi> they plot their Work, ſit their Engines, procure their Tools and Inſtruments and Engines; ſpare for no pains, no coſt, not daunted with any ill ſucceſs; like their Maſter, <hi>running to and fro, ſeeking whom they may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either by down-right Murder and <hi>Ravilliacks,</hi> taking Men's Lives away; that Snare catches Men to purpoſe. It was a <hi>Pope</hi> that ſaid on ſuch an occaſion, <hi>a dead Dog bites not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though theſe are <hi>ſure Snares,</hi> yet there is <hi>danger</hi> in ſetting them, and <hi>jeopardy</hi> to boot; dangerous to the <hi>Men-Hunters,</hi> and <hi>Men-Catchers;</hi> murder will out, one time or other.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſureſt way of catching Innocent Men, is, <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s-<hi>way,</hi> to make the <hi>Law catch a Man,</hi> (as Innocent <hi>Naboth</hi>) and kill him by the Teſtimony of ſome <hi>Sons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial;</hi> as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Some think, That this Sin of Catching, Trapping, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring and Trepanning Men by Sham-Plots and Sham-Swearers and falſe Swearers, is a <hi>New-Mode,</hi> lately Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and new come over <hi>from beyond Seas,</hi> as our <hi>other new-Modes</hi> and Faſhions, and from <hi>the ſame place</hi> too:</p>
            <p>But they are mightily miſtaken, that think this Sin of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring Men at this rate is a new Sin, and never (or but lately) invented and thought of, before this Age, ſo fruitful and luxuriant in monſtrous Births and impious Productions.</p>
            <p>For you ſee already that this Sin is older than my Text, an old Trick of the Devil, of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> of <hi>Ahab whom Jezebel his Wife ſtirred up;</hi> no Sin more ſpoken of in Holy Scripture, no Sin had worſe Conſequence; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>of Swearing</hi> (the Prophet means, Forſwearing, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or Falſe-Swearing) <hi>the Land mourneth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 23.10.</note> as well as for what goes before, namely, <hi>the Land is full of Adulterers; and therefore</hi> alſo the Land mourneth: And ſo the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> couples them together—<hi>By Swearing,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.2.</note> and Lying, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94091:7"/>Killing, and committing Adultery, they break out, and Blood toucheth Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Original Word for <hi>Blood</hi> there, is in the <hi>plural</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to denote a great deal of Blood ſhed already by thoſe <hi>Falſe-Swearers,</hi> Affidavit-Men and Men-catchers, a <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> as well as a <hi>bloody</hi> Crew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. How and where do they lay theſe Snares?
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Anſw. Pſal. 11.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, always in the Dark, <hi>privily do they ſhoot, and fear not,</hi> for their Works are Works of Darkneſs, their Engineer the Prince of Darkneſs, and the <hi>Whore</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> (that has <hi>Myſtery</hi> writ in her Forehead) diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines them in <hi>this Myſtery</hi> of Iniquity,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 64 5.</note> in <hi>laying Snares to catch Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But always they ſet their Snares <hi>by Night</hi> (I mean) <hi>by dark,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 1.11.</note> they hope no Body ſees them;
<note place="margin">Eccleſ 5.8.</note> but he <hi>that is higher than the higheſt regardeth, and there are higher than they.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> compares theſe lurking Catch-Poles, theſe Knights of the Poſt, (that wait in all Companies, and plye in all Aſſemblies) unto a <hi>Lion lurking in his Den,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 17.12.</note> or in ſecret places, lying in wait privily and undder ſome Covert (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the righteous Law) to catch Men, to catch their Prey.</p>
            <p>Where Men walk, where Men talk, <hi>by the way-ſide,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. 140.5.</note> ſays <hi>David,</hi> they inſinuate into all Companies, all Buſineſs, all Aſſemblies, where they can get admittance, they are never out of their way; catch at the Words of a Miniſter in the Pulpit, of a Judg upon the Bench, <hi>laying Snares for him that reproveth in the Gate,</hi> trepanning their very Comrades, their Friends and Familiars, like <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s Companions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. <hi>All my Familiars waited for my halting, ſaying, Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he will be enticed, and we ſhall prevail againſt him, and we ſhall take our Revenge on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this they always do with all Privacy imaginable, and perhaps under an <hi>Oath of Secrecy,</hi> to pump the deeper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colour of Friendſhip, or under colour of ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word that will bear two Sences, and they ſhall always
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94091:8"/>take it in the <hi>worst</hi> Sence and the <hi>wrong</hi> Sence, and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent in Sence,</hi> and incoherent with all former or ſubſequent Diſcourſe, or make Additions, <hi>Villainous Additions</hi> of their own, theſe are the Dark-Lanthorn-Men, that like <hi>Faux,</hi> walk with a Vizard on, the Vizard of Honeſty, of Religion, Friendſhip, or, perhaps of good Fellowſhip, laying thus <hi>their Snares</hi> ſecretly and in the Dark,
<note place="margin">Pſ. 142.3.</note> 
               <hi>to catch Men;</hi> Pſal. 142.3. <hi>In the way</hi> (ſaith Holy <hi>David,</hi> of my Employ, my Trade, my Buſineſs) <hi>wherein I walked, have they privily laid a Snare for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4.</note> let us conſider the <hi>Iſſue and Effect</hi> of theſe Catch-Poles, theſe Men-catchers, theſe <hi>Judas-ſes,</hi> theſe Trepanners; (For I know, you would gladly ſee their Exit and Departure.)</p>
            <p>They do not all (like <hi>Judas</hi> their Brother) hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> otherwiſe than as their own Facts bring them to the Gallows, and the Pit they have digged for others they fall into themſelves. Thus Holy <hi>David</hi> prayed againſt theſe Men, and no doubt but God Almighty heard his Prayers—<hi>Grant not,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 140.8, 9.</note> O Lord, the deſires of the Wicked, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not his wicked device, lest they exalt themſelves.</hi> Selah. <hi>As for the Head of thoſe that compaſs me about, in the miſchief of their own Lips cover them.

               <hi>Deliver me from my Perſecutors,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 142.6, 7.</note> for they are ſtronger than I.

            <p>But yet it is as true, that God in his ſecret Wiſdom <hi>does ſuffer</hi> theſe Trepanners to proſper a while in their Roguery; and ſeems to hide his Eyes whilſt his Beloved may be <hi>ſore ſmitten in the place of Dragons,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 44.19, 22, 23, 24.</note> and be covered with the ſhadow of Death, though for his ſake, they be killed all the day long, and are counted as Sheep for the Slaughter,</hi> whilſt Almighty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94091:8"/>God <hi>ſeems to ſleep,</hi> and <hi>caſt them off for ever, hiding his Face, and forgetting their Affliction and their Oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilst the Wicked ſay, Tuſh, God hath forgotten,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.11.</note> he hideth his Face, he will never ſee it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I fear, that <hi>Atheiſm and Irreligion</hi> is the great cauſe of theſe Evils of Swearing, Forſwearing, Perjury and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy amongſt us; together with that falſe Religion, that deems it lawful to <hi>do evil that good may come thereof;</hi> or, (however) can give a Pardon for the worſt of Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villanies; nay, can Saint a Villain, a <hi>Clement,</hi> a Murderer, a <hi>Ravilliack</hi> for Murder and King-killing.</p>
            <p>Betwixt this Religion and no Religion there goes but a pair of Sheers, they are all of a Piece, and the ground-work of this Religion and no Religion, is <hi>one and the ſame,</hi> A the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, it is to be feared; The ſubtile Grandees and Engineers that ſet the <hi>bigotted</hi> Wheels at work, ſaying in their Heart, There is no God; as that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 10. that was ſuch a Fool as to diſcover his Atheiſm, in a jolly Fit, or to ſhew his Wit, and that he was above the foppiſh Ceremonies of that Superſtition, could not forbear his villanous Poetry, in another place recited, <q>—<hi>Hem! quantum reddit nobis haec fabula Chriſti!</hi>
               </q>

            <p>I am ſure this Temper or Diſtemper of Atheiſm drew a great deal of Blood, good and bad, from <hi>Iſrael and Judah,</hi> and made their Iniquity to be exceeding great,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.9.</note> and filled <hi>the Land full of Blood, and the City full of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion:</hi> (for ſo the word <hi>Perverſeneſs</hi> is rendred, <hi>wreſting of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the Margent) And the reaſon of theſe Miſchiefs, is there given by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> at the latter end of the Verſe, to be Atheiſm—<hi>For they ſay, The Lord hath forſaken the Earth, and the Lord ſeeth not.</hi> Like thoſe in <hi>Malachi,</hi> that ſay,
<note place="margin">Mal. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>Every one that doeth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94091:9"/>Judgment?</hi> Where? No where ſure, ſaith the Atheiſt, or elſe he is like <hi>Baal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 18.27.</note> and buſy, either he is talking, or he is purſuing, or is in a Journey, or takes a Nap at preſent, and ſleepeth and muſt be awakened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poor Worms!</hi> Yet theſe are the Blades of our Times, and the Men of Valour, they dare ſtrut, like thoſe Gyants of old that bid Heaven Battel, and bid defiance to the God of Heaven, and blaſpheme him to his Face, and if they ever pray to him, 'tis only in Jeer, as when they pray to God to <hi>damne them,</hi> damn them:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All in good time;</hi> And yet theſe plumed Whiflers ſhall (like <hi>Caligula</hi>) ſeek a Cellar or Cave to hide their Heads in, when it does but Thunder, and their Hearts tremble and quake at every crack of Thunder:</p>
            <p>Or, if Death do but ſtare them in the Face, through the Caſement of Sickneſs, old Age, Peſtilence, or in a Battel, then any Privy-hole or Hollow-Tree, is worth all the World to them, to hide their Heads in.</p>
            <p>Ay, but like that <hi>Egyptian,</hi> King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> let but their Fears be over, and their Luſts that rule them make them Atheiſts again, or willing to be Atheiſts again, and they ſtrut again, and cry, damn them again, and the little Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks ſhreame out and yawleamain, pluming themſelves:</p>
            <p>Thus when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw that the <hi>Rain, and the Hail, and the Thunders were ceaſed,
<note place="margin">Exod. 9.34</note> he ſinned yet more, and hardened his Heart, he and his Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I'lle aſſure you, theſe People think themſelves of the ſubtleſt Mould of Mankind, Wits refin'd from the common Dreggs of Opinions, imbib'd in Infancy and a Religious Education, and are in all Men's Opinions (as well as their own) <hi>no ſmall Fools.</hi> 'Tis a courſe Complement, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, to Men of their Pregnancy, but I learn'd it a long time ago in my Pſalter,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.1.</note> 
               <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his Heart, there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He cannot ſay ſo in his Head, if there be any Buſineſs in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94091:9"/>it, or any <hi>Eyes to ſee</hi> (the Earth, the Heavens, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, that keep their Courſes, whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Maker is God) but <hi>he ſays ſo in his Heart,</hi> (that is) he <hi>wiſhes and prays</hi> ſo in his Heart that there were no God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> (there) in the Original is <hi>Elohim,</hi> not <hi>Jehovah. Jehovah</hi> ſignifies God as he is Eternal and Self-Exiſtent; but <hi>Elohim</hi> ſignifies God as he is a <hi>Judg,</hi> and ſo this Pſalmiſt uſes the Word in Pſal. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods;
<note place="margin">Pſal 82.6.</note> Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> Judges or Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Thus the Fool could be content there was a <hi>Jehovah,</hi> a good and merciful God; but he cannot in his Heart (which accuſes and condemns him) deſire an <hi>Elohim,</hi> which is greater than our Heart, and knoweth all things, even the ſecrets of the Heart, the ſecret Plottings, Conſpiracies, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and black Villanies hatch'd in Hell and in <hi>the dark,</hi> and the moſt ſecret Adulteries, Sodomies, and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not to be named, whilſt the Atheiſtical Committers of theſe Impieties, like thoſe Antients of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that did their Idolatry in the dark,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſaid he unto me, Haſt thou ſeen this, O Son of Man?
<note place="margin">Ezek. 8.17.</note> Is it a light thing to the Houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>that they commit the Abominations which they commit here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For they have filled the Land with Violence, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to provoke me to Anger: and lo, they put the Branch to their Noſe.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>go dance,</hi> you Atheiſts! and ye that curſe and damn, ſwear and forſwear, and kick up your heels at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, go dance, like Murderers in a Goal (with your Shackles on) and think every day a play day till the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes come.</p>

            <p>One would think that no Man ſhould be ſo Purblind and Beetle-brow'd as to be an Atheiſt; who can chuſe but they muſt viſibly ſee God's Almighty hand ſtretched out, in Judgments, in Mercies, in overthrowing a mighty Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, and perhaps by a <hi>Jehu,</hi> as very an Oppreſſor as he that he overthrew, and treading in the ſame arbitrary and tyrannical Oppreſſion, and in the very ſteps of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, down tumbles he too; and this <hi>divine Juſtice</hi> is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to any Man of Obſervance or common-Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Heathen's called this Divine Vengeance—<hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis;</hi> and the Heathen Poet could not but obſerve it, when he ſaid—

            <p>But Words are loſt, and much more Holy Scripture Words are loſt on theſe ſtout Hectors, Atheiſts, falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Men-Catchers, Catch-Poles, and Sham-Evidence.</p>
            <p>God bleſs us all from them, and grant we may never come into their Clutches, or within the reach and probability of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94091:10"/>their Oaths, <hi>their Oaths, the Snares</hi> wherewith they catch Men, many honeſt Men, uſeful Men; nay, <hi>therefore</hi> theſe Men-catchers lay their Snares and their Oathing-Gins to catch them; becauſe they are honeſt and uſeful, and ſtand juſt in the way to hinder their villanous Plots and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Well, go on, and ſwear and damn your ſelves to the Pit of Hell, and let Men perſuade you there's no ſuch thing as Hell; at worſt, but a kind of Purgatory, (a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Crucible, only to take away your Droſs) and for a little Money, or killing two or three Hereticks, and that warm Hot-Houſe too may be avoided.</p>
            <p>Make theſe Lyes your Refuge, and under theſe falſhoods hide your ſelves, there's little hopes to convert a <hi>Judas,</hi> they'll be hang'd firſt, or hang themſelves firſt, as he did, and damn themſelves firſt, it is to be feared.</p>
            <p>Oh! but they'll ſay, It is a difficult thing to prove a Rogue perjur'd, and an Affidavit-Man, and an <hi>Evidence</hi> ſhall find Favour and Friends, 'tis hopeful; and if we ſwear (ſay they) to catch and trap a Man out of his Life and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, we are upon our Oaths, (<hi>ſo are they every hour of the day but when they ſleep,</hi> but no ſooner awake, but the firſt is a Prayer to God, Damn me) none can contradict us, the Jury is bound to believe us <hi>(whether they will or no, and in ſpight of their Heart and Conſcience)</hi> they muſt go according to their Evidence, <hi>(Yes, yes, the Juries well know their Duty, well know you and your Evidence too)</hi> none know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is not an Oath an Oath?</p>

               <hi>Yes, Yes,</hi> an Oath is an Oath, and an honeſt Man's Oath is intended for the <hi>deciſion of all Strife;</hi> an Oath is not to make Strife, nor to draw Blood, nor to drill Men out of their Eſtates and Honours.

            <p>But your Ghoſtly Father, nor their Father—<hi>Pa-Pa-Pater Patrum,</hi> cannot deliver the falſe-Swearers and Men-catchers from the juſt Judgment and Diſcovery of the Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who proteſts he will be both <hi>Judg</hi> and <hi>Jury</hi> and <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> too againſt the falſe Swearers, Adulterers and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,

            <p>What is Man, or Men, without the comfort of Society? what commerce or Felicity in the World without Society be ſecur'd?

            <p>I do not ſay that all Sins are crying Sins, and bring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a Kingdom and Nation, but this Sin of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion under colour of Law and Juſtice, by falſe Swearing and Sham-Evidence, catching and trapping Men, is certainly a <hi>crying Sin,</hi> and brought God's Judgments, his dreadful Judgments upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> the cry of whoſe Sins was ſo loud as to reach up to Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20, 21.</p>
            <p>And what were the Sins of <hi>Sodom?</hi> mark them well, as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> numbers them to the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to make them beware.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.48, 49, 50.</note> Sodom <hi>thy Siſter hath not done, ſhe nor her Daughters, as thou haſt done, thou and thy Daughters. Behold, this was the Iniquity of thy Siſter</hi> Sodom; <hi>Pride, fullneſs of Bread, and abundance of Idleneſs was in her,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94091:11"/>and in her Daughters, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that even withdrawing of Juſtice, or oppreſſing the needy,</hi> is a crying Sin, and deſtroyed <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Sin of falſe-Swearing, and Oppreſſion, or catching-Men by the Oaths of Catch-Poles and Sham-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, has been an old Sin that ruin'd King <hi>Ahab</hi> and Queen <hi>Jezebel,</hi> almoſt ruin'd their Kingdom by a great Drought, it rained not for the ſpace of three years, ſo that there was a Famine and Mortality, they had ſcarce any Graſs or <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to keep the reſt of the Beaſts alive.</hi> 1 Kings 18.5.</p>
            <p>Indeed this Sin, though a common (too too common Sin) is ſeldom touch'd upon in Pulpits, though none more declaim'd againſt in Holy Writ; ſome Miniſters will not, and ſome cannot, and ſome dare not give <hi>theſe Devils their due,</hi> by a juſt and ſharp Reproof, I mean theſe falſe-Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Catch-Poles, and Sham-Plotters, and Sham-Evidence, that lay their <hi>Snares privily to catch Men.</hi>

            <p>Let Papiſts call this a <hi>Venial Sin,</hi> we know 'tis <hi>Mortal,</hi> 'tis Fatal, 'tis a crying Sin.</p>
            <p>How conſcientious was good <hi>Samuel</hi> to aſſoil himſelf of this Sin before all the People, before he left his Office of chief Magiſtrate; though not in the leaſt Guilty, 1 Sam. 12.3. <hi>Behold, here I am, witneſs againſt me before the Lord, and before his Anointed: Whoſe Ox have I taken? or whoſe Aſs have I taken? or whom have I defranded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any Bribe to blind mine Eyes therewith?

            <p>Theſe (I ſay) are the great Plague, the <hi>none-ſuch Peſts</hi> of all Society, the <hi>common-Nuſance:</hi> no <hi>former Age</hi> (that I read of) can parallel ours for improvement of Vice and Miſchief: What Block-heads were the <hi>French-Men's</hi> Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in the <hi>Art of Poyſoning,</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>preſent Skill</hi> and Dexterity? What Block-heads were the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the <hi>native Iriſh</hi> in all Arts and Myſteries imaginable, in <hi>former Ages?</hi> But <hi>now</hi> how ingenious (though ſome of them are but Bunglers ſtill, and enough to deſtroy a neat, well laid, and well contriv'd Plot in the Management, for want of Skill in a ſubtile Intrigue.) But time and <hi>good Tutors may improve</hi> them, if there be firſt a willing mind.</p>
            <p>Tell not me of Conſcience and Religion, when Men make it a matter of Conſcience and Religion to catch Men by falſe Oaths, and ſo cut their Throats! <hi>Will you call this</hi> Religion, <hi>and an acceptable day to the Lord?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus have I entertained you an Hour, with my Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not without ſome reluctancy (I profeſs); for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd

            <p>I am no <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> to fancy that every conceit of mine, or warmth of Thought, is an impulſe of the Holy Ghoſt; nor yet ſuch a <hi>Libertine,</hi> as to neglect all obſervation of the ſecret and vehement Impulſes of God's Spirit, and his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our Spirits.

            <head>THE POSTSCRIPT TO THE READERS.</head>
            <p>ANd now, <hi>Gentle Readers,</hi> if ever I had <hi>need to beg</hi> your Candour, or to make an Apology for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a crude Sermon, now is the time.</p>
            <p>For as it is true, that I had not ſo much as ſhort Notes when I preach'd it, nor time to make them; ſo, as near as my Memory ſerves me, I have ſet down <hi>verbatim</hi> (at leaſt the Subſtance of) what I preach'd; writing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately what I preach'd, whilſt freſh in my Memory, and ſo ſent it the next day by a ſpecial Meſſenger to the Preſs.</p>
            <p>You'll ſay, perhaps, why? <hi>What haſte?</hi> If this had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Printed, or Printed ſeven years hence, it is ſoon enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all may be;</hi> For neither in the Preaching, nor Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing, had I the leaſt Reflection to hit any particular Man alive.</p>
            <p>But I know the Sin of <hi>ſetting Snares to catch Men</hi> is ſo common (<hi>too too common</hi> God knows) in theſe Days; ſuch Shamming and Trepanning, that ſcarce an honeſt Man in <hi>England</hi> of any Eminency, but has or may have cauſe to ſay with Holy <hi>David —Every day they wrest my Words,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 56.5.</note>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:94091:14"/>all their Thoughts are againſt me for Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Diſcourſe then be but <hi>conimoda ut accommoda,</hi> as profitable as ſeaſonable, I have my end and only aim; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely waving in this Sermon all vain Rhetorical Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, idle or elaborate Quotations, much more that ſcenical gaping, or endeavour at Wit, Pun or Quibble, ſo much admir'd by the Humming-Tribe.</p>
            <p>In which little Arts I have no Skill, and leſs Will; as thinking no Rhetorick nor Quotations comparable to that and thoſe in Holy Writ; leaving to Pulpit-Stagers, the little Hitts, Hintings and Glances at Wit, unbecoming the Gravity and Grandeur of a Divine, and better befitting the levity of a Stage, or a Barber's Shop, than the ſacred Pulpit.</p>
            <p>And as I have no Malice againſt any Man alive; ſo I do not know nor believe that I have an Enemy in the World, but ſuch as are ſo, upon the ſame Score, and for the ſame Reaſon,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1. Gal. 4, 16.</note> with which St. <hi>Paul</hi> upbraids the <hi>bewitched and fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>Am I therefore become your Enemy becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some think our Diviſions and Diſtractions are ſo great, that they will not find <hi>a ſhorter Period,</hi> than the Wars and Miſeries of <hi>Greece:</hi> of the end whereof the <hi>Oracle of Apollo</hi> (being conſulted) replyed,—<hi>They ſhould ſurceaſe when they ſhould double the Altar at Delos;</hi> which was Cubique-form. Whereupon all Hands went to work in haſte to add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Altar to the old one, <hi>of a like Cubique-Form to it;</hi> but to little Purpoſe, for the <hi>Miſeries abated not a whit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Plato</hi> better expounded the <hi>riddling God,</hi> telling them, the Oracle meant, <hi>They ſhould never have end;</hi> for the doubling a Cube in <hi>Solids,</hi> is (as the Quadrature of a Circle in <hi>Plano</hi> amongſt Geometricians, or as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Stonc, amongſt the vain-promiſing and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boaſting Chymiſts) never (alas!) <hi>never to be found out.</hi>

            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:94091:15"/>
            <p>Yet I have other Thoughts, more Faith, and better Hope that our Diſtractions will find a happy Concluſion, and the Death of the Plots and Sham-Plots in good time be <hi>fathom'd, ſounded</hi> to the bottom, and diſcovered; yet, truly, I think, (as is ſaid of the Altar at <hi>Delos</hi>) a period and end of our Diſtractions is impoſſible, 'till all <hi>Popiſh Altars, Popiſh Hopes,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Claim</hi> (by the <hi>Pope and his Emiſſaries</hi>) to theſe three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the propagation of his Superſtition amongſt us be extirpate and rooted out, nay, Root and Branch: for there <hi>always were</hi> Plots, Popiſh Plots, in the Reigns of all our Kings, ever ſince the Pope's Supremacy and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations have been rejected; and whilſt there is a <hi>fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and hopes</hi> of Redemption of this <hi>Golden-Fleece,</hi> (though they be <hi>but Glimpſes</hi>) Popiſh Plots and Conſpiracies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly ceaſe, nor the <hi>Engliſh, Scotiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh-Papiſts,</hi> ceaſe their Aſſiſtance and Conſpiracies, except they apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize from the Principles of Popery.</p>
            <p>Do they not all follow the Fathers of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> into which not a Man was admitted to Vote, 'till he had taken this Oath—<q>Ego N. &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>How <hi>inconſistent</hi> is this Oath with the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy? How <hi>impoſſible to reconcile</hi> theſe two Oaths?

            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94091:15"/>
            <p>For which cauſe (no doubt it was) made Treaſon (by the Statutes 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. and 3 <hi>Jacob.</hi> 4.

            </q>
            <p>Then the ſaid Statute <hi>(which ſee at large)</hi> makes it <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of Treaſon wittingly to aid or maintain ſuch an Apoſtate,</hi> or conceal his Offence twenty days together, <hi>without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it to a Justice of Peace,</hi> or other High Officer: nay, he ſhall pay an hundred Marks, and be impriſoned a Year, that ſhall <hi>willingly hear Maſs:</hi> As it follows in the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So careful have our Kings and Parliaments been to <hi>brand</hi> that <hi>Julian,</hi> that (being educated in an honeſt and true Religion built upon Holy Wait) ſhould be ſuch <hi>a Fool,</hi> or <hi>Knave,</hi> or <hi>Atheist</hi> (for <hi>one of the three,</hi> or <hi>all of the three,</hi> ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94091:16"/>an Apoſtate muſt be) to change ſuch a Religion, for a Superſtition forged and invented by <hi>Prelatical Pride and Rapacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>maintenance whereof,</hi> all their pious Frauds and Cheats, all their lying Miracles, Indulgencies, Purgatories, Limbus's, Croſſes, Images, <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> Holy Water, Maſſes, Canonizations, Prayers to Saints, baptizing of Bells, Excommunications, Fulminations, Inquiſitions, burning of Hereticks, Maſſacres, Fopperies, Plots and Sham-Plots are calculated, deſign'd and contriv'd.</p>
            <p>I do not think that <hi>every ſilly Papiſt</hi> knows theſe things; for they <hi>(poor Puppets!)</hi> dance, creep to the Croſs, cringe, bow, drop Beads, croſs themſelves, ſprinkle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Holy Water, mumble their <hi>Ave's,</hi> and <hi>ſhow tricks as the Masters of the Puppit Play,</hi> with Wiers <hi>(within the Curtain)</hi> actuate them; and make them <hi>frisk</hi> ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, <hi>curvet</hi> and ſhew ſuch <hi>Gambolls</hi> in Religion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Proceſſions</hi> (which I have ſeen in <hi>Portugal</hi>) that the ſobereſt Countenance cannot forbear a Smile, mixt with Pity.</p>
            <p>But there's never a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> amongſt them, <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Cardinal,</hi> but knows that I here write <hi>God's Truth:</hi> And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear <hi>laughing among themſelves</hi> at theſe Frauds; only, they ſanctify <hi>theſe Cheats</hi> with a <hi>mollifying</hi> Epithete, calling them—<hi>Pious Frauds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know, 'tis hard, very hard, for even a rational Man to emancipate himſelf and his Reaſon out of the Hands and Tyranny of Superſtitions, ſuck'd in with our Mother's Milk, and imbib'd by Education. And therefore, <hi>I rather pity than blame</hi> a ſilly Papiſt, Man or Woman, brought up in ſuch Superſtitions: Which are as ridiculous as that of the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Iſland of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that fight it out to Death to this <hi>day,</hi> to decide which is <hi>the right Elephant's Tooth</hi> that fell from Heaven; whilſt the wiſe laugh or pity them, judging (aright) that both the <hi>pretendedly-Divine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94091:16"/>and Heavenly Fangs</hi> came from the <hi>Jaw bone of the Beaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore have compaſſion for thoſe Bigots, <hi>but none</hi> for a Proteſtant, (that in defiance of Truth) ſhall apoſtatize therefrom, and run to <hi>theſe thick Skull'd Vanities;</hi> for which groſs <hi>Perverſion</hi> (not Converſion) the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> cannot ſo much as pretend <hi>the deluſion of Education;</hi> but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; (I ſay) <hi>ſuch a Julian Apoſtate,</hi> muſt either be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> and ſo, of <hi>no</hi> Religion; or ſome ſilly fooliſh Bigot that underſtands not the Principles <hi>of any</hi> Religion; or elſe has <hi>conceiv'd</hi> ſome monſtrous and <hi>bloody</hi> Stratagom and <hi>Plot,</hi> impoſſible to be <hi>brought forth,</hi> but by the <hi>ſolo Midwifery</hi> of ſuch <hi>bloody Hands and Bloody Religion;</hi> no other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can poſſibly do the Feat.

            <p>For did ever any wiſe or honeſt Man <hi>eſpouſe and wed</hi> a Religion (to which he was not <hi>pre-contracted,</hi> and in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy drawn in and <hi>cajol'd</hi>) 'till <hi>acquaintance first had</hi> with that Religion he <hi>weds?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> can deny their Lord and Maſter, as ſtoutly as ever did St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf; but <hi>he</hi> with Repentance, theſe without repenting.</p>

And I think I am not at all herein ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'd in my Charity, though I muſt expect <hi>never the fairer quarter</hi> from them for this Declaration.</p>
            <p>But where is our true <hi>Christian,</hi> true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and true <hi>Engliſh Courage</hi> now become? Who, (but he that's <hi>unfit to live</hi>) would <hi>fear to die in and for</hi> ſo juſt a Cauſe?</p>

            </p>
            <p>And yet <hi>this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> (though he can ſhow no Warrant, no Commiſſion nor Authority for his Claim, from Chriſt or Holy Scripture; yet, <hi>like another late <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi>) he can <hi>lay his Hand upon the Hilt</hi> of his two Swords <hi>(Spiritual and Temporal)</hi> and cry, <hi>This is my Commiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if his <hi>Temporal</hi> Sword (which is <hi>no ſmall one</hi>) be <hi>too ſhort;</hi> then he unſheaths his <hi>Spiritual Sword,</hi> and with <hi>Fulminations, Excommunications,</hi> Curſes and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, with Bell, Book and Candle, he huffs and ſwaggers; roars, nants, hectors and bluſters all Mankind, that <hi>either fear</hi>

            <p>To keep up therefore this uſurped Power, or to regain it, where loſt, <hi>there is,</hi> and ever <hi>will be</hi> Popiſh Plots, when and where there are <hi>any blooming hopes</hi> to accompliſh them in any Proteſtant Kingdom whatſoever.</p>
            <p>They are not now, (though they have been) much troubled with theſe Popiſh Plots in <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> wherefore? I'le tell you;</p>
            <p>For <hi>two Reaſons; One is,</hi> that the Laws againſt Papiſts are ſo fully put in Execution, <hi>without connivance;</hi> that I have rid a hundred Miles together in thoſe Countries, and could not (upon Inquiry) hear of one known and profeſs'd Papiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Reaſon is,</hi> (and they have found it, <hi>by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> a moſt <hi>incomparable</hi> Remedy) They <hi>gueld</hi> all the Popiſh Prieſts they catch in their Kingdoms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>They <hi>uſed to hang them</hi> formerly, but that would not do; for the hopes of being Canoniz'd and Sainted (as Martyrs) drill'd ſome ſilly Prieſts thither; 'till a <hi>converted Nun</hi> (I know not from <hi>what Experience</hi>) perſuaded Authority, to <hi>gueld all the Popiſh Prieſts</hi> they took.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They took her Advice,</hi> and it proves a wonderful Cure and <hi>Remedy againſt propagation</hi> of Popery in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>I ſay therefore, 'tis ſenceleſs to doubt <hi>the being of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot,</hi> that <hi>never ceas'd</hi> (ſince the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.) <hi>in England;</hi> but now by <hi>Coleman's Letters</hi> it infallibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they never had <hi>ſuch bleſſed hopes</hi> of converting theſe three Kingdoms, ſince the <hi>Bone-fires</hi> in <hi>Smithfield</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary's Days,</hi> as <hi>now, now</hi> at <hi>this</hi> time, <hi>now that</hi>—</p>
            <p>And <hi>the more impudently</hi> they deny ſo clear a Truth, the more cauſe we have to <hi>abominate the Villany</hi> of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94091:19"/>that hardens Men in <hi>Lies</hi> or <hi>Equivocations even to Death;</hi> And the more they deny it, after ſuch apparent and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Conviction, the more ſuſpicious and dangerous it is, by the combined endeavour to conceal it, and to turn the Edge thereof upon the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Thus the Prophet did firſt <hi>blindfold the Syrians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 6.18.</note> and then how <hi>eaſily</hi> did he lead them into the <hi>Enemies Camp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed no Man can deny but 'tis politickly and craftily done, to endeavour to <hi>put out the Eyes of thoſe Men,</hi> that are moſt quick-ſighted to <hi>diſcern their dark</hi> myſterious and helliſh Intrigues: Or, if they could but be <hi>Godfrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd, ſtrangl'd, hang'd</hi> or <hi>ſtab'd,</hi> the Buſineſs would be done as effectually, and to all Intents and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> if the Sham-Evidences would but be improv'd and manag'd, with ſome <hi>Lawyer</hi>'s <hi>Hackney-Tongue,</hi> whoſe Conſcience is ſo often ſold <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> right or wrong, for <hi>Plaintiff</hi> or <hi>Defendant</hi> (who <hi>bids moſt,</hi> and who <hi>comes firſt</hi>) proſtituted and ſet to ſale, (when Merchandize is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently and equally made of Truth and Falſhood) the Snare of <hi>catching Men would be the ſtronger,</hi> and the Feat more currant. But that honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Juries do know that a <hi>Hackney-Tongue is no Slander,</hi> and they'll believe them no further than they liſt; They have heard them ſo often <hi>bawle, babble and bluster,</hi> ſo loud and clamorous for Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff <hi>one day,</hi> for Defendant <hi>another,</hi> that <hi>no wiſe Man heeds them;</hi> but knows that <hi>Words</hi> are <hi>but Wind, Windy Words</hi> (from <hi>Hackney-Tongues</hi>) as <hi>empty and variable as the Wind;</hi> but that it coſts more to <hi>buy ſuch Winds,</hi> than it does the <hi>becalmed Mariners</hi> in the <hi>Baltick-Sea,</hi> when they (as I have ſometimes known them) <hi>buy a Wind of a Lapland-Witch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ('tis obſervable) that <hi>this Hackney Wind,</hi> as well as <hi>the other,</hi> is uſually <hi>fatal to all that buy</hi> them, <hi>ending</hi> in a <hi>Wreck,</hi> at leaſt, <hi>a repented Bluſter and Storm.</hi>

            <p>Whilſt theſe <hi>Merchants of Truth and Falſhood;</hi> Merchants of Law, and ſometimes of very <hi>little or no Law,</hi> (but with) the ſame <hi>Hackney</hi> Tongues, vilify and diſgrace all that ſtand in their way, without reſpect to <hi>their own Modeſty</hi> (I thank you, ſome of them <hi>have none!</hi>) without reſpect to Ingenuity, <hi>common Civility,</hi> or good <hi>Manners,</hi> without reſpect to any Man's <hi>Worth or Quality</hi> (except they expect <hi>a Fee from them;</hi> for that <hi>alone opens and ſhuts the Breath-ſeller's Mouth</hi>) they cannot <hi>open,</hi> but <hi>Dirt flys out to beſpatter,</hi> as if they had got a <hi>Priviledg</hi> or Patent to be the <hi>Common-Shoars,</hi> and <hi>common Filth,</hi> common Slanderers, <hi>under the colour</hi> of a Fee, and <hi>under the Protection</hi> of a <hi>Motley</hi> or <hi>Button-Gown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, (I know it, and will maintain it for a great Truth) that a Gentleman's Credit and Eſtate, Life and Honour, are in leſs Danger and Hazard in the Field amongſt ten thouſand Enemies, than amongſt thoſe <hi>ſneaking Split-Cauſes,</hi> theſe Snappers, Enſnarers, and <hi>Catchers of Men.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>wary Hollanders</hi> therefore (though the greateſt and wiſeſt encouragers of Trade) <hi>of all Trades and Mysteries of Iniquity,</hi> ſuffer not the <hi>Merchandize of theſe Hucksters of Law,</hi> in any of their Territories.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>I would not</hi> be conſtrued to reflect in the leaſt upon thoſe <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> Gentlemen of the <hi>Long-Robe,</hi> of which ſort are very <hi>many,</hi> that have more Integrity and Honour, than to <hi>abuſe their learned</hi> Skill by <hi>entrapping, enſnaring</hi> and catching Men, with <hi>Law-tricks,</hi> and <hi>Sham-tricks,</hi> turning Darkneſs to Light, and Light to Darkneſs, and turning <hi>Pleading to Rayling,</hi> Lying and Slandering; now ſo much the Mode at Bar: a Shame it ſhould be ſuffered!</p>
            <p>'Tis theſe alone (as the World goes) that can defend us from the <hi>catching Snares</hi> laid by the former, to catch <hi>a Man and his Cauſe,</hi> a Man and his Heritage.</p>
            <p>'Tis theſe alone (with the Authority, Juſtice and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Reverend Judges) that can deliver Men <hi>out of the Snares</hi> that are <hi>laid</hi> for them, by <hi>thoſe prostituted Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>none of the Snares</hi> that are laid to <hi>catch Men,</hi> are comparable to the <hi>Subtilty and Cruelty of the Romiſh Priests;</hi> for the <hi>ſpeediest</hi> Execution of a Sham-Plot, is an <hi>Abſolution from a Jeſuit;</hi> or a <hi>Bull of Indulgence</hi> or <hi>Jubilee</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> like that of <hi>Pardon</hi> to the <hi>late Iriſh</hi> Rebels and <hi>Cut-Throats.</hi>
