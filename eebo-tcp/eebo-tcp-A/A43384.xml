            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MR.</hi> Herbert<hi>'s Poems</hi> have met with so general and deserv'd Acceptance, that they have undergone Eleven Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons near Twenty Years ago: He hath obtain'd by way of Eminency, the Name of <hi>Our Divine Poet,</hi> and his Verses have been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quoted in Sermons and other Discourses; yet, I fear, few of them have been Sung since his Death, the Times not being at the Command of ordinary Readers.</p>
            <p>This attempt therefore, (such as it is) is to bring so many of them as I well could, which I judg'd suited to the Capacity and Devotion of Private Christians, into the <hi>Common Metre</hi> to be Sung in their Closets or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: The like I have done as to some of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Hymns in Dr. <hi>Woodford</hi>'s <hi>Paraphrase</hi>: To all which I have added one <hi>Ode</hi> in the same Measures in which I had it, because I think it was never Printed, and I thought it Pity, it should be lost in a Private Hand. I hope I shall not be counted a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> seeing I claim nothing here as my own, but what they allow me, <hi>viz.</hi> a Liberty to Sing and use their Hymns, which I was no more able to do in their <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Tunes,</hi> than I was able to compose them as they did.</p>
            <p>Nor will this hinder <hi>their</hi> use of the Lyrick Measures in <hi>Herbert</hi> and others, who are enabled to do it by their
<pb facs="tcp:37095:3"/>
skill in Musick, which they ought to look upon as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to be accounted for. How much more fit is <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's Temple</hi> to be set to the Lute, than <hi>Cowley's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress!</hi> It is hard that no one can be taught Musick, but in such wanton Songs as fill the Hearts of many Learners with Lust and Vanity all their Days. Why should it be thought a greater Prophaning of Spiritual Songs to use them in a Musick-Scool, than it is of the New Testament, to teach Children to spell; yet what Christian would not rather have his Child taught to read in a Bible than in a Play-Book? Especially, when they who learn Musick are generally more apt to receive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions from the Matter of the Song, than Children are from the Books in which they first learn to Spell. My attempt hath been easie, only to alter the measures of some Hymns, keeping strictly to the Sence of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; But how noble an undertaking were it, if any one could and would rescue the high flights, and lofty strains found in the most Celebrated Poets, from their sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Applications to <hi>Carnal Love,</hi> and restore them to the <hi>Divine Love!</hi> When the Devil drew off the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the True God, He caus'd the same Institutions with which God was honoured, to be used in the Idol Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Temple, Priests, Sacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. and amongst the rest <hi>Psalmody:</hi> And it is strange, that when we have so long been emerg'd out of Heathenism, that such a Remnant of it should be amongst us, wherein the most devotional Part of Religion doth consist.</p>
            <p>Almost all Phrases and Expressions of Worship due only to God, are continu'd in these artificial Composures in the Heathenish use of them, even from the <hi>Inspirations</hi> that they invoke in their beginning, to the <hi>Raptures, Flames, Adorations,</hi> &amp;c. That they pretend to in the Progress: Nor are these meer empty Names with them, but their Hearts are more fervently carried out in the
<pb facs="tcp:37095:3"/>
musical use of them, than they would be if their Knees were bow'd to <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Astaroth:</hi> Few Holy Souls are more affected with the Praises of a Redeemer, than they are of the wanton Object that they profess to adore. Oh for some to write <hi>Parodies,</hi> by which Name I find one Poem in <hi>Herbert</hi> call'd, which begins, <hi>Souls Joy, where art thou <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one,</hi> and was, I doubt not, a light Love-song turn'd into a Spiritual Hymn. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Est quum alterius Poetae Versus in aliud Argumentum trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruntur.</hi> I do not find it hath been made a Matter of scruple to turn the Temples built for Idols into Churches: And as to this Case, it is to be consider'd, that the Musick and Poetry was an excellent Gift of God, which ought to have been us'd for Him; and that their high strains of Love, Ioy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Suit none but the adorable Saviour; and all their most warm and affecting Expressions are stollen from the Churches Adoration of Christ; and who can doubt but the Church may take her own, whereever she finds it, whether in an Idolatrous Mass-Book or Prophane Love-song? It was a noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of him that said,
<q>I'll Consecrate my <hi>Magdalene</hi> to Thee—</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eyes, Mouth, Hair,</hi> which had been abus'd to Lust and Vanity were us'd to <hi>Wash, Kiss, Wipe</hi> the Feet of a Saviour: May Men and Angels Praise him for ever and ever! <hi>Amen.</hi>
