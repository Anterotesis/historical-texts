            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

hath taken great paines
to examine, search, and sift

rumors, not onely in the
North, but also in the South parts of this Realme,
according to the seuerall humours of sundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
some of them holding opinion, that all that
<hi>Action</hi> was true, and acted in deed by the <hi>Deuill</hi>
in the bodie of the <hi>Boy:</hi> and some others of the
wiser and more stayed sorte, remayning in a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
what they should thinke of it: in so much
that diuerse of the latter sort, being persons of good
Note and Qualitie, (knowing that I was well
acquainted with the matter, as hauing been an
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or Reader of the proofes collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and openly read in a very <hi>Honorable</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13570:3"/>
               <hi>Solemne</hi> assemblie) did deale earnestly with me;
that I would declare vnto them, euen <hi>in fide boni
viri,</hi> in the faith of an honest man, what I thought
thereof. And although I did truely and according
to their charming request, relate vnto them, how
plainely, euidently, and manifestly it was proued,
that the matter was a meere <hi>Imposture</hi> and <hi>Couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi>
yet could I by no meanes settle a resolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in some of them, that I had dealt sincerely
with them therein: neither would they be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from the doubtfull humour which had vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a predomination in them, but would remaine
still in the same, vntill they might vnderstand more
certaintie, of this my asseueration deliuered vnto
them. Which strong conceit (it seemeth) they
haue nourished and fostered in their minds, partly
vpon the extrauagant and extraordinarie Motions
and Gestures of the <hi>Counterfeit Cranke</hi> that acted
them, and partly vpon the <hi>Stoicall</hi> conuersation
and <hi>Holy life</hi> of the <hi>Chiefe Choragus,</hi> that brought
all those <hi>Actors</hi> vpon the <hi>Stage.</hi> To deliuer these
good minded people out of their error, it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired by many, and by some expected, as a
thing very conuenient, that the saide collected
proofes should be published to the world; so as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man thereby may see, what notable practises
haue been vndertaken: but to what end, I will not
iudge. In the meane while, I am bolde to present
vnto your view and censure, this little pamphlet,
containing a true <hi>Discourse</hi> of a matter of the like
<pb facs="tcp:13570:3"/>
Nature, written and printed in the French tongue,
and directed to the <hi>French King:</hi> which alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into my hands <hi>tam oportune,</hi> in so fit a time, I
thought good to translate and publish to the world,
to the end it may be seene, that euen by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the best <hi>Phisitians</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> nothing was
acted by the <hi>Boy</hi> of <hi>Notingham,</hi> or this <hi>Mayde</hi> of
<hi>Romorantin,</hi> but might very well be performed
by the course of Nature, and without the helpe,
presence or assistance of a <hi>Deuill.</hi> I was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to haue prefixed an <hi>Aduertisement</hi> to the
<hi>Reader,</hi> wherein I might haue made an <hi>Apologie</hi>
for my selfe, by alleadging some speciall reasons
why I translated this discourse: to answere some
curious <hi>Carpers,</hi> that may peraduenture taxe mee
for setting forth the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Toyes,</hi> that
are commonly vsed and practised by the <hi>Popish
Exorcists</hi> in their <hi>Coniurations:</hi> in which respect
some haue alreadie taxed mee for the Booke of
<hi>Congo.</hi> But I stand or fall to <hi>my God,</hi> assuring my
selfe, that I haue neither here nor there done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, which is not auouchable by the <hi>Sacred
Scriptures;</hi> let them feed their own humour as they
list. I meant also to haue enterlaced some other hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
&amp; examples of former times, touching such
cunning &amp; counterfeit <hi>Possessions.</hi> But when I had
gathered them together, I found that if I should
haue followed that course, accordingly as that
cause had required, I should haue made the head
bigger then the body, and the shortnesse of the
<pb facs="tcp:13570:4"/>
time would not haue permitted me to finish it in
fit oportunitie. And therfore I haue reserued those
<hi>Parralleles</hi> for a longer <hi>Treatise,</hi> which as my
leasure will affoord me, I meane by Gods good
leaue and fauour hereafter to publish. In the meane
time I beseech your Lordship to accept this

which we haue giuen therein and thereupon, in our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

Art, without any painted shew, without any flourish, but with
a naked simplicitie, the faithfull companion of trueth, which
you haue desired from vs in this matter, and which in euery
other thing you haue alwaies loued and curiously sought.
This desire, Sir, is a most certaine proofe of the vprightnes,
which you carrie both in your mouth and in your soule, as a
witnesse of your iust and holy intentions: whereby you haue
gained, and for euer confirmed the hearts of your Subiects
withdrawne from your obedience: and the amitie of forren
Nations, as much as you haue done by the terror of your
Armes: both the one and the other being as greatly assured
in the certaintie of your word, as they haue feared and stood
in awe of your inuincible courage. Receiue therefore, Sir, if
it may please you, the trueth contained in this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
as a testimony of our most humble obedience: and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to honour the same with the benignitie of your surueigh,
in fauour of the singular affection that you beare vnto
the trueth, which indeede doth make you so much the more
conformable to the <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> whereof you are a liuely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and which is the very Trueth it selfe. Whom we doe
humbly beseech to redouble vpon you his holy graces and

VPON THE MATTER OF
Martha Brossier of Romorantin,
pretended to be possessed

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S faith is the gift of <hi>God,</hi> and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
inspired by <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> whereby
we do stedfastly beleeue such things
as do not appeare vnto vs, neither
by sense nor by naturall reason: so
is too great credulitie a vice, that
proceedeth from an infirmitie or
weaknes of a mans minde, and that oftentimes by
suggestion of the wicked <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore old
authors haue said,<note place="margin">Epicharmus.</note> 
               <hi>That not to beleeue</hi> lightly is the sinew
<hi>of true wisedome:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.</note> and the <hi>Apostle</hi> forbiddeth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
euery <hi>Spirit.</hi> The faith of <hi>Christians</hi> is greatly
commended: but the credulitie of <hi>Magicians</hi> is much
reprehended, as being so great, that it taketh away
beliefe from all things; and is the cause, that by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
euery thing (though neuer so absurd) in the
end, men will no more beleeue any thing at all. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<hi>Antiquitie</hi> hath bin deceiued by the delusions
of <hi>Deuils,</hi> and drawne to superstition and idolatrie:
but <hi>Christian Religion</hi> hath been alwaies contrarie to
such deceits, to the end that the honor of the true God
and sinceritie of faith might be preserued. And this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13570:6"/>
was the cause, that by the craft and subtiltie of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
Christians</hi> had an euill report, and were by these
<hi>Sorcerers</hi> and Deceiuers expelled, when they went
about to work any of their delusions; for then would

<hi>Foorth Christians.</hi> Faith is a sure and certeine way to
come to veritie, saluation and wisedome: but too great
credulitie is the path that leadeth headlong to false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
fraud, follie and superstition. This difference
of faith and credulitie may bee shewed by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of ancient times: but there is none of them
more worthie to bee written and knowne in these
daies, then the <hi>Historie</hi> of <hi>Martha Brossier</hi> of <hi>Romoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>

the commaundement and word of God they are cast
out, haue by a diligent obseruation of all her signes

of this woman, and haue made their report
thereof to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the true Protector and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender

through credulitie, or to follow the opinion of the

that there was a wicked <hi>Spirit</hi> in the bodie of this
woman, challenging al others for <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Atheists,</hi>
which should thinke, or say, that this woman was not
a <hi>Daemóniake.</hi> The <hi>Parliament,</hi> by a solemne <hi>Decree</hi> of

But to the end, that there may rest no scruple or
doubt in weaker mindes, and that such a cousinage
may be knowne to all the world: we haue briefly and
truly written the whole <hi>Historie,</hi> we haue proued the
said <hi>Martha</hi> not to haue been a <hi>Daemóniake,</hi> wee haue
faithfully described the opinion and reasons of those
which thought the contrarie, following therein the
<hi>Original</hi>-writing of their owne hands, word for word:
and haue withall confuted their arguments, as being
grounded vpon too light coniectures. We doe hope,
that those which shall reade this discourse will receiue
pleasure and profit thereby, and con them thankes,
that (without fearing the slaunder of euill speakers,
and looking to none other marke, but onely to the
trueth it selfe) haue resisted and made warre against
the <hi>Author</hi> of lyes: and that they will likewise giue
thankes to God, who hath discouered this cousonage,
whereupon there might otherwise haue followed, not
onely false miracles, but also great diuision and parts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
among the people: as by the discourse ensew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all men of vnderstanding may know.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the xxx. of <hi>March</hi> 1599. at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the right Reuerend, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi>
there met together, <hi>Marescot, Ellain, Hautin, Riolan,</hi> and
<hi>Duret,</hi> within the <hi>Abbie</hi> of <hi>Saint Geneuesua,</hi> in the hall
of my Lord <hi>Abbat,</hi> where was brought before them
one <hi>Martha Brossier,</hi> who (they said) was possessed of a
wicked <hi>Spirit:</hi> and this was in the presence also of the
said Lords the <hi>Bishop</hi> and the <hi>Abbat,</hi> and many other
persons of Note. By the commandement of the said
Lord <hi>Bishop, Marescot</hi> (as the ancientest of the rest)
questioned with her in <hi>Latin:</hi> (for the rumour went,
that she spake all manner of languages) but she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
not a word. Then said the <hi>Abbat,</hi> She will not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13570:7"/>
answer, vnlesse my Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> commaund her. Then
the <hi>Bishop</hi> commaunded the <hi>Deuill</hi> to speake, saying,
<hi>Adiuro te per Deum viuum, vt respondeas Dommo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescoto.
I adiure thee by the liuing God, that thou answere</hi>
Master Marescot. But both the woman and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi>
were mute. She was againe questioned withall in
<hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Marescot</hi> the <hi>Phisitian,</hi> and in <hi>Greeke</hi> by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Marius Doctor</hi> of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Reader</hi> of
<hi>Greeke Philosophie:</hi> but she answered not a word. Then
the <hi>Bishop</hi> being very desirous and curious to discouer
the trueth: (because the said <hi>Martha</hi> had said, that this
was no place to answere in) commaunded that she
should be caried into a <hi>Chappell.</hi> Wherein, a number
of Tapers being lighted, one <hi>Priest</hi> accompanied with
two others, all apparelled in decent and <hi>Priestly</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in the presence of the said Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> and the
<hi>Abbat,</hi> and many other persons of qualitie, all being
together in great deuotion and at their praiers, began
to <hi>exorcise</hi> her. She, being vpon her knees praying to
God, and making the <hi>signe</hi> of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> presently tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
her selfe backward, first vpon her buttocks, then
vpon her backe and vpon her shoulders, and then
softly vpon her head. Whilest she lay vpon her back,
fetching her breath very deepe, and quaking in her
flankes, (like a horse after he hath runne) she turned
her eyes in her head, blared out her tongue, and tolde
the <hi>Bishop</hi> that he had not his <hi>Miter,</hi> and bid him that
he should goe and fetch it. Then they caused certen
<hi>Reliques</hi> of the very true <hi>Crosse</hi> to bee brought vnto
her, which she indured to be put in her mouth. They
presented also vnto her a <hi>Doctors</hi> whood, which shee
stoutly reiected, as though the whood of a <hi>Diuine,</hi> or
the <hi>Miter</hi> of a <hi>Bishop</hi> had more vertue and more <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
in them, then the <hi>Reliques</hi> of the very <hi>Crosse.</hi> These
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13570:7"/>
things being done, and many other, which would bee
to no purpose to rehearse, the Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the <hi>Phisitians</hi> would tell him what they
thought of it. Who after that they had maturely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated
together, and considered all that they
thought fit to bee considered, reported to the <hi>Bishop</hi>
with the consent of them all, and by the mouth of the
said <hi>Marescot,</hi> the ancientest of them all, what their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
was, and that in few words, <hi>Nihil à Daemone:
Multa ficta: Amorbo pauca. Nothing of the Deuill: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things counterfeited: and a few things of sicknesse.</hi> And
indeed all these actions were counterfeit, as hereafter
shall be shewed. But in trueth her tongue was red, and
they perceiued some little rumbling vnder her short
ribs on the left side, proper to those that are subiect to
the <hi>Spleene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The day following, which was <hi>Wednesday</hi> the last
day of <hi>March, Ellain</hi> and <hi>Duret</hi> met together: and
when the <hi>Exorcismes</hi> or <hi>Coniurations</hi> were againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
the said <hi>Martha</hi> fell downe at the rehearsall of
certaine words, raised her selfe vp againe very lustily,
made mowes vpon the <hi>Exorcists</hi> euen to their faces,
and nothing else was then done, sauing that <hi>Duret</hi>
pricked her with a pin, betweene the thumbe and the
forefinger. After these actions diuerse times reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vntill Noone, the <hi>Bishop</hi> demaunded of <hi>Ellain</hi> and
<hi>Duret,</hi> what they deemed of it. But they intreated the
<hi>Bishop,</hi> it might stand with his good pleasure, that the
other <hi>Phisitians,</hi> which had seene her the day before,
might be called, and others also with them, to the end
they might more maturely deliberate of the matter:
especially considering, that the said <hi>Martha Brossier,</hi>
being commaunded to giue some tokens of her pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
by the <hi>Deuill,</hi> had made answere, <hi>To morrowe:</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:13570:8"/>
which request the <hi>Bishop</hi> found to bee very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Vpon <hi>Thursday</hi> the first day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> all mysteries
were imployed and vsed: none of the remedies were
forgotten, that are proper to the driuing out of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils.</hi>
They setled themselues to prayers: She blared
out her tongue, turned her eyes, and at the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of certaine words, <hi>(Et homo factus est: Verbum caro
factum est: Tantum ergo Sacramentum:</hi> that is, <hi>And he
was made man: The word was made flesh: Therefore so great
a Sacrament)</hi> she fell as before, and vsed such motions,
as they doe that are troubled with a <hi>Conuulsion.</hi> Yet
all these actions seemed to the <hi>Phisitians</hi> to be meerly
counterfeit: and therefore they would haue been
gone. But my Lord the <hi>Bishop</hi> intreated them, that
they would bestow yet a little more time for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
benefit. The <hi>Exorcismes</hi> or <hi>Coniurations</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
againe: and then the woman hearing the words,
(<hi>Et homo factus est, And he was made man</hi>) she laboured
with all her strength and forces to make her gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
and being vpon her backe, in foure or fiue skips
remoued her selfe from the <hi>Altar</hi> to the <hi>Chappell</hi>-dore:
which indeed did astonish all the companie.<note n="*" place="margin">A Capuchin Frier.</note> Father
<hi>Seraphin</hi> waxed somewhat angrie, and said: <hi>If there be
any here that is incredulous, and will trouble her, the Deuill
will carie him away in the ayre.</hi> Then <hi>Marescot</hi> growing
impatient at that cousinage, said, <hi>I will take that hazard
and perill vpon me: let him carie me away, if he can.</hi> And so
set his knee vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her knee, took her by the gorge, and
commanded her to bee quiet. She being not able to
stirre her selfe, and seeing her cousinage to bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
said, <hi>He is gone: he hath left me.</hi> The good <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>
approching neere vnto her, said, <hi>Indeede this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but</hi> Martha: <hi>the Deuill is departed. Then haue I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13570:8"/>
made him runne away,</hi> quoth <hi>Marescot.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very desirous to know the trueth, and doubting
some counterfeiting, said: <hi>Let vs begin againe, and pray
to God, that he would learne vs the trueth: let vs see if the
Deuill will torment her againe.</hi> Then they sung <hi>Veni
Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles Creede.</hi> At this word, <hi>Et thomo
factus est, And he was made man,</hi> she did not fall, nor was
tormented any more: yea, when they shewed her the
<hi>holy Sacrament,</hi> she neither was troubled, nor tumbled
any more: but seeing <hi>Marescot, Hautin,</hi> and <hi>Riolan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
her, she said, <hi>Meddle thou with thy Phisicke. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescot</hi>
answered her: <hi>If thou doe stirre, and play the foole
againe, I will handle thee well enough.</hi> In the meane while
they perseuered in their prayers to God. She think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Marescot</hi> was departed, fell againe vpon her
backe, plaied her old trickes, and vsed her ordinarie
motions. Then <hi>Marescot, Hautin,</hi> and <hi>Riolan</hi> held her,
and staied her very easily. The <hi>Bishop</hi> began to say to
Father <hi>Seraphin</hi> the <hi>Exorcist, Good Father, command her
to rise.</hi> The good Father cried vnto her with a lowd
voyce, <hi>Raise thy selfe vpon thy feete, raise thy selfe vpon
thy feete. Marescot</hi> said, <hi>The Deuill riseth not in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:</hi>
and withall, because few people should take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
he spake alowd in <hi>Greeke,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Nothing against nature, nothing against nature.</hi> And
it is not to bee marueiled at, that the said <hi>Marescot,
Hautin,</hi> and <hi>Riolan</hi> were not afraid, because they knew
her dissembling, and beleeued in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is
the terror of all <hi>Deuils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riolan,</hi> at the commaundement of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> spake
vnto her in <hi>Latin,</hi> as followeth: <hi>Misera, quous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perges
nobis illudere? Nunquámne cessabis plebeculam ludificare?
Agnosce culpam, &amp; veniam deprecare. Patent enim tuae
fraudes: &amp; nisi hoc feceris, breui tradêris in manus Iudicis,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13570:9"/>
qui quaestione veritatem extorquebit: Thou wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
how long wilt thou proceede to delude vs? Wilt thou
neuer cease to deceiue the simple people? Acknowledge thy
fault, and craue pardon. For thy guiles are discouered: and
vnlesse thou doe so, thou shalt shortly bee deliuered into the
hands of the Iudge, who by torture will wrest out the trueth.</hi>
She being demaunded, whether she vnderstood this
or no, answered in good sooth, <hi>She did not.</hi> It was
thought, that now all this businesse was done: and
the <hi>Bishop</hi> withdrew himselfe, and went out of the
<hi>Chappell,</hi> with diuerse men of good Note, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the <hi>Phisitians,</hi> then being present, freely to
tell him their opinion and aduise. One of them assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him for certaine, that she had the <hi>Deuill</hi> in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
because she had blared out her tongue very farre,
and had indured the pricking of a pinne. Another
amongst them said, that vndoubtedly hee had seene
very many signes of counterfeiting: but yet his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
was, that they should stay three moneths longer,
to the end they might be assured, whether she had the
<hi>Deuill</hi> in her bodie or no. For <hi>Master Fernelius,</hi> as he
writeth in his <hi>Second booke De abditis rerum causis, Of
the secret causes of Nature,</hi> could not certainly know a
certaine sicke gentleman to bee possessed with a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
till the end of three moneths. Sixe others there
were, that very confidently and constantly said for
certaine, all these actions of <hi>Martha</hi> were fained and
dissembled, as it was reported on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> before.
And therefore it was thought that they were now at
the end of this businesse.</p>
            <p>But vpon the <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday</hi> following, being
the fourth and fifth daies of <hi>Aprill,</hi> they called other
<hi>Phisitians,</hi> (omitting the greatest part of those which
had seene her before) and then they began a new
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13570:9"/>
combat with this <hi>Fantasticall Deuill.</hi> One spake cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Greeke</hi> wordes vnto her: and she answered in
<hi>French.</hi> Another spake in <hi>English:</hi> shee answered in
<hi>French,</hi> but yet (as some say) somewhat to the purpose.
They obserued her most violent and sudden motions
to be without any change, either in pulse, or in breath,
or in colour. The <hi>Phisitians</hi> then present, made report
in many words and magnificall termes, that <hi>Martha</hi>
was possessed with a <hi>Deuill,</hi> and signed it with their
hands. Which report wee will write out hereafter,
word for word, as it is in the <hi>Originall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While all this was in doing, the <hi>Parliament</hi> fearing,
that this concourse of people, which came to see this
new <hi>Deuill,</hi> might breede some new Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster of <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
(whereunto were are all too much inclined) made
a <hi>Decree, That</hi> Martha Brossier <hi>should be committed into
the hands of</hi> Monsieur Lugoly, <hi>the Lieutenant Criminall.</hi>
Hereat, the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> persons repined, and said,
that this cause, of a woman pretended to be possessed,
belonged vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>Preachers</hi> cried out alowd at
the matter. And the <hi>King,</hi> being then at <hi>Founteyne-Bell'-eau,</hi>
and fearing also, that of this sparke there
might be kindled a great flame, commanded the like.
And for the performance thereof, <hi>Martha</hi> was caried
into the <hi>Chastelet,</hi> where she continued and liued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
for the space of two moneths, not as a prisoner,
but being entertained very mildly, and well lodged:
viewed and visited by <hi>Bishops, Abbats,</hi> and other <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi>
persons, <hi>Councellors</hi> of the <hi>Court, Aduocates,
Gentlemen,</hi> and many <hi>Ladies</hi> and <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> as many
times and as often as any was desirous to see her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
she was viewed by many <hi>Phisitians,</hi> that is to say,
by my <hi>Masters De la Riuiere,</hi> the chiefe <hi>Phisitian, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
the <hi>Kings ordinarie Phisitian, Laffilé</hi> the auncient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13570:10"/>
               <hi>Deane</hi> of the <hi>Facultie</hi> in <hi>Paris, Le Feure, Marescot, Ellain,
Hautin, Lusson, Pietre, Renard, Heroüard, Cousinot, D' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boise,
Palmier,</hi> and <hi>Marcés:</hi> all which did say, and signed
it with their hands, that they had not seene nor obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
any thing, that was aboue the common lawes of
Nature. And yet many there were, who being still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the old Leauen, had scattered it abroad
throughout the Citie, that in the <hi>Chastelet</hi> she had
plaied many of her <hi>Deuillish</hi> trickes: which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
found to be false.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Martha,</hi> being shriuen on the morow after
<hi>Easter</hi>-day, and absolued by the <hi>Curate</hi> of <hi>Saint Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi>
or the <hi>Vicar</hi> there, receiued the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
without making any stirre, or signe, or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a person possessed by a wicked <hi>Spirit.</hi> In the
end, when al sorts of informations were most diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
searched, and all things well considered, the <hi>Great
Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> set downe a <hi>Decree,</hi> with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and clemencie, which wee will deliuer you in
the end of this discourse. We haue declared vnto you
the whole <hi>Historie</hi> as in trueth it was: and now wee
must shew, by what reasons we were induced, firmely
to beleeue, that <hi>Martha Brossier</hi> neither was, nor is
possessed of a wicked <hi>Spirit:</hi> and afterwards wee will
signifie vnto you, how sleight their reasons are, which
held the contrary opinion, to the end we may cleere a
matter of so great weight and of such consequence.
But first we would haue euery man to vnderstand, that
we were not any way assistant in this action, but only
being called and commanded thereunto, by the right
Reuerend, the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris:</hi> and that wee had none
other scope therein, saue only <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Conscience,</hi>
not regarding what many might say thereof, nor the
harme that might redound to vs thereby. And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13570:10"/>
the <hi>Thesis</hi> and <hi>Generall Proposition,</hi> there was neuer
any doubt of it. For we doe beleeue, according to the
<hi>Christian Faith,</hi> that there are <hi>Deuils:</hi> that they enter
into mens bodies: and that they torment them in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
sorts: and all, whatsoeuer the <hi>Catholike Church</hi>
hath determined of their creation, Nature, Power, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and <hi>Exorcismes,</hi> wee hold to bee true, firme and
stable, as the <hi>Pole</hi> of <hi>Heauen.</hi> But touching the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
that is to say, that <hi>Martha Brossier</hi> is, or hath been
possessed of a <hi>Deuill,</hi> we say, it is absurd, false, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any likelihood. And to proue it, we will conclude
by this generall <hi>Syllogisme.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Maior.</hi> Nothing ought to be attributed

               <item>

            <p>Those that are exercised in the knowledge of the
signification and equipollence of propositions, and in
the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> will confesse, that it is concluded
very well <hi>in secundo Modo prima Figurae,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Celarent.</note> 
               <hi>in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13570:11"/>
second Moode of the first Figure.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> or the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
is very euident, and <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> is of
opinion, that there are <hi>Deuils,</hi> because there be many
things where of a man can giue none other reason, but
that it is the <hi>Deuill,</hi> as being extraordinary effects, and
surpassing the forces of Nature. The <hi>Minor</hi> or the
<hi>Assumption</hi> may bee knowne by an <hi>Induction</hi> of all the
<hi>Actions</hi> of the said <hi>Martha Brossier.</hi> For what hath she
done? Mary, she hath blared foorth her tongue, she
hath roled her eyes in her head, she hath shewed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
motions like to <hi>Conuulsions,</hi> and being laid vpon
her backe, she hath shaken her flankes. There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a one, I do not speake of these tumblers, but euen
of the very Lackies of the Court, that cannot doe so
much. And by this reason, that excellent Dancer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the rope was rather to bee counted a <hi>Daemóniake,</hi>
and possessed with a <hi>Deuill,</hi> then she is. <hi>Martha</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath done no <hi>Action,</hi> that wee ought to attribute
to the <hi>Deuill,</hi> as hereafter shall be more at large decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Moreouer, is it likely, that after fifteene moneths
being so often vexed and tormented, she should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
fat and in good liking? considering that euen
in the <hi>Gospell</hi> it is noted, that such as were possessed
with <hi>Deuils,</hi> waxed drie and very slender? We are yet
at this day all of vs of one minde and opinion, that the
motions like to <hi>Conuulsions</hi> in <hi>Martha,</hi> proceeded not
of any sicknesse or disease, because while she was in
them, keeping her eyes halfe shut and halfe open, she
perceiued and saw whatsoeuer was done, and did of
her owne free will and power moue her eye, and by
consequence all her body. Againe, such as haue a true
<hi>Conuulsion</hi> indeede, vse to bite those which come vnto
them, and put their fingers into their mouthes: yea, if
a man put a cudgell betweene their teeth, they will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13570:11"/>
crack it: and withall haue their limmes so starke and
stiffe, that they cannot be bended. <hi>Martha</hi> seeing her
selfe staied and holden by any, or hearing certaine
words of the <hi>Priest,</hi> wherewith she was before instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
lifted her self vp lustily, as though she had had not
fit at al. These motions then proceeded not of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and therefore they were counterfeit, as wee haue
alwaies maintained: or else they proceeded from the
<hi>Deuill,</hi> as some held opinion grounded vpon verie
sleight reasons: which we will throughly examine, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wee haue set downe the <hi>Originall</hi> report thereof
word for word, and inserted the same in this place, as
followeth.</p>

the Facultie of <hi>Phisicke,</hi> in the Vniuersitie
of <hi>Paris,</hi> touching the matter of <hi>Martha
Brossier,</hi> a maide of the age of two and
twentie yeres, or there abouts, borne at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morantin</hi>
in <hi>Berry,</hi> who diuerse times to some of vs, but
specially vpon <hi>Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> the second and third
of <hi>Aprill</hi> to all of vs in common, (sauing and excepted one of
vs, who was not there but only on the <hi>Saturday</hi>) was brought
vnto vs in the <hi>Chappel</hi> of my Lord of <hi>Saint Genenefue,</hi>
hearing Masse there celebrated by my Lord the right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and induring the <hi>Exorcisme,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on the <hi>Friday</hi> by <hi>Father Benet</hi> a <hi>Capuchine,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
therein by <hi>Father Seraphin,</hi> a <hi>Religious</hi> person of the
same Order, who had exercised her vpon the daies aforesaid:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13570:12"/>
and on the <hi>Saturday</hi> by <hi>Master Clerk</hi> a <hi>Lay Priest,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by <hi>Father</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillans.</hi>
And there, during the said time, we saw her some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in constitution, countenance and speech, as a person
sound of bodie and minde: and sometimes dissigured with
diuerse foule, vnseemely and deformed lookes: and now and
then vexed and troubled with many different and furious
motions of all the visible parts of her body: All the said euill
fauoured lookes being either full of a kinde of scoffing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,
and consining laughter: or very fierce, horrible, and
silent, and oftentimes accompanied for the most part with a
roaring. In the middest of all this, sometimes obeying and
answering the <hi>Priest,</hi> aswell in gesture as in words, vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
and demaunds that were conceiued in <hi>Greek,
Latin</hi> and <hi>English:</hi> but as farre as wee did marke, more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and more readily to <hi>Father Benet,</hi> then to any other: we
do say in our consciences and certifie that which followeth:</p>
                        <p>That is to say, as it may be that all this, which is before set
downe, remaining to bee specified hereafter, must necessarily
be referred to one of these three causes, which are <hi>Sicknesse,
Counterfeiting,</hi> or <hi>Diabolicall possession.</hi> And for the
opinion that it proceeded of <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> we are cleerely exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that, for that the agitations and motions which we
obserued therein, doe retaine nothing of the nature of <hi>Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
no not of those <hi>Diseases,</hi> whereunto at the first sight
they might haue been resembled: it being neither an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie,</hi>
or <hi>Falling Sicknesse,</hi> which alwaies supposeth the
losse of sense and iudgement: nor the <hi>Passion,</hi> which we call
<hi>Hysterica</hi> or <hi>Suffocation</hi> of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> which neuer is
either without vtter priuation, or at least without restraint
of breath: (of which accidents neuer did there any appeare
vnto vs.) But to the end we be not too long, and by excluding
generalities, to exclude lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

shall looke neere into the matter, these motions aforesaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13570:12"/>
found not to appertaine to any of the foure motions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of <hi>Diseases,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Shiuering, Trembling,
Panting,</hi> and <hi>Conuulsion:</hi> Or indeede, if there doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
any <hi>Conuulsions,</hi> and that a man will so call, the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vp of her eyes, the gnashing of her teeth, the writhing of
her chaps, (which are almost ordinarie with this maid while
she is in her fits:) the confidence which the <hi>Priest</hi> hath when
he openeth her mouth, and holdeth it open with his finger
within it: testifying sufficiently that they doe not proceed nor
are caused by any disease, (considering that in <hi>Diseases,</hi> he
that hath a <hi>Conuulsion</hi> is not master of that part or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
wherein it is, hauing neither any power of <hi>Election</hi> or
commaundement ouer it: and particularly in the <hi>Conuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of the <hi>Iawes,</hi> which is the most violent of all the rest, the
finger of the <hi>Priest</hi> should bee no more respected nor spared,
then the finger of another man, but should be as quickly bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
off.) Adding hereunto moreouer, that the accidents of
<hi>Diseases,</hi> aswell as the <hi>Diseases</hi> themselues, being found to
haue their times of beginning, increasing, full force, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
these torments here as they first tooke their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and mounted to their vttermost extremitie all at once,
so did they likewise cease all in a moment. <hi>Diseases</hi> and the
motions also of <hi>Diseases,</hi> (especially those that are violent)
as they leaue the bodie feeble, the visage pale, the breath pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
this maide on the contrarie, at the end of her fittes was
found to be as little moued and changed in pulse, colour, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and breath, as euer she was before: yea (which is the
more to be noted) as little at the end of her <hi>Exorcisme</hi> as at
the beginning, at euening as in the morning, at the last day
as at the first. Notwithstanding touching the point of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting,</hi>
the insensibilitie of her bodie, during her extasies
and furies, tried by the deepe prickings of long pinnes, which
were thrust into diuerse parts of her hands and of her necke,
and afterwards plucked out againe, without any shew, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13570:13"/>
euer she made, of feeling the same, either in the putting in of
them, or in the taking out of them: and also without any mark
of blood, (a griefe, which without <hi>Magike</hi> and without speech
could not in our opinion be indured, without any countenance
or shew thereof, neither by the constancie of the most coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
nor by the stoutnesse of the most wicked, nor by the strong
conceite of the most criminall Malefactors) tooke from vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the suspition of it: but much more perswaded vs from
that opinion, the thin and slender fome, that in her Mad-fits
we saw issue out of her mouth: which she had no meanes to be
able to counterfeit. And yet more then all this, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
before mentioned, of the little or no change at all,
that was seene in her person after all these most sharpe and
very long pangs, (a thing which no bodie in the world did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
trie in their most moderate exercises) we are driuen, euen
till this houre, by all the lawes of discourse and knowledge, yea
and almost forced to beleeue, that this maide is a <hi>Daemóni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake,</hi>
and the <hi>Deuill</hi> dwelling in her, who is the author of all
these effects: for that next after the corporall and materiall
causes, which wee doe not finde to haue had any place in this
matter, come the spirituall and supernaturall causes, in the
highest degree whereof, acknowledging <hi>God</hi> to be the Father
of grace and mercie, and the <hi>Angels</hi> to bee ordained for the
tuition and consolation of Mankinde, as <hi>Christian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
wee haue learned and know, that there is none but the
<hi>Deuill</hi> that delighteth in doing euill.</p>
                        <p>Now if wee had seene that, which my Lord of <hi>Saint Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuefue</hi>
and many others doe report, that this maide was
lifted vp into the ayre, more then foure foote, aboue fiue or
sixe strong persons that held her: it would haue been an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
vnto vs of an extraordinarie power, ouer and beyond
the common nature and condition of man. But not being
present at that wonder, we doe giue a testimonie of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which is as much or rather more admirable then that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13570:13"/>
force and power was, <hi>viz.</hi> that being demaunded, and in her
<hi>exorcising</hi> commaunded, (my Lord of <hi>Paris</hi> furnishing the
<hi>Priest</hi> with questions and Interrogatories) this maide diuers
and sundrie times, by many persons of qualitie and worthie of
credit was seene and heard to obey and answere to purpose, not
onely in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, (wherein it had not been imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
peraduenture to haue suspected some collusion) but also
in <hi>Greeke</hi> and in <hi>English,</hi> and that vpon the sudden. She
did (we say once againe) vnderstand the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
languages, wherein wee beleeue, as it is very likely, that
she was neuer studied: so that there was no collusion vsed with
her, neither could she inuent or imagine the interpretations
thereof. It resteth therefore euen in the iudgement of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
in the like case, that they were inspired into her.</p>
                        <p>By reason whereof, and considering also (vnder correction)
that <hi>S. Luke,</hi> who was both a <hi>Phisitian</hi> and an <hi>Euangelist,</hi>
describing the persons, out of whose bodies our <hi>Lord</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles</hi> did driue the <hi>Deuils,</hi> left vnto vs none other, nor
any greater signes, then those which we thinke wee haue seene
in this case: wee are the more induced, and almost confirmed
to beleeue and to conclude as before, taking God for a witnesse
of our consciences in the matter. Made at <hi>Paris,</hi> this third
of <hi>April.</hi> 1599.</p>

            <p>Now let vs briefly examine this long discourse: The
actions of <hi>Martha</hi> (say they) which we haue obserued,
are either counterfeited, or proceede of some <hi>Disease,</hi>
or are caused by the <hi>Deuill.</hi> Of any <hi>Disease</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
not, neither are they counterfeit: then are they
caused by the <hi>Deuill.</hi> The <hi>Proposition</hi> is true: the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
is false: and we do deny it. How proue you it?
Mary first you proue, that they proceeded not of any
<hi>Disease;</hi> because euery motion that proceedeth of any
<hi>Disease,</hi> is either a <hi>Trembling,</hi> or a <hi>Stifnes,</hi> or a <hi>Panting,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:13570:14"/>
or a <hi>Crampe.</hi> This diuision seemeth to bee imperfect:
because there bee diuerse motions proceeding from
<hi>Diseases,</hi> which are mixt: as for example those that are
called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mingled of a Crampe</hi> and a <hi>trembling:</hi>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Trembling with a Shiuering,</hi> which
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And these mixt kindes are
sometimes so mingled one with another, that it is a
very difficult thing, to referre them to any one of your
simple kindes. But let vs not rest vpon this, seeing we
are all agreed, that the motions of this woman procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not from any disease: and let vs examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which you alleadge for the <hi>Deuill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first reason is, for that she being pricked very
deepe with a pin, she neuer made any semblant, that
she felt it. Out of all question, when she was but
sleightly pricked on the side of her neck, she turned
her selfe, and felt it indeede: and then <hi>Father Seraphin</hi>
vsed his wonted excuse, and said, <hi>Here is nothing els but
Martha.</hi> Well, a little after, being pricked somewhat
deeper, she dissembled her paine: and therefore had
she the <hi>Deuill</hi> in her bodie? The Lackies of the Court,
which diuerse times will of themselues thrust a pin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deepe into some fleshie part, as in the thigh, or in
the arme, are they therefore possessed with a <hi>Spirit?</hi>
The wise <hi>Stoike,</hi> being inclosed in the bull of <hi>Phalaris,</hi>
said that it was but a gentle torment. Theeues that
robbe by the high way doe easily endure the torture:
we haue seene many that were burned aliue, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shewed any token of paine. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of
<hi>Lycurgus,</hi> saith, that the children of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi>
did vse themselues to stealing, with so great feare to
bee discouered in their theft, as one of them hauing
stollen a yong Foxe, hid it vnder his cloathes, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all his bellie to bee rent out with the nailes and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13570:14"/>
teeth of the beast, and yet neuer cried for it, for feare
he should haue been discouered, insomuch as he dyed
in the place where he was. Which thing (saith <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>)
is nothing incredible, when wee see what yong
children doe euen at this day indure. For wee haue
seene many that without either crying, or speaking a
word, haue indured to be whipped euen to the death,
vpon the Altar of <hi>Diana.</hi> Behold the very words of
<hi>Plutarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ye will say, that <hi>Martha</hi> was pricked, without
any blood following. Assuredly we did see a shew and
a marke of red. And ye must vnderstand, that when a
pinne is pricked directly and vprightly into a fleshie
part, wherein there is not notable veine, it will make a
very small and narrow hole, out of which blood doth
not issue, especially if the blood be earthie and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike.
Vpon such a like argument as yours is, wee
haue seene poore soules condemned to be burned for
Witches, and afterwards absolued and let goe by the
Iudges of the Court. A dangerous argument for such
Witches, and yet in this question now in hand much
lesse pricking then a pinne. But let vs argue by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie</hi>
a little more subtilly. <hi>Galen</hi> sheweth against
<hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>Sense</hi> is not the alteration or chaunge
that is made in the <hi>Organon</hi> or <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> but
the knowledge of that alteration. As for example,
(saith he) if I bee very attentiue to any thing, and in
the meane while one passeth before me: although his
image bee receiued into the <hi>Chrystalline humour</hi> of
mine eye, as it were in a glasse, yet for all that I shall
not see him, because the <hi>Visuall Spirit</hi> with the power
thereof is kept backe in the spring and original foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the sight: or the soule doth not send forth the
<hi>Common Sense</hi> into the eye, because it is occupied else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13570:15"/>
and without it there can bee no <hi>Sense,</hi> and by
consequence either little or no paine at all. If I bee
very greatly busied or occupied attentiuely about any
thing, although one crie out or speake alowd that is
neere vnto me, yet shall not I discerne what was said,
because the <hi>Common Sense</hi> is hindered elsewhere. Some
haue receiued many shots of gunnes in the warres,
that felt nothing thereof. <hi>Archimedes,</hi> being busied
about his <hi>Geometricall</hi> lines, did not thinke that <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusa</hi>
had been taken. If therefore constancie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
as also a strong imagination doe detaine the
<hi>Spirit Animall</hi> in her fountaine: if the <hi>Soule</hi> doe not
send foorth into the part her <hi>Common Sense,</hi> without
which there is either little or no feeling at all, and by
consequence either little or no paine: doe we thinke
it strange, that the patient, being very resolute, doth
endure little or no griefe, and so dissemble it? This
reason induced the <hi>Stoikes</hi> to defend this <hi>Paradoxe,
That griefe or paine consisteth in opinion:</hi> because <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
is the mother of <hi>Opinion:</hi> and if <hi>Imagination</hi> doe
not worke withall, there is no paine at all. Cease ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to conclude that <hi>Martha</hi> was possessed with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi>
because she was not moued with the pricking of a
pinne: conclude rather that she was not possessed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she felt not the pricking. For there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in it, and it is a thing <hi>incompatible,</hi> (not agreeing
with it selfe) that the <hi>Deuill</hi> should quite take away
the feeling of paine, from those whom he meaneth to
torment: nay, he would rather augment and increase
the same, to make them feele the greater paine. Cease
ye also to marueile, that there followed no blood out
of the pricke: for the onely apprehension or strong
conceit of being let blood, is ordinarily a cause, why
there followeth no blood out of the issue that is made,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13570:15"/>
although the veine bee very well opened. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people doe vsually say, <hi>I was so angred, as if a man
had stroke me with a dagger, I should not haue bled.</hi> And
thus haue wee philosophically disputed about a pinne
somewhat too much.</p>
            <p>The second reason to proue, that <hi>Martha</hi> was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a <hi>Deuill,</hi> is, That there appeared in her
mouth a certaine kinde of thin foame. Who did euer
heare any speech of the <hi>Deuils</hi> foame? If it be so, there
should haue been added, that it was also blacke. For
all that commeth from him being of hell, must needes
be blacke. Yea, our good old women vse to say, <hi>That
the Deuill hath no white at all in his eye.</hi> Who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
laughter, to heare, that a woman is knowne to
be possessed with a <hi>Spirit,</hi> by her foame and spittle?</p>
            <p>The third reason to proue that <hi>Martha</hi> was posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is, Because she had certaine maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
violent motions, without any alteration either in
her pulse, or in her breathing, or in her colour. But
truly, her motions were not so violent, but that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Phisitians,</hi> which could not patiently abide this
cousinage, could very easily stay her: and so would
haue done vpon the last daies also, when she plaied
her part so cunningly, if they had been called. But,
<hi>Non patebant fores, ne pateret veritas. The doores were not
open, for feare least the trueth should haue beene opened.</hi>
Moreouer, though the motions of <hi>Martha</hi> had been
violent, yet were they very briefe and short: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
she raised her selfe, and then the <hi>Exorcist</hi> said,
<hi>Here is nothing else but Martha.</hi> But let vs confesse and
auow, that these her motions were so violent and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
as they say, without any chaunge or alteration in
her pulse: yet this signifieth, that her blood was very
thicke and earthie, and so could not easily be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13570:16"/>
and therefore we say with <hi>Galen,</hi> that the pulse of
such people is very rare. We haue oftentimes seene,
sundrie Melancholike persons, not onely many daies
and moneths, but also many yeeres, to haue runne vp
and downe crying very strangely, and howling like
dogs, without any change, either in pulse, or in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
or in colour. Againe, vse and custome serueth
greatly to this purpose. There were fifteene moneths
spent in carying of her too and fro, like an Ape or a
Beare, to <hi>Angers, Saulmur, Clery, Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Paris:</hi> in
which time they taught her to practise all these gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds,
<hi>Et quae consueta sunt, minus afficere solent. The things
that are of vse and custome doe not breede any great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
How many things are there, which we doe daily
see in Nature to be farre more strange, admirable, and
incredible, which notwithstanding are not attributed
to <hi>Deuils,</hi> but to the hidden secrets of Nature? We see
those that are bitten with a mad dogge to barke like
dogges, Men that are Warewolfes to howle and eate
mans flesh like Wolues, because they haue their <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi>
hurt, and thinke themselues to bee Wolues.
They that are desirous to know more hereof, may
reade the two bookes of <hi>Leuinus Lemnius De occultis
Naturae miraculis, Of the secret miracles of Nature. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaldus</hi>
and <hi>Fracastorius</hi> in the bookes of <hi>Sympathie</hi> and
<hi>Antipathie:</hi> and <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> in his <hi>Magike Naturall:</hi>
and also that which a learned man of this age hath
written touching Miracles.</p>
            <p>To bee short, there are an infinit number of things,
that are done by the secret power of Nature: which if
because they are secret, wee should attribute to the
<hi>Deuill:</hi> then, to vnfolde the <hi>Questions</hi> of <hi>Naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie</hi>
and <hi>Phisicke,</hi> from the beginning to the end of
these two <hi>Sciences,</hi> we should alwaies haue recourse to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13570:16"/>
               <hi>Deuils.</hi> But this reason is of so slender force, as by the
same I may conclude the quite contrary, that is to say,
that <hi>Martha Brossier</hi> neither is, nor was possessed with
a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those that are possessed with a <hi>Deuill,</hi> after their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
and sudden motions, do remaine astonished,
and haue their members (as it were) cracked, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the ninth chapter of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> and by the
<hi>Histories</hi> reported by <hi>Master Fernelius</hi> in his second
booke <hi>De abditis rerum causis, Of the hidden causes of
Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha Brossier,</hi> after her motions, was not in that
case, but to the contrarie, remained liuely and lustie.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Martha Brossier</hi> was not possessed with a
<hi>Deuill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, build your beliefe vpon such slender
reasons as you make, to conclude a matter of so great
weight.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason, if it were true, would necessarily
conclude, that is to say, if she had spoken <hi>Greeke</hi> and
<hi>English,</hi> hauing neuer before learned either of those
languages, it would be a certaine and sure argument
of her possession with a <hi>Deuill.</hi> But that is altogether
false. For she neuer spake any other language, then
the <hi>French</hi> tongue, and the proper speech of <hi>Romoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
although false rumours haue been spread abroad
thereof to the contrarie. But (say they) indeede she
neuer spake either <hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>English:</hi> but she answered
to the purpose, when a question was demanded of her
in <hi>Greeke.</hi> One asked her, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: <hi>How camest
thou into the bodie?</hi> She answered in <hi>French, For the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God.</hi> Now the very selfe same question in <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eke</hi>
had bin made vnto her before at <hi>Clery,</hi> as <hi>Master Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
Criminal</hi> hath seene in his informations. It is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13570:17"/>
manifest therefore that there was a collusion in it.
Besides that, she answered not to the purpose: for she
was asked the means how he had entred into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
&amp; the answer was made of the end, that is to say,
wherfore it entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie. <hi>Father Benet</hi> questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with her a long time in <hi>English:</hi> and the good old
<hi>Father</hi> asked her, <hi>What was his name,</hi> and the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>I was not at your Christning.</hi> O goodly Miracle:
<hi>Martha</hi> had heard the <hi>Bishop,</hi> that furnished the good
<hi>Father</hi> with <hi>Interrogatories</hi> (as euen the <hi>Phisitians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
which though the woman was possessed, haue
written in their <hi>Reporte</hi>) and the <hi>Bishop</hi> willing him,
to aske it in <hi>English, What was his Name,</hi> it was an easie
matter for this cunning wench, being very craftie
and well instructed in such subtilties, to answere, <hi>I
was not at your Christning.</hi> But if in this woman there
had been a <hi>Diuell</hi> in deede, how commeth it to passe,
that hauing been so long a time conuersant in the
<hi>Westerne Church,</hi> where <hi>Latin</hi> is so common, it had not
in all that time learned that language? Now she did
confesse, that shee did not vnderstand vs, when wee
spake <hi>Latine:</hi> What was the reason then that she did
vnderstand rather the words of the <hi>Priests,</hi> but onely
because shee was alreadie instructed and vsed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and so vnderstoode them, as an <hi>Ape</hi> or a <hi>Dogge</hi>
vnderstandeth his Master? And for as much as whiles
she was in the <hi>Chastelet,</hi> shee had vsually in her hands
the booke of the <hi>Deuill</hi> of <hi>Laon,</hi> which shee brought
with her from <hi>Romarantin,</hi> and which <hi>Monsieur Lugoly</hi>
caused to be taken from her: I leaue it to considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether it were not of purpose to instruct her
more and more in such <hi>Apish</hi> toyes.</p>
            <p>Besides all these former reasons specified, they
bring vs the testimonie of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Euangelist</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:13570:17"/>
and <hi>Phisician,</hi> to the end that this authoritie should be
the greater against the <hi>Phisicians:</hi> who, when he reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Histories of such as were possessed, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> doth alleadge no more plaine and
euident signes of possession, then those that were seen
in this woman of <hi>Romarantin.</hi> Now let vs see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this bee true, and well concluded. In the first
place, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his eleuenth Chapter maketh
mention of a <hi>Diuell</hi> that was dombe, and driuen forth
by <hi>Christ,</hi> and doth not describe or set downe any
signes, whereby this <hi>Deuill</hi> might be knowne. The
<hi>Euangelists</hi> had no intent to describe any such signes.
For they which were brought to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
were euidently found to be such persons, euen by
the confession of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and on the behalfe of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> hee knew them well enough without any
signes. If therefore wee want none other signes of
the <hi>Diuels</hi> possession, but those that are set downe by
the <hi>Euangelists,</hi> then euery person that is <hi>Epileptike,</hi> or
troubled with the <hi>Falling Sicknesse,</hi> euery <hi>Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
and euery <hi>Frantike</hi> person shall haue the <hi>Deuill</hi> in
their bodies, and there will be moe <hi>Demóniakes</hi> in the
world, then there are <hi>Fooles.</hi> But let vs see, whether
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doe not set downe more apparant and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
tokens of such as are possessed with <hi>Deuils,</hi>
then those which <hi>Martha</hi> had. This <hi>Euangelist</hi> and
<hi>Phisician</hi> in the eight Chapter of his Gospell, descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the man possessed with a <hi>Deuill</hi> called <hi>Legion,</hi>
(because many <hi>Deuils</hi> were entered into him) saith,
that this man <hi>Ware no cloathes, neither aboade in house, but
in graues. Martha</hi> did weare garments of a slight
coloured cloath, after the fashion of a <hi>Romarantin</hi>
Mayde. Shee was, when occasion required, at the
table of <hi>Bishops, Abbats,</hi> and <hi>Monkes.</hi> Shee did eate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13570:18"/>
and drinke as other folkes doe. This <hi>Demóniake</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with the <hi>Legion,</hi> acknowledged <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to
bee the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whom hee neuer had seene nor
heard of, and therefore he knew things, that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
secret. But <hi>Martha</hi> did neuer any such
thing. This <hi>Demóniake,</hi> although hee were bound with
chaynes of Iron, yet he broke them, and was caried
away by the <hi>Deuill</hi> into the <hi>Deserts.</hi> But <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>
was easilie helde and stayed with a very weake
hand. Then is this authoritie of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> not well
alleadged.</p>
            <p>Now that wee haue confuted these slender and
sleight reasons of some of the <hi>Phisicians,</hi> let vs come
to the reasons of some others: and begin with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of diuerse men of qualitie, which say, that
they saw her lifted vp into the ayre for a space, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any stay to vphold her. Goe too then: Let vs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
by <hi>Philosophie.</hi> Whatsoeuer is moued <hi>in recta li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,
in a right line,</hi> it must haue a rest, before it take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contrary Motion: as for example, a Ball being
throwne against a Wall, before it reboundeth backe
againe, resteth it selfe vpon the Wall, as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
sheweth in his eyght booke of <hi>Phisicks:</hi> and an <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
after the <hi>Dilatation</hi> thereof, before it make <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi>
resteth it selfe. And now you may see, why
this woman of <hi>Romarantin,</hi> leaping vp into the ayre,
rested her selfe before she came downe againe. But
this is somewhat too subtile a reason: let vs yeeld
you one that is more plaine and cleere. They tolde
vs, vpon the <hi>Thurseday</hi> morning, that they alwaies
thought this matter of <hi>Martha</hi> to be meere cousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
but in the after-noone, they saw her aloft in
the ayre: peraduenture because some vapours ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vp into their braines, did breede certaine acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13570:18"/>
like to <hi>Suffusions,</hi> or <hi>Clowdes,</hi> in such sort as a man
shall see things (as it were) out of their place. Which
may very well bee shewed by the <hi>Arte Optike.</hi> Yea it
way possibly be, that they saw <hi>Duplicem Martham, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam
humi, alteram in sublimi (Two Marthaes, one vpon the
ground, and another a loft.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Others there bee, which haue alleadged another
reason, in that <hi>Martha</hi> did lift her flankes, all the rest
of her bodie remayning vnmoued. And so Horses, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they haue runne, when they pant in their flankes,
(which <hi>Horace</hi> termeth <hi>Iliaducere,</hi>) may as well haue
the <hi>Deuill</hi> in their bodies. I am ashamed to heare such
reasons.</p>
            <p>And in sooth, this which followeth is not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
They heard a rumbling vnder her left ribs, but it
was very little, and that onely when it was touched.
By this reason, those that are troubled with a Winde
about the short ribbes, and poore Maydens that haue
the <hi>Greene Sicknesse,</hi> and pale colours, shall haue the
<hi>Deuill</hi> in their bodies. For oftentimes the sound in
their bellies is so great, that it may bee heard aboue
from beneath, and from one chamber to another.
And by this reason also, they should not haue one <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi>
alone, but many. And in deed, if we beleeue those
<hi>Good-Fathers, Martha</hi> had, and yet still hath three <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils</hi>
in her: one that is an olde and a cruell one, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Beelsebuh:</hi> another that is a merrie one, which
they call <hi>Ascalon, The lester of Hell:</hi> and a third which
they call, <hi>The Skullion of Hell.</hi> And thus these reasons
march all after one tune.</p>
            <p>Some there be, which adde hereunto, that <hi>Martha</hi>
discouered and tolde certaine Secrets of <hi>Men,</hi> in such
sorte, as many of the assistants were in great feare
thereof. <hi>Father Seraphin,</hi> (who alwaies walked with a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13570:19"/>
good simple conscience in this businesse) demaunded
of her, <hi>What haue I done this night? Martha</hi> answered,
<hi>Thou hast prayed to God.</hi> Behold, what a goodly great
Secret this was, to tell a <hi>Capuchine Frier, Thou hast
prayed to God.</hi> Whereby a man may know that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marantine</hi>
Wench mocked the simplicitie of these
<hi>Good-Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some bring a reason that is more vrgent, that is to
say, <hi>That Martha did speake in her bellie, when her mouth
and her lips were shut and closed.</hi> Truely <hi>Martha</hi> spake
as another bodie did. And yet if shee had done so,
should she therefore haue a <hi>Deuill,</hi> that spake within
her bellie? <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his fift booke of the <hi>Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
the 58. sentence, maketh mention of the wife of
one <hi>Polemarchus,</hi> which spake in her bellie. <hi>Iohn Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi>
in his <hi>Definitions Medicinall,</hi> sayth, that in <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
they are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which talke in their
bellie, when their Mouthes and their Lippes are shut
and closed. Looke vpon <hi>Scaliger</hi> against <hi>Cardan</hi> in
the 258. <hi>Exercise,</hi> and the third part. <hi>Foetius</hi> in his <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomia
Hippocratica</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Great Adrian
Turnebus</hi> did say in his <hi>Reading-Chayre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>Augustine</hi> also reporteth a strange dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (though it be somewhat filthie) of a man, that with the winde of his hinder parts, could make what sound he listed, and that with so good measure, as you would haue thought he had sung. <hi>Piedro Mexia de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilla, lib. varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum lectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. cap.</hi> 26.</note> that he had seen
a Rogue, who without opening his Mouth or stirring
his lippes, did with his bellie, make such a sound, and
vttered such a voyce as pleased him, and gained great
store of money by practising that feate. And in truth
it might very well bee done: because in closing or
shutting the breast and stomacke, there may enter
some ayre into the <hi>Arterie,</hi> which may make a kinde
of sound or voyce, not very distinct or plaine to bee
discerned at first, and yet by long exercise may bee
in a sorte perceiued: and such persons are called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>Talking in their Bellies.</hi> Or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

               </gap>, <hi>Prophecying out
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13570:19"/>
of their Breasts. Calius Rhodigynus</hi> referreth this to the
<hi>Deuill,</hi> that speaketh within the <hi>Bellie.</hi> But hee is but
a Reporter of Fables, and therefore let vs leaue these
popular and common reasons.</p>
            <p>Those, that haue thought themselues to bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more wise then the rest, as being skilfull in the
Law, and making Profession thereof, haue oftentimes
obiected against vs: <hi>If Martha were not possessed of a
wicked Spirit, Cui Bono? Whose benefite was it? To what
end did she all these things?</hi> To this question, it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not to our <hi>Arte</hi> to answere. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
let vs entreate this fauour, that wee may make
some gesse of the matter. To what ende doe many
runne vp and downe the streetes, and say, that <hi>They
are Emperours,</hi> and Kings, and <hi>Kings Sonnes,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?</hi>
You will then say againe, <hi>That Martha thought
herselfe to be a Demóniake.</hi> It may be so: and to the end
that she might imprint that opinion in the mindes of
<hi>Men,</hi> she counterfeited and dissembled all the rest of
her <hi>Actions.</hi> And it is not to bee thought a strange
matter, that the selfe same person should commit an
errour in one poynt, and in all the rest should be very
cunning, subtile, and warie. Melancholike persons are
craftie and malicious.</p>
            <p>Let vs tell you a thing that is more likely then this.
The Father of <hi>Martha,</hi> was alwaies factious; by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
report. He saw that his daughter, who (as also
the rest of his other Children did) was euer reading
of bookes touching <hi>Deuilerie,</hi> and especially and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie
that Booke of the <hi>Deuill</hi> of <hi>Laon</hi> was a very
proper and fit Booke for these <hi>Deuilish</hi> feates and
counterfeitings: adding thereunto, that many <hi>Priests,</hi>
and namely the <hi>Theologal</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> by that which
she tolde vnto vs, confirmed her in this opinion, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13570:20"/>
she had the <hi>Deuill</hi> in her bodie. And therefore hee
caried her to <hi>Our Ladie</hi> of <hi>Ardiliers,</hi> to <hi>Saulmur,</hi> to
<hi>Angers,</hi> to <hi>Clery,</hi> to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and now at the last to
<hi>Paris:</hi> Whether this were done vpon a follie, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in deed that his daughter had the <hi>Deuill</hi> in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
or thereby to make some stirre and alteration, or
for couetousnesse, <hi>God</hi> knoweth: for that belongeth
to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to looke vnto. But the very truth is,
that many bestowed Money on her Father: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Monsieur de S. M.</hi> Twentie Crownes, others Thirtie:
some more, some lesse. Yea her Father being at <hi>Paris,</hi>
went vp and downe a begging Money of the <hi>Church-Men,</hi>
euen of simple <hi>Religious</hi> persons, to bring this
holy enterprise to good perfection. And it is not to
bee doubted, but if the matter had fallen out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
there would haue been good store of money
gayned by it, and shee should haue been caried from
house to house to gather a beneuolence, as was the
Mother of <hi>Frier Clement,</hi> that wicked and cursed <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata</hi>
and <hi>Runnagate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Frier that murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red K. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the third of France.</note> the remembrance of whom bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a horror in my soule. And thus much for those
that aske, <hi>Cuibono? Who had benefite by it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee haue now shewed, that <hi>Martha</hi> neither was
nor is possessed with a <hi>Spirite:</hi> Wee haue confuted the
reasons of those that helde the contrarie opinion: We
haue seene the testimonies of the wisest and most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
persons among them. <hi>Martha</hi> was caried to
<hi>Angers</hi> to bee <hi>Exorcised</hi> or coniured. The right <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Bishop Miron,</hi> (a man of good wisedome and well
aduised) would not <hi>Exercise</hi> her, vntill hee had first
tryed her, and knew of a certaintie that she were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed.
He caused her to bee stayed, hee bourded her,
and for certaine dayes hee made her drinke nothing
but <hi>Holy-water,</hi> wherewith shee was neither altered
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13570:20"/>
nor moued. After certaine dayes he caused common
ordinarie water, (not hallowed) to be brought vnto
her in a <hi>Holy-water stocke:</hi> and then <hi>Martha</hi> seeing the
<hi>Holy-water-stocke,</hi> layed her selfe downe, fell to her
brabling, and made her wonted <hi>Apes-faces.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> told her that he had a peece of
the <hi>True Crosse.</hi> Hee tooke a key of <hi>Iron,</hi> wrapped it
worshipfully in <hi>Taffata</hi> like a <hi>Relike,</hi> and offered it
<hi>Martha</hi> to kisse: and presently she began to play her
<hi>Deuilish</hi> trickes. A little while after, when he sayde,
<hi>Let one bring me my great booke of Coniurations,</hi> they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a <hi>Virgil</hi> to be brought vnto him: and he began to
reade, <hi>Arma virumque cano.</hi> By and by, she thinking
them to be words of <hi>Coniuration,</hi> fell downe vpon the
ground, and tormented her selfe in the best manner
she could. At the last, her counterfeiting being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
the Lorde <hi>Bishop</hi> sent her away, and would
not prophane those holy <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Exorcisme,</hi> to
driue away a <hi>Counterfeit Deuill.</hi> Others may imitate
and folow the wisedome of this <hi>Prelate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what was done at <hi>Clery</hi> and at <hi>Orleans?</hi> The
<hi>Officiall</hi> there, being well assisted with the wisest of the
<hi>Clergie,</hi> did forbid all <hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>Diocesse</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
to <hi>Exorcise Martha,</hi> vpon paine of <hi>Suspension</hi> from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Seruice.</hi> It would be a long matter, if we should
goe about to rehearse all that was done at <hi>Orleans,</hi>
for the discouering of this cousinage of the sayde
<hi>Brossier:</hi> wee will onely tell you two of the pretiest of
them. First, there was brought vnto her a great thicke
<hi>Grammar</hi> of <hi>Despanterius,</hi> bound after the old fashion
with boords, and with claspes of Copper: it was ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and giuen her to reade. Shee lighted vpon this
place, <hi>Nexo, xui, xum vult: Texo, xuit, indeque Textum.</hi>
Which words <hi>Martha</hi> thinking to be <hi>Diabolical,</hi> began
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13570:21"/>
to fall backward, (but softly enough, as we tolde you
before) and to fetch her ordinarie friskes and gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldes.
Another pretie tricke was, that my Masters
of the <hi>Clergie</hi> in <hi>Orleans,</hi> would needes make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the graund Remedie to driue away the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi>
and that is called the <hi>Parfume.</hi> They did set fire
to this <hi>Parfume,</hi> and offered those villanous and
stinking vapours to her Nose, she in the meane while
being bound to a chayre, but her feete at libertie
to play withall: and then began shee to
crie out, <hi>Pardon me, I am
choaked, He is gone
away.</hi>

                  <p>It cannot bee expressed, with how much prudence
and consideration this <hi>Arrest</hi> or <hi>Decree</hi> was made: and
yet these poore soules (being blinded) are disposed to
confirme their error thereby: and say, <hi>If Martha had
the Deuill in her bodie, they should haue sent her backe into
the hands of Ecclesiasticall Persons to be Exorcised: But if
she had none, then should they haue punished this Cousinage
publikely, and made an example of it.</hi> But yet wee ought
to beleeue that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Angers</hi> knew the cousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage:
that the <hi>Clergie</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> knew it, when they
forbad to <hi>Exorcise</hi> her: that the <hi>Phisitians</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> (some
few excepted) manifestly knew it &amp; declared it: that
my Masters of the <hi>Chastelet</hi> did wholy discouer it: that
the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath seene it plainely and cleerely, and
so sent the miserable wench backe to her Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her owne desire, and promise, that they
should neuer heare any more speech of her: Wherein
the said Court vsed great mercie towards her. Why it
did not grieuously punish this Cousenage, it is not for
vs to deale or enquire any further, but to conteine our
selues within our owne office and vocation, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13570:25"/>
feare <hi>God,</hi> to honour the <hi>King,</hi> and to obey the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
<hi>He that resisteth them, resisteth the Ordinance of
God.</hi> In the meane while let vs praise <hi>God,</hi> and sing an
hymne vnto him. <hi>For his mercie is multiplied vpon vs, and
his trueth endureth foreuer.</hi> Amen.</p>
