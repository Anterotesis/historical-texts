            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ELEGY On the DEATH of Sir EDMOND SAUNDERS, LATE <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice of England,</hi> Who died <date>the 19th of <hi>June,</hi> 1683.</date>
            </head>
            <l>IT is Decreed by Fate's unchanging Doom,</l>
            <l>(For Fate will to no Compoſition come)</l>
            <l>That ev'-ry Head muſt viſit the Cold Tomb.</l>
            <l>Tis Natures Univerſal Law, that all</l>
            <l>To their firſt Principles at length muſt fall;</l>
            <l>But yet we are allow'd to vent our Grief</l>
            <l>For the Deſerving Dead, and ſeek Relief</l>
            <l>In flowing Tears, and, as we can, Repair</l>
            <l>The Breach that Death hath made upon us here,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Saunders</hi> dy'd. But oh! a loſs ſo vaſtly great,</l>
            <l>That it ſeem'd wanting only to compleat</l>
            <l>The Meaſure of our Sorrows, which of late</l>
            <l>Have had ſo many Subjects, from ſad Fate.</l>
            <l>Brave Men apace forſake th Unworthy Earth,</l>
            <l>Which ſeems now teeming with ſome monſtrous Birth.</l>
            <l>Sedition ſings now this Great Man is gone,</l>
            <l>But thy vain Mirth will not continue long:</l>
            <l>For other <hi>Saunders's</hi> will the Dead ſucceed.</l>
            <l>And then, moſt curſt Sedition, thou muſt bleed.</l>
            <l>His great Example ſhould be ſet to ſhow</l>
            <l>And teach ſucceeding Ages what to do.</l>
            <l>Loyal and bold throughout his Active Life,</l>
            <l>His Duty and his Intereſt ne're at ſtrife;</l>
            <l>But What the one did ſeriouſly adviſe</l>
            <l>With that the other heartily complies;</l>
            <l>And, mark the end, ſee how he glorious dyes!</l>
            <l>His Honours freſh and green upon his Head,</l>
            <l>Still Live, and ever ſhall, though he is Dead:</l>
            <l>Death may the Body into Aſhes turn,</l>
            <l>But his high Virtue ſhall out-live his Urn.</l>
            <l>His Merit Rais'd him to this high Degree;</l>
            <l>For Prince and People none more fit than He.</l>
            <l>That underſtood the King's moſt rightful Power,</l>
            <l>And therefore thought all Subjects juſtly lower.</l>
            <l>Nor threats nor Flatteries on him prevail,</l>
            <l>To ſet his Conſcience wickedly to ſale.</l>
            <l>He was too Great and Good to ſerve a Cauſe</l>
            <l>Againſt his Reaſon, Senſe, and Nations Laws,</l>
            <l>Large Knowledge always keeps its Owners tight</l>
            <l>In worſt of Times, whilſt every blaſt does fright</l>
            <l>Unthinking Ignorance, and ſhocks it quite.</l>
            <l>Our Noble <hi>Saunders</hi> to his Parts had joyn'd</l>
            <l>All that might make his Generous Soul Refin'd.</l>
            <l>Deep inſight in the Myſteries of the Law,</l>
            <l>From whence he did ſuch wholſom, Counſels draw,</l>
            <l>For all the Nations Peace, who owe to him</l>
            <l>Both preſent Bleſſings, and the future time.</l>
            <l>Not every day ſuch Men as he are born,</l>
            <l>How ought we therefore ſuch a <hi>Loſs</hi> to mourn.</l>
            <l>Juſtice her ſelf ſhould put black Sables on.</l>
            <l>Ye Learned of the <hi>Law,</hi> who beſt can tell</l>
            <l>How much Great <hi>Saunders</hi> did the moſt excell</l>
            <l>In your moſt noble Faculty; So hard</l>
            <l>To be o'recome, Had he not bravely dar'd;</l>
            <l>Not daunted with the hardſhips of the way,</l>
            <l>He urg'd his ſteady courſe, and gain'd the Day.</l>
            <l>Beſtow ſome Tears upon the mournful <hi>Herſe</hi>
            </l>
            <l>That may attone for this unhallow'd Verſe.</l>
            <l>For how can Numbers flow, with eaſie grace</l>
            <l>When Sorrow has all o're poſſeſs'd their place.</l>
            <l>Some better Bard ſhall riſe in better times.</l>
            <l>And ſing thy Noble Praiſe in ſhining <hi>Lines.</hi>
