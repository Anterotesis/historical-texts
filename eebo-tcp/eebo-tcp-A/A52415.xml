            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>'TIS a Maxim of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given by some of the Nicer Describers of the Bounds of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> That it ought to be temper'd between a total Neglect and a full and just Requital. To strike off <hi>all</hi> Scores is, they say, as uncivil as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge <hi>none,</hi> and every whit
<pb facs="tcp:59847:3"/>
as disingenuous not to <hi>suffer,</hi> as not to <hi>acknowledge</hi> an Obligation.</p>
                  <p>Now, Sir, 'tis one of the proper Happinesses of my little Fortune to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cast upon this measure. I am got too far in your <hi>Accounts</hi> to be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite to the full, some part of them I must ever leave <hi>uncrossed</hi> as a standing <hi>Hold</hi> upon me; and tho my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude it self be never so strong and pregnant, yet the most forward Instance of it can rise no higher than an <hi>Acknowledgment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59847:3"/>
And as this is the utmost I can do, so of doing this too I have so few Capacities and Opportunities, that I am the less willing to let go any that offer themselves; which indeed has given a speedier Issue to my Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether I ought to address these Discourses to your Patronage or no, which perhaps without the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of a <hi>Dedication,</hi> would of right belong to you, as falling within your District, and as being the Fruits of that Retirement which by your <hi>Free</hi> Bounty I enjoy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59847:4"/>
As an Acknowledgment therefore of this and your other constant Favours, I presume to put these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses into your Hands, which I hope will be able to do both <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Me</hi> that Justice, as to convince the World, that as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by generous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Measures in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of this Publick Trust, so you was not very much mistaken in your Choice, when you thought fit to Oblige</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Here commend to thy serious Perusal a <hi>Set</hi> of Select Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses upon the <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> which were at first undertaken, and are now publish'd for the Public Benefit of all well-disposed Christians. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects themselves are as Great and Noble as any perhaps that occur in all Practical Divinity, being the Prime and Capital <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Excellent Sermon upon the Mount, and containing the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Principles of all Christ's Practical Instructions, and of a True Christian <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59847:5"/>
Here we may see (what the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> so much desired) the true <hi>Living Idea</hi> of Vertue and Goodness; nay more, what 'tis to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, an <hi>Interiour</hi> Christian, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian indeed. And I heartily wish that those whose Orthodoxy is chiefly employed in giving out <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> of Conversion and Saintship, wherein their end seems rather to be the distinction of a Party, than any real Promotion of Godliness, would choose rather to dress their Interiour by this <hi>Glass,</hi> and afterwards try it by this <hi>Measure.</hi> For here they will find that Real Christianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Poverty of Spirit, Humility, Self-denyal, Mortification, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Mercifulness, Purity of Heart, Peaceableness, and such like inward Dispositions of Soul, and not in a few outward Formalities, Sighs and
<pb facs="tcp:59847:5"/>
Groans, Looks and Postures, Words and Phrases, and such other affected Badges of a fond Distinction.</p>
                  <p>And as the Subjects themselves are Great and Noble, so I hope these Discourses will be found in some measure to rise up to their Dignity. I am sure there has been no care wanting on my part to make them worthy of their Subjects, to which I have endeavour'd to do the utmost Justice. But however I may fail of that, yet I hope the Reader will not be altogether disappointed of his Expectations, or repent of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but will find here sufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment both for his <hi>Speculation,</hi> and for his <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be a Surprize to some to see me appear again so soon in public. To this, if there needs any
<pb facs="tcp:59847:6"/>
Apology, that which I shall offer is, That if these Discourses be not worthy of publick View, then 'tis not fit they should ever be sent abroad; but if they be, I cannot understand how they can be published too soon. The Truth is, considering the shortness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Life, I have been lately very much of Opinion, That a Man can never live too fast, (the Heathen will tell you <hi>Never fast enough</hi>) nor make too much haste to do good; especially when a Man's Sphere is such, that he has but <hi>Few</hi> ways and opportunities of doing it, which by Experience I am well convinc'd to be my Case.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid (where-ever the fault lies) that it will not be my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be able to do good where I am, which I might have done in some other Station. Which makes me the
<pb facs="tcp:59847:6"/>
more frequent in <hi>Public,</hi> that I may supply this Defect by the Service of my <hi>Pen,</hi> having some reason to hope that my Discourses will meet with better Liking <hi>Abroad,</hi> than they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do at <hi>Home;</hi> and that there are some in the World to whom I shall not be a <hi>Barbarian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What has been here the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of <hi>my</hi> Pen was (as I learn from Dr. <hi>Rust</hi>) intended, and in part performed by the Excellent <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Taylour,</hi> who while he was meditating upon the <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> was receiv'd up into the Enjoyment of them. And I have lately spoken with a Gentleman, who told me, That he himself saw a <hi>Manuscript</hi> of it in the Bishop's own Hand. I am very sensible how much the Subject has lost by the <hi>Change</hi> of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. All that I can say is, That
<pb facs="tcp:59847:7"/>
I have done my Best, and I hope God will accept of my good <hi>Intention,</hi> and that the World will be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the better for my <hi>Performance.</hi>

shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 2</note> as the dew, as the small rain upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der herb, and as the showers upon the grass.</p>
                     <p>But the Parallel will not run through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. For the Divine Oracles were not now accompanied with <hi>Thundrings</hi> and <hi>Lightnings,</hi> with <hi>Blackness,</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Tempest,</hi> but were deliver'd in the small still Voice of <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 'Twas with a Beatitude that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> began his Collection of Divine Hymns; and in like manner does the Son of <hi>David</hi> usher in his sublime In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. And this was very suitable and agreeable both to the Character of his Person, and to the Genius of his Doctrin. As to his <hi>Person,</hi> Blessing became the Mouth of him, who was the Reconciler of God and Man, the great Embassadour of Peace, the Author of Salvation and Happiness, and at whose Nativity the Angels sang Peace on Earth, and good will towards Men. And as to his <hi>Doctrin,</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts he was to deliver were of so refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and high-raised a Nature, so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle agreeable either to the Maxims of the World, or to the grosser Relishes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59847:9"/>
of the Animal Life, that they would have found but cold Entertainment, had they not come recommended with a Reward, and been guarded on each side with a Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>'Twas requisite therefore that the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Blessing</hi> should go hand in hand; and accordingly our Lord, who well understood the Temper of the Sons of Men, how passionately we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue any thing that looks like <hi>Happiness,</hi> and how apt we are to ask that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi> thought it expedient to joyn them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Discourse, as they will be in the <hi>Event,</hi> and to pronounce <hi>them</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed here, whom he intends to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce so hereafter, when he shall say, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>Kingdom prepared for you from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the better to win us over to the practice of his Divine Sermon, our Lord like a wise Master-Builder, lays the Foundation of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> where we must lay that of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> and assigns the first place among his Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to <hi>Humility</hi> and Poverty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59847:9"/>
For Humility is the Foundation of Obedience; we must be first poor in Spirit, before we can be rich in Good Works; first Humble before we can Obey, and first Obey before we can Reign. And therefore with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son does our Lord lay down this as the first Principle and Ground-work of his Institution, <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In my Discourse upon these words I shall,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Resolve what we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by Poor in Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Shew that this Poverty of Spirit is a Christian Duty, and the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Shew the Happiness of those who are so disposed.</p>
                     <p>As to the Resolution of the first, I consider that this Poverty of Spirit here recommended by our Saviour, is not a state of <hi>Life,</hi> but a state of <hi>Mind;</hi> and we may take it either in Opposition to <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or in Opposition to <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>High-mindedness.</hi> If in opposition to Covetousness, then to be poor in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59847:10"/>
Spirit, is to have our Souls so disposed, as first, Not to be eagerly carried out in our Desires after any created good; particularly the good things of this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World, whether Honors, Pleasures, or Profit; especially not to be greedy and craving in our desire of Riches. But Secondly, To be so moderately and indifferently affected towards all these, as to be well contented without them, and also ready to resign and part with them, when either God shall think fit to deprive us of them, or when we can no longer retain them with a good Conscience. This is to be poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, consider'd in opposition to <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may also be considered as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Pride, or High-mindedness; and then to be poor in Spirit will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note, First, A Just, that is, a low and mean Sense and Apprehension of our own selves, of our Souls, and of our Bodies, of our Intellectuals and of our Morals, of our Acquirements and of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. And Secondly, as a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this, a Contentedness when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any or all of these are disesteem'd or disparag'd, either tacitly and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59847:10"/>
by Affronts and dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Treatments; or else directly by express undervaluations, a readiness to prefer others before our selves, and a willingness that the same Preference should be given them by others; an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Captivation</hi> of our Understandings to the Obedience of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Submission</hi> of them in all doubtful Cases to the Dictates of our <hi>Superiours;</hi> a declining of Fame and Popularity, and a studious concealment of our own Praises and Excellencies; but when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Glory of God, or the good of our Brother is concern'd in their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. In short, (to use the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Psalmist) he is truly poor in Spirit, who from his Heart can say to the Searcher of Hearts, <hi>Lord, I am not high-minded, I have no proud looks; I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 131.</note> 
                        <hi>do not exercise my self in great matters which are too high for me; but I refrain my Soul and keep it low, like as a Child that is wean'd from his Mother; yea, my Soul is even as a weaned Child.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus briefly shewn what it is to be Poor in Spirit, both with respect to Covetousness, and with respect to Pride and High-mindedness. I come
<pb facs="tcp:59847:11"/>
now in the second place to shew, that this Poverty of Spirit is a Christian Duty, and withal the great reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it. And First, That Poverty of Spirit, according to the <hi>first</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, is a Christian Duty, 'twould be Conviction enough to consider how often we are call'd upon in Scripture to withdraw our Affections from the Creature, <hi>to seek those things which are</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Colos. 3. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>above, to set our affection on things above, not on things of the earth; to mortifie our members which are upon earth,</hi> among which is reckon'd <hi>Inordinate Affection, Evil Concupiscence,</hi> and <hi>Covetousness, which is Idolatry.</hi> Again, we are bid <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 15</note> to <hi>beware of Covetousness,</hi> and to have both our <hi>Treasure</hi> and our <hi>Hearts</hi> in <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 33</note> Heaven; to be as indifferent in the very <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 29.</note> enjoyment of any worldly Good, as if we enjoy'd it not; and if in the <hi>enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> then certainly much more in the <hi>desire.</hi> Lastly, to add no more, we are caution'd by St. <hi>John</hi> not to love the World, neither the things that are in the World. And lest we should take this only as a matter of <hi>Advice</hi> and Counsel, not express <hi>Command,</hi> he further adds, <hi>If</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>any man love the world, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59847:11"/>
But that 'tis a Christian Duty to be thus poor in Spirit, will be further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the Christian Institution. The Grand thing intended in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was to reduce straying Man to his true Good and Happiness, to subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, refine and spiritualize his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to loose him from the Cords of Vanity, and from his fast adhesions to created Good; to purge him from all earthly Concretions and Alloys; to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage and separate him, not only from the World about him, but even from one part of himself; in one word, to raise him from Earth to Heaven, not only by a <hi>Local,</hi> but by a <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>mental</hi> Elevation.</p>
                     <p>Indeed 'twas much otherwise under the Jewish Dispensation. There was then great Indulgence afforded to the Animal Inclinations and worldly Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Men; and their very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was indeared to them by Temporal Promises and Blessings. Not that God intended hereby to express any liking or approbation of Covetousness and Earthly-mindedness, but only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59847:12"/>
with the infirmity of that gross stupid People, which rendred them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being won upon by more noble Proposals. And besides, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a received Notion among the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Inhabitants of the Land (as is <note place="margin">Dr <hi>Spencer</hi> de Legibus Haebraeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alibus.</note> observ'd by a late Learned Author) that the Worship of their Idols and False Gods did procure them fruitful Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and increase of all manner of store, 'twas in proportion requisite that God also should promise <hi>his</hi> Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the like worldly Affluence to keep them from running over to the <hi>Gentile Superstitions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon these and the like Accounts much was indulg'd to the Jewish State and People. They were never expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to abstract their desires from the things of the World. Nor, unless they proceeded to covet <hi>unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that is, what belonged to another, were they ever taxable for a too earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and downward disposition of Soul. Not but that earthly-mindedness was as much an Imperfection in it self as 'tis now, and was really forbidden accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more retired and involute sense of the Law; but the Letter did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59847:12"/>
not reach it, because then was the time and state of Imperfection, and 'twas the only <hi>Handle</hi> which that People could be took hold of by, whose <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Heart</hi> was the occasion of this, as well as of some other Indulgencies.</p>
                     <p>But now they that shall think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to no higher measures of Perfection under the Christian State, know not what manner of Spirit they are of. Christ, as he has introduced a <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Better Hope,</hi> so has he annexed to it more excellent and more exalted <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;</hi> and as his Kingdom was not, so neither is his Religion of this World. The Christian Law is <hi>Lex Ignea,</hi> a Law of Fire, a Law that purifies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, that warms, actuates and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, that separates also and dissolves those strong Ties whereby the Soul sticks glued to the Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle calls the Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> and in another place, <hi>the ministration of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>the Spirit.</hi> And what our Saviour said of some words of his, may truly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all, <hi>The words that I speak unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 6. 63</note> 
                        <hi>you, they are spirit and they are life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59847:13"/>
This therefore being the Design of the Christian Dispensation, to perfect Holiness, to advance the Interest of the Divine Life, to elevate us to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most degree of moral Perfection our Nature is here capable of, and as far as is possible to make us Partakers of the Divine, 'tis utterly inconsistent with the <hi>End</hi> of such a Law as this, to suffer us to lie groveling with our Faces on the Earth, to seek Rest and Happiness in things more ignoble than our selves, and to grow one as it were with the dirty Planet upon which we live. We ought rather, (as the Philosopher speaks) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, aspire to the measures of Immortality, shake off the Clogs of Earth that weigh us down, and make hast to be Angels as fast as we can. We are obliged by the <hi>Design,</hi> as well as by the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> to be as loose from the Creature as may be, not to love the World, nor the things of the World, whether the Lust of the Flesh, or the Lust of the Eye, or the Pride of Life, but to be poor in Spirit, and empty of the Creature, that we may be rich towards God, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59847:13"/>
with the fulness of him that fills all in all.</p>
                     <p>And now that to be thus poor in Spirit is a <hi>reasonable</hi> Duty, as well as a <hi>Necessary</hi> one, will sufficiently appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these two grounds:</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Because these Worldly Enjoyments are not our True Good.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Because they hinder and divert us from that which really is so.</p>
                     <p>That they are not our True Good is certain; for if they were, we should then find <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in them. But this we are so far from doing, that we are as dissatisfied <hi>under</hi> our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>without</hi> them. For though by Fruition our Appetite be abated as to that particular Object which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, yet still we desire on further, and our <hi>general</hi> Thirst after Happiness is as unsatisfied as ever: Which plainly argues, that our true good is not to be found in these things, but that they are altogether <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> To place therefore our Happiness in such Objects is utterly absurd and against Reason, and argues us to be grosly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59847:14"/>
of one of the two things, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>our selves,</hi> or of the things of the <hi>World.</hi> We are either ignorant of the Dignity and Excellence of our Natures, of the Designs and Ends of our Creation, and of the Strengths and Capacities of our Appetites, which can be satisfied with nothing less than infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Or if we do know and consider all this, then we are so much the more grosly ignorant of the World about us, to think there is any thing to be had in this Circle of Vanity, that may satisfie the importunity of such craving and capacious Appetites. Poverty of Spirit therefore is reasonable, because the things of the World are not our <hi>True Good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is the least part of their Charge. They are not only insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be our true good themselves, but they also, Secondly, hinder and divert us from that which really is so. For not to mention the many Snares and Temptations of a great Fortune, and what a dangerous thing it is to be always furnished with all the Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Opportunities of Sin and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: I only observe, that the very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59847:14"/>
of these Earthly things diverts us, and takes us off from the Love of God. When our Love is divided even among <hi>Created</hi> Objects, the force of it will be much abated in respect of each. But much more will the Love of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diminish from the Love of God. For there is so vast a disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Kinds</hi> as well as the <hi>Degrees</hi> of the two Goods, that he that once comes to relish one, will find but little tast in the other. And therefore says St. <hi>Austin, Monemus ne mundum ametis, nt eum qui fecit mundum liberè ametis. Our advice is, that you love not the World, that so you may love its Maker freely.</hi> The truth is, to love God <hi>freely,</hi> we should love him <hi>intirely;</hi> for every advance we make towards the Creature, so much we recede from God. For these are two contrary Terms of Motion; and there is so great a Contrariety between the Love of God and the Love of the World, that they do not only abase each other, but are in some degrees ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconsistent. For so St. <hi>John, If any man love the world, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 2. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>is not in him.</hi> And if this be the consequence of loving the World, I think the less we have to do with it,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59847:15"/>
the better, and that there is a great deal of reason to be <hi>Poor in Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus far have we consider'd the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reasonablenes of Poverty of Spirit, as it signifies an Indifferency of Desire to the things of the World. I come now to consider it as it denotes Humility, and Lowliness of Mind; whereof I am also to shew,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The <hi>Duty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>Reasonableness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Duty of Humility is plain in all the Scripture, but more frequently and earnestly inculcated in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, insomuch that it may be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the <hi>distinguishing</hi> Doctrins of the Christian Religion. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Morals almost overlook'd it, and in the Old Testament Writings 'tis but sparingly recommended; but in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Institution we every where meet with it in Capital Characters, as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the first Magnitude. <hi>God resisteth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6. 1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the proud,</hi> saith St. <hi>James;</hi> and <hi>be ye cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humility,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And our Lord himself, who was a perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all Moral and Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59847:15"/>
and in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt bodily, seems yet to commend himself to our imitation chiefly upon the Account of his <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Learn of me,</hi> says he, <hi>for I am meek</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 25</note> 
                        <hi>and lowly in heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there needs no multiplication of Scripture for the proof of this. I shall therefore only further observe, that the greatest Personages that ever were in the World were always most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and conspicuous for this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. Out of many I shall select three Instances, which may well deserve our Consideration. The first shall be the great Fore-runner of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the <hi>Holy Baptist.</hi> This Great and Holy Person, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to demand of him who he was, not only disclaim'd the Titles, of <hi>Christ,</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> and of <hi>that</hi> Prophet (this his Humble Spirit was not content with) but went further, and gave this strange and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified account of himself, <hi>I am,</hi> says he, <hi>the voice of one crying in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 23.</note> The Prophet <hi>David</hi> indeed had said before of himself, that he was a <hi>Worm,</hi> and <hi>no Man.</hi> And this one <note place="margin">Psal. 22. 6.</note> would think was a sufficient stretch of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59847:16"/>
Humility. But the Baptist speaks in a strain below him, allowing himself to be no more than a <hi>Voice.</hi> The same Holy Person thought himself unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to Baptize his Saviour; nay, what makes that less admirable, not worthy so much as to unloose the very Latchet of his Shoes.</p>
                     <p>The next Instance I shall mention, is the ever-blessed <hi>Mother</hi> of our <hi>Lord.</hi> She, if ever any Creature, had cause to be <hi>Proud.</hi> 'Tis impossible even to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a stronger Temptation. She was saluted by an Arch-Angel, said to be a Person highly favoured with God, and Blessed among Women. And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, That she should be Mother to the Son of the Highest, and that too by the Power of the most High. Was not here enough to betray a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Virgin into Pride and Vanity? Had the Angels half so much reason for their Pride and Haughtiness, when they fell from the Heights of Glory? Well, how did she behave her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>dangerous</hi> Salutation? Why, she seem'd to make it rather matter of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Resignation,</hi> than of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> and <hi>Boasting. Behold,</hi> says she,

the handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me <note place="margin">Luke 1. 38.</note> according to thy word.</p>
                     <p>But the most stupendous Instance of Humility that ever was or can be, was in the Person of our <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we consider him in the Mystery of his Incarnation, or in the mean Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his Birth, or in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble method of his Life; whether we consider him as emptying himself of his Eternal Glories, and drawing a Cloud over his Brightness, or as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the Devils to publish his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and Men to declare his Miracles, and his Disciples to tell of his Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration; or as washing his Disciples Feet, or as riding upon an Ass, or as conversing among Sinners, and lastly, choosing to die between Thieves. These and many such other Instances of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension argue the most profound Humility that can be imagin'd, and withal, how concern'd our Lord was to commend and endear this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Duty to the Practice of Men. Of all the Vertues and Excellencies in the World, one would have thought this of Humility least capable of being <hi>practis'd</hi> and <hi>exemplify'd</hi> by the Son of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59847:17"/>
God. <hi>Commend</hi> it indeed he might by <hi>Precept</hi> as well as any other, but sure one would think not by <hi>Example.</hi> But see what rare Arts and Mysteries God has found out to teach us this Lesson. And therefore we may well conclude, that there is <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> in it as well as <hi>Difficulty,</hi> and how much it concerns us to <hi>learn,</hi> what God has been so peculiarly solicitous to <hi>teach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is then a Christian Duty to be thus Poor in Spirit. And the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it is as great as the <hi>Obligation.</hi> This I might shew from the Good Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and Happy Effects of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Spirit; but this falling in more properly under the Third Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of my Discourse, I shall for the present content my self with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Considerations taken from the Condition of Man; whom I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. As a <hi>Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. As a <hi>Sinner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then, Man is a <hi>Creature,</hi> and this is a very reasonable Ground for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59847:17"/>
Humility, and Poverty of Spirit. We usually think it a very <hi>Humbling</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to remind a Person of the meanness of his Original. But now what Original can be so mean as to be from <hi>Nothing?</hi> It is enough to take down the Spirit of the brightest Intelligence, to consider, that nothing was his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, a state more vile and dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the Chaos it self. Now this is the Condition of Man. He had his Rise from Nothing, and derives his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree by his <hi>Mother's side</hi> from <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Emptiness.</hi> And though now by the Omnipotency of his Creator he is something, yet still he holds his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as precariously as he first received it, and depends as much for his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence upon the Will of his Creator, as Light does upon the Sun, or the Image in the Glass upon the Presence of the Body. If God does but turn his Face from him, and cease to behold him, he will vanish into nothing. God spake the Word indeed before he was made, but to unmake him there needs no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Fiat,</hi> he need only be <hi>silent,</hi> and not sustain him by the <hi>Word of his Power.</hi> And shall that Being be proud which was once nothing, and has still
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59847:18"/>
such a <hi>Natural Bent</hi> towards <hi>Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as to need only a bare <hi>Negative</hi> to make him nothing again? No, says the Wise Man, <hi>Pride was not made for man, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.</hi> Man must forget his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, to give the least admittance to Pride; and he need but study and consider that, to have the most <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> sense of Humility.</p>
                     <p>This Consideration is yet further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, if we admit the Hypothesis of those who say, that to be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture involves a State of Nothing, as well as an <hi>Origination</hi> from Nothing; that there is nothing <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Positive</hi> in any Creature but what is from God; and that though a Creature be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as of God, yet he is nothing as of himself, nor can exert any positive Act or Operation from himself as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Principle of Action, being still as to <hi>that,</hi> as much a <hi>Nothing</hi> as before. If this be true, (and he that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and well understand what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>M. Poiret</hi> in defence of this <note place="margin">Lib. 4. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitat. Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. De Deo, p. 574</note> Notion, will scarce find it in his Power to think otherwise) certainly Man has infinite reason to be poor in Spirit, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59847:18"/>
to descend into the lowest Abyss of Humility and <hi>Self-abdication,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Being that not only <hi>was once,</hi> but <hi>is still</hi> a mere <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Man therefore as a <hi>Creature</hi> has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason to be Humble and Poor in Spirit. But if we consider him <hi>2ly,</hi> as a <hi>Sinner,</hi> he has Cause not only to be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to lie down flat upon his Face, and look upon himself to be more base and vile than the very Dust whereof he was form'd, and whereon he treads. To be a Sinner is much more vile than to be the meanest Creature, and the Non-Entity of <hi>Sin</hi> is more dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than that of <hi>Nature.</hi> This latter, tho' it cannot actively conform, yet 'tis not disobedient to the Will of God. But the former <hi>Nothing</hi> contradicts and <hi>resists</hi> his Will. This is, as one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> call it, <hi>Nihil Rebelle, &amp; in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um armatum,</hi> an <hi>Arm'd Nothing.</hi> Indeed to be a Creature, involves Weakness and Imperfection in it, but then it also involves Good, because nothing can be but by partaking of the Perfection of God. But now to be a Sinner involves nothing but pure and unmixt Evil, and is withal a further Remove from Good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59847:19"/>
than to be nothing, since 'tis not only <hi>negatively,</hi> but <hi>contrarily</hi> opposed to it. 'Tis indeed the greatest Monstrosity and Deformity in the World, the greatest Contradiction to Order and Harmony, to Reason and Proportion, to Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being and Happiness. In one word, 'tis the only thing which God hates. What great Reason then has Man to be Humble and Poor in Spirit, poor even to Emptiness and Self-Annihilation, who is not only a <hi>Creature,</hi> but a <hi>sinful Creature!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having now shewn the Duty and Reasonableness of Poverty of Spirit in the full Latitude of the Word, I proceed to shew in the third place the Happiness of those who are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spos'd. <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>for theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> That's the only Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness which is here expresly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But they are happy also in other regards. For in the first place, What an happy disposition of Soul must it be always, to carry about one such a strong and lively Conviction of the Vanity of all created Good, as not to run out into vehement desires after it? For
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59847:19"/>
Desire it self, to go no further, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a great Torment. 'Tis the same to the Soul that <hi>Thirst</hi> is to the Body, and <hi>Hope deferr'd</hi> (as the Wise Man tells us) <hi>makes the heart sick.</hi> But that's <note place="margin">Prov. 13.</note> not all. For here will come in the Trouble of <hi>Disappointment,</hi> as well as of <hi>Desire.</hi> Not that which the World generally understands by Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the not compassing what you design'd, (tho' that also will often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) but the not <hi>enjoying</hi> what you have compassed, the <hi>Disappointment</hi> of <hi>Fruition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to be poor in Spirit is the way to avoid all this. Such a Person expects no Happiness from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and consequently not to find it there will be to him no Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He does not lean upon any Created Good with any <hi>Stress,</hi> and therefore tho' it should fail under him, his Fall will be but slight and easie. And indeed 'tis not to be imagin'd what a deal of Anxiety, Care, Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, Disappointment, Sorrow, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Labour and Endeavour are saved by this Poverty of Spirit. And I think this is no small degree of Happiness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59847:20"/>
Again, Is it not a great Happiness to be so moderately and indifferently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards the World, as to be contented with any Condition in it? To be of a Quiet, Sedate, Resign'd and Disinteressed Disposition? He that's thus disposed, is above, or rather below the reach of calamitous Accidents. The Storm flies over his Head, he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing for Fortune to take hold of. Nor will he be under the hazard of parting with his Religion to secure his Worldly Interest. No, he can do his Duty, tho at the expence of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and tho' highly <hi>deserving</hi> of the <hi>best</hi> Times, may yet be <hi>trusted</hi> in the <hi>worst.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then as to the Happiness attending upon Poverty of Spirit, as it stands for Humility, there is no one Vertue that is more her own Reward than this: Pride is the most <hi>uneasie</hi> thing in the World, and withal the most <hi>odious;</hi> uneasie to the <hi>Patient,</hi> and <hi>Odious</hi> to the <hi>Observer.</hi> And as 'tis uneasie in it self, so is it the Parent of many Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom and Uneasie Passions, such as Anger, Contention, Revenge, Envy,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59847:20"/>
Impatience, &amp;c. So that 'tis hard to determin whether the Proud Man be more <hi>Ridiculous</hi> or <hi>Miserable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to be Humble is to be Wise, to understand the true Proportion and Measure of a Creature, to be serene, to be contented, to be thankful, to be pleasant and chearful, to be calm and untroubled, to be dispassionate and unconcern'd. In short, no Man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys what he really is, so much as he that does not fancy himself what he is not. And besides, the Humble Man is sure to get that very Honour which he declines, and because he declines it. I end this with the Observation of <hi>Plato,</hi> That a Man that does not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know himself, can neither be <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, good,</hi> nor <hi>happy,</hi> which is all that goes to the perfection of Man, and he that does, is sure to be all this.</p>
                     <p>Thus far of the Happiness belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the two Kinds of Poverty of Spirit <hi>severally.</hi> There remains yet one more belonging to them both in <hi>common,</hi> and that is the Kingdom of Heaven, which I suppose to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> As <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59847:21"/>
                        <hi>Grace,</hi> we are told by the Apostle, that <hi>God has chosen the poor in this world to be rich in Faith.</hi> And in the same place where God is said to resist the Proud, he is said also to give <hi>Grace</hi> to the <hi>Humble.</hi> Indeed Humility is the <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 6.</note> proper Foundation of Grace, and the Theatre of all Divine Operations. This State of Nothingness and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptiness is as much a Preparation to the <hi>New,</hi> as the <hi>Void</hi> and <hi>Inform Space</hi> was to the <hi>Old</hi> Creation; 'tis the true and proper <hi>first matter</hi> in the Spiritual World, into which the Form of the <hi>New Creature</hi> will be introduced; and if Man does but contain himself in this <hi>Nothing,</hi> God will not fail to work all, and to be all in him, having promised his Special Presence to the Man of an <hi>Humble Spirit.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 57. 15.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then as for <hi>Glory,</hi> 'tis highly equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they who have humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves here should be exalted hereafter, and that they who have renounc'd this World should have their Portion in the next. And to convince the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and distrustful World that thus it shall be, God has already given a Specimen of it in the Example of his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59847:21"/>
Son, who was particularly eminent for this double Poverty of Spirit, for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and for <hi>debasing himself,</hi> whom therefore God has <hi>highly</hi>

                     <p>THEY are the Words of him who was himself a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief; and who was also acquainted with <hi>Happiness</hi> too, with the Joys of Religion, with the Refreshments of Angels, with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepasts of Glory, and with that Peace of God which now passes all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and shall hereafter satisfie all Desire: He had tasted of both Cups, the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Trembling,</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Salvation:</hi> He had tried both the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of Human Nature, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Divine; and so well knew what proportion the Consolations of God have to the Infelicities of Man, and how little the Sufferings of this present time are, in comparison of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59847:22"/>
Glory that shall be reveal'd to them that with meekness bear them, and with fruitfulness improve under them. He therefore having tried both the <hi>Worst</hi> and the <hi>Best,</hi> must needs be a proper Judge in the Case, Whether Happiness may consist with Affliction or no. And he is so far from discouraging his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from treading in the same thorny rugged way that he did, that he rather gives them all the invitation in the World to do so, casts a <hi>Glory</hi> round the Head of the Sorrowful, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents Grief as a very Lovely thing, by telling them that <hi>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But are <hi>all</hi> those blessed that Mourn; and does Grief intitle all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its Dominions, to Happiness and Consolation? This indeed would be good News to this our World, where there is so much of it, which is a Valley of Tears, and a Region of Sadness, where there are a thousand Sighs for one Smile, and where <hi>the mourners go</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 5</note> 
                        <hi>about the streets.</hi> But 'tis not all mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that comes within the Circle of this Beatitude; nor shall all that sow in Tears, reap with Joy. As there are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59847:23"/>
some that <hi>Sorrow without Hope,</hi> so is there some kind of Sorrow, concerning which we can hope nothing. There is a Sorrow that proceeds from no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Moral Principle, but from Natural and Necessary Causes, as from the Influence of external Impressions, from the grosness of the Spirits and Blood, from Melancholy, and the like. Again, there is a Sorrow, which tho' of an Human and Moral Extraction, yet springs from no Good or Laudable Principle, but is altogether of a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral and Indifferent Nature. Again, there is a Sorrow that proceeds from an ill Principle, as from Malice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Covetousness, Ambition, Servile Fear, and the like, and which tends also to an ill end, as to Revenge, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, Despair, &amp;c. Accordingly the Apostle tells us of a <hi>Worldly Sorrow,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.</note> and of a Sorrow that worketh <hi>Death.</hi> So far is all Mourning from being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Mourning, or from giving us a just Title to this Beatitude.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore it will concern us to consider three things:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59847:23"/>
I. That there is such a thing as the Duty of Christian Mourning.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Who these Christian Mourners are?</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Wherein consists their Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>And first, I say, that there is such a thing as <hi>Christian Mourning.</hi> This must needs seem a strange Paradox to the Philosophy of those, who make the Pleasures of the Animal Life the end of Man, and think that now we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to enjoy them, and that God sent Man into the World to the same purpose as he placed the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> in the Sea, only to take his pastime therein. 'Twould be but a cold Employment to go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince such Men either of the <hi>Necessity,</hi> or of the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of Mourning, whose Answer would be in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of those Sinners in the Book of Wisdom, <hi>Come on, let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use the Creatures as in our youth. Let us fill our selves with costly Wine, and Ointment, and let no flower of the Spring pass by us. Let us crown our selves with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59847:24"/>
rose-buds before they be wither'd, let none of us go without his part of our Voluptous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place, for this is our portion, and our lot is this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the Style of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> School. And there are also some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who tho they do not make the Pleasure of the Animal Life their End, Lot and Portion, as do the other, yet they think they may allow themselves a great Scope and Compass in it, that they may indulge themselves to the full in all the Mirth and Jollity of the World, and that there is no need of any such thing as mourning in <hi>Sion.</hi> These Men seem to have the same No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christs <hi>Religion,</hi> that the Jews had of his <hi>Person:</hi> They look't upon him under the Character of a great Temporal Prince, and dream's of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under his Reign but Victories and Triumphs, and Festivals, and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and Olive yards. And so some think of his Religion. They look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a fine, gay, secular, jolly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as a state of Freedom and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipation, of Ease and Pleasantness; as if the Children of the Kingdom had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59847:24"/>
nothing to do, but to eat, drink, and be merry, and that mourning had no more place in <hi>this,</hi> than it is to have in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> wherein, as the Evangelical Prophet tells us, <hi>All tears</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>shall be wiped away from mens eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nor crying, nor any more pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is indeed most certain, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has its Joys and Pleasures, and that the Christian Religion has the most of any, and that they are such too as by far transcend all others; that the Best Life is also the most Pleasant Life, and that 'tis worth while to live well, if 'twere only for the meer pleasure of doing so. And there is a great deal of Truth in that Noble Saying of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>The good man excels the wicked man not only in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Comment. in Aurea Carmina, <hi>p.</hi> 177.</note> 
                        <hi>but also in pleasure it self, for whose sake only the other is wicked.</hi> Nay sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Pleasures of Good Men are not only greater than those of ill Men, but such as they cannot enjoy or relish, and have no manner of Notion of. As there are some things of God, so there are Pleasures of Religion, which the Animal Man does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59847:25"/>
For the <hi>Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> and the <hi>Stranger does not intermeddle with their Joy.</hi> Nay further yet, no Man has any Ground or Pretence for rejoycing, but a good Man. 'Tis the most usurping and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring piece of Impudence in the World for an ill Man to laugh or be merry. What has he to do with Mirth, who has the Wrath of God abiding on him, and Hell open to receive him? It does not belong to him, 'tis none of his part. Mirth is the Reward of a good Conscience, the Prerogative of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the peculiar Right of good Men. And they not only <hi>may</hi> be joyful and chearful, but are also <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> to be so. Thus in the Law, <hi>Thou shalt rejoyce before the Lord thy God,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 11.</note> says <hi>Moses</hi> to the Jewish Votary. So again the Psalmist, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord O</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 33.</note> 
                        <hi>ye righteous, for it becometh well the Just to be thankful.</hi> Again, <hi>Let the righteous</hi>

                        <hi>be glad, and rejoyce before God, let them also be merry and joyful.</hi> And again, <hi>Serve the Lord with gladness.</hi> And says <note place="margin">Psal. 100.</note> our Blessed Lord in his Farewel Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to his Disciples, <hi>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>remain in you, and that your joy might be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59847:25"/>
full.</hi> And we are exhorted to <hi>rejoyce evermore</hi> by the Apostle, who also reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. Gal. 5. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Joy</hi> among the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all this is true, and I not only confess, but also recommend the thing hitherto pleaded for. But then 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be consider'd what the Wise Man says, that <hi>to every thing there is a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 3.</note> and that there is a time to <hi>weep</hi> and <hi>mourn,</hi> as well as a time to <hi>laugh</hi> and <hi>dance.</hi> And this not only from <hi>Natural,</hi> but also from <hi>Moral</hi> Necessity. For the Circumstances of Human Life are such, as make it our <hi>Duty</hi> as well as <hi>Fate,</hi> to mourn and be sorrowful. Religion has its gloomy as well as bright side, and there are to be Days of Darkness as well as days of Light in the Christian Kalendar.</p>
                     <p>This is intimated to us by several <hi>Expressions,</hi> and by several <hi>Examples</hi> in Holy Scripture. Thus the Church in general is in the Divine Song of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> compared to a Dove, which tho' considerable for some other qualities, is yet for nothing so remarkable as for her continual mourning. So far was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59847:26"/>
that wise Man from the Opinion of those who make Temporal Prosperity a mark of the True Church. Again, says the same wise Preacher, <hi>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting.</hi> And again, <hi>Sorrow is better than laughter.</hi> Where you see he not only inculcates the practice of Mourning, but also expresly prefers it before its Contrary. And he gives this reason for it, because <hi>by the sadness of the Countenance the Heart is made better.</hi> And therefore he makes this the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 3.</note> of Wisdom and Folly, by telling us in the next Verse, <hi>That the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of Fools in the house of mirth.</hi> This Practice of Mourning is every where inculcated in the Writings of the Prophets, but especially of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who has writ a whole Book of <hi>Lamentations.</hi> But above all, tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable what our Lord himself says of Mourning in the <hi>16th</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> where he seems to make it the great mark of Difference between his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and the Men of this World, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily,</hi> says he, <hi>I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall shall rejoyce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:59847:26"/>
Nor do there want <hi>Examples</hi> of this holy Mourning in Scripture. Thus the Devotion of <hi>Hannah</hi> is expressed by <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 15</note> her being a Woman of a sorrowful Spirit. The Royal Prophet spent his whole time almost in Mourning and Sorrow, which he also indulged and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Music and Divine Hymns. And yet he was a Man wise and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a Man after God's own heart, and withal a Man of great Business and publick Occupation. Thus again the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was a great Mourner, a Man as unsatiable in his <hi>Sorrow,</hi> as some are in their <hi>Luxury.</hi> He was so full of Grief, as not to be satisfied with the Natural and Ordinary ways of expressing it, and therefore says he, <hi>Oh, that my head were waters, and mine</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night.</hi> More I might instance in, but I close all with the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who, as the Text says, was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief: And that not only in his last Passion and Agony, when his Soul was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; and when, as the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:59847:27"/>
says, <hi>He offer'd up prayers and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>with strong crying and tears,</hi> but also throughout the whole course of his Life. We oftentimes read of his weeping and sorrowing, as upon his Prospect of the City <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the Grave of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and a little after his last Supper, when as the Text says, he began to be <hi>sorrowful</hi> and <hi>very heavy,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> and in the Garden where he wept tears of Blood. But we never read that he ever Laught. Once indeed 'tis said that he rejoyc'd, but then 'twas <note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> not with an outward, sensitive and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Joy, but with an inward, spiritual and silent Exultation. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd in spirit.</hi> And what was it for? Not upon any Animal or Secular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but upon an Occasion altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual and Divine. 'Twas for the abundant Grace of his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon his Disciples, and for their good use of it, and improvement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                     <p>I do not intend in all this, such rigid Measures as are practis'd and exacted by some of the Religious Orders of the Roman Church, where a Man is is not allow'd so much as to Laugh,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59847:27"/>
or to say any thing but <hi>Frater memento mori,</hi> for several years together. This would be to turn Society into a <hi>Dumb Shew,</hi> to make Life a Burthen, and withal to bring an ill report upon the good Land of Promise, and to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Men from the Christian Religion. But that which I stand for is this, that we ought not so to give our selves over to secular Mirth and Jollity, but that we are still to remember that we are in the Vale of Tears, that there is a time for Mourning as well as for Rejoycing, and that this is that time; now we are in our Exile, and in the midst of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Fears, and that therefore Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row must sometimes have its turn as well as Joy, and that there is such a thing as Christian Mourning.</p>
                     <p>Nor need we be troubled that we have discover'd such an ungrateful Duty, since there is a <hi>Beatitude</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it. But because as was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, all manner of mourning will not come within its Compass, it will concern us in the second place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider who these Christian Mourners are. This I think cannot be resolv'd by any better measure, than by considering
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59847:28"/>
what are the true and proper Causes why a Christian ought to mourn. Now to this I shall answer,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. In <hi>General.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. In <hi>Particular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In General I say, that then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mourns for a due and proper Cause, when the Principle of his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is either Zeal for the Honour and Glory of God, or a Concern for the Good of Mankind. Nothing less than this can either deserve his Sorrow, or derive any Vertue or Excellency upon it. So that in short, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> will be the two Principles into which all true Christian Mourning must be at last resolv'd.</p>
                     <p>But because this may be exemplify'd in variety of Instances, 'twill not be amiss to consider some of the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of them. I answer therefore more particularly, That one very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and reasonable Cause, why a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should mourn, is the <hi>Consideration of sin.</hi> For a Man to consider seriously what a great and strange kind of Evil Sin is, how contrary to God, to his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59847:28"/>
Nature, to his Will, to his Commands, to his Goodness, to his Justice, to the wise Order of his Grace and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and especially to the great mystery of Godliness: Then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how contrary 'tis to Man, to his Nature, to his Reason, to his rational Instincts and Inclinations, to his inward Peace and Satisfaction, and lastly, to his Interest, both Temporal and Spiritual, Private and Publick, Present and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Then again to consider, how prone we are to commit it, and that we our selves are the Authors of this proneness: And lastly, how much of this great strange Evil there is in the World, how Iniquity abounds, and the Love of many waxes cold; that the whole World, as St. <hi>John</hi> says, <hi>lies</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 5. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>in wickedness;</hi> that there are but few that pretend to any Strictness or Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of Living, and yet fewer that discharge their Pretensions truly and sincerely: I say, for a Man to consider all this, to consider it seriously and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, must needs be a sad Scene of Contemplation, and such as will justly call for his Sorrow and Mourning. It was so to God himself, who is brought in by <hi>Moses</hi> as griev'd at his very heart
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59847:29"/>
for the abundance of wickedness which he beheld in the Old World. And I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not but that among the bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of our Lords Passion, this was none of the least, to foresee that there would be so many, who by their final Impenitence and persevering in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness would receive no Benefit from it. And if we may judge by proportion, the Angels in Heaven, who rejoyce at the Conversion of one Sinner, do also <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> for the irreclaimable Wickedness of so many Millions as are in the World. 'Tis a thing worth our Considering, and worth our Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore says the Psalmist, <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                        <hi>men keep not thy Law.</hi> And again, <hi>It grieveth me when I see the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.</hi> This is a vertuous and laudable Sorrow, as proceeding from a good and noble Principle, from Piety and Charity; and he that mourns upon this consideration, is a <hi>true Christian Mourner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again Seconly, Another very proper and reasonable Cause why a Christian should mourn, is the consideration of the <hi>Miseries of Human Life.</hi> 'Tis a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59847:29"/>
most deplorable thing to consider what a deal, and what variety of Misery there is in the World at once. <hi>Many</hi> things must concur to make us tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>Happy,</hi> but <hi>One</hi> thing alone is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enough to make us very <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> And how unhappy then must Humane Life be among such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Evils as are incident to it! I shall not go about to recount or describe them. They are too many to be numbred, and too various to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any method. This only I say, That should a Man by some compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Device have an united Prospect of the Miseries of the World, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by the Devils Artifice had of the Glories of it, 'twould be the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Landfcape that ever was drawn, or can be imagin'd. 'Twas for this that some of the Ancients reckon'd an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Death among the greatest Blessings of Heaven. <hi>Quem Dii diligunt, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescens moritur, The Favourite of the Gods dies young,</hi> says the Comedian. But <hi>Solomon</hi> goes further, and prefers <note place="margin">Eccles. 6.</note> an <hi>untimely Birth</hi> before a Man that has spent many years in this World. To be short, such is our Condition here, that we see God has not thought fit to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59847:30"/>
trust us with the least fore-knowledge of what is coming upon us, lest like Men upon a deep Precipice, we should be amazed, confounded, and fall down at the dreadful Prospect. And if the private Circumstances of each single Man's Life be so black and disconsolate, that 'tis thought fit he should see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he goes, what shall we think of the miseries of all Mankind put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? If any thing be worth our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, certainly this is. Our compassionate Saviour wept over the approaching Ruin of perishing <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and shall not a Christian mourn for the miseries of the whole World? We suspect the good Nature of him that can endure to sit out a deep Tragedy with dry Eyes; and can we stand and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a miserable World without mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? There are some Men of Rocky Hearts, and impassible Tempers, that could stand by and see the whole World in Flames without any concern, were but their own little selves secure from the Ruin. And this some are pleas'd to call <hi>Philosophy.</hi> But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian Charity that obliges us to sympathize with the miseries of each particular Man, to weep with those
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59847:30"/>
that weep, as the Apostle speaks, does much more require us to lament the common Miseries of Human Life. This therefore is a very proper Cause of Christian Mourning.</p>
                     <p>As is also in the Third place, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Emptiness</hi> of all Worldly and Created Good. The general Cause of most of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and Melancholy that is in the World, is because Men can't get so much of Worldly Good as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, not at all questioning its <hi>Vanity;</hi> but on the contrary, supposing that if they could <hi>compass</hi> such and such things, they should be Happy; and their only trouble is, that they can't <hi>get</hi> 'em. Now this is properly Worldly Sorrow, and comes from an ill Principle, either from Covetousness, Lust, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. But now there may be a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and laudable Discontent, as well as a vicions and sordid one. And that is, when a Man mourns and is troubled, not because he can't <hi>compass</hi> such and such Created Goods: No, perhaps he would not eat of the Fruit if he could reach it; but purely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are all <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59847:31"/>
cannot satisfie. He does not grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>wants them,</hi> for it may be he chooses to be without them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are wanting in <hi>themselves,</hi> and have not that in them, which can ever make him Happy. And indeed it is enough to cast a Damp upon the Spirit of any considering Man to think that what is substantial and satisfactory is out of his reach, and that all is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Vexation that lies within it; that the former he can't <hi>enjoy,</hi> and that the latter can't <hi>satisfie.</hi> To be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly convinc'd that all Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition is a Cheat, and so to have nothing in expectation, no one Glimpse or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Enjoyment before one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite one to live longer. This is a sad Reflection, and such as must needs cause Sorrow and Mourning. But then 'tis a very laudable one, and such as proceeds from an excellent Principle. 'Tis a Sorrow that arises from <hi>Increase</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 18</note> 
                        <hi>of Wisdom,</hi> from a right Notion and Understanding of things, from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, from a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of our own Powers and Capacities, and from the more than ordinary Aspirings of the Soul to God, who alone is able to satisfie her. And
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59847:31"/>
to be sorry upon such Principles as these, is to sorrow in a rational way, and after a godly sort.</p>
                     <p>To instance one more, another very proper Cause why a Christian should mourn, is the consideration of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite misery of those who shall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in so momentous a Concern. As to the certainty of our Salvation, 'tis not so great as some are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. For tho I can be assured of this Proposition with a certainty of Divine Faith, it being matter of express Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that the Faithful and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent shall be saved; yet that I Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and Repent, can be known to me only on the grounds of Experimental Knowledge, which is an Human, and therefore Fallible Testimony. And consequently the Conclusion always following the weaker part, I cannot be assured of my Salvation with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Divine Faith, but only with an Human and Moral Assurance, which indeed, to call it by a right Name, is no more than an high Probability, a strong Presumption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59847:32"/>
But yet if even this Moral Assurance were <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Irreversible,</hi> and were to take in the <hi>Future</hi> as well as the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> 'twere yet a considerable Stay and Security. But it is not so with us. That Assurance which we have is Absolute only for the Present, and reaches not the Future but only upon condition, supposing that we persevere in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Disposition, which considering the mutability of our Wills, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our Temptations, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examples of Apostacy, is a thing not only of <hi>uncertain,</hi> but of <hi>hazardous</hi> consequence.</p>
                     <p>And as we are not, cannot be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely sure that we shall not miscarry, so on the other hand 'tis most certain that we shall be unspeakably miserable if we do. For a Man to fall off from his last End and only true Good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes or possibility of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is a thing that can hardly be thought of without Confusion and Amazement. Now let a Man put these two things together, that whether he shall be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or no, is a matter of a depending and uncertain issue; and that if he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59847:32"/>
his case is intolerable; and then tell me whether this be not a just Cause for Trouble and Sadness? and whether this Salvation, this uncertain Salvation be not to be wrought out with <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Mourning</hi> as well as with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Certainly it is, and were it not for this, 'twould be no easie thing to give an account, why Gravity, Seriousness and Sobriety of Spirit should be such decent and commendable Qualities in Men. For otherwise, why should not a Man give himself up to the utmost Gaity and Jollity, and express it in all manner of odd Postures and Gestures up to the height of an <hi>Antick Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness?</hi> I say, why should not a Man do this? but only because this is not agreeable to the part he is to act, who being in a state of Probation and Doubtfulness, and having so great an Interest depending, ought rather to temper and correct the Luxuriancy of his Spirit, with some Grains of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Pensiveness, and beware of laughing too much here, lest it should be his Turn to weep and mourn here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59847:33"/>
These are the principal Causes of mourning, and from hence we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who the Christian Mourners are, who are concerned in this Beatitude; those namely, whose mourning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon these or such like grounds, which are at last reducible to either of these two Principles, Zeal for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of God, or a Concern for the Good of Mankind. They who mourn upon the score of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> are true Christian Mourners.</p>
                     <p>It remains that we now consider in the last place, wherein consists their Blessedness. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Meditations very frequently speaks of the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Tears,</hi> and as often <hi>Prays</hi> for it. And well he might, since 'tis attended with such happy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and has such a Blessedness intail'd upon it. Its Blessedness is both Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to Come. What the present Blessedness is we may learn from the Wise Man, who tells us that <hi>by the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the countenance the heart is made better.</hi> It is so, for by this it becomes more soft and tender for all Divine Impressions, for the Love of God, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59847:33"/>
Devotion, for Charity to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for Mercy and Compassion, for Repentance, and the like. It is also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made more serious, more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and reflecting, more recollected, more setled and composed, which is to be considerably <hi>better.</hi> For as Sorrow is the Principle of Consideration, so is Consideration the Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and well-living, according to that of the Psalmist, <hi>I consider'd my</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                        <hi>own ways, and turn'd my feet to thy testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And of all this we have a very sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Example in the Nation of the Jews, who till the time of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity were very Gross and Carnal, notwithstanding so many Miracles of God both in their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in their passage through the Wilderness. And when they were brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho they had such open and clear Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Divine Presence among them; so many Prophecies, so many Miracles, and so many Apparitions of Angels; yet we find them ever now and then relapsing into Idolatry. But after the Captivity, when they had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59847:34"/>
gon through a course of Sorrow and Affliction, they presently began to behave themselves more orderly, and seem'd like Gold, to <hi>refine</hi> upon the Trial of the Furnace. For we don't read that after that time they ever fell into <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And accordingly God began to deal with them now no longer as Children, but as Persons of some maturity, by withdrawing from them his <hi>Visible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to have learnt enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the School of Affliction to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede all other methods of Instruction and Disciplin. And from that time forwards the Minds of Men began to be more generally erected towards Heaven and the good things of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Life, when they saw that the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Observers of the Law fell often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into those Evils which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd against the Transgressors of it. By which means they were by degrees prepared for the reception of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>This is the present Blessedness of those that mourn: What the future is, we are told by our Saviour, who says, they shall be <hi>comforted,</hi> that is, shall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59847:34"/>
be received into a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> of Bliss and Happiness, Joy and Delight, and be infinitely rewarded in Heaven for all their Pious and Charitable Mourning upon Earth. According to that of the Psalmist, <hi>He that now goes</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 126.</note> 
                        <hi>on his way sorrowing and bringeth forth good seed, shall doubtless come again with joy, and bring his sheaves with him.</hi> They shall be receiv'd into the City of God, the new <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where there is no more Mourning, nor cause of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and where not only <hi>all Sin,</hi> but even those very <hi>Vertues</hi> which are founded upon the least <hi>Imperfection</hi> shall be done away. Here therefore there will be no room left even for <hi>Godly Sorrow,</hi> but all shall be Joy and Gladness, Harmony and Thanksgiving. And Blessed are they who so mourn here, that they may enter into this Joy of their Lord hereafter.</p>

                     <p>THE Judgment of God differs so very widely from that of Man, that his Thoughts are seldom as our Thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. But in nothing is the difference so signal, as in the Conclusions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery.</hi> Our Judgments are seldom conformable to the Divine in matters of meer Truth and Notion, but much seldomer in Practical Maxims, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Resolutions. Here, if any where, is chiefly to be found that <hi>Vain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> which we are caution'd against by the Apostle, and that <hi>Tradition of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Colos. 2. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Men,</hi> and those <hi>Rudiments of the World</hi> which are not after Christ. Herein 'tis that the Wisdom of God and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59847:35"/>
of the World which seldom meet in one point, stand yet most divided and opposed to each other; and tho the latter be always in some respect or other, Foolishness to the former; yet never so much as in her Resolutions concerning Good and Evil, Happiness and Misery. The World for the most part calling that Evil which God calls Good, and those miserable whom God pronounces in an especial manner Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. This is very remarkably verify'd in the matter now before us: For tho there has been great diversity of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Gentile Philosophy about the Objects of Human Happiness, some placing it in one thing and some in another; yet among all their variety we don't find any that placed it in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> or <hi>Meekness.</hi> These they scarce acknowledged as Vertues, much less to be such as wherein the Happiness of Man should in great part consist. Nay, they rather look't upon these as mean, servile Dispositions, such as were fit for Men of low Fortunes, and lower Minds, and which were so far from conducing to Happiness, that they rather exposed Men to misfortunes and miseries. But now these are the Dispositions of Mind
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59847:36"/>
which our Lord and Saviour, who was the <hi>Wisdom of his Father,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> singles out and marks for a peculiar Excellency and Happiness.</p>
                     <p>Nor need we wonder overmuch at the singularity of this Christian Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, since the whole course of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Life and Doctrin was a direct Contradiction to the Maxims and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the World. Thus Men hate to unsay or undo what they have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done or said, and to confess their former Folly by an after-retractation. But now this is the principal thing of our Saviours Institution, whose whole Gospel is a Doctrin of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is a <hi>Retractation</hi> of Judgment and Choice. Thus again Men love Riches, but Christ chose to be Poor. They are altogether for Honours and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but he hid himself that he might not be made a King. They again gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pursue after Pleasures, but both his Life and Doctrin was all over Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Mortification. The World thinks Affronts intolerable, and 'tis reckon'd a piece of Gallantry and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to revenge them, but our wise and good Lord chose to be reviled
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59847:36"/>
and spit upon. They are impatient of Calumnies and Slanders, but he chose to be condemn'd being innocent. They lastly (as the Prophet complains) <hi>call</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>the proud happy,</hi> and despise the meek Man as a miserable Slave and Fool; whereas says our Lord in Opposition to the former, <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit,</hi> and in opposition to the Latter, <hi>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the Words I shall discourse of these two things in general, the <hi>Duty</hi> and the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of Meekness. In treating of the first 'twill be requisite,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. To consider what Meekness is.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. To shew that it is a Christian Duty.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. To state the Measures of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in its more general Cases.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. To inforce the Practice of it as far as it Obliges.</p>
                     <p>First therefore as to the Notion of Meekness: <hi>Aristotle</hi> has long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined it to be a <hi>Mediocrity</hi> about <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, are his Words in the Fourth of his Ethicks.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59847:37"/>
This Definition tho it be true as far as it goes, yet like the rest of his, it runs in such general Terms, that a Man is little the wiser for it. And indeed it rather serves to tell us the meaning of the Word, than to discover the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing. To do this therefore I should rather think fit to say, that 'tis such a Temper or Disposition of Mind, whereby a Man so moderates and commands the Passion of Anger, as not to be carried to any such degree of it, as may either discompose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or injure his Neighbour. Call this a Definition or Description, or what you please, I think 'tis such as may give a sufficient Idea of the thing we are discoursing about.</p>
                     <p>This therefore being setled, our next business is to shew, That to be thus meek is a Christian Duty. That it is so, might sufficiently appear from this General Consideration, that 'tis an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Charity,</hi> which as we well know is the Life and Substance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law. And 'tis a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Instance too: For since Charity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to promote both our own and our Neighbour's Happiness, it must by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59847:37"/>
consequence oblige us to moderate and govern those Passions which have any influence upon either of them. Now among all the Passions, there is none in the Exercise of which either our own, or our Neighbours Happiness is so often and so much concerned, as in this of Anger. So <hi>often</hi> it being a thing of daily incursion. So <hi>much,</hi> because upon this depends all the Strength and Stability both of Private and Publick Peace. And consequently, such a due Moderation of this Passion as may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure both (which is what we call meekness) is a very considerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Charity, and therefore also of the Christian Law, which is so much a Law of Charity, that as the Apostle tells us, 'tis <hi>fulfilled</hi> by it. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 14.</note> we may observe, that among the several Excellencies and Properties of Charity reckon'd up by the Apostle, these are particularly insisted upon, that it suffers long and is kind, that it is not easily provoked, and that it <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> bears all things, which are also some of the chief Properties of Meekness.</p>
                     <p>But that Meekness is a Christian Duty, and one of the first Order too,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59847:38"/>
may be more particularly shewn from the express Doctrin and Example of our Divine Law-giver. As to his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> he not only commands it, but seems to resolve all that Moral Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency which he either had in himself, or would have in us, to these two, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Meekness. Come unto me,</hi> says he, <hi>and learn of me.</hi> But what? Not to make Worlds, not to cure the sick, not to restore Light to the Blind, <note place="margin">Manudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio ad Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, <hi>c.</hi> 32. <hi>pag.</hi> 40.</note> or Life to the Dead, (to use the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of the excellent Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi>) but learn of me, for I am <hi>meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What! was it that our Lord had no other Vertues? Or that he excelled in these two more than in any of the rest, that when he bids us learn of him, he proposes no other to our imitation? Neither of these can be said. Not the former, because in him dwelt the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Godhead, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the absence of any one Grace or Vertue. Not the Latter, because he was uniformly as well as intirely good, and had every Vertue in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perfection, having (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture says of him) received the Spirit of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59847:38"/>
God without measure. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he might be and was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the outward exercise of one Vertue than another, according as opportunities and Circumstances might require; but as to the inward Habits and Dispositions themselves, he was equally perfect in them all, and did not excel in one more than in another. Why then does he recommend only these two to be learnt by his Disciples? It must be partly because he was the only Master that could teach such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dispositions, and partly because of some special Excellency in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues themselves above any other of the Christian Law. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our Lord puts them for the <hi>whole</hi> of it, by calling them his <hi>Yoke, Take</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29</note> 
                        <hi>my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor are we less obliged to this by the <hi>Example,</hi> than by the <hi>Precept</hi> of our Lord. For as his Example was a Living Law, so was the Practice of his Vertue a very eminent part of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. This he himself intimates to us, by assigning this for the reason why we should learn of him. And of this we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59847:39"/>
may be further informed from the whole Story and Process of his Life. Never was any mans Meekness so much tried as his was: For as the <hi>real</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Dignity of his Person height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every Astront and rude Treatment that was offer'd him to an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pitch, so the <hi>outward</hi> Lowness and Meanness of it exposed him to a great many of them. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the number and heinousness of his Provocations, we don't find that he was ever in the least discomposed or put into a Passion by them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> indeed was a Man very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for this Vertue, insomuch that the Scripture gives this Character of him, <hi>That he was very meek above all the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>men which were upon the face of the earth.</hi> And yet we find that with all his Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he could not bear with the Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Perverseness of that untract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able People the Jews, who (as the Psalmists Observation is) <hi>so provoked</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 106.</note> 
                        <hi>his spirit, that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</hi> Now our Lord had to deal with the very same stubborn and cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grain'd Generation of Men, only now under infinitely greater Prejudices and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59847:39"/>
Disaffections, and suffer'd more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities from them than either were or could be offer'd to <hi>Moses.</hi> And yet none of all their ill Usages could ever raise such a thing as Anger or Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, though they did so in those who stood by, and beheld his Abuses. Thus the unkindness of the rude <hi>Samaritans</hi> could not so much as strike a Spark into his Divine Breast, when at the same time it made his two zealous Disciples <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <note place="margin">Luke 9. 54.</note> to that Degree, as to desire Fire from Heaven to consume them. And so again, the rough Seizure of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Person by the Soldiers, could not extort from him so much as an angry Look, when yet the very sight of it made his warm Disciple draw his Sword.</p>
                     <p>And with the same Meekness he went on with his Sufferings with which he begun them, as may appear from that mild Answer which he return'd to the Officer that struck him, <hi>If I have</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 18.</note> 
                        <hi>spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why smitest thou me?</hi> What could have been said more mildly and dispassionately, or that could argue a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59847:40"/>
more sedate and well-govern'd Spirit? His greatest Apostle could not be half so moderate under a far less urging occasion. For when not actually smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but only commanded to be so by the order of <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Priest, he return'd him this sharp and warm Answer, <hi>God shall smite thee thou whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me after the Law, and commandest me to be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contrary to the Law?</hi> There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing in his Answer, but what perhaps might have been justified by the oddness of the Provocation, but yet you can't but observe a great difference between the behaviour of the <hi>Disciple</hi> and of the <hi>Master.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you would see a perfect Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Meekness, look upon him under the Shame, and Dishonour, and Pains of the Cross, encountring at once with the Agonies of Death, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and Revilings of Sinners, and the Vengeance of an Almighty God; and all this without any the least shew of Impatience or Discomposure of Spirit. So that I think I may well inlarge the Question of the Prophet, and to that, <hi>Is there any sorrow like</hi>
                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59847:40"/>
to my sorrow, <hi>add this also,</hi> Is there any meekness like to my meekness?</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but make a stand, and with Sorrow reflect upon a certain Order of Men, how little they have of the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they have learnt either by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or by the Example of him whose Religion and Imitation too they profess, and by whose venerable Name they have thought fit to distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; who instead of this Meekness and Gentleness, are all made up of Passion and Violence, Fury and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiousness, meer <hi>Firebrands</hi> in Society, that kindle and lay wast where-ever they come, and seem more like <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> shot into a Town, than <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of it, by thus raging where they light, by thus burning, destroying and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all about them. How unlike are these Men to the Temper of the meek Lamb of God! As unlike cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as Wolves and Tigers. And yet 'tis an unlikeness they are so little sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of, that they will yet pretend to the Name and Practice of Christians; yea to the very Name of <hi>Jesus;</hi> and he had need be a bold Man, or at a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59847:41"/>
good distance from them, that shall dare to contradict them.</p>
                     <p>But certainly as <hi>Wrath worketh not the righteousness of God,</hi> so neither is such <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 20.</note> an allowed course of it consistent with it. And as he cannot be a good Man who is so inordinate in the use of a Passion, wherein both his own and his Neighbours Peace and Quiet is so much concern'd; so much less can he be a good Christian, who is of a Frame of Spirit so directly contrary to that of the Holy Jesus, and who wants this great Christian Qualification, the Spirit of Gentleness and Meekness, which is so considerable an Instance of Charity, and so strictly enjoyn'd by the Precept, and so strongly recommended by the Example of Christ.</p>
                     <p>But because the <hi>Limits</hi> of this Duty are not so plain as the <hi>Obligation</hi> of it, I proeced in the Third place, to state the Measures of its Obligation in its more General Cases. And here in the first place it may be demanded, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Anger be contrary to Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and consequently unlawful? The Affirmative is stiffly contended for by the <hi>Stoic;</hi> but I think the Negative
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59847:41"/>
sufficiently warranted by that Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Caution, <hi>Be angry and sin not.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 26.</note> Which plainly implies, that there may be anger without Sin. And 'tis also plain from the nature of the thing that there may. For Anger is a natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, implanted in us by God, from whom nothing can proceed that is simply and as such Evil. And besides, the Office of Meekness is not utterly to destroy this Passion, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it, whereby 'tis supposed that 'tis not in its whole kind evil; for what is so cannot be regulated, and must be destroyed:</p>
                     <p>Since then Anger is supposed not wholly to be destroy'd by Meekness, as being Evil, but only to be regulated lest it become so, the next thing to be consider'd is, by what <hi>Measures.</hi> Now these Measures may either respect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as to the inward Passion, as within a Man's own Breast; or as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts, Effects, and Expressions of it.</p>
                     <p>And first, As to those Measures which respect Anger as to the inward Passion, as lodg'd within a Man's own Breast. These I think will be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59847:42"/>
comprized within these Four Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, the Cause or Occasion, the Object, the Degree, or the Time. As to the Cause, to render that justifiable, 'twill be requisite, First, That it be something weighty and considerable, something wherein either the Glory of God, or the publick Good, or else some very great private Interest is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. 'Tis not every little impertinent Trifle that can warrant our Anger. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, 'Twill be requisite that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger owe its Birth to some competent measure of previous Counsel and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation: For if all our Actions are to be govern'd by Reason, certainly our <hi>Passions</hi> ought not to be wholly exempted from it. I'm sure they need it most of all; and if a Man thinks not before he gives himself leave to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, though the ground of it should prove never so just and proper in it self, yet as to him his Anger was bruitish and unreasonable. As it will also be, if Thirdly, it be not conceived for a due end, such as either the Vindication of the Divine Honour and Glory, the procurement of good to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or the prevention and suppression of sin. And so much to qualifie our Anger with respect to the <hi>Cause.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59847:42"/>
But Secondly, to the further Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, 'twill be requisite that it have a due <hi>Object.</hi> For all are not so. There are some things that cannot, some that ought not to be the Objects of Anger. That cannot with Reason, and that ought not for Religion. Thus we ought not to be Angry with <hi>God,</hi> as 'tis said <hi>Caligula</hi> was, who being vext at the Thunder for disturbing his Banquet, rose up from the Table and provoked <hi>Jupiter</hi> to fight with him. Neither ought we to be angry with <hi>inanimate</hi> senseless things, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was with the River for drowning one of his Sacred Horses. It argues a Mind overcome and blinded with Passion to be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of it where it can signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Nor ought we to be angry with those, who either by Chance or Necessity, or probable Ignorance, or common Frailty, have offended us. Nor are we to be angry with those, who though they have none of these excuses to qualifie their Trespass, yet acknowledge their Fault, beg our Pardon, and promise Amendment. Repentance is the measure of God's Forgiveness, and so it ought to be of ours. Nor Lastly, should we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59847:43"/>
let loose our Anger against <hi>Brute</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Children, Fools or Mad-men, or any other that are under any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or disorder of Understanding. But we are to be angry with such only as are impious and wicked, and that are neither ashamed nor repent of their wickedness. And even here also we ought rather to be angry with the <hi>Fault,</hi> than with the <hi>Person.</hi> For so <hi>Moses</hi> was exceeding angry at the <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when at the same time he prayed for the <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus far of the <hi>Object.</hi> The two last circumstances whereby our Anger is to be qualify'd, are <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> As to Degree, this may receive a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Measure, one from the Person who is the <hi>Object</hi> of Anger, and another from the Person who is the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. That with reference to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is this, That our Anger should not exceed the quality of the Offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. That with reference to the Subject will be this, That it should not be so great, let the Offence be what it will, as to discompose the mind of him who conceives it, and thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him for the discharge of such Offices
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59847:43"/>
as he own either to God, his Neighbor, or Himself.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the time of our Anger, this we find already stated by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, who limits it within the Compass of a <hi>Day.</hi> 'Tis a Passion that ought to <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 26.</note> be so short lived, that the Sun must not go down upon it. For indeed 'tis not safe trusting our selves with such a dangerous Guide in the <hi>Dark,</hi> nor to nourish a Passion, which tho in its own Nature innocent, borders so nicely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hatred, that with a little keeping 'twill grow so stale, sower and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as to commence Malice.</p>
                     <p>And thus far of those Measures which respect Anger as to the <hi>inward Passion.</hi> Proceed we now to those who respect it as to the outward Acts, Effects and Expressions of it. And here among other things too obvious to be insisted on, two Enquiries offer themselves more principally to be consider'd. One is concerning the Propulsation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of Injuries, the other is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the revenging of Injuries already done. Of both these it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how far they are consistent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59847:44"/>
with the Vertue and Duty of Christian Meekness.</p>
                     <p>As to the Former, 'tis to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that Injuries are either Public, as when the Magistrate oppresses his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; or Private, when one Subject injures another; or lastly, such as are on both sides Public, as when one King or State injures another. This premised, I answer, First, That an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury offer'd from one Kingdom or State to another, may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by that other, this being one of the main Ends and Uses of the Civil Sword to protect those who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it, which when it does, 'tis duly employed. To which it may be added, that distinct Kingdoms, being under no common Jurisdiction, have no other expedient whereby to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Either therefore they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways suffer, which would be intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Society, or they must right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the Sword. Secondly, That in case the Supreme Magistrate oppress his Subjects, 'tis by no means consistent with Christian Meekness for them by force to repel the Injury. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to <hi>Obey</hi> him only in <hi>some</hi> Cases,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59847:44"/>
but to <hi>Resist</hi> him in <hi>none.</hi> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a True, tho to some an Hard Saying. <hi>Wherefore ye must needs be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation,</hi> are as plain Words as any in the Bible. But Men are very slow to understand what they have no mind to practise; otherwise one would think there should need no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision in the case, than the Example of our meek Lord and Master, who pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently submitted himself to an ordinary Magistrate, commanded his rash Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>sheath his Sword,</hi> and would not suffer his Angelical Legions to <hi>draw</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 53</note> 
                        <hi>theirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Thirdly, as to private Injuries between Man and Man, I answer, First, That these are never to be forcibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by a private Defence, when a publick one may be had; in defect of which a private one may be used. But then we are to consider Secondly, That either this private Injury reaches only to our Goods and Possessions, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard of Life; and here a good Man would go very far in yielding from his right, and in patiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Injuries: Or else 'tis with extream
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59847:45"/>
Danger of Life, and then indeed he not only may, but perhaps is oblig'd by the Law of Self-preservation by the utmost Force to repel the Injury. And thus much to be observ'd in <hi>repelling</hi> of Injuries.</p>
                     <p>I come now in the Second place, to consider the <hi>Vindication</hi> of Injuries al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done. And here I take notice of a two-fold Extreme. One is of those who stand for the highest Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Injuries without any measure or moderation; which seems to have been the Fault of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, who by the Law of Retaliation, thought they might exact any thing, an Eye for an Eye, or a Tooth for a Tooth. The other is of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> who so extol the Law of Charity, as not to allow any place for the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Injuries, not permitting it either to private Persons or publick, and so taking from the Magistrate both the Right and the Use of the Civil Sword.</p>
                     <p>These I take to be Extremes; and that the Truth lies between them, which I suppose is, That publick Vindication
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59847:45"/>
of Injuries is not only Lawful but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; so far from being against Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that 'tis a great instance of it, and required by it. For without this there would be no living, and Human Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety could never stand. But as to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Vindication of Injuries, that which we more especially call <hi>Revenge,</hi> this I shall readily allow to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and so make appear upon these Grounds. First, Because Vengeance is proper to God, and therefore to be committed either to him, or else to those whom he has empowr'd, who are therefore styled Gods. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Vengeance is an Act of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and consequently a Publick Act, and therefore not to be exercised by a private Person, who also must not be allow'd to be a Judge in his own Cause. Lastly, Because Vengeance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to them by whom the ends of it cannot be obtain'd. But now by a private Hand they cannot, as may appear by considering what these Ends are, which I suppose to be chiefly these Three; To amend him that is punish'd; To better others by his Example; and to procure to the injur'd Party and others Security for the future. But now pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59847:46"/>
Revenge reaches none of these Ends. For First, It does not amend or reform the Adversary, but rather provokes him further. Nor Secondly, Does it tend to the bettering of others, but rather corrupts and scandalizes them by an ill Example. Nor Lastly, Does the private Avenger procure safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either to himself or others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger to both, and to himself Vexation and Trouble for the present, and Fear for the future, left his Enemy should revenge himself again. Private Revenge therefore is universally to be condemn'd, as utterly unlawful, and altogether inconsistent with the Duty of <hi>Christian Meekness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus have we stated the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this Vertue in its more General Cases. But this is a thing that needs to be <hi>inforc'd,</hi> as well as <hi>explain'd.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider therefore, First, That God has expresly forbidden us all undue Anger, and has prescribed the contrary Offices of Charity and Meekness. Consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that all Injuries befall us by Gods special Providence, and may, if we hinder not its course, turn to our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Good. Consider again, that God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59847:46"/>
uses an incredible Patience and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering toward the worst of Men, and particularly towards our selves; by the former setting us an Example of Lenity, and by the latter making it very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to follow it. Consider again, that all Vengeance belongs to God, who has said, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> And that therefore he that avenges himself, assumes the part of <hi>God,</hi> yea withall of a <hi>Judge,</hi> of an <hi>Accuser,</hi> of a <hi>Witness,</hi> and of an <hi>Executioner</hi> all at once, against all Sense and Reason, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Justice. This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd with reference to God.</p>
                     <p>Then again as to our Neighbour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he is nearly related both to God, and to our selves. To God, as made after his Image; and to our selves, as cast in the same Mould with us, and partaking of the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature. Consider again, what we would have done by our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to our selves, and how reasonable 'tis that we should do the same to him. Lastly, Consider what we <hi>have</hi> already done to him, whether we have not been guilty of the same or greater er Injuries <hi>towards</hi> him, than those
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59847:47"/>
which we so warmly resent <hi>from</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>Then lastly with reference to our selves, consider First, how much by our unjust Anger we expose our selves to the just Displeasure of God, who <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 22.</note> by his Son has told us, that <hi>Whosoever is angry with his Brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider again, that we may easily, and do often mis-interpret Men's Minds and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions by their outward Demeanour, and think our selves affronted by them when there is no such thing intended; and that therefore even upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 'tis very reasonable we should be <hi>slow to wrath.</hi> Consider again, how much causless and intemperate Anger unfits us for all the parts of Divine Worship, which can neither be well perform'd by, nor will be accepted from a Heart flaming with this strange Fire. And therefore says the Apostle, speaking of Prayer, <hi>Lifting up holy hands without</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>wrath,</hi> implying, that a vacancy from Wrath is a necessary Qualification for Prayer. To which purpose 'tis very considerable, that when King <hi>David</hi> would have erected a Temple for the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59847:47"/>
Public Worship of God, tho a Man otherwise of a sweet and gentle Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and only accidentally and innocently too ingaged in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Anger and Contention; yet he was refused, and the Work imposed upon one not of a more meek Spirit, but only of a calmer and more serene Life. And if God would not accept an <hi>House of Prayer</hi> from a Man of a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way and Character, much less will he accept those <hi>Prayers</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Soul disturb'd with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Consider again, how it unfits us for the business of our Calling, how it hinders the free exercise of our Thoughts, how it prejudices our Health, disturbs the Tranquility of our Minds, renders us odious and uneasie to all about us; in one word, how utterly it unfits us both for enjoying our selves, and from being delighted in by others! Consider lastly, to what mean and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Principles within us this Passion owes its rise, such as Pride, Self-love, vain Curiosity, and Suspicion, rash Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, Negligence and Inadvertency, Ambition, Lust, Envy, and the like. So that besides its own proper illness,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59847:48"/>
'tis further to be detested upon the Scandal of its Parentage.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far discours'd of the Duty of Meekness, First, By shewing what it is. Secondly, By shewing that 'tis a Christian Duty. Thirdly, By stating the general Measures of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. And lastly, By proposing such Considerations as may recommend its Practice. I come now briefly to discourse of its <hi>Blessedness,</hi> which may also serve as another distinct Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to inforce the Practice of it. <hi>Blessed are the meek,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>for they shall inherit the earth.</hi> The only Beatitude which has a Temporal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise annex'd to it; wherein our Lord seems to imitate <hi>Moses,</hi> who in his Law had also one Commandment with a Temporal Promise. And there seems to be great resemblance between them. One is, that thy <hi>Days may be long in the Earth,</hi> and the other, <hi>They shall inherit the Earth.</hi> Here therefore We are to do two things. First, We must enquire into the Sense and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Beatitude. Secondly, Into the Truth of it. That is, We must first enquire, What is meant by the Meek's
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59847:48"/>
inheriting the Earth; and secondly shew, that they do so inherit it.</p>
                     <p>And first, by their inheriting the Earth, I suppose cannot be meant, that they shall have large Portions of it, that they shall raise great Estates, that they shall take root and spread, and as the Prophet expresses it, <hi>joyn House</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>to House,</hi> and <hi>lay Field to Field.</hi> This I suppose cannot be meant.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Because this is not true, the Meek do not inherit the Earth according to this Sense.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Because if they did, this would not be a proper Ground for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pronounc'd Blessed.</p>
                     <p>And first, this Sense is not true, the Meek do not <hi>thus</hi> inherit the Earth. We rather find that the World is made for the Bold and the Violent, for the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirited and turbulent, for the furious and boisterous, and that they have commonly the greatest share of it who deserve the least. And therefore we commonly urge this as one Argument against the goodness of Riches, that they frequently fall to the Lot of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59847:49"/>
the worst Men. And therefore says the Psalmist, <hi>Lo, these are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 74.</note> 
                        <hi>these prosper in the world, and these have riches in possession.</hi> While in the mean time the Meek are oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and devoured by these Beasts of Prey, and are so far from inheriting the Earth, that 'tis as much as many of them can do to <hi>Live</hi> upon it, and more than some of them can do to find room <hi>under</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>But Secondly, Suppose they did thus inherit the Earth, by having great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, yet this would not be a proper Ground for their being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd Blessed. For are Clods of Earth a suitable Good for Man? Or is Happiness to be measur'd by the Acre? Do we find that Rich Men are so very much Happier than others? Or do we think that the Earth has Mines of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, as it has of Gold? But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>we</hi> think, is it at all probable that our Blessed Lord, who himself made choice of Poverty, who but in a Line or two before pronounc'd the Poor Blessed, who tells us that his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not of this World, who bids us beware of Covetousness, and warns
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59847:49"/>
us of the great danger of Riches, by telling us how hard it is for one that has them to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; who dehorts us from laying up Treasures on Earth; and who lastly recommends to his Disciples nothing more than the contempt of the World, by assuring them, that the Life of Man does not consist in the abundance of things which he possesses: I say, is it imaginable that our Lord after all this, should therefore pronounce the meek Man blessed for having great Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?</p>
                     <p>This therefore cannot be the thing meant by the Meek's inheriting the Earth; which I take rather to signifie the <hi>manner</hi> of possessing, than the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their Possessions; and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thus much, That the Meek shall enjoy what they have, be it little or great, with comfort, and satisfaction, and tranquility of Mind; whereas those of a contrary disposition, tho they may <hi>possess</hi> a great deal, can yet be truly said to <hi>enjoy</hi> little or nothing. And this seems to be the Sense of the Psalmist, when in Words directly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to these of our Lord, he says,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59847:50"/>
                        <hi>The meek-spirited shall possess the earth,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 34. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>and shall be refreshed in the multitude of Peace.</hi> That is, they shall have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Pleasure, Peace and Content with whatever they have, which how little soever, shall yet carry a true Rellih, and yield more real satisfaction to them, than the otherwise affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can reap from their ample Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. According to what the Psalmist in the same place immediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, <hi>A small thing that the righteous</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>has, is better than great riches of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I take to be the <hi>Sense</hi> and Meaning of this Beatitude. As to the <hi>Truth</hi> and Reality of it, there is this Double Security for it, the natural tendency of the Vertue of Meekness, and the Blessing of God upon it. As to its natural tendency, Meekness is a very decent, amiable, and winning thing; and accordingly the Apostle calls it, <hi>the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit.</hi> And by this in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability the Meek Man will sweeten and endear even his very Enemies to him, and so gain himself Peace <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> by his quiet and inoffensive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59847:50"/>
But however this be, yet yet he is sure to have Peace <hi>within,</hi> with himself, and with God. And having this, he is in a very fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Mind to enjoy himself, and to take comfort in what he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses.</p>
                     <p>Which he will be farther enabled to do, Secondly, by the Blessing of God. And this again the Psalmist takes notice of some few Verses after the forecited ones. <hi>Such as are blessed of the Lord</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>shall possess the Land,</hi> says he, implying, that as the Meek, whom he just before spoke of, should possess the Earth, so 'tis through a special Blessing of God that they should do so. And these are two great Securities for a Life of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Self enjoyment, the Peace of a sedate Spirit within, and the Blessing of God without. And both these the meek Man has, whom therefore we may venture to pronounce Blessed, and therefore Blessed because he shall <hi>thus</hi> inherit the Earth: Which yet shall be but a Type and Pledge of his Future Inheritance with the Saints in Light.</p>

                     <p>THO God has provided <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment</hi> for all the Appetites which he has made; yet there are but two Appetites of Man which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to gratifie to the <hi>Height,</hi> and to bless with a full and lasting satisfaction. And those are the desire of being Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and the desire of being Good. There are some Appetites of Man which are never satisfied; for says the Wise Man, <hi>The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>ear fill'd with hearing. Seeing</hi> and <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are the most refined of all the Senses, and those Appetites which are most Spiritual and refined, and come nearest to the Elevations of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Nature, are always hardest to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59847:51"/>
be satisfied. And the Intellectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, when 'tis more raised and elevated, as in the state of Separation, will have a more inlarg'd Appetite, and a sharper edge of Desire, and so will be harder to be satisfied than 'tis now. Which by the way I take to be the Reason why those Sensual Spirits which now feel no great uneasiness from the Absence of the Supreme Good, will notwithstanding hereafter be extremely miserable in being exiled from his Beatific Presence. As for the <hi>Grosser</hi> Appetites of the Animal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, such as Hunger, Thirst, and the like; these indeed have this advantage above the <hi>Finer,</hi> that they may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for some time, (and such is the bruitishness of Man) are too often overcharg'd. But then they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again in certain Periods like the Tide, and be as importunate as ever for new Supplies; and, as our Saviour told the Woman of <hi>Samaria, Whosoever</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 4. 13</note> 
                        <hi>drinks of this water shall thirst again.</hi> The Appetite may be laid asleep for a while, but it will infallibly awake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into its former eagerness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59847:52"/>
But 'tis not the unhappiness of Man to have <hi>all</hi> his Appetites like these, such as will either <hi>never,</hi> or not <hi>finally</hi> be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd. There are two that are design'd for a full and lasting Satisfaction, The Desire of being Happy, and the Desire of being Good and Vertuous. But still with this material difference between them, That the Desire of Happiness is not absolutely secure of Satisfaction, but only upon condition. The Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of this Desire is suspended upon the Quality of our Moral Conduct. But now the Desire of Goodness and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has by the Grace and Indulgence of God an absolute Title to Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is sure to be throughly grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For, says our Saviour, <hi>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be fill'd. Shall</hi> be fill'd, without any further Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Reserve.</p>
                     <p>That we may the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of this Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it will be necessary</p>

II. What kind of Hunger and Thirst that is, to which this Promise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion is made.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. To make good the Proposition it self, that those who do hunger and thirst after Righteousness shall be fill'd.</p>
                     <p>To satisfie the first Inquiry, I shall not critically weigh all the acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Word <hi>Righteousness</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thinking it sufficient to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand, to consider the general <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi> of Righteousness. This therefore may be consider'd either in a <hi>Judicial,</hi> or in a <hi>Moral</hi> Sense. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in a Judicial Sense imports as much as a Legal Discharge, whereby the Person impleaded becomes Right in the Court, or Righteous. Which Legal Discharge may be again two ways, either by remitting a Criminal, or by acquitting suspected or accused Innocence. These are the two ways of a Legal Discharge, and then is a Person Judicially Righteous, when he is discharg'd either of these two ways, either by the remission of his Guilt, or by the Declaration of his Innocence.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59847:53"/>
The Latter of these is properly Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tho the former be <hi>that</hi> Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby Christians must expect to stand in the Judgment of God, since in the other Sense no Man Living shall be Justify'd. For we are not Justify'd as <hi>Innocent</hi> Persons, but as <hi>Sinners,</hi> and accordingly are not <hi>Acquitted,</hi> but <hi>Pardon'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Righteousness in a <hi>Moral</hi> Sense may be supposed to import all those Divine and Moral Vertues which are required by the Christian Law, consisting of the whole Duty of Man, to God, Himself, and his Neighbour. This latter kind of Righteousness may again be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd either <hi>Materially</hi> and <hi>Abstracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> for the bare Vertues themselves, as they are certain supposed Actions which naturally tend to the good and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction both of Human Nature, and of Human Society. Or else <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Concretely</hi> for such and such Vertues as subjected in Man; or for the Habitual Will of doing such supposed Actions, which is formal Vertue, and whereby the Man is denominated Vertuous or Righteous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59847:53"/>
This is not one of those Distinctions which are without any <hi>Difference.</hi> For the Difference is very clear and great: As for instance, when 'tis said, <hi>I love or practise vertue,</hi> and, <hi>I am proud of my vertue;</hi> 'tis plain that the word Vertue does not bear the same Notion in both Propositions. For when 'tis said, <hi>I love and practise vertue,</hi> there 'tis plain that Vertue is taken Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for the Abstract Idea of Vertue, which is supposed to be the Object of my Love. But when 'tis said, I am proud of my Vertue, here 'tis as plain that Vertue is taken Formally, for my Habit of willing it, whereby I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated vertuous. For I cannot be supposed to be proud of Vertue in its abstract Idea, but only of the Love I have towards it. To be short, Moral Vertue may be taken either for the things which are fit to be done, or for the Habitual Will of doing them. The former is the righteousness of the Law, prescribing what ought to be done; the latter is the righteousness of the <hi>Man</hi> willing to do what is so prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. These are the general kinds of Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59847:54"/>
Now to the Question, What kind of Righteousness that is, which if we hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst after, we shall be fill'd: I answer, First, That the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness here intended cannot be Judicial Righteousness, since the mere desire of Pardon or Justification is not of it self sufficient to procure it, or to avert the Sentence of Condemnation. It must therefore be <hi>Moral</hi> righteousness.</p>
                     <p>If you ask in what Sense? Whether as materially, or as formally taken? I think either Sense may be admitted. But then there will be difference in the Proposition according to the Sense presumed. For if Righteousness be here taken <hi>materially,</hi> then the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting after it will be a <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Act of the Will; but if <hi>Formally,</hi> for that Righteousness whereby a Man is formally good and vertuous, then the hungring and thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it will be a <hi>Reflex</hi> Act of the Will, that is, a Desire not of material Righteousness, but of the Love of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Righteousness, which is a Man's formal Righteousness. And this Sense of Righteousness I take to be most
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59847:54"/>
agreeable to the exigence of this place, because the desiring material Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by a direct Act of the Will actually makes a Man formally Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and so prevents and anticipates that Repletion which our Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises as a future Reward and Blessing. Whereas the desiring formal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, or the Love of material Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness by a Reflex Act, supposes the Man not yet actually Righteous, as he is also supposed in the Beatitude, and so leaves him capable of having the Promise made good to him, that he shall be filled.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Christian Righteousness, the Masters of Spiritual Life usually assign Three. By Degrees I suppose, meaning not all those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in Righteousness, whereby a Man may exceed either another, or Himself; for then they might as well have reckon'd 3000, there being an infinite Latitude in Goodness; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such Advances as imply different <hi>Periods,</hi> and distinct <hi>States</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life. These they assign to be Three, grounding this their Division upon the Authority of St. <hi>John,</hi> who,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59847:55"/>
they say, represents Christians as under a threefold State, by bespeaking them under the several Titles of <hi>Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Young Men,</hi> and <hi>Fathers.</hi> By lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, meaning young or new Converts, who must be fed with the Milk of the Word, with the plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and Principles of Christianity. By young Men those who are grown up to some strength in Holiness, and have made some Progress in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Inferiour Life. By Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, those who are arrived to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect habit of Goodness, and as far as Human Nature will admit, are fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into the Divine Life.</p>
                     <p>But I think this Computation must be retrench'd. For with all the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have I can find but three States or Degrees for the whole Moral Condition of Mankind. For all the Men in the World, and every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man in several Periods of his Life, may be reduced to one of these three Orders: Either he is one of those who do not apprehend Sin as an Evil, who either through want of understanding and reflection, have not attain'd to any sense of its Malignity, or through
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59847:55"/>
Debauchery and habitual Vicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness have lost it, and so will and choose Sin <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>intirely,</hi> with U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Consent, and without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of reluctancy, which is the most exalted pitch of Wickedness that a Creature is capable of. Or else one of those who indeed do look upon Sin as Evil, and as such nill and are averse to it; but not looking upon it always as the <hi>greatest</hi> Evil, do oftentimes nill it only imperfectly, and absolutely speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do will and choose it, to avoid (as they then think) some greater Evil. Or else lastly, one of those who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Sin not only under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Evil, but as the greatest of all Evils, nill and refuse it, not only in some certain respect, but absolutely and throroughly, so as not by any means to be persuaded to commit it.</p>
                     <p>These Three Degrees will comprize the whole Moral State of Mankind. And accordingly I observe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes mention of a three-fold Law. The first is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The Law of sin which is in the Members.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> The Second is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The Law of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>the Mind,</hi> or Conscience. The Third
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59847:56"/>
is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>The Law of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the Spirit of Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These three Laws answer exactly to the three Moral States of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Under the first Law, the Law of Sin, are those who will and embrace Sin purely and entirely. Under the Second Law, the Law of the Mind, are those who nill and stand averse to Sin in some certain respect, as Evil, but yet will and chuse it absolutely and effectually. Under the third Law, the Law of the Spirit of Life, are those who absolutely and thoroughly nill the Commission of Sin.</p>
                     <p>The first of these States is a State of meer Sin and Death, and those of this Order are they who are said to be <hi>Dead in Trespasses and Sins.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> is a State of Imperfect Life. The Third is a State of Health and Vigour. The first is a State of Rest and Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence in Sin. The Second is a state of Contention. The third is a state of Victory. In the first state the mind is laid fast in a deep sleep. In the second she is between sleeping and waking. In the third she is broad awake, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59847:56"/>
well come to her self. He that is in the first state, is born only of the Flesh, and has no higher Principle in him: He is that <hi>Animal Man</hi> that perceives <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> not the things of God. He that is in the second, has indeed some quickning Motions, some ineffective Stirrings and Endeavours of the Divine Life. But he that is in the third, is born of the Spirit and of God, and doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin, because his <hi>Seed remains in</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this Distribution of the Moral State of Man, 'tis evident that there can be but two distinct Degrees of Righteousness, or states of the Divine Life. For the first of the three (as was before remark'd) is a state of meer Death and Sin. Righteousness and Life belong only to the two latter, but with this great difference, that the first of these two Degrees, tho it has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Life and Righteousness in it, yet 'tis such as is consistent with the final and absolute Prevalency and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of sin, and consequently such as cannot qualifie a Man for Pardon, or put him into a state of Grace and Salvation. Whereas in the last, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59847:57"/>
Principle of the Divine Life is supposed to be so strong, as not only to resist, but to overcome sin. And he that is thus spiritually alive, is alive indeed, alive unto himself, and alive unto God, and if he abide in this Life, shall live for ever.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore but two such Degrees of Spiritual Life and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness as imply different states. And therefore to the Distribution of St. <hi>John</hi> my Answer is, That it must necessarily be understood not of three distinct states of Righteousness (there being no more for the whole Moral condition of Man) but of three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in one and the same general State. If it be demanded which of the two states of Righteousness that is? I answer, That St. <hi>John</hi> must be supposed to intend the last and best state, because he addresses himself to his little Children, young Men and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as those who had their <hi>Sins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them,</hi> who had <hi>overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one,</hi> and who had <hi>known the Father.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 2.12, 13.</note> All which Expressions argue one state of Grace in common between them, tho differing in Measures and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The reasonableness of which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59847:57"/>
threefold Gradation I do not think my self concern'd at present to enquire into or justifie, it being sufficient to my present purpose to have shewn that it cannot be meant of three different states of Righteousness, but only of three different degrees in the same state. The states themselves are but two.</p>
                     <p>Now to the Question, What degree or state of Righteousness that is, which if we hunger and thirst after we shall be fill'd: I answer, That it must be no other than that which puts a Man in favour with God, and qualifies him for the Mercies of the New Covenant. For if the <hi>Righteousness it self</hi> be not such as will render a Man acceptable with God, how can the <hi>Desire</hi> of it intitle him to his Promises? 'Tis a much less Worthiness to desire any Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than 'tis to have it; and how then can it be an acceptable thing to desire an unacceptable Righteousness! The Righteousnes therefore here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended must be such as makes him that has it, acceptable to God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently it can be no other but the last degree or state of Righteousness: Since nothing short of that can either
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59847:58"/>
reconcile God to Man, or make Man fit for God. And this I take to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Voice of Scripture, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of our Holy Church, which every where represents an absolute and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Love of Holiness, and the like Hatred of Sin as necessary to the state of Grace and real Regeneration.</p>
                     <p>There are, I know, some among us, who notwithstanding their usual and popular Pretence, That they differ from our Church not in any Doctrinal Points of Religion, but only about some few Ritual Observances, do yet teach very differently in this Article, setting the state of Regeneration and Sanctification so low, that a bare ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive striving against sin is reckon'd a very sufficient mark of it: Wherein they conspire with those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who make the slightest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance by the Accession of Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Absolution to be full and valid; only with this Difference, That what the one make sufficient in a certain case, and on a certain supposition, the other make sufficient universally and absolutely, requiring nothing further as of necessity to Sanctification than a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59847:58"/>
bare ineffective strife against sin. A state which a Man may be soon <hi>in,</hi> tho, according to the same Gentlemen, not so soon <hi>out.</hi> For whoever has the least sense of sin as an Evil (and certainly there are but few who have not so much) must needs be so far averse to it, and cannot possibly commit it but with some reluctance: Which yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Men, is sufficient to intitle a Man to the state and reward of Sanctification, tho at the same time he be the <hi>Servant of Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I confess is a good way to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance the Severity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probating Decrees, and to stock Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as much by one Doctrin, as they depopulate it by another. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gate of Heaven is much too strait both for this Doctrin, and for those (I will not say that hold it, but) that live by it. It is a Doctrin too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle according to Godliness to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Truth, and such as makes neither for the Honour of God, nor for the Safety of Man. But I need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it no further, it being sufficiently, exposed by our most excellent <hi>Bishop Taylor</hi> in his Preface to the Clergy of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59847:59"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> before his <hi>Unum Necessarium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All therefore that I further remark is, That since the Righteousness of the first Degree is that which these Men make sufficient for Acceptance with God, the same degree of Righteousness would I suppose according to these Men be a sufficient Title to this Beatitude. But if the last degree of Righteousness be only that which can procure us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God (as most certainly it is) then that is the only Righteousness, which if we duly hunger and thirst after, we shall be fill'd. I say, which if we duly hunger and thirst after. Which leads me in the second place to enquire what kind of Hunger and Thirst that is to which this Promise of Repletion is made.</p>
                     <p>And first, 'tis plain that Hunger and Thirst here must be taken in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and metaphorical sense; since Righteousness is not the Object of a <hi>Natural,</hi> but of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Appetite. Hunger and Thirst therefore is the same with willing or desiring. This as to the <hi>Kind.</hi> But then as to the <hi>Degree,</hi> 'tis to be consider'd, That every Good
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59847:59"/>
does as such necessarily move the Will, as every the least possible Weight moves the Scale. But it does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways move <hi>effectually,</hi> as every Weight in the Scale does not weigh it <hi>down.</hi> But however something it does to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, since otherwise as much Weight would be necessary to turn the Scale as if it had been quite empty. I shall therefore distinguish of Willing as a very contemplative Theorist does of Physical Motion, into that which is <note place="margin">Dr. Glisson de Vita Naturae, c. 19. p. 254.</note> 
                        <hi>impotent,</hi> and that which is <hi>prevalent.</hi> By Impotent willing meaning that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination or <hi>Velleity</hi> we have to every Good as such, which indeed would be Prevalent, if not out-weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Reasons of stronger moment on the other side; but being overcome by them becomes Impotent, not as to the Endeavour (for that is inseparable) but as to actual Determination. By prevalent willing, I mean such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of willing as is not a meer endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but passes into actual and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual choice: When the Moral Scale not only <hi>gravitates</hi> and presses, but weighs down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59847:60"/>
Now to the Question, Which of these Degrees of willing or desiring is here intended: I answer, the last and highest, that which is peremptory and effectual, that which passes into act, and ends in a thorough Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Will. Since nothing less can either be signify'd by such strong Metaphors as these of <hi>Hungring</hi> and <hi>Thirsting,</hi> or consist with the sincerity of a Christian Spirit. 'Tis not enough therefore to have oues face set towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to cast some amorous Glances upon the Beauty of Holiness. 'Tis not enough to have some faint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effective Wishes, some kind resentments towards Righteousness, there being but few so wretchedly wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moraliz'd as not to have some such little <hi>Velleities</hi> of being Good; and no question <hi>Balam</hi> that desired the <hi>Death,</hi> did also at <hi>this</hi> rate desire the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Righteous.</hi> But the Desire must be strong and active, vehement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, absolute and peremptory, without any Reserves or Conditions. It must bear the same proportion to the Soul, that the Keenest Hunger and Thirst does to the Body, that is, it must
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59847:60"/>
be a great deal sharper, as much as the Appetites of the Spirit are more quick and exquisite than those of the Body. It must be such a desire as our Saviour had to celebrate the Passover, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute his last Supper, when he says, <hi>With desire have I desired to eat this Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 22.15</note> 
                        <hi>with you before I suffer.</hi> Briefly, it must be such a Desire as carries in it, the full bent and stress of the Soul, such as is accompanied with the most earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and hearty endeavours, and with the most passionate and Devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Aspirations to God. Such as that of the Psalmist, <hi>O that my ways were made so direct, that I might keep thy statutes!</hi> With many more such throughout the whole 119 <hi>Psalm,</hi> which I commend to the Meditation of the Pious.</p>
                     <p>This is that Hungring and Thirsting after Righteousness intended in this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitude. And accordingly 'tis observable what <hi>Solomon</hi> in a place almost parallel to this of our Lord, says concerning the Love of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which generally in Scripture, especially in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, signifies the same with <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. My Son, if thou wilt receive my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59847:61"/>
words, and hide my commandments with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; yea, if thou criest after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and liftest up thy voice for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of thy God.</hi> Here the Wise Man makes the most searching Diligence, and the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertion of Soul necessary to the finding of Wisdom. And he that so seeks her shall find her. Which brings me in the last place to make good the Proposition it self, That those who do thus hunger and thirst after Righteousness shall be fill'd.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed to this, I beg leave by way of Digression to speak something of another sort of Hunger and Thirst which all Christians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to have. Our Saviour tells us, that <hi>Except a man eat the flesh of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 53.</note> 
                        <hi>son of man, and drink his blood, he has no life in him.</hi> Now if the Flesh and Blood of our Lord be necessary to the <hi>Life,</hi> then certainly the Hungring and Thirsting after it is necessary to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59847:61"/>
Health and good Habit of a Christian. There is not a more open Sign of a distemper'd Constitution either in the <hi>Natural,</hi> or in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man, than either to long for what is not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Food, or not to have an Appetite for that which is. And therefore since the Body and Blood of Christ is the proper Food and Aliment of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, it concerns him as he values the Health and prosperous State of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life, not only to feed upon it, but to keep up in himself a due <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> after it.</p>
                     <p>More especially this he ought to do, when-ever he approaches the Holy Altar to partake of this Divine and Heavenly Feast. He ought then by all the Arts of the Spirit, and by all the Methods of Grace, to quicken and raise this Hunger, and set an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Thirst. St. <hi>Austin</hi> discoursing of the Disposions of a Worthy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant reckons this <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and makes them as Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Qualifications as any. And there is a great deal of reason for it. This Holy Sacrament is generally set out in Scripture by meat and Drink. 'Tis
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59847:62"/>
call'd expresly by the name of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> And, says our Saviour to the Jews, <hi>My flesh is meat indeed,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                        <hi>and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> And as 'tis <hi>expressed,</hi> so also was it <hi>prefigur'd</hi> by Types of the like nature, such as the Tree of Life in the midst of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, the Bread and Wine of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeck,</hi> the Manna, the Paschal Lamb, the Shew-bread, the Bread where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Angel fed the Prophet, and particularly by the Waters springing out of the Rock, whereof the Fathers drank in the Wilderness.</p>
                     <p>Now I consider that as these Figures represent the Nature and Efficacy of the Holy Sacrament, that 'tis the Food of the Soul, and the Life and Strength of the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> so they do also represent to us our <hi>Duty,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Measure and Argument of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: For if Meat and Drink be the Entertainment, what more convenient Preparation than <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst?</hi> We ought indeed to come to these Springs of Salvation, as the Hart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to do by the Psalmist to the Water-brooks, panting and thirsty, longing and impatient. Or rather, to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59847:62"/>
use a nearer Emblem, as those thirsty <hi>Israelites</hi> did to the Waters that issued out of that Mystic Rock in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. 'Tis impossible to give a just Description of this <hi>Sacramental Thirst;</hi> but if we could but so far advance our Fancy, as to represent to our selves with what eagerness and greediness those thirsty and scorch'd Travellers in the Wilderness did apply their Mouths to the springing Stone, that was now more indear'd to them by the <hi>Benefit</hi> than by the <hi>Miracle,</hi> then and then only may we have some Notion of that Hunger and Thirst wherewith we are to approach and receive these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries. For if that Rock and miraculous Water was a Type of our Sacrament (as the Apostle assures us it was, telling us expresly that that Rock was Christ) then by the like <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.4.</note> proportion that <hi>Thirst</hi> was also a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of our Duty, a signification of our <hi>Sacramental Thirst.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as he that will come to this Divine Feast must come Hungry and Thirsty; so he that is truly Hungry and Thirsty as he ought, will be sure to come, and not (as too many do)
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59847:63"/>
study to find out Pretences to excuse his Absense. But why do I say <hi>Study</hi> to find Excuses? There are some Men that will be hinder'd by <hi>any</hi> thing; nay, by <hi>every</hi> thing. There <hi>is</hi> nothing, there <hi>can</hi> be nothing so little and inconsiderable, but what will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some Men from the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That which would not hinder them from any thing else, things of much lighter Weight than what were pretended by those in the Parable, the buying of a Farm, or the Trying of a Yoke of Oxen, or the Marrying of a Wife. If the Heavens do but frown, or if they themselves are never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of humour; if a Visit be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day after, or if a Domestick Jar happen'd a day before, then presently keep off from the Sacrament. Nay, some are so very absurd, that tho they themselves are in perfect Charity with all the World, and have not the least Tincture of the old Leven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, yet if <hi>another</hi> Person happen to be out with <hi>them,</hi> they shall think this a sufficient Warrant to stay away from the Sacrament; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to as much as if a Man should say, Because another Person has sinn'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59847:63"/>
against God and my self, and so be sure to out-do him.</p>
                     <p>But there is a degree of Folly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this. There are some that cover over this gross Neglect, which comes the nearest of any thing to what the Apostle calls <hi>Trampling upon the blood of the covenant,</hi> and <hi>doing despite to the spirit of grace,</hi> with the specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Reverence.</hi> They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth so profound a Reverence for the Holy Sacrament, that they can't find in their Hearts to come to it. A very odd way of expressing Reverence to any Divine Institution by turning ones Back upon it. This is such a Reverence as the Jews pretend towards the <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton,</hi> or Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which consists in their never using it. Such a Reverence (if so much) as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists shew to the Host when they carry it in Procession to be gazed upon and stared at. But do these Men indeed Reverence the Sacrament? Then one would expect at least that when-ever they <hi>do</hi> come, they should behave themselves there with more Devotion and Reverence, than others that are more constant. But there is nothing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59847:64"/>
like this to be observ'd. Nor do I at all wonder at it, since the way to Communicate well, is to Communicate often. And I further remark, That those who behave themselves most <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently</hi> at all other parts of Divine Worship, are the very Men that stay most away from the Holy Altar upon the pretence of <hi>Reverence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how comes it to pass that <hi>this</hi> is the only part of Religion that must be neglected upon the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence? Do they do so by any <hi>other</hi> part of Religion? 'Tis true indeed that all the other parts of Divine Worship are too much neglected as well as this; but I do not find that ever any were so absurd as to pretend <hi>Reverence</hi> for the neglecting of <hi>them,</hi> and why then should they do it here?</p>
                     <p>But do these Men indeed Reverence the Holy Sacrament? Why then do they not pay some regard to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> it self, as well as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of it? <hi>Do this,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</hi> Why should all the Reverence be fixed upon <hi>This,</hi> and none upon <hi>Do?</hi> Or if they do Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59847:64"/>
the <hi>Command,</hi> how are they not affraid of breaking it? Or how can a Command be reverenc'd by not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving it? <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> If the doing this be in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our Saviour, then the not doing it is to forget him. And how can he pretend Reverence to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> that forgets the <hi>Author</hi> of it?</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but take notice of another gross Notion that I find passes very current among common People. They think all the danger lies in coming unprepared. If they eat and drink unworthily, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Death and Damnation. But if they stay away, all is safe and well. As if a Man might not destroy himself with <hi>Fasting,</hi> as well as by taking <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> These Men ought to consider that there is such a thing as an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Non-Communicant,</hi> as well as an <hi>Unworthy Communicant.</hi> And I wish they would read a certain Book that bears that Title, <hi>The Unworthy Non-Communicant.</hi> They would then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be sensible of some other Danger, besides that of coming without suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Preparation. In themean time all
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59847:65"/>
that I shall further say to those Men, is, That what-ever Pretences they make to Christianity, 'tis certain they have not that <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst</hi> which is so necessary to the Life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and which, if they had it, would bring them oftner to this Spiritual Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, and procure them the Blessing of being <hi>fill'd</hi> and Replenish'd. To the consideration of which I now return.</p>
                     <p>Now there are two ways of being fill'd. Either <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Simply,</hi> so as not to be any more in Desires. Or with respect to some <hi>certain</hi> Object, so as not to desire any more of the <hi>same,</hi> tho simply speaking you do <hi>desire</hi> still. The first of these is <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Satiety.</hi> And those that duely hunger and thirst after Righteousness, shall be filled both ways. That is, they shall be fill'd with <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and they shall be fill'd with <hi>Happiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, They shall be filled with <hi>Righteousness.</hi> For since the Spirit of <note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> God, which sheds his Love abroad in our Hearts, is a good and loving Spirit, and knows no other Bounds in his Communications than what are set him
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59847:65"/>
by the Capacity of the Subject, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that he will not fail to replenish all those with his Graces, who are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualify'd to receive them. But now nothing can be supposed to be a greater Qualification, than such Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and Thirsting as I have described. This is the utmost Man can do to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself for the reception of the Divinest Impressions. This therefore is that Sacred Lure, that powerful Charm, which draws down the Holy Spirit into the Hearts of Men, as the <hi>Platonists</hi> say of aptly disposed matter, that it <hi>sucks</hi> a Soul into it by a kind of Natural <hi>Magick</hi> from the World of Life. This Hunger and Thrist after Righteousness is the very same to the Life of the Soul, as that <hi>Organical Apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is to the Life of the Body. 'Tis the <hi>Congruity</hi> of the Soul in order to Spiritual Life. That Soul therefore that is so qualify'd for Righteousness, cannot miss according to the Order of Grace of being fill'd with it.</p>
                     <p>The short is, God desires the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Man more than Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self does or can do; he delights to see his own Image reflect from him, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59847:66"/>
stands ready to sow the Seeds of the Divine Life in every capable Soil; and therefore we need not doubt but that the truly Hungry and Thirsty Soul shall be fill'd with the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and <note place="margin">Psal. 23.</note> with the <hi>Waters of Comfort.</hi> Not that he shall be so fill'd with Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this Life, as not to desire any more of it, (for we are now in a state of Proficiency, not of Perfection) but in the next he shall. He shall then be so replenish'd with it, as not to desire any one further degree of it, and shall be perfectly possessed of that Divine Life and Nature, whereof he is now only Partaker.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, These hungry and thirsty Souls shall be fill'd with <hi>Happiness.</hi> This is a certain Consequent of the other, there being both a <hi>Natural</hi> and an <hi>Establish'd</hi> Connexion between Righteousness and Happiness. Some indeed have gone so far as to make them one and the same as to <hi>Kind,</hi> and distinguishable only as to <hi>Degree.</hi> Hence that common Theological Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fate, <hi>Grace is Glory begun, and Glory is only Grace finish'd.</hi> But I think there is more prettiness in the Expression, than
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59847:66"/>
truth in the Notion; nay, there is one Instance which plainly demonstrates it to be false: For 'tis most certain that the Human Soul of our Saviour was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a state of <hi>perfect Grace,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the Scripture says, received the Spirit of God without measure; and yet 'tis as certain that he was not while on Earth in the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> being then a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief. Much less was he in the state of Glory at the hour of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and during his dreadful Derelicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which yet could never be, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Grace and Glory were as some contend, one and the same thing.</p>
                     <p>But our Proposition will stand well enough without the help of this Notion. For tho Righteousness be not the same thing with Happiness, yet there is such a Connexion between them, that they who are fill'd with the former, shall certainly be so with the latter. And this depends upon the nature of things, as well as upon the Order of God. For a Righteous Frame of Spirit not only gives us Admission to the Supreme Good, but also disposes us for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, without which all the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59847:67"/>
other Materials of Happiness would signifie nothing. 'Tis the disposition of the Soul that makes the Vision of God truly <hi>Beatific,</hi> and when we <hi>awake</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 117.16.</note> 
                        <hi>up after his likeness, and behold his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in righteousness,</hi> then and then only, we shall be <hi>satisfy'd</hi> with his Glory.</p>
                     <p>And here we may stand still a little, and reflect what a great Priviledg those that hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, have beyond all those who make secular and carnal things the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Desire. These things can never fill them <hi>Absolutely,</hi> so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish all Desire, being neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Good of Man, nor leading to that which is. Nor can they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways satisfie that <hi>particular</hi> Appetite which is conversant about them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times because the things themselves cannot be had, Nature having not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided enough for the Covetousness and Luxury, tho she has for the Necessities of Men. And sometimes because they are too deficient when we have them, by reason of their disproportion to the inlargement of the Faculty, as in the Objects of <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59847:67"/>
neither the <hi>Eye</hi> nor <hi>Ear</hi> is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, as was remark'd before. And when these things <hi>do</hi> fill any particular Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, 'tis only for a time, till the next Fit of Longing comes, as the ground is for the present refresh'd with a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient Sh owr. But for those that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst after <hi>Righteousness,</hi> as their Desires are more Noble, so their Satisfaction shall be more Abundant. 'Tis their great and peculiar Blessedness to be fill'd in all Senses, and in all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and to all Eternity.</p>

                     <p>OF all the Passions which God has planted in Human Nature, there is none which at once carries so bright a resemblance of <hi>God,</hi> and is so fitted to the present Condition of <hi>Man,</hi> as that of Pitifulness and Compassion. And if when God made Man, he consulted his own Eternal Essence, certainly when he drew this part of him, we may suppose him to have reflected upon the Divinest of all his Ideas, and to have stamp'd upon him the most Lovely Feature of the Divinity.</p>
                     <p>All the other Passions are in their own simple Natures indifferent, neither good nor evil in themselves, but equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable to either, and for the most
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59847:68"/>
part are actually determin'd to the wrong. They are generally irregular, either in the Degree, or in the Object, are either mis-govern'd or mis-plac'd; and when most orderly manag'd, the highest Character they can pretend to, is only to be Instruments and Servants to Vertue. They are as a gusty Wind and Sail to a Ship; if she steer right, they prosper and further her course; but if wrong, they serve only to strike her against the Rocks with more Speed and Force.</p>
                     <p>But now this Affection of Pity and Compassion rises higher than Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and is not content with a bare state of Innocence. It is of it self a vertuous Disposition, and needs only actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion to make it a Direct Vertue, and then its own Native Excellency will place it among the highest Orders. And therefore tho our Saviour by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming our intire Nature, justify'd the innocency of <hi>all</hi> our Natural Passions, yet as <hi>Mercy</hi> was that Attribute of God which he came chiefly to display, so is <hi>that</hi> the Affection which he chiefly commends to Man, by his Practice, and by his Discourses, by open Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59847:69"/>
and by Parabolical Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but chiefly by selecting and adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this alone of all the Passions into the Sacred Number of his <hi>few</hi> Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, by telling us, that, <hi>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This great and peculiar Honour done by our Lord to this Affection will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to consider,</p>
                     <p>First, The Nobleness and Excellency of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Its great Reasonableness and Usefulness.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The particular Blessedness assign'd to it.</p>
                     <p>But before we can well enter upon these Considerations, we must first premise something concerning the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mercy or Compassion. By which I suppose is commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood a trouble or uneasiness of Spirit, conceiv'd at some Evil that has befall'n another, with a desire to help him out of it; whereby it may be perceiv'd that this is a mixt Passion, compounded of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Desire.</hi> Sorrow for the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59847:69"/>
Evil of the Patient, and Desire of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him from it.</p>
                     <p>If it be askt, What kind of Evil that must be, which is the Object of this Sorrow, or which may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Man to our Pity, I know no reason why we should except against any. There are I know some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Divines and Moralists (among whom is <hi>Curcellaeus</hi>) who will allow no <note place="margin">Pag. 999.</note> other Evil to be capable of Pity, but only Evil of <hi>Pain,</hi> nor that neither if it be <hi>deserv'd.</hi> But for my part, I do not understand why <hi>Sin</hi> may not fall under our Pity, as well as any other Evil. Nay, I think that the greatest Object of Pity in the World is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable Sinner. And as for <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> tho the thing it self be most pitiable when joyn'd with Innocence: Yet I think upon the <hi>whole,</hi> the Guilty Sufferer is more to be pitied than the Innocent, since I can pity him for his Demerit, and for his Misery too; whereas the latter is pitiable only for his Misery. Indeed the guilty Patient is not to be pitied so much for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Misery, because he deserves it, but then he is more to be pitied for his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59847:70"/>
Desert and Misery together, than the other is for his Misery only. And I question not but that our compassionate Saviour when he wept over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> relented as much for the <hi>Sins,</hi> as for the <hi>Vengeance</hi> that was hanging over that unhappy City. And that had those two great Tragic Scenes been at once presented before him, the <hi>Slaughter</hi> of the <hi>Innocents,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of that <hi>Guilty People,</hi> he would have found more to be pitied in the latter, than in the former Tragedy.</p>
                     <p>I know that by the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Laws, 'twas forbidden to shew any Signs of Compassion in the behalf of those that suffer'd as <hi>Criminals,</hi> and in consequence to this they were not to <hi>Sit,</hi> (that being the Manner and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the Hebrew and Roman Mourning) but to <hi>Stand</hi> at their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Which was the Reason (as a <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in his Notes and Observ. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> Learned Critic of our Church observes) why the Blessed Virgin tho deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for the severe Usages of her Son, yet in compliance with the Law, chose rather to <hi>Stand,</hi> than to <hi>Sit</hi> near the Cross; and tho' full of inward Grief,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59847:70"/>
refused to make any <hi>Solemn</hi> shew of Lamentation.</p>
                     <p>But I suppose that the signification of these Laws in forbidding open Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to convicted Malefactors, was not, that they were not Objects capable of it, and that therefore to pity them would argue a sense of their Innocence, but only to procure the greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Judicial Sentences, and to shew their great satisfaction and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escence in the administration of Justice. This therefore will not exclude Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals from the Sphere of our Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of which I see nothing that should make them uncapable. And I would fain know what would have become of all Mankind, if <hi>Suffering Innocence</hi> had been the only Object of Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seration.</p>
                     <p>These few things being premised concerning the Notion of Mercy and Compassion, let us now consider the things that recommend it. The first whereof is, The Nobleness and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it. This has suffer'd much under the misrepresentation of two sorts of Adversaries, the <hi>Stoic,</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59847:71"/>
the <hi>Aristotelean.</hi> In the Stoic Morality it is so far from having any Reputation for Excellence, that it passes for a down-right Vice, for an instance of weakness and littleness of Soul, for such a piece of Softness and Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as does not comport with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their <hi>Wise Man;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is allowed to <hi>Relieve,</hi> but not to be <hi>Troubled</hi> for the Afflicted, and to add, if he can, to the Tranquility of <hi>their</hi> Minds, but not to lose any thing of his <hi>own. Non miserebitur, sed succurret,</hi> says <hi>Seneca.</hi> He may help the Miserable, but he must not share in the Misery. This the Gravity of <hi>Zeno</hi>'s School will at no hand permit, which indeed should make us the more beholden to them for granting what they do. But 'tis no wonder that they who will not allow a Man to be sensible of his <hi>own</hi> Evils, should forbid all Pity to those of <hi>other</hi> Men.</p>
                     <p>On the other side the <hi>Aristotelean,</hi> tho he does not strike this Affection out of the List of the Vertues, as does the other, yet he very much cheapens and depreciates the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it, by deriving it only from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59847:71"/>
selfish Principles, by making this the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground of pitying others, that we upon the account of common Nature and Chance, are obnoxious to the same Evils our selves.</p>
                     <p>In opposition therefore to this Double Reproach I shall maintain and illustrate the Nobleness and Excellency of this Disposition upon this Double Ground.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Because 'tis found always in the Best of Natures.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Because it proceeds from the best of Principles.</p>
                     <p>And First, 'Tis always found in the Best of Natures. God as he is the Best, so is he also the most Merciful and Compassionate of all Beings. 'Twas the very Name whereby he proclaim'd himself to <hi>Moses, The Lord, the Lord</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6</note> 
                        <hi>God, merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. And our Saviour commends this Attribute of God in particular to our Imitation, <hi>Be ye merciful as your Father is merciful.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 6.36.</note> We read in Scripture of the <hi>Tender Mercies</hi> of God, or as it may be more strictly render'd, The <hi>Bowels</hi> of the <note place="margin">Luk. 1.78.</note>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:59847:72"/>
Mercy of God. There is a strange Emphasis and Strength in the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And indeed there is nothing in Scripture so pathetically expressed as the Tenderness and Mercy of God. 'Twould be endless to alledge Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but there is one place which may go for all. 'Tis that famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation of God with himself upon the disingenuous Behaviour of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Israel, <hi>How shall I give thee up</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im? <hi>How shall I deliver thee</hi> Israel? <hi>How shall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>How</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hos. 11.8.</note> 
                        <hi>shall I set thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>Mine heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled together.</hi> What moving, melting strains are these! What a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, breathing Image of Mercy and Pity! And yet 'tis but an <hi>Image</hi> still, vastly short of the Original, as will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be, what-ever is said or thought of the infinite Mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Talmud</hi> speaking concerning the Employment of God before the making of the World, say, not as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that he was preparing an Hell for the Inquisitive, but that he was contriving how to be <hi>merciful</hi> to Mankind. And 'tis true indeed God
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59847:72"/>
did from all Eternity contrive to shew Mercy to Man, tho not by way of study or imployment of mind, as they grosly fancy.</p>
                     <p>But the Hebrews further Note (what indeed is more considerable) that God to shew his great Honour and Love for this dear Attribute, in all his kind and merciful Transactions with Men, chose always to be call'd by that his great and incommunicable Name, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> as to <hi>Moses</hi> in the Clift of the Rock, <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. But in any Process of Justice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he always styles himself <hi>Eloah,</hi> or <hi>Elohim,</hi> a Name importing Force and Power, and that is not proper to God as the other, but common to him with the Creatures, being sometimes given to the Angels, sometimes to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and sometimes even to False Gods. The Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> was more Sacred, and of higher import than that of <hi>Elohim;</hi> and therefore God to shew his special regard to Mercy above his other <hi>Strange Work,</hi> chose in his Milder Addresses to be call'd by the former, and in his severer Proceedings
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59847:73"/>
by the latter. Which was the reason, (as the forementioned Learned Critick remarks, why our Saviour at the point of his Dereliction cried out, not, <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>Eli, Eli, my God, my God,</hi> as not presuming at that time and in that Capacity, to call God by his Titles of Paternal Love and Indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as <hi>Naming the Judge of the World doing the extreamest right upon his own Son, treading the Wine-press alone in the person of all mankind,</hi> as that Learned Author expresses it. <note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the greatest and most convincing Demonstration of the Mercy of God, is seen in the mysterious and costly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Laps'd Man. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Exaltation of which is to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but, as the Angels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to do in Heaven, to stoop down and look near into it with silence and wonder. <hi>Which things the Angels</hi>

                        <hi>desire to look into.</hi> An Allusion no doubt to the Propitiatory or Mercy-lid upon the Ark, whereupon two Angels, <hi>Cherubins,</hi> (who are the Angels of <hi>Knowledge</hi>) did abide with their Faces one toward another, and their Eyes bent down to the Ark. Which by the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59847:73"/>
way is also a sufficient Argument of the Unfathomableness of this great Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Mercy, which can still find further Employment for the Study and Curiosity even of Angels.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps 'twill be said, that Mercy in <hi>God</hi> is of another kind than what is call'd by that Name in <hi>Man,</hi> that it comes nearer the Stoical Notion of Mercy, importing only a bare Will to help the Miserable, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Resentment for his Misery. It may be so, I wont dispute that now, tho I can hardly believe but that such strong and flaming Expressions of the Divine Mercy in Scripture must needs signifie something more than what such <hi>cold</hi> Interpreters affix to them.</p>
                     <p>But however to be more convincing, I further instance in the Human Soul of our Saviour Jesus Christ. 'Tis most certain that of all Human Spirits his was the most excellent. <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocence was not comparable to him. He was excellent only by way of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but our Saviour's Human Spirit to the same or greater Excellence of Nature had also superadded the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59847:74"/>
of Grace, not common Grace, but that great and transcendent Grace of the Hypostatick Union. And 'tis as certain that as he had the <hi>Best,</hi> so he had the <hi>Best-natured</hi> and most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly compassionate Soul in the World. I need not produce Instances, his whole Life is but one Argument of it. Only one Passage, when he saw the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude scattered abroad like Sheep that have no Shepherd, 'tis said, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>He was moved with compassion</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 9.36.</note> 
                        <hi>on them,</hi> so we render it; but indeed the Expression is too high and pregnant to be verbally translated. 'Twould require a long copious Paraphrase to drain the Sense of that one Word, which signifies all that inward Feeling and Yerning of the Heart and Soul at a pitiful Object, that melts and turns the very Bowels of the Good-natured Spectator.</p>
                     <p>And the same Tenderness of Spirit which he had on Earth, he retains still in Heaven, tho in all other respects <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible,</hi> and incircled with Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Whereupon he is call'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our <hi>merciful High-Priest;</hi> and to convince any Opposer that this is not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59847:74"/>
meant of Mercy improperly so called, a bare Will to help without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate resentment, says the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, We have not an High-Priest which cannot be touch'd with feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> 
                        <hi>of our Infirmities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And these two Considerations by the way give a clear defeat to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of both the foremention'd Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. For whereas the <hi>Stoic</hi> traduces this noble Vertue for a piece of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Infirmity, fit only for soft and effeminate Persons; to him I oppose the instance of our Saviour's Human Soul while on <hi>Earth.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> makes the only ground of Pity to be a fear of falling into the like Calamity; to him I oppose the same Instance of our Saviour, but in <hi>another Capacity,</hi> when he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impassible in his glorify'd State, and above the possibility of partaking with us in our Miseries any other way, than by <hi>Sympathy</hi> and Compassion.</p>
                     <p>To this I may add, that among <hi>meer</hi> Men the most generous and braveSpirits, those whom <hi>Paganism</hi> has Deifi'd, and Christianity has Sainted; those Heroes
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59847:75"/>
whom History has mark'd with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and whom Envy it self is asham'd to calumniate, have all along been sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for their <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Good Nature.</hi> As on the contrary, the most base, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous and low-spirited Breasts are always observ'd to be the Seats of <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty</hi> and Hard-heartedness.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis no wonder that this Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is found in the Best of Natures, since in the Second Place it proceeds from the Best of Principles. For it proceeds from <hi>Charity,</hi> with which the least thing a Man can think or do is excellent, and without which the greatest, even <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> it self, is nothing worth. It has that for its Parent, which is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Vertues, and which is of it self the fulfilling of the most perfect, that is, of the <hi>Christian</hi> Law. And that it proceeds from Charity is plain. For the more we desire the Happiness and well-being of Mankind, the more we shall be troubled to see any of them in Misery, and be the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to procure them Ease and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And this tho we do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our selves in danger of the like Calamity, there being no necessity
<pb facs="tcp:59847:75"/>
of making that the ground of Pity, as appears from the instance of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Human Soul in its Glorified State. I deny not but that the generality of Men <hi>are</hi> moved to Pity upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of common Danger, and that it may be their own turn next to suffer and stand in need of help; but it is not necessary that they <hi>should,</hi> and 'tis their imperfection that they <hi>are.</hi> I say <hi>their</hi> Imperfection, not that of the <hi>Affection</hi> it self, whose Idea involves no such selfish Principle, and which may really be separated from it, as by the fore-alledged Example is certain and evident.</p>
                     <p>And now if to be found in the Best of Natures, and to proceed from the Best of Principles, be any Argument of Excellence, we may hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what a Noble and Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Mind this is, and that when the <hi>Roman Orator</hi> told <hi>Caesar,</hi> That of all his many Vertues, none was either more acceptable, or more wonderful than his Mercy and Clemency; he might perhaps Complement the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> but said nothing extraordinary of the Vertue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="tcp:59847:76"/>
As will further appear by considering Secondly the great Reasonableness and Usefulness of it. As to the Former, besides that all that which may be said in the behalf of Charity and Universal Love, may be alledged as well for this, there are these two more proper and peculiar Grounds to prove and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. To consider what Man has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. To consider what he Expects.</p>
                     <p>And First, If we consider what Man has already <hi>receiv'd,</hi> this Vertue of Mercy will appear to be highly reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Man has receiv'd innumerable Mercies of God, some of which are so great, so surprizing and incredible, that 'tis made one of the greatest Trials and Commendations of his Faith to <hi>believe</hi> them. Such as the Honour of the Hypostatick Union, the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Sin and Misery by the Death of the Son of God, the Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the like. All which are yet improv'd and heightned by this further Consideration, that they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59847:76"/>
are proper and peculiar to him, no other Creatures, not so much as the Angels themselves being Partakers with him. The Angels indeed as all other Creatures, partake of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God; but Man alone among all the Creatures has the Priviledge to be the Object of his Mercy. Since therefore Man and Man only has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd so much Mercy of God, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very reasonable that he of all Creatures should shew Mercy.</p>
                     <p>As it will Secondly, if we consider what he <hi>expects.</hi> Man has not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so much mercy, but that he expects more. The Mercy that he has receiv'd is by the Redemption of Christ to be put into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of Salvation, but the Mercy that he expects is to be <hi>actually</hi> saved. The Court of Mercy is the only Court where Man dares ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, or can abide a Trial. Briefly, Man expects Mercy both from God and from Man, in this Life, and in the next, in Death and after Death, and therefore there is great reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he of all Creatures should be merciful, and that <hi>Cruelty</hi> was as little <hi>made for Man</hi> as <hi>Pride.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:59847:77"/>
Nor is this Affection less Useful than Reasonable. The condition of Man in this World is such, as makes it as necessary for him to be <hi>pitiful,</hi> as to be a <hi>sociable</hi> Creature. Man cannot subsist without the Guardianship and Protection of Society; nor is Society any Security without this Affection. For what signifies Strength and Ability (and Society as such infers no more) without Inclination to assist? The Wise Man tells us that <hi>Wisdom is better than</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Strength,</hi> and 'tis very true; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, nor both of them sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing without a tender and compassionate Temper. Then only may we expect Happiness and Defence from Society, when there is the same Sympathy in the Politick as there is in the Natural Body, when there is a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Correspondency and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parts, like the Sympathetick Answer of one Lute to another. When the <hi>Heaven hears the Earth</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Phrase; or as the Apostle more fully expresses it, when <hi>If one member</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member be honour'd, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> This would make a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59847:77"/>
                        <hi>Millennium</hi> indeed; nor is any thing further wanting, but only that Men would agree together to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
                     <p>And now if this Divine Affection (for so we may now venture to call it) be not yet sufficiently recommended from its Nobleness and Excellency, and from its great Reasonableness and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, let us further add the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Blessedness here assigned to it. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the merciful,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>for they shall obtain mercy.</hi> This they shall obtain from Men and from God, here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>First, They shall obtain Mercy from Men here. Not that this is to pass for an Absolute Rule, without any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since as long as Men are but Men, Mercy is capable of being abused and ill-requited, as well as any other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; otherwise our Saviour would have been more kindly treated than he was by the Jews. But the meaning is, that nothing does more naturally recommend a Man to the good Will and Compassion of others, than a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and Benign Temper, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59847:78"/>
speaking, if Men be but tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well disposed, and have any Sense of Justice and Gratitude, the merciful Man will actually find Mercy amon them. However if not, he has the greater stock of Mercy to come. For,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Merciful shall obtain Mercy from God hereafter. And this does not depend upon so many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties, and such uncertain Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the other. Here 'tis only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that <hi>Mercy and Truth meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and that the Man be sincere and upright in all other moral respects. And so much indeed is necessary. For 'tis not to be thought that Mercy alone, any more than any other Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vertue can qualifie a Man for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. No, the Man must be <gap reason="foreign">

Only there may I think be allow'd this further Sense in the Proposition, that no <hi>one</hi> Vertue shall go so far towards the obtaining of full Mercy from God, as this of merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And that if the merciful Man
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59847:78"/>
for want of other necessary parts of Christian Perfection, should not be able to <hi>stand</hi> in the last Judgment, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Fall shall be much the milder, and he shall have great Abatements of Punishment made him for the sake of this one Excellency.

                     <p>One way or other therefore the merciful shall be sure to obtain Mercy, nor will God forget this <hi>Labour of Love.</hi> Pray God we may not forget it our selves, but may so love, study and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise mercy here, that we may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after not only receive a milder Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but find such a Degree of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as may finally <hi>rejoyce against Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

                     <p>ONE of the most distinguishing Perfections of the Christian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution above any other either Divine or Human, is, that it requires an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rectitude of Mind and Spirit, and makes the <hi>Heart</hi> the Principle and Seat of Spiritual, as it is of Natural Life. The <hi>Heathen Morality</hi> went little further than the regulation of the outward Behaviour, not much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sanctity of the <hi>Interiour.</hi> And tho some few raised Spirits among them, moved by a Diviner Impulse, would now and then, like men in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, talk above the World and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too, recommending certain <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> and <hi>Purifications</hi> of Soul, as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platonists,</hi> yet this
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59847:79"/>
was not taught or known in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Schools of Nature, nor was it any where made the Ordinary Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Morality.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> as it presented to the World a second and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Edition of the Law of Nature, so was it in this particular respect more perfect than the Gentile Morality, there being in the Moral Law <hi>one</hi> special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which directly concerns <hi>Purity</hi> of Heart. But yet there was a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect even here too, because tho there was a Prohibition of <hi>inward Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> yet it had no penal Sanction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to it. Every other Precept was so guarded as to be able to revenge it self upon those who transgressed it. Idolatry was punish'd, Perjury was punish'd, Profanation of the Sabbath, Disobedience to Parents, Murther, Adultery, Theft, and bearing false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were all punish'd, only Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence had no Punishment allotted to it. Which (as a Learned Person Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures) gave some occasion to think <note place="margin">Philippus a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borch The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olog. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, P. 217.</note> that they might securely indulge their Concupiscence, so it did not break forth into the outward and grosser act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59847:80"/>
Certain it is, that many among the Jews so thought and practis'd, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with external Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law, without any regard to the inward Purity and Holiness, as may appear from our Saviours frequent reprehensions of the Pharisees upon this very account. And 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this their Fancy was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by there being no Punishment assign'd to the Breach of the <hi>Tenth</hi> Commandment, as that Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son conjectures. However 'tis certain that it was a great Defect in the Law not to bind so perfect a Precept with a Penal Sanction. Tho indeed the true reason was, because 'twas too perfect to be severely exacted in that Infant Age and state of the Church. The Law therefore did not rigidly <hi>exact</hi> it, tho it did plainly <hi>command</hi> it. Which tho no defect with relation to that Time and State, (the Law being as perfect as the Gospel, as to all the ends and purposes intended by it, and every way accommodated to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those on whom it was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) yet absolutely speaking it was a great Defect and Imperfection of the Law.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:59847:80"/>
Then as to the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion (which indeed is only Heathenism pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Revelation) this tho the last, and assuming to it self the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all that went before, is yet really short even of Heathenism it self. This is so far from requiring internal Purity, that it does not require so much as external, but allows and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends</hi> too the grossest Impurities; which has often made me wonder why the <hi>Turk</hi> should write upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of his Alcoran, <hi>Let no Man touch this Book, but he that is pure.</hi> I'm sure the Book it self requires no such thing, nor can I justifie the Reason of the <hi>Motto</hi> in any other sense but this, That none but he that is pure is fit to be trusted with such a corrupt Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                     <p>But the Christian Law is <hi>pure</hi> indeed, and none but such as are so are worthy to unloose the Seals of this Book. This requires the utmost Purity that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Measures of Mortality, Purity without, and Purity within, pure Hands and pure Hearts. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it more expresly, and in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59847:81"/>
degree, than either the Heathen or Jewish Religion, and (what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the other) under the Sanction of Rewards and Punishments, and those the greatest imaginable. It does not only command inward Purity, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it too by the strongest Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals that can affect either the <hi>Sense</hi> or the <hi>Reason</hi> of Man. One of the greatest of which Encouragements is, that our Saviour inserts it into the order of his Beatitudes, and gives it a special Title to the Beatifick Vision in these Words, <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Subject to be here discours'd of is <hi>Christian Purity,</hi> or Purity of <hi>Heart.</hi> Whereof I shall represent</p>
                     <p n="1">I. The Nature, by a Character or Description.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Necessity.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The Blessedness.</p>
                     <p>By Purity of Heart in general, is to be understood an inward Conformity of all the Thoughts and Desires of the Soul to the Will and Law of God. When not only the external Actions
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59847:81"/>
are according to the Rule, but the whole inward Frame and <hi>Position</hi> of the Mind stands right and well order'd, and (as the Apostle describes it) not <note place="margin">Thess. 5.23.</note> only the Body, but the <hi>whole Spirit and Soul is blameless.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to make it so, these two things are particularly requisite, First, That we do not consent to any unlawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, no not so much as to the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sin, whether proceeding from the corruptness of our own Nature, or from Diabolical Suggestion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That we do not entertain with any delight the remembrances of our past Sins.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly yet, Purity of Heart may be doubly consider'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in opposition to <hi>Pollution,</hi> or in opposition to <hi>Mixture.</hi> In the first Sense it removes Sensuality, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Hypocrisie. This distinction of the Word Pure is acknowledg'd and withal applied to this place by our Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> illustrated by <note place="margin">Pract. Cat. p. 107.</note> the Instances of Water and Wine, the former of which is said to be pure,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59847:82"/>
when not mudded or defiled; the latter when not mixt.</p>
                     <p>But tho the Word be equally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this Latter Sense, yet I do not think it to be at all intended by our Saviour in this place, there being no such particular Congruity between this sort of Purity and the nature of the Reward here assign'd. Confining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Discourse to the former Sense of the Word, as more suitable to the Circumstance of this place, from what has been premised, we may collect this Idea or Character of the Pure in Heart, <q>That they are such as regulate not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the external Conduct of their Lives, but also the inward Frame and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their Minds, and conform not only their Actions, but their Wills and Desires, Thoughts and Designs to the Rule of the Law, and to the Dictates of the <hi>Internal Light</hi> of God in the Soul. Such as sanctifie the Lord God in their Hearts, compose the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most recesses of their minds into an Holy Awe and Reverence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Presence, set a Law to all their Intellectual Powers, and suffer not the least Thought or Passion to violate
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59847:82"/>
the Order either of Reason or Grace. Such lastly as yield no consent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Being or Stay of irregular Motions, nor give any entertainment to the Allurements of the World, the Flesh, or the Devil, nor delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with any pleasing recollections, any imaginary Scenes of their past Immoralities, but set themselves at the greatest distance from sin, resist the very first Beginnings, and, as near as they can, abstain from the least Appearances of Evil.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the most resembling Idea that I can frame to my self of the Pure in Heart. And now lest this should be taken for a meer Idea, a thing of Notion rather than Practice, I proceed in the next place to represent the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of such a Disposition of Soul.</p>
                     <p>The Necessity of it is Double, in order to a double End, <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And First, This Purity of Heart is necessary in order to Holiness, that is, There can be no true Christian Holiness without it. This will appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59847:83"/>
First, That the Christian Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly requires it. For this I need ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal no further than to the progress of this same Discourse of our Saviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount. Where among several other <hi>improving</hi> Expositions of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saic</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5.27.</note> 
                        <hi>Law,</hi> we find this, <hi>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adultery. But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart.</hi> By which <hi>Lusting</hi> here I conceive must not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the bare natural Appetite of Concupiscence (that being as such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different) but the Appetite irregularly determin'd; nor that neither as 'tis a pure Natural and Mechanick Motion, (for so it has nothing Moral in it, and can only be materially Evil) but as it has the consent of the Will going along with it. Which consent may be either to the very <hi>Desire</hi> it self, or to the <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it. If to the Act, then the Man is in all Moral Accounts a compleat Adulterer, and will be so esteem'd by God, who as he <hi>Sees,</hi> so he <hi>Judges</hi> by the Heart, and will not think a Man the more innocent only for wanting an Opportunity of committing what he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59847:83"/>
fully intended. But if the Consent be only to the Desire, then tho the Man be not a compleat Adulterer, yet he may be truly said in the Style of the Psalmist, to be a <hi>Partaker with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> to have enter'd within some degrees of Unchastity, and to have transgressed against that Christian Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which forbids all Consent not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the compleat Acts, but also to the first Motions of Sin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The necessity of this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart in order to true Holiness, will appear by considering the Nature of God, who is both a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>Discerner</hi> of Spirits, and ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a double Reason to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd in <hi>Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Our Saviour <note place="margin">Joh. 4.24.</note> thought the former sufficient, but the latter adds a further degree of strength to it. God as a Spirit cannot be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily served by any thing less than the Sacrifice of the Spirit, which perhaps was one of the Reasons why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when he was to become a Sacrifice to his Father, took upon him not only Human Flesh, as some of the Ancient Hereticks would have believ'd, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an Human Soul. And as a Discerner
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59847:84"/>
of Spirits he cannot be put off with a Bodily inst ead of a Spiritual Service, or accept of a polluted and unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirit. The Psalmist had a due sense of this, when he said, <hi>Thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirest</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 51.6, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>truth in the inward parts, and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly.</hi> And when he pray'd, <hi>Make me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Purity of Heart may be further concluded necessary to true Holiness from the Nature of Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in whom as the Soul is in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the <hi>Principal,</hi> so in all Moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects is it the <hi>only</hi> part concern'd. This <hi>Inner Man</hi> is that Man who is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and proper Subject of all Good and Evil, Vertue and Vice, and accordingly this is the part to which our Sanctification and Regeneration is always ascribed, and from which the Man receives his whole Moral Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore says the Apostle, <hi>To be carnally minded is Death, but to be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8.6.</note> 
                        <hi>spiritually minded is Life and Peace.</hi> Where you see 'tis the inward Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Mind</hi> that makes all the difference. If this be Pure and Holy,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59847:84"/>
the whole Man is so; but if this stand not right to God and Goodness, 'tis not all the external Conformity in the World that can supply the Defect.</p>
                     <p>'Twas the Conceit of the Antient <note place="margin">De Jure Nat. &amp; Gent. pag. 159.</note> Jews (as we are told by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) that every Proselyte of <hi>Justice</hi> at the very instant when he became so, had a new Soul infused into him, to which Opinion our Saviour is supposed to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude in his Discourse with <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> Now tho Christianity does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a New, that is, <hi>another</hi> Soul in its Converts, yet it requires that the same Soul become new, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a new Frame and Temper of Spirit. The <hi>Christian Man</hi> is to be Born again, and to become a New Creature, a Creature of another Rank and Order. And 'tis the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> upon which this great Transaction is to pass, and which is to be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subject of this extraordinary Change. And accordingly our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is expressed in Scripture by our being <hi>renew'd in the Spirit of our</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4.23.</note> 
                        <hi>minds.</hi> We must be renew'd; and where? Not in our Body or outward Man, but in our Minds. And in what
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59847:85"/>
part of the Mind? Not in the Inferior part, whether <hi>Sensitive</hi> or <hi>Plastic,</hi> that which is exercis'd about Objects of Sense, or that which <hi>moves</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> the Body, but in the highest and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest part, in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Minds, which answers to the Platonical <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the very <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of the Soul. Here 'tis we are to be renew'd, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we must if we be renew'd at all, this being in all regards the Principal, and the only <hi>moral</hi> part of Man.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose it may be further consider'd, that this Intellectual Heart, the Spirit and Soul of Man is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Source of all Action. This is that which sees in the eyes, and hears in the ears. This is that which understands and wills, loves and hates. Here are all the Springs and Powers of Life and Motion, here is the last resort of all outward Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and from this <hi>Central Point</hi> are derived all the Lines of Action and Motion, even as all the Arteries and Veins are from the Natural Heart, which it diffuses and disperses through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Body, and has its Pulses in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part. If therefore this general Head-Spring be not kept pure and clean, how can the Streams run clear?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59847:85"/>
And upon this was grounded that signal Advice of the Wise Man, <hi>Keep thy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> 
                        <hi>heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of Life.</hi> Parallel to which I find a passage in the Meditations of the Royal Philosopher <hi>Marcus Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Oxford E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, p. 224.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Look within, for within is the fountain of good.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further yet, this Intellectual Heart is not only the Fountain of Action and Motion, but the most active and most rapidly moving thing in the World. This Heart is always <hi>Beating,</hi> the Pulses of it never rest, Thought rises upon Thought, and Desire succeeds Desire. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perpetual, constant and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so vehement, that the swiftest Bodily Motion, no not that of the Starry Orb is comparable to it; so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement that it cannot be discern'd or number'd, and comes nearer to a <hi>Rest</hi> than a Motion, as the swiftest turnings round of a Globe look like standing still. Now what a dangerous thing is such a Motion as this, if not rightly determin'd? Of what vast heights in goodness is it capablel And to what vast heights of wickedness may it rise,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59847:86"/>
if not well-govern'd! There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great necessity that this <hi>Heart</hi> of Man should be kept with all Diligence, and that it should be kept pure and undefiled.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and Lastly, The Necessity of Purity of Heart in order to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will appear as from the Christian Law, the Nature of God, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, so also from the <hi>intimate Vnion</hi> that is between the Divine and Human Nature. All things are full of God, who is therefore call'd in the Sacred Tongue <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or the <hi>Place.</hi> But there is nothing so intimately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him as the Spiritual part of the Creation. God is the Immediate <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> who all live, move, and have their being in him, and are joyn'd to him by a <hi>Central Touch,</hi> as the great <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaks. The Apostle says, that even our Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost, our Souls then must be at least his Sanctuary, and most Sacred Recess. But what? was not God just now supposed the Place of Spirits, and are Spirits now made the Place of God? Yes, and without any Absurdity. For so St. <hi>John</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes our Union with God, by our
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59847:86"/>
dwelling in God, and by God's dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">John 4.16.</note> in us. The Union is Double, on God's part, and on Ours. God dwells in us by his special Presence, by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and Benediction. But we dwell in God Essentially and Totally. God dwells only in some certain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, such as are of a Dispositiont fit to receive and entertain him; those who (as the Jews love to speak) are worthy to have the <hi>Shecinah</hi> rest upon them. But all Spirits good and bad, however qualified, dwell in him. For where else should they dwell, since he is all, and fills all? Now both these Unions infer the Necessity of Purity of Heart in Order to Holiness.</p>
                     <p>For First, if we consider the Soul of Man as dwelling in God, what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite reason is there that that part of him especially should be kept pure which is essentially joyn'd to, touches and inhabits so pure and so awful an Excellence! <hi>Put off thy shoes from off</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 9.5.</note> 
                        <hi>thy seet,</hi> said God to <hi>Moses, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</hi> And if so much Reverence be due to the Dwelling-place of God, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is there then due when God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59847:87"/>
is the Dwelling-place! How dares any Man lodge an impure Soul in the Bosom of so pure a Majesty! Or how can he in any measure be esteemed Holy, tho in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects never so unablamable, who is polluted in <hi>that</hi> part which is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly united to the Beauty of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness!</p>
                     <p>Then Secondly, if we consider God dwelling in the Soul and Body of Man, there is great necessity of Purity of Heart. And that upon a double Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Because the Spirit of God which is the Principle of all Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness will not enter but into a pure and clean Heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Because no other is worthy of so Divine a Presence.</p>
                     <p>And First, the Holy Spirit will not enter but into a pure and clean Heart. For this special and gracious Presence of God is not like his General and Essential Presence, universal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, but fixt and confined to certain
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59847:87"/>
Laws, and depending upon certain Conditions and Qualifications. And tho the first Addresses, influential Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, and distant Overtures of the Holy Spirit prevent all previous dispositions of Man, who (as our Church expresses it in her <hi>10th</hi> Article) <hi>cannot turn and prepare himself by his own natural strength,</hi> yet to his fix'd Dwelling and residen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Abode in us, 'tis necessary that there be an antecedent Preparation of Heart. Which I conceive to be the reason that tho <hi>all</hi> Men are at some time or other Partakers of the common and ordinary Motions of the Spirit, (who is said to have striven even with <note place="margin">Gen. 6.3.</note> the old World) yet none but very <hi>good</hi> Men have the Priviledge to be the Temples of his Residence. And this whole matter I take to be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented in these Words of St. <note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> 
                        <hi>John, Behold I stand at the door and knock: If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him.</hi> Where by standing at the Door and knocking, is meant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and preventing Grace. And this indeed is used to all, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Qualifications. But he does not come in and sup, that is, take up his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59847:88"/>
and be a familiar Ghest, till his Voice be hear'd, and the Door open'd, that is, till the Man has well attended to, and complied with those his antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Motions and Suggestions, till he has swept and made clean the inner Room of his Heart: So that Purity of Heart is absolutely necessary, tho not for the first preventing Influences, yet for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence and in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit, who tho he visit those that sit in Darkness, and in the Shadow of Death, yet he will not <hi>Lodge</hi> but in a pure and bright Soul.</p>
                     <p>Nor Secondly, Is any other than such worthy of so Divine a Presence. Indeed the purest Soul has reason to say with the Centurion, <hi>Lord, I am not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 8.8.</note> 
                        <hi>worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof,</hi> if we consider the disproportion that is between the Purity of God, and that of the purest Temple we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for him. For <hi>he putteth no trust</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Job 15.15.</note> 
                        <hi>in his Saints, nor are the Heavens clean in his sight.</hi> How much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then is the impure and polluted Soul of so pure a Presence! Suppose the Spirit of God <hi>would</hi> enter into a Polluted Spirit, yet what Soul that has
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59847:88"/>
any sense of Decency would dare to continue any longer so, when once possess'd by so Divine an Inhabitant! <hi>Holiness becomes thine house for ever,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 93.</note> says the Psalmist, that is, it is very meet and right, decent and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable that the place of the Divine Residence should be kept holy and undefiled. The Divine Presence is the greatest and most solemn Consecration of any place that can be, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he fixes his Mansion, there the Inscription ought to be, <hi>Holiness to the Lord.</hi> And the reason of all this is by the Psalmist render'd elsewhere, <hi>For thou art a God that hast no pleasure</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 5.4.</note> 
                        <hi>in wickedness, neither shall any evil dwell with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far shewn the Necessity of Purity of Heart in Order to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to complete this part it remains that we further represent its necessity in order to <hi>Happiness.</hi> Now this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity may respect either our Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Happiness or our Enjoyment of it when admitted. That Purity of Heart is necessary to our Admission into Happiness is already sufficiently deducible from what has been premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59847:89"/>
concerning its necessity to Holiness, without which we are expresly told, <hi>No man shall see God.</hi> We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Heb. 12.14</note> further concern'd only to shew that 'tis necessary to the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of Happiness.</p>
                     <p>And here not to feign a long Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis of a Sinners being admitted into Heaven, with a particular Description of his Condition and Behaviour there, we need only consider that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good is of a <hi>Relative</hi> Nature, as well as any other Good, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the enjoyment of it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily require some Qualification in the Faculty, as well as the enjoyment of any other Good does, something that may render that Good a Good to that particular Faculty. Otherwise tho it may be <hi>possess'd,</hi> yet it can never be <hi>enjoy'd.</hi> This again must be something that must produce some Likeness or Agreeableness between the Faculty and the Good to be enjoy'd. Which because the Purest of all Beings leaves no room to doubt but that Purity of Heart must be that Agreeableness, without which as a Man cannot <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,</hi> so neither can he <hi>enjoy</hi> God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59847:89"/>
We see that even in this Life 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tedious to be in the Company of a Person whose Humour is disagreeable to ours, tho perhaps in other respects of sufficient Worth and Excellency. And how then can we imagin that an ill-disposed Soul should take any Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in God, who is to her infinitely more unlike, and therefore disagreeable, than one Man can be supposed to be to another? For my part, I rather think that should an impure Soul be afforded a Mansion in Heaven, she would be so far from being happy in it, that she would do <hi>Pennance</hi> there to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For besides that a sensualized Soul would carry such Appetites with her thither for which she could find no suitable Objects, which would be a constant Torment; those that she <hi>does</hi> find there would be so disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they would rather vex and upbraid, than satisfie her Indigence. So that this in short would be her case, That which she desires and could relish, that she has not; and that which she has, that she neither desires nor can relish; the result of which must needs be a very high degree of Misery
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59847:90"/>
and Dissatisfaction. So absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is Purity of Heart both to the <hi>Acquisition</hi> and <hi>Enioyment</hi> of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is something that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends it further yet, and that is the <hi>Blessedness</hi> that attends it, the third and last thing to be consider'd. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> But before we come so far as this, there is a Present Blessedness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it in this Life, which I shall briefly touch upon. And here besides that inward Peace of Mind, that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Conscience, and Spiritual Joy and Complacency which are the common advantages of a good and well-order'd Life, there are these three more peculiar Advantages of Purity of Heart.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That 'tis more <hi>Innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. That 'tis more <hi>Easie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. That 'tis more <hi>Safe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>More <hi>Innocent,</hi> because 'tis supposed to put a Bar against the very first Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Sin, and consequently to be removed at a greater distance from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59847:90"/>
More <hi>Easie,</hi> because tis easier to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from the first Beginnings of Sin, than from a further Progress in it after you have once begun. Nor is there so much pains required not to admit, as to eject a Temptation. Which made an ingenious Person say, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of <hi>Concupiscenee</hi> was not so much a new or distinct Commandment, as an Instrument of Security for the keeping all the rest.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, More <hi>Safe,</hi> because more Easie; there being not so much danger of yielding to what a Man can easily forbear, as to that which he must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from with pain and uneasiness.</p>
                     <p>But the greatest Blessedness of all is the <hi>Vision of God.</hi> Which I suppose may be extended beyond that <hi>Beatific</hi> Vision of him, which is the Happiness of Angels and Saints in Heaven, and may signifie some peculiar advantage belonging to the Pure in Heart even in this Life, namely, the clearer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of all <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Ideal</hi> Truths (which may well be call'd see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, they being one and the
<pb facs="tcp:59847:91"/>
same with the Divine Essence) especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such Ideal Truths as are of a Moral and Spiritual Nature, to the Discovery of which Purity of Heart is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preparative. According to that of the Angel to <hi>Daniel. Many shall be</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 12.10</note> 
                        <hi>purify'd and made white, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</hi> But having professedly discours'd of this * elsewhere, I shall <note place="margin">Reflect. on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Human Life.</note> stay no longer upon this part, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that other Vision of God which is called <hi>Beatific.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here I remark, that this is the only Beatitude to which the express Promise of the Vision of God is annex'd. This indeed is implicitly contain'd in some others, but there only openly expressed. And because 'tis reasonable to think that our Lord does suit his Rewards to the Natures of the Excellencies here specify'd; We may well conclude that he intended some peculiar Honour and Priviledge to this holy disposition of Soul, and to signifie that it has a more than ordinary Title to the Happiness of the Beatific Vision. This will include two things,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59847:91"/>
I. That the Pure in Heart shall have a clearer and more inlarged sight of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That they shall take a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in what they do see of him.</p>
                     <p>And First, They shall have a clearer and more enlarged sight of God. This will depend upon two Suppositions.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Upon the peculiar Aptness of this Disposition for the Vision of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Upon the Will of God to afford a greater and clearer manifestation of himself to a Soul so disposed.</p>
                     <p>That Purity of Heart has a peculiar aptness in order to the Vision of God, we need not doubt, if we consider that the only reason why we see not God now, is the grosness of this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle wherein the Soul is incased. This is that <hi>Glass</hi> through which we now see so Darkly, and which makes us do <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> so. This is that black Skreen that parts the <hi>Material</hi> from the <hi>Intelligible</hi> World. The more abstract therefore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59847:92"/>
we are from the Body, and from the Bodily Life, the more fit we shall be both to <hi>behold,</hi> and to <hi>indure</hi> the Rays of the Divine Light. We find that even now the purer and finer our Blood and Spirits are, the freer and clearer are our Thoughts. The more bright and transparent this Glass is, the more the Ideal Light will dart in upon our Souls. And the same will hold in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion hereafter. The purer the Soul is, the purer will all its Faculties and Operations be, the less it will retain of corporeal Gusts and Relishes, the more recollected and undivided will be its Powers; for Unity of Thought follows Unity of Desire; and the fewer things a Man desires, the fewer will be his Thoughts, and consequently the more strong and vigorous upon the Object where they fix. To which we may add, that the purer the Soul is, the purer will also be her <hi>Resurrection Body,</hi> which is of great moment to the Vision of God, as well as to other <hi>Spiritual</hi> Operations. For we must then see through a Glass as well as now; only the Glass will be clearer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Purity of the Soul, which even in this Life gives a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59847:92"/>
Brightness of Air to the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and makes the Face to shine with an unimitable Lustre. Purity of Heart therefore even upon this single account has a peculiar aptness in order the Vision of God. But to this may be added Secondly the <hi>Will</hi> of God to afford a greater and clearer manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himself to a Soul so disposed. For 'tis highly rational to believe, that God who is so great a Lover, will also be a liberal Rewarder of inward Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and that he who delights to dwell in pure Hearts now, will reveal himself in a very plentiful measure to such hereafter. So that both from the aptness of the Disposition and from the Will of God we may conclude, That the Pure in Heart shall have a <hi>larger</hi> share of the Beatific Vision.</p>
                     <p>Nor shall they only see more of God, but Secondly, take a greater Delight in what they do see of him. And this is the principal Ingredient of their Happiness: For 'tis not the meer <hi>having,</hi> but the <hi>delighting</hi> in a thing that makes a Man happy. And this is the Condition of Pure Souls. The same Purity which procures them a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59847:93"/>
sight of God, will also make them to delight in the Vision of him, so that they shall <hi>Tast</hi> as well as <hi>See</hi> how <note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>good</hi> God is. For the purer the Soul is, the liker it is to God who is Essential Purity; and the more it resembles God, the more it must needs love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him.</p>
                     <p>Likeness is the greatest indearment of Love, and the most natural Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Delight and Complacency. We see this in all the Orders of Being, and in all the Degrees of Life. In the Sympathetic Associations of Vegetables, in the Voluntary Consortings of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and in the chosen Friendships of Men. But most of all may this be seen in God himself. What is it but the most perfect Likeness and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Essences, Understandings and Wills that renders the Sacred Persons of the mysterious and adorable Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity so infinitely lovely and agreeable to each other! This was that which made the Father say of the Son, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased,</hi> because he saw there the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                        <hi>of his glory, and the express image of his person.</hi> And upon this is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59847:93"/>
that mutual Delight which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacred Persons enjoy from each other. That therefore which makes the Persons of the Holy Trinity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in one another, must needs make the pure Soul delight in the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. A pure Soul cannot but delight in a pure God, and the purer she is, the more she will love and delight in him. Purity of Heart does even here <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate,</hi> much more then will it hereafter <hi>increase</hi> the Joys of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore that having this excellent Hope, we study to purifie our selves even as God is pure, and so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to resemble and transcribe the Divine Perfections here, that we may contemplate them with the greater Complacency and Delight hereafter. To which purpose let us now and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Pray in the Words of our Holy and Devout Church,</p>

                     <p>THE Words very well become the Mouth of him that spake them, who was himself the greatest <hi>Peace-maker</hi> in the World. He made Peace in Heaven by the Blood of his Cross, and endeavoured to promote it on Earth. He first reconciled God to Man, and then tried to reconcile Men to one another. He chose to be born in the most quiet and peaceful state of the Roman Empire, when <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> in token of an Universal Peace had shut up the <hi>Mystical</hi> Gates of <hi>Janus</hi> his Temple. And when he came into the World his Proclamation by the Angels was Peace; and when he was to leave the World, the same was his Legacy. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my <note place="margin">John 14.</note>
                           <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59847:94"/>
peace I give unto you.</hi> The Order of his whole Life was a constant Compliance with the Peace of the State, whereof he gave two signal Instances, in paying Tribute when not obliged, and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding resistance of the Officer that seized him, and his Last Prayer was for the Peace and Unity of the Church. And now since by this great Love and Study of Peace he shew'd himself to be the Genuine Son of God, who is sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> he might with <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.33.</note> the better <hi>Decorum</hi> make the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Mind the Measure and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>our</hi> filial relation to him, as he does when he tells us, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-makers, for they shall be called the Children of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By <hi>Peace-Makers</hi> here I suppose is meant not only those that interpose as Moderators to compose Feuds and Quarrels (tho' that be the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Sense of the Word) but more generally those that are peaceably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and that shew this their Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Disposition, either by living qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and inoffensively, or by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to maintain Peace where it is, or to restore it where it is interrupted.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59847:95"/>
The first of these Degrees of Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness consists in a meer Negative; the two last are of a positive Nature, and consequently of a greater Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But the most excellent of all is the last, it being for the most part not only a <hi>thankless,</hi> but an odious, difficult and hazardous Undertaking to bring <hi>them</hi> nearer together whom Anger has set at a distance. 'Tis like the business of a <hi>Fire-quencher,</hi> who tho' he may with plying of Engins and great adoe rescue the Pile of Building from the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flames, yet his Eyes will be sure to smart with the <hi>Smoke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this Peace, in the not violating, preserving, or restoring of which this peaceable-mindedness is concern'd, may be either private Peace between Man and Man, or public Peace between Societies of Men. Again, public Peace is distinguishable according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Distribution of Human Society, into Civil and Ecclesiastic, that of the State, and that of the Church. The former concerns Men not only as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Government, or as under this or that particular Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but also as Men, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59847:95"/>
all Men. For even the state of Nature antecedently to all Human Conventions and Constitutions (as has been abundantly proved against the Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi>) is not a state of War, but of Peace. The later re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects only those who are Members of the Christian Church, whereof Christ Jesus is the Head, and subject to that Spiritual Government whereof he is the Author. The former kind of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace is opposed to War and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Practices, the later to Schisms and Divisions.</p>
                     <p>The way being thus far clear'd by pointing out the general Degrees of Peaceableness, and the general kinds of Peace, we may now with the less intanglement proceed to fix the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Order of the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And here I do not intend a <hi>Casuistical</hi> Tract by entring upon that long <hi>beaten</hi> Common-place concerning our Obligation to Peace, and the Measures of observing it with reference either to Church or State. For besides that this has been the constant Theme of almost every Casuist; and that 'tis impossible to say any thing <hi>more</hi> than
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59847:96"/>
                        <hi>All,</hi> or <hi>better</hi> than <hi>Some</hi> have already said upon it: I further think that the thing is of it self plain enough, and that were it not for the perversness of some Men rather than for any obs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity in the Duty, there needed not have been any other Measure given in this matter than that <hi>General</hi> one of the Apostle, <hi>If it be possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> For when 'tis inquired, How far we are obliged to Peace in the State, or Peace in the Church? The Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is plain and ready from hence, That we are obliged to both as far as is <hi>Possible,</hi> and as much as in us lies; and that Nothing less than <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Evident</hi> Necessity can justifie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War in the State, or Separation in the Church. Which one Rule if well heeded and practised, the Condition of the World would be much more peaceable and quiet than it is, or is like to be.</p>
                     <p>Instead therefore of treating of this Beatitude in a <hi>Casuistical</hi> way by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the Measures of our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Peace, I shall rather chuse this Order of Discourse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:59847:96"/>
First, To set forth the general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a peaceable Disposition.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To consider that More particular Prerogative of it in making those that have it Children of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To conclude all with some Reflections upon the present Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace of Christendom.</p>
                     <p>And first, The general Excellency of a peaceable Disposition may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from these two Principles:</p>
                     <p>First, From what it <hi>Argues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, From what it <hi>Causes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And first, It Argues a well-ordered Frame and good Habit of Mind: Good by natural Disposition, good by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and Choice, and good by Gracious and Divine Operation. It argues a Soul not only lightly tinctured, but deeply season'd, and throughly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with Goodness.—<hi>Incoctum generoso pectus honesto.</hi> The same may be said of the peaceable Man that St. <hi>James</hi> says of him that offends not in his Tongue, that he is a <hi>Perfect</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jam. 3.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Man.</hi> Not that the due Government

of the Tongue alone does make a Man Perfect; for there is a Body of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness as well as a Body of Sin; and to make it perfect the Members must have both a just number and Size; but that considering the many requisites to so great and excellent a piece of Temperance, it argues and supposes him to be so; and, as it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>able also to bridle the whole Body.</hi> And so here, the peaceable Man may be said to be a perfect Man; not that he is so made by this single Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but that this Disposition argues him to be so, considering what a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Accomplishment of Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before a Man can be capable of exercising so noble a Virtue.</p>
                     <p>There are some Degrees in Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that necessarily suppose others; the Man must first walk in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the Ungodly, and stand in the Way of Sinners, before he can have the <hi>Forehead</hi> to sit down in the Chair of the Scornful. And so there are some Degrees in Goodness, that do also necessarily suppose others. For there is a Scale of Perfection in both, and we can neither be Good nor Bad
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59847:97"/>
by strides and jumps. And this is such a Degree of Goodness as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses many others to have gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, being one of the <hi>Top-stones</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Building,</hi> and one of the last finishing strokes of the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage <note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> of that Christ which is <hi>form'd</hi> in us. For the Holy Spirit of God (as was shewn in the preceding Discourse) requires a Consecrated Abode, a Chast Body and a Pure Soul; and will not enter into us till the former be made a Temple, and the later a Sanctuary. And yet this Excellence is reckon'd by the Apostle among the special <hi>Fruits</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> of the Spirit, and consequently must presuppose all that Moral Preparation at least that the Entrance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit does, and must therefore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a well-order'd Frame and good Habit of Mind.</p>
                     <p>But this being only a general (tho' to one that attends the force of it, sufficiently Conclusive) Argument, I will more distinctly shew that it does so, by considering what particular Qualifications of Soul are required in order to a peaceable disposition; whose presence must needs <hi>Argue</hi> whatever it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59847:98"/>
                        <hi>Requires.</hi> Now these Requisites are either Negative, or Positive. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative are</p>
                     <p>First, That the Man be free from all inordinate <hi>Self-Love,</hi> it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that he who prefers his own little private Concerns before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interest, should be at peace with the Publick when that tender part comes once to be toucht. No, Such a one will ballance <hi>Self</hi> against all the World, will not care what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Publick when it stands in competition with that; but will embroil all the World in War and Mischief if he can, for the least Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Man be free from Covetousness, which tho the Root of all Evil, is yet more so of Strife and Dissention than of any other. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness and Peace can't dwell long together. Tis indeed a very <hi>Litigious Principle,</hi> and one of the greatest Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Incendiaries in the World. 'Tis this that fills the Court with Brawls and Wranglings, and the Field with Bloud and Slaughter. And 'tis a known
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59847:98"/>
Observation, That in all Wars whether justly or unjustly undertaken, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part fight only for <hi>Plunder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That he be free from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> which is as great an Enemy to Peace without, as it is to inward Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. The Ambitious Man is always advancing his aim at some higher mark of Honour; and if Peace will not serve to raise him, War shall. Take an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> What a World of Schisms and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in the Church, and Factions, Seditions, Plots, Massacres, and Wars in the State have been from time to time occasioned by the Ambition of that See! But there's an higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance than this, for 'twas <hi>Ambition</hi> that made War in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That he be free from <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> which indeed spites every thing that is excellent, but is of all things the most direct and sworn Enemy to Peace. 'Twas the Envy of the Devil that first disturb'd the peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the World, and set the whole Creation in Battail Array against Man. And 'tis the same Envious Being that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59847:99"/>
still raises and foments all the Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Dissentions that divide both the Church and State; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be called the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Discords,</hi> as well as the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Lies.</hi> Envy is the greatest Enmity in the World, and the Envious Man is the most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Enemy. There is no Man but whom by the very Principles of his Disposition he is obliged either to <hi>Hate</hi> or to <hi>Despise.</hi> All his Superiors and Equals he hates, and despises all his Inferiours, which comprise the whole body of Mankind. And both ways is Envy an Enemy to Peace, and very destructive to Kingdoms and States. Whereof there is a signal Instance in the Case of <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> who through Envy to the growing Glories of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> deny'd him a Supply of Forces to carry on his <hi>Italian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and so ruin'd <hi>him,</hi> their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>themselves</hi> too.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That he be free from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> which is another great Trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser against Peace, and without which the rest would not be so mischievous as they are. For this continues and foments those Enmities to which the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59847:99"/>
other give Birth, rivet and fastens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimosities in the Minds of Men, and by fresh returns of provocation brings in (what has in vain been attempted in <hi>Nature</hi>) a kind of <hi>Perpetual Motion</hi> in Malice, and immortalizes Quarrels and Contentions.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly and Lastly, to comprize all at once, 'tis requisite that the peaceable Man be free from all manner of <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Irregular Passions,</hi> whether of the Sensual or Intellectual Part, and from all Disaffection and Disorder of Soul. This being the Spring and First Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to all the Discords and Disorders that are without. According to that of St. <hi>James, From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Lusts, that war in your members?</hi> Where these reign, there can be no Peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the peaceable Man must be free from these.</p>
                     <p>These are the <hi>Negative</hi> Qualifications in order to a peaceable Disposition. The <hi>Positive</hi> I need but just name, the Proof of them being virtually contain'd in the other. They are therefore,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59847:100"/>
First, Charity or universal Love, that seeketh not her own, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good. Secondly, Generosity and a noble inlargement of Soul, that sets a Man above the little petty Occasions of Quarrel and Contention. Thirdly, Humility and Modesty, that makes a Man possess himself and his station with Contentedness and Thankfulness. Fourthly, A candid, sweet and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Temper that thinks no evil, but is well pleased in the Prosperity of every Man, and every State or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Fifthly, A mild, meek and forgiving Spirit, that does not keep up the <hi>Circulation</hi> of Injuries, but lets the Quarrel fall and dye. Sixthly and Lastly, a serene and well-composed Soul, one that rules well her own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Charge,</hi> having her Passions in Subjection with all Gravity, Peace and Tranquility of Mind.</p>
                     <p>All these excellent Qualifications are required to furnish out a peaceable Disposition, which will not come into the Soul, as the Soul will not into the Body, till after it be duly tempered and prepared for it. Whence the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to be made out is sufficiently
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59847:100"/>
concluded, that it argues a well-order'd Frame and good Habit of Mind: Which is the first Ground of its Excellency.</p>
                     <p>The second is taken from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of what it <hi>Causes.</hi> The Effects of it are as great and noble as its Principles and Prerequisites. Its great and general effect is <hi>Happiness,</hi> upon which no one Virtue has so large an influence as this. Some Happiness it causes immediately and directly, and contributes to secure whatever Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness it does not cause. Some Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings it originally procures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the possession of all. So that some way or other all our Blessings are <hi>Blessings of Peace,</hi> since to this we owe either the Blessings themselves, or at least the secure enjoyment of them. And all this it does by giving Strength, Beauty and Pleasure to Society.</p>
                     <p>First <hi>Strength.</hi> Peace is as much the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> of Society, as Mony is of War, and without it Society is so far from obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of its just and natural Ends, that 'tis a far less eligible State than that of perfect Solitude. For in perfect Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude Men only want the mutual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59847:101"/>
of one another; but in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and inraged Society, Every Man is in the condition of <hi>Cain,</hi> in fear lest the next that meets him should do him a mischief. 'Tis Peace that makes Society a Defence, and that distinguishes the Congresses of Men from the Herds of Beasts, or which is worse, from the Confusions of the Rabble. And as it strengthens Society <hi>within,</hi> so it strengthens it <hi>without</hi> too; nor would War be any Security abroad without Peace at home. Briefly, 'tis Union and Coherence that makes every thing strong, and Peace is the Cement that holds all fast together. And what So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is there that can subsist without it, when even a <hi>Kingdom divided against it self,</hi> tho it be that of the Devil <note place="margin">Mark 3.24.</note> himself, <hi>cannot stand?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly <hi>Beauty.</hi> There is indeed a certain Beauty in Strength, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is strong is so far beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But besides this, Peace gives a more proper and peculiar Beauty to Society, the Beauty of Order and Proportion, of Decency and Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness. For a peaceable Disposition inclines every Man to mind his own
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59847:101"/>
proper Business, and to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self within that place and station where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God and his Superiours have fix'd him, and not to <hi>aspire</hi> to what is <hi>above</hi> him, or <hi>invade</hi> what does not <hi>belong</hi> to him. For indeed Peace it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without this, any more than Society can without Peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore there is Peace, there will also be this Order and Proportion. The Hand will not affect the Office of the Eye, nor the Foot the place of the Head, but every Member will be contented with, and intent upon his own Office and Place in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The result of which must needs be the greatest Beauty and Harmony.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly <hi>Pleasure.</hi> This indeed is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily consequent to the two former, since it cannot but be a great pleasure to every particular well-affected Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Society to reflect upon the Strength and Beauty of the whole. But besides this, a peaceable Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion derives a more immediate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Pleasure upon Society. For who can express the Pleasure that is in Love and Joy; Sweetness and Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in mutual Kindness and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59847:102"/>
in Union of Minds and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Friendship! They that have had the Happyness to tast of this Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, know they cannot express it, which made the Psalmist break forth <note place="margin">Psal. 133.</note> into that abrupt Extasie, <hi>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in Unity!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far set forth the general Excellency of a peaceable Disposition from what it <hi>Argues,</hi> and from what it <hi>Causes,</hi> I now proceed in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place to consider that more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prerogative of it in making those that have it, Children of God.</p>
                     <p>To be Children of God is indeed common to all good Men, who being begotten anew by the immortal Seed of the Word, do bear Gods image in Holiness, endeavouring in all things to do their Father's Will. But there are some Dispositions that give a more peculiar Right to this Title than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they are nearer Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Divine Excellencies. Among which is the Disposition now under our Consideration, whereby a Man becomes in a special Degree and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59847:102"/>
like God, and so evidences himself to be his Child, and may upon the consideration of that likeness fitly be so called. And this is the constant use of this Phrase in Scripture, <hi>Ye are</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note> 
                        <hi>of your Father the Devil</hi> (says our Lord to the unbelieving Jews) <hi>and the Lusts of your Father ye will do.</hi> And so again, <hi>Love your enemies and do good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye shall be the Children of the Highest,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 6.35</note> 
                        <hi>for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.</hi> And says the Apostle, <hi>Be ye</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 5.1.</note> 
                        <hi>followers of God as dear Children.</hi> They are the Children of God, who are Followers of God, who purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as he is pure, and who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as he is perfect. So that to be the Child of God, or the Child of the Devil, signifies as much as to carry a particular resemblance of either. When therefore 'tis said, that the Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers shall be call'd the Children of God, it comes to as much as that they carry a particular Character of the Divine Likeness, whereby it may be known to whose Family they retain, and that they are the <hi>True</hi> Sons of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:59847:103"/>
And so indeed they are. For God is the God of Peace; and the greatest Peace, that which passes all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, is called the <hi>Peace of God.</hi> For God is the greatest Lover of Peace, the Author and Giver of Peace, and the Rewarder of all such as live in Peace. Indeed under the Jewish State, (which as in other things, so in this was very peculiar, that 'twas a State of <hi>Theocracy</hi>) God was known by the Name of the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> not as expressing his true natural liking and approbation, but only his relation to that particular People, whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate King and Leader he was. But now under the State of the Gospel, which exhibits a more genuin Idea of God (for the only Begotten Son, <note place="margin">John 1.18.</note> which is in the Bosom of the Father, he has declared him) he has changed his Title from the style of <hi>War</hi> to the style of <hi>Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This indeed was ever his <hi>Delight,</hi> but now 'tis his <hi>Glory,</hi> and inserted among the brightest Ornaments of his Crown. He is now manifested to be what he ever really was. God from
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59847:103"/>
all Eternity to all Eternity enjoys a profound Peace within himself, and the Sacred Persons of the Trinity are not more one in Essence and Nature, than in Will and Inclination. Their <hi>Moral</hi> is as great as their <hi>Natural</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Kingdom of God is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Peace, and Heaven the Throne of his Majesty is a peaceful Region. We never read but once that there was any War there, and those that <note place="margin">Rev. 12.7.</note> caused it were quickly banish'd thence. To be short, God both enjoys and establishes Peace above, he <hi>maketh peace in his High-places,</hi> and he has sent his Son to procure it below, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile Men to him, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that so both Worlds might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire in Unity, and that this Will of God might be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. And therefore since God has shewn himself to be so great a Lover of Peace, there is sufficient ground for this particular Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a peaceable Disposition, that it makes those that have it Children of God. From which I pass in the third and last place, to conclude all with some Reflections on the present Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers of the Peace of Christendom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="tcp:59847:104"/>
'Tis the Observation of a Great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian <note place="margin">

But could we suppose a Stranger from one of the other Planetary Worlds to come and take a View of this our little Spot, and of the Manners of those that live upon it, he would not sure think <hi>this</hi> of all the things in the World to be the Character of Man. For he could not but observe, and perhaps it would be one of the first Remarks he would make, that there are more Wars and Fightings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, than among any other sort of Creatures, and more among <hi>Christians</hi> than among any other sort of Men. For at the very first opening of the Scene, what a miserable face of things would appear both in Church and State! What Wars and Desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the one! and what <hi>Debates, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Wraths, Strifes, Backbitings, Whisperings, Swellings</hi> and <hi>Tumults</hi> in the other!</p>
                     <p>But because most of the Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in the State proceed from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59847:104"/>
those of the Church, I shall confine my Reflections to those that disturb the Peace and Order of the Christian Church. Where I shall First, Point out who these Disturbers are. And Secondly, Set some such Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before them, as may make them sensible of their Crime.</p>
                     <p>There are I conceive these two ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ways of disturbing the Peace of the Church; either by imposing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or unreasonable Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or by refusing to comply with such as are Lawful and Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That the first of these is a Breach of the Church's Peace there can be no doubt, because it introduces a necessity of Separation. And that the latter is so is as plain, because 'tis a Separation without any Necessity for it. Either of these is <hi>Schism,</hi> whose Notion (as all agree) consists either in making a necessity of Separation, or in separating without necessity.</p>
                     <p>The First of these will fall heavy upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, (as it has been sufficiently made good against her) has brought in an Absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59847:105"/>
of Separation, by imposing such notoriously unlawful and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Terms of Communion. The latter will light upon all those who separate from such parts of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> where they may lawfully Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. More especially it will light heavier than ordinary upon all those <hi>Sectaries</hi> among us, who now divide from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Terms of whose Communion, (as has been undeniably prov'd and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) are not only Lawful, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reasonable, and of an excellent Constitution.</p>
                     <p>I need not here, nor is it my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to set my self professedly to make out the Charge of Schism against the Dissenters and Separatists from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> It has been done over and over, to the utmost Degree of Evidence, and the whole Circle of the Reform'd Churches cry out upon them for their unreasonable Separation. Only I would desire them to try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Cause by that one plain Apostolical Canon before mentioned, and see whether they can justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by that single Measure. It is this,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59847:105"/>
                        <hi>If it be possible, as much as lies in you,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 12.18.</note> 
                        <hi>live peaceably with all men.</hi> If with all Men, then certainly much more with Bodies and Societies of Men; much more with our Governors and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; much more yet with the <hi>Church,</hi> the most Sacred and most Eminent of all Societies. And if as far as is <hi>possible,</hi> then certainly as far as is <hi>lawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I would ask our Dissenters and Separatists this one Question, and appeal to their <hi>Consciences</hi> as well as to their <hi>Practices</hi> for an Answer. Do they live peaceably with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as by Lawful Authority esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd, as far as is <hi>possible,</hi> and as much as <hi>in them lies?</hi> So far from this, that I <hi>Might</hi> say (were I minded to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate things) that they do the quite contrary, and <hi>Divide</hi> from us as far as is possible, and as much as in them lies, it being very notorious that they run from us as far as they can, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their Purity and Sanctity by their distance from us; and condemn and disuse many things meerly because we approve and use them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:59847:106"/>
But I need not take advantage of this, tho it be too notorious to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as well as too scandalous to be defended. I only demand, Do they live peaceably with the Church as far as is possible, and as much as in them lies? They cannot with any modesty say that they do. For if they did, not to say that they might come much nearer to us than they do, they must of necessity conform with us. Since as they were never able to shew any thing unlawful in our Communion; so they now generally allow it to be lawful, and accordingly will afford us their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now and then upon occasion, as often as they think fit to do us that Honour. Well then, if our Communion be lawful, then 'tis <hi>Possible</hi> for them to communicate with us, and if they do not, then 'tis plain that they do not live peaceably with us as far as is <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> and as much as in them lies, and consequently by vertue of this plain Apostolical Canon stand fully convicted of <hi>Schism,</hi> and let them bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves off if they can. I am satisfi'd they will be able to answer it but ill here, and I am affraid worse hereafter.</p>

I have now in general pointed out the Disturbers of the Christian Peace, and I wish I could now as easily make these Troublers of our <hi>Israel</hi> sensible of this their Crime, as prove them guilty of it. In order to which not to insist upon the Heinousness of the Sin of Schism which is as expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Scripture as Murder or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and the great Obligation that lies upon all Christians to preserve the Unity and Peace of the Church, which the Scripture every where so earnestly presses and inculcates, and which the Example of the Primitive Christians so strongly recommends; and for which both our Reason and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest (especially at this time) would suggest to us a thousand Arguments; I say not to insist upon these and such like considerations (for a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I refer to an excellent Discourse of Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>'s concerning the Unity of the Church) I would only desire the Persons concern'd to consider how much by their Schisms and Divisions they prejudice the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> I do not mean as to the Life and Power of Godliness,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59847:107"/>
(tho that be very true and worthy to be seriously consider'd) but as to the Propagation of the Christian Faith. And that with respect to the three great Enemies of it, The <hi>Heathen,</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Mahumetan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, With respect to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> to whom as the Unity and Agreement of the <hi>First</hi> Christians was a great indearment, and a very prevalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, so as to occasion that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Speech among them, <hi>See how the Christians love one another!</hi> So the Schisms and Divisions of the <hi>Present</hi> Christians must needs be a great Scandal and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. For indeed how can any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering Heathen be perswaded to think such a Broken and Divided Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be of Divine Revelation, when that which <hi>he</hi> takes to by the Light of Nature has more of Unity and Consent!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, With respect to the <hi>Jew,</hi> who may certainly number the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christians among the greatest Hindrances of his Conversion. For when in the Prophetick Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Characters of the times of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59847:107"/>
the Messias he shall find this to be one, and one of the chiefest, that it shall be a Reign of Charity and Peace, that <hi>they shall beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shares,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 2.4.</note> 
                        <hi>and their Spears into Pruning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks;</hi> That <hi>Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more.</hi> That <hi>The Wolf shall also dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid,</hi> &amp;c. I say the Jew finding this to be one of the Characteristics of the Messias his Reign, and observing withal nothing like it in the Christian State, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perfect <hi>Reverse</hi> of all this, and not being able to distinguish with some between the Design and Natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the Christian Religion, and the accidental Event of things, or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have recourse to the other more glorious Reign of Christ in the Millennial State of the Church, wherein these great and strong Figures shall have a proportionable Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he must needs be shrewdly tempted to think that the Time of the promised Messias is not yet come, and that the Religion which now goes for his, is as false, as its Professors are evil and wicked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59847:108"/>
Thirdly and Lastly, With respect to the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> who indeed allows Christ to have been a true Prophet, and his Religion to have been once a true Religion, only he says it has had its Time as well as that of the Jews, and is now, as <hi>superannuated,</hi> to give place to a more perfect Institution, that is, to <hi>Mahumet</hi>'s, who as he came after Christ, so was he to fill up his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to deliver the last and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Will of God. And will he not find pretence to be confirmed in this his Opinion, and to prefer his Master <hi>Mahumet</hi> as much before Christ as we do Christ before <hi>Moses;</hi> when he shall perceive (as quickly he may) that there is not half so much Unity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement among Christians, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their very Religion which is to be the Bond of their Unity, as there is among <hi>Mahumetans?</hi> Certainly he will, and tho he perish in his Error, yet I fear his Blood will be upon those who administer the occasion of it. These are great Scandals and Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both to the Heathen, Jew and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan, and woe be to them by whom this great Offence comes. Our Saviour
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59847:108"/>
pronounces a severe Woe against them that shall offend even one of his little <note place="margin">Mat. 18.6.</note> ones, and what then shall be the doom of those that scandalize so great a part of the World! I heartily wish that the present Disturbers and Dividers of the Christian State and Church would seriously consider these things, and how they act the part of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in thus letting and hindring the Course of the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I shut up all with this Prayer, That God would give Light to those <hi>Heathens, Jews</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi> that sit in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death, and that in order to this, he would first guide the Feet of us <hi>Christians</hi> into the Way of <hi>Peace,</hi>

                     <p>IT has been ever a great occasion of Dissatisfaction to some Men that there should be any such thing as evil in the World. A greater yet, that this Evil should often fall upon good, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the best of Men. But the greatest of all is, that not only good Men should meet with Evil, but that their very Goodness should betray them into it; that suffering should not only be the Portion of the Righteous, but that Men should suffer for the Sake of their Righteousness. It seems hard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that a Righteous Man should suffer, but much more that he should suffer for his being Righteous, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59847:109"/>
that Affliction should not only be the <hi>Lot,</hi> but also the <hi>Effect</hi> and <hi>Consequence</hi> of his Virtue. For if Honesty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity cannot be a Defence and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge against Evil, yet one would expect it should not be a Procurer of it, and that if the Man were not the better for his Virtue, yet at least he should not be the Worse.</p>
                     <p>These have been always as perplext <hi>Appearances</hi> in the Moral, as any that arise in the Natural System of the World; a frequent Trouble and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Good and Pious, and a more frequent Occasion of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the Atheistical and Profane, who have raised from hence their most plausible objections both against the <hi>Being</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which by these greatest Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of it they have been incouraged either to <hi>Deny</hi> or to <hi>Condemn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the two first of these Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties I am not at present concern'd. Nor shall I determin of what force the last and greatest might be, were this the last state of things, and the <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding Scene</hi> of the World. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59847:110"/>
it might then be strong enough to conclude what some are now so weak as to wish and believe. But certainly with the supposition of an After-state the Objection is so far from being <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,</hi> that I can see nothing <hi>Difficult</hi> in it: And I think 'tis here sufficiently answer'd by that ample Compensation promis'd by our Saviour to all those whose faithful adherence to a good Cause, shall at any time engage them in Sufferings and Afflictions. For says he, <hi>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which last Words (as our Saviour afterwards explains them) contain not only a Promise of Heavenly Happiness in general, but of a greater Degree and Measure of it, and intitle the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers for Religion, those who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Persecution for Righteousness sake, to a more than ordinary weight of Glory. So that hence arise two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to be distinctly consider'd:</p>
                     <p>First, That there are Degrees in that Glory which shall be the Reward of Saints in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59847:110"/>
Secondly, That one of the Highest Degrees of it shall be the Reward of those who suffer Persecution for the sake of Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>That there are Degrees of Glory, tho by some a much contested, is yet I think a most certain and unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth. The certainty of which I shall endeavour to establish upon these few evident Principles.</p>
                     <p>First, I consider that this must needs be the natural and necessary result of things. And here I desire only it may be granted me, That there are some certain Dispositions of Soul necessary to relish and enjoy the Happiness of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This I think is a Supposition that need not be disputed, since even to the enjoyment of sensible good there is requisite a proportion of sense. The Ear must be tunably set to relish the Charms of Music, and the Palate must be rightly disposed to find any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the sweetest Delicacies. And if these grosser Objects that have a more natural Affinity with the Organs of Sense, and strike hard upon them,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59847:111"/>
will not yet affect them without some more <hi>particular inward</hi> Preparation; there is greater reason to think that the Delights of Heaven that are so far above the Level of our Natures, so pure and so refined, cannot be tasted but by a suitable Disposition of Soul. The necessity of which appears so great, that I am apt to think (as a late worthy Writer of our Church <note place="margin">Practical Discourse of Death, p. 76.</note> does) that the whole Moral Excellency of some Vertues is their Qualification for the Happiness of another State, they being of no great consequence to the present Order of this World.</p>
                     <p>Well then, if certain Dispositions of Soul be required to fit us for the Happiness of Heaven, then it follows, that the more disposed any Soul is for the Glories of Heaven, the more happy she must needs be in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. And if so, then 'twill be necessary to say, either that all Souls are equally disposed, which would be to contradict the Sense and Experience of the whole World; or if one be better disposed than another, then in proportion one will also be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than another. The Consequence is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59847:111"/>
plain and necessary, If there must be a Moral Qualification of Soul to fit a Man for Happiness, then certainly the more qualify'd the more happy. Which has made me often wonder at the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inconsistency of those who allowing a virtuous Frame and Temper of Mind to be a Natural Disposition for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, do yet deny greater Degrees of Glory to greater of Degrees Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Indeed if a Moral Disposition of Soul did not fit us for Happiness, the case were otherwise; but since tis allowed to do that, I cannot conceive but that the Degrees of Happiness must follow the Degrees of Virtue. And indeed how can he that thinks at all, think otherwise, but that a Soul well purged and purified, that has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon a long course of Mortification, till she is throughly awakened into the Divine Lise and Likeness, and is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to <hi>the measure of the stature of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 4 13.</note> 
                        <hi>fulness of Christ,</hi> must find more Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the Vision of God, than a Soul just pregnant with the Divine Form, and that carries away with her only the first Rudiments of Spiritual Life! Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Soul which is most like God will be most happy in the fruition of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59847:112"/>
him. This is no more than what may be concluded from the meer natural necessity of things, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to any Positive Order of God about it. But neither may that be supposed to be wanting. For</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I consider that the same may be concluded from the Justice and Goodness of God as well as from the Nature of things. And first, from his Justice. Not that there lies an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> and <hi>Antecedent</hi> Obligation upon God to bestow greater Rewards upon greater Saints; for if Eternal Life it self be (as the Apostle represents it) <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> 
                        <hi>the Gift of God,</hi> no doubt but the Degrees of it are so too. God cannot become a Debtor to Man, or to any other Creature but by a free Act of his own. He may indeed oblige himself to us by a voluntary ingagement, but we cannot pass any strict Obligation upon him by any thing we can do; and to talk of <hi>Meriting</hi> in this sense is no less than Blasphemy, and I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that any man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood himself, ever thus held it.</p>
                     <p>But tho Good be not absolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59847:112"/>
to his Creatures, but only upon Supposition, and consequently cannot be Absolutely bound to reward grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Saints with greater Happiness, yet if we once suppose him to ingage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by Promise to be a Rewarder of Virtue in general; there will be all the reason in the World to think that by the same Promise he has also <hi>Virtually</hi> obliged himself to crown the greatest Virtues with the greatest Rewards. For since the reason why he ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Rewarder of good Men was not (as is already precaution'd) any Absolute Merit of theirs, but only to shew his great Love of Virtue and Goodness, tis reasonable to conclude that by the same Motives, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the same End, he also ingaged himself to be a more liberal Rewarder of greater Saints. Since this is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a means to shew his Love to Virtue and Goodness as the other. And therefore tho we should grant (which yet in the sequel will appear otherwise) that God had expresly promised only to be a Rewarder of Virtue in general, yet since the End and Reason of this His ingagement was to shew His great Love to Virtue, this would be warrant
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59847:113"/>
enough to conclude, That he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and virtually ingaged Himself to have an equal regard to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Degrees of Virtue, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them after their respective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions.</p>
                     <p>But to rise higher yet, tho God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in <hi>Strict Justice</hi> obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the best of our Services but by an ingagement of his own, much less to reward them with Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet I think there must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a kind of <hi>Congruity</hi> or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingness</hi> on God's part so to do, even Antecedently to any Promise or Covenant. There is indeed no strict Obligation till after some Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but there may, and I think must be a Congruity even before. For tho there be no Proportion of <hi>Equivalence</hi> between our best Works and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Heaven, and consequently <note place="margin">Le Blanc Theses Theolog. p. 590.</note> no possible room for any strict Merit, yet I cannot but think with a person of great Judgment and Moderation, that there is a proportion of <hi>Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;</hi> that is, as he afterwards explains it, tho there be nothing strictly due from God to the Services of good
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59847:113"/>
Men, yet tis highly worthy of God to reward them; upon which account they also may be said to be worthy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Rev. 3.4.</note> to that of the <hi>Apocalyps, They shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed unless we will admit of this <hi>Congruity,</hi> I do not see how to justifie the sense of that Apostolical <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6</note> Maxim, <hi>He that comes to God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi> Tis plain that the Apostle here speaks of the Grounds of Natural Religion, and what should move and qualify a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Man to make his first Addresses to God. This he tells you is to believe the Being and the Providence of God, that he <hi>is,</hi> and that he is a <hi>Rewarder.</hi> But now how shall a Heathen Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is a Rewarder? By any Revelation of his? But that he is not yet supposed to admit. He must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude it by his own natural Reason, by considering the Idea and Nature of God, the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that which may naturally be known of him, and how becoming it is for so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Being to reward those who apply themselves seriously and heartily to him.</p>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59847:115"/>
Well then, if it be reasonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon the Stock of natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that God is a Rewarder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being assured of it by any Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation (which is here supposed in the Heathen's Case) then it follows, that even antecedently to any Promise of God there is a great Congruity, tho not a strict Obligation that he should be a Rewarder. For otherwise what ground could the Heathen Man have so to Conclude or Believe? This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity therefore must of necessity be allowed, however apt some may be to startle at it, when the word <hi>Merit</hi> is put before it. This is <hi>Prejudice,</hi> but the thing it self as I have here stated and explained it, is both innocent and necessary to be granted. And if there be such a Congruity that God should be a Rewarder in general, then by the same Proportion it follows that he should dispense his Rewards accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Degrees of Virtue. There being certainly at least as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity in this as in the other.</p>
                     <p>And besides this, there is no reason to question but that the <hi>Goodness</hi> of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59847:115"/>
God which in it self is infinite, and which is already supposed to exert it self so liberally as to reward the little and defective Services of a short Life with Eternal Glories, will also be so consistent with it self, as to reward those most, who have pressed forward to the highest Degrees of Sanctity. And were it not for this I do not see what incouragement there is for Men to <hi>Excel</hi> in Virtue, which yet the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God obliges us to suppose. For what should move a Man to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently good, considering how difficult it is to be so, and how little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd in this World, if it were not in order to a greater Reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</p>
                     <p>If it be said, that the least Degree of Glory is a sufficient incouragement for the greatest Degree of Virtue; I grant it is so, were that greatest Degree of Vertue the necessary Condition of it, without which the least Glory could not be obtain'd. But since less will suffice for that (as must be admitted, unless you will say that all glorified Saints are equally good and vertuous) I do not see how there can be sufficient
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59847:116"/>
Incouragement for higher Attainments, but only upon the Supposition of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Rewards. Which therefore from the Goodness as well as Justice of God there is good Reason to conclude.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly and lastly, From Principles of Reasen I appeal to Holy Scripture, which I think will be found to speak as fully and plainly to this purpose as may reasonably be desired. For there we find that <hi>God will render to every man</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2.6.</note> 
                        <hi>according to his deeds.</hi> And again, that <hi>every one shall receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> 
                        <hi>whether it be good or bad.</hi> And lest this should be refer'd to the general Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Rewards and Punishments, more expresly it is said, that <hi>he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor 9.6.</note> and that <hi>he that sows bountifully shall reap also bountisully.</hi> The same again is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly represented under the Parable of the <hi>Talents</hi> committed to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Servants, who were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally <note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> rewarded according to their several Improvements. And tho Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables are not allowed to conclude <hi>throughout,</hi> yet certainly as to the thing directly and purposely intended by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59847:116"/>
them they are as conclusive as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms of Speech, which in this Parable must be the different Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Rewards hereafter or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Again, the Scripture mentions different Seats of Glory, <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>house are many Mansions,</hi> says our Saviour, that is, Mansions of distinct Ranks and Orders; For 'twould have been but a small piece of News for our Saviour to have told his Disciples, that in Heaven there were a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mansions in number. Nor would this be so suitable to the Introduction of his Discourse, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, we read of particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards belonging to Men of particular Characters, as of a <hi>Prophet's Reward,</hi> and a <hi>Righteous Man's Reward. He that receives a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10.41.</note> 
                        <hi>shall receive a Prophet's Reward,</hi> says our Saviour. Why a Prophet's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if there be not some special Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward assign'd to a Prophet? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, tis plainly intimated that every Degree, and every Act of Virtue shall have its proper Recompence, where tis said, <hi>Whosoever shall give to drink
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59847:117"/>
unto one of these little ones a Cup of cold water only in the Name of a Disciple,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 10.42.</note> 
                        <hi>shall in no wise lose his Reward.</hi> To which purpose there is also a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press place in the <hi>Proverbs, He that hath pity on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord, and look what he layeth out, it shall</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note> 
                        <hi>be paid him again.</hi> Where there is a Reward promised not only to Charity in general, but to every Degree of it. And if every Degree of Virtue shall be particularly rewarded, it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows that the greater our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are the more abundant shall be our Reward, otherwise some Degrees of Virtue would go unrewarded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Supposition.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be added, that a greater Degree of Blessedness is every where attributed to Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, &amp;c. when their Glorification is expressed by their <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down</hi> in the Kingdom of God, and that of other Saints, by their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down with them, in allusion to the Eastern manner of Feasting. This Priviledge of a more eminent Seat is particularly assigned to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> by our Saviour, when he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59847:117"/>
tells us that <hi>Many shall come from the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 8.11.</note> 
                        <hi>East and the West, and shall sit down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> And so again to the Apostles, <hi>Verily I say unto you, that ye</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 19.28</note> 
                        <hi>which have followed me in the regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Son of Man shall sit in the Throne of his Glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve Thrones.</hi> It cannot be denied but that this is meant of the Apostles only, and not of his Disciples at large, because of the Twelve Thrones. And why should Twelve of them only be specified, if they were not to be Thrones of an higher Order? Or what <hi>Extraordinary</hi> would our Saviour have promised to his Disciples? And this is further confirmed by St. <hi>John,</hi> who in the Description of the Heavenly <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> makes the twelve Apostles the Foundations of the City. <hi>And the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 21.14</note> 
                        <hi>Wall of the City</hi> (says he) <hi>had twelve Foundations, and in them the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</hi> A place exactly parallel to that of the Twelve Thrones.</p>
                     <p>To dispatch all in a word, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Saints in Glory is expressed in Scripture by their being <hi>made like
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59847:118"/>
like unto the Angels;</hi> and 'tis of it self <note place="margin">Mat. 22.30</note> reasonable to think that the same Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Order and Proportion shall be observ'd in both these Sons of God, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> But now 'tis most certain that the Angels have their different Orders and Hierarchies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distinguish'd into Thrones and Dominions, Principalities and Powers, and into Angels and Arch-Angels, and that some of them sit nearer to the Throne of God than others. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Talmudists</hi> call <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, <hi>The Prince of Faces,</hi> or the Prince of the Presence, being (as they say) so near to the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as to be admitted to sit down by him, and register the good Actions of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> And says the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> of himself, <hi>I am</hi> Gabriel <hi>that stand</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luke 1.19</note> 
                        <hi>in the presence of God.</hi> He distinguishes himself as much by his <hi>Station</hi> as by his <hi>Name.</hi> And the Vision of <hi>Isaia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents one of the Angelic Orders co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Faces with their Wings, which supposes them to be nearer than Ordinary to the Presence of God, so as not to be able to abide the Glory of it, without the help of a <hi>Veil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:59847:118"/>
Since therefore there is such a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the Angelical Stations, and our future Condition is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by theirs, this alone were enough to put us upon thinking that our Glorification must admit of the like gradual Diversity. And 'tis no more than what natural Order and Decency seems to require, that the Members of Christ's Mystical Body should retain the same Diversity in the other World that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ascribes to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> them in this, that there should still be an <hi>Eye</hi> and an <hi>Hand,</hi> an <hi>Head</hi> and a <hi>Foot,</hi> more Honourable and less Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Parts: Whereof the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heaven exhibits a very convenient Emblem, in which one Star differs from another Star in Glory. And after all, tho there were no plain Proof to be had for this, yet there is such an obvious Congruity in the thing as would <hi>convince</hi> where it could not <hi>silence.</hi> And I believe there is no Man, tho never so forward to raise Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against what has been contended for, and to equalize the Glories of Heaven (for the other World has its <hi>Levellers</hi> as well as this) that could yet
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59847:119"/>
obtain Leave of his own Modesty to expect as bright a Crown as the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far asserted the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees of Glory, which I have the longer insisted upon, because 'tis a very <hi>practical</hi> as well as <hi>notional</hi> Theory, being of great consequence to the encouragement of Heroic Goodness, I come now to consider the second thing proposed, that one of the Highest Degrees of Glory shall be the Reward of those who suffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for the sake of Righteousness, that is, of <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And here for the Eviction of this, having already shewn that there are Degrees of Glory in proportion to the degrees of Vertue, I think 'twill suffice to shew that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom is one of the highest Degrees of Vertue. For the Argument redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Form will stand thus:</p>
                     <p>An higher Degree of Vertue shall have an higher Degree of Glory.</p>
                     <p>But Martyrdom is an higher Degree of Vertue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:59847:119"/>
Therefore Martyrdom shall have an higher Degree of Glory.</p>
                     <p>The first Proposition is what we have been proving hitherto. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Conclusion therefore there needs only a Proof of the second. Here therefore my business shall be to give a short representation of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Honour of Martyrdom was so great in the Primitive Church, that even the Commonness of it, which depretiates every thing else, could not diminish from its Veneration. It was then thought of so great Excellence, as to supply the room of Baptism, and the new Convert, whose early and sudden execution prevented his solemn Admission into the Christian Church, was yet esteemed a very good Member of Christ's Mystical Body, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with his best Saints in Glory everlasting. The same Honour to Martyrs made them chuse their Tombs for the places of their Devotion; and God himself was pleased to signalize his special regard to these his Saints,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59847:120"/>
and to shew how precious their Death <note place="margin">St. <hi>Ferem</hi> against <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius,</hi> Book 4.</note> was in his sight, by making the places of their Rest the Stage of his Miracles.</p>
                     <p>Nor is there any thing in all this more strange and extraordinary, than the Excellency of the Vertue it self which was thus honoured. A general representation of which is thus given by the Pen of a Celebrated Writer of the Roman Church. A Church which, <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Senault</hi> Christian Man, p. 336</note> by the way, has made more Martyrs, and has fewer than any in the World. But she has dealt long enough in Blood, to be able to form an Idea of Martyrdom from the Martyrs which she has made. <hi>We see</hi> (says one of her Sons) <hi>nothing in the Church more noble than Martyrdom. 'Tis the highest jorm of Vertue, the last Expression of Charity; and when a Man has shed his Blood and parted with his Life for Jesus Christ, there is not any instance that can further be expected from his Love, Justly therefore may we acknowledge nothing more August in Religion than Martyrs. They are the Heroes of Christianity, the gallant Men of this State, the Noblest Parts of this mystical Body. There is no greatness that gives not way to their</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59847:120"/>
Dignity; whatever we admire is below their worth, and according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one of the wisest Fathers of the Church (<hi>he means St.</hi> Cyprian) 'tis more to be a Martyr than to be an Apostle. Neither hath any thing been ever more Honour'd in the World. Heaven has wrought an hundred Miracles to discover their Innocence, wild Beasts have respected them, the Flames have spared their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Tyrants have admired them, and many times their Executioners have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Disciples, in so much that these renowned Champions had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be afraid of Vain-glory, at the same time that God deliver'd them from Sorrow. <hi>The Description is handsom and elegant, but what</hi> they Describe, <hi>they have left to</hi> our Church <hi>to</hi> Practise.</p>
                     <p>But more particularly and distinctly, to take the just <hi>Height</hi> of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Martyrdom, we must first lay down a Measure whereby the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of any Vertue is to be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. Now the Excellency of any Vertue may be measured either from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Object will'd, or from the Degree of <hi>willing</hi> it. And
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59847:121"/>
two Persons that are equally Vertuous with respect to the good that is will'd, may yet be very unequally so with respect to the Degree of Willing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one may will the same Good, and the same degree of Good more intensely and affectionately than the other. Thus for instance, <hi>Virginity</hi> may be said to be more excellent than a Conjugal Life, and that tho you do suppose the States themselves to be equally Pure, because 'tis harder to preserve Virginal than Conjugal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity. So that tho the Degrees of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be supposed the same in both States, yet because they are more strongly will'd in the one than in the other, the Virgin may be said to be more pure than the Conjugated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; not perhaps as a Lover of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Purity, but as a stronger and more pertinacious Lover of the <hi>same,</hi> which he adheres to under more disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Circumstances.</p>
                     <p>And this I take to be the Case of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> whose general Excellency above other Virtues consists in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Inclination or Adhesion to good, which in the Martyr is supposed
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59847:121"/>
to be so strong as to determin him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer death, and the utmost Extremity of it, than to transgress what he knows to be his Duty. And indeed if we consider how sweet Life is, and how naturally a verse we are to Death even in the most easy, much more under the most terrifying Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it must needs be a very strong and peremptory adhesion to Virtue that shall ingage a Man to quit his Life rather than his Innocence, and Dy rather than Offend.</p>
                     <p>But to be more particular yet. To recommend the Excellency of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is a Concurrence of the greatest Virtues. The most eminent of which (for 'twere endless to reckon up all) are the greatest <hi>Faith,</hi> the greatest <hi>Love,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Courage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, The greatest <hi>Faith.</hi> There is indeed no Faith like the Faith of a Martyr. This is that Faith which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes the World, and all that is terrible in it; That Faith to which all things are possible and nothing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and that removes <hi>Fear,</hi> which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59847:122"/>
is more than to remove <hi>Mountains.</hi> This is that Faith which is more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Substance of things hoped for, and the Argument or Demonstration of things not seen. This noble Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith is never so fully verify'd as in the Faith of a Martyr. This is that Faith that turns the End of the <hi>Perspective,</hi> and shortens the interval of Time, and makes the future World present, and represents Heaven open, and the Son of Man standing on the Right Hand of God ready to defend, and receive, and reward those that will be content to indure the Cross, and despise both the Shame and the Pain of it for his sake. And all this with such certainty and fulness of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that tis ready to change its Nature, through too much Evidence, and to cease to be any longer Faith, and commence Science or Revelation. For indeed nothing less than this, than such a full down-bearing Perswasion can well inable a Man to drink off this bitter Cup, and to be <hi>Baptized</hi> at this <hi>Bloody Font.</hi> It must certainly be a strange Degree of Affiance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence which that Man has in God, who can resign up all that is good and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59847:122"/>
pleasant, and submit himself to all that is evil and terrible in this World, and meet Death with all its Natural and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Terrors, and trust God for his Reward in another Life. What a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, victorious Faith is this! and what a noble Idea must such a person have of God! The Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is highly celebrated in Scripture for his readiness to offer up his Son at the Command of God. And no doubt 'twas a very rare and extraordinary Faith that could reconcile him to such an unnatural undertaking. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Faith of a Martyr is very much beyond this, as much as tis an higher act of Reliance to trust God with ones own Soul, and for ones E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happiness, than for a Posterity to inherit a promised Land.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The greatest <hi>Love.</hi> There is indeed no Love like the Love of a Martyr. This is that Love which is properly stronger than Death, and which is so perfect as to cast out or overcome all Fear. This is a Degree of Love truly <hi>Seraphic,</hi> and which comes the nearest of any to the Love of Angels and beatify'd Spirits. If
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59847:123"/>
there be any such thing as Seraphic Love in the World, this is it. Not only because tis bright and flaming, noble and generous, but because tis a Love that gets above all the Bodily Passions, silences all the motions of the lower Life, and makes the Man act as if he were all Soul and Mind. More particularly, Martyrdom is the greatest Love of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and the greatest Love of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Martyrdom is the greatest Love of <hi>Virtue,</hi> because that is valued at a higher rate than Life it self, which the Martyr will rather lose than Sin. Our Saviour makes it the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Argument of Friendship, for a Man to lay down his Life for his Friend. And so doubtless it is. For tis then plain that the Man sets a greater value upon his Friend, than he does upon Life. And the like may be said of the Martyr, that he sets a higher value upon Virtue, then he does upon Life, which yet is so dear that (as one observes, who for our safety too well understands the secret Springs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Human Nature) <hi>all that a man has will he give for it.</hi> And yet <note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note>
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:59847:123"/>
this very Life for which a Man will give all things, is by the Martyr given as a Sacrifice to his Innocence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Martyrdom is the greatest Love of <hi>God,</hi> because the Martyr sets so high a Price upon him that he will chuse rather to dye than forfeit the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his Favour and Blessedness, and may truly say with the Psalmist, <note place="margin">Psal. 63.4.</note> 
                        <hi>Thy loving Kindness is better than Life.</hi> Tis an easie thing for a Man in a warm gusty fit of Devotion, when the Evil day is far off, and no probable danger of any competition between his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and his Life, to say that he sets a greater Value upon the loving Kindness of God than upon Life. You know who did so. <hi>Tho I should dy with thee yet I will not deny thee,</hi> that is, (to reduce the words to a more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Order) I would rather dy than deny thee. This is easily said, but not so easily done, as the Event too sadly shew'd. But he that says he values the loving Kindness of God more than Life, and dies rather than forfeit it, may be believ'd. For what greater Love can there be than this, or what higher Instance or Tryal of it? The
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59847:124"/>
greatest Love of God was to dy for Man. God could not signalize his Love to Man by any higher instance than by dying for him; and the greatest Love of Man is to dy for God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The greatest <hi>Courage.</hi> For there is also no Courage like the Courage of a Martyr. He fears no Evil but only Sin and Damnation, which are just and reasonable Objects of Fear, and will undergo any other Evils to avoid these, which is the truest and the greatest Courage. For where is there any like it? I would not have the Man of Honour or Duelist, of all the Pretenders to Courage in the World, offer at a Competition here. For tis most certain that he abuses the notion of Courage as well as that of Honour. His Courage is to dare to sin and be damn'd that he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Reproach of Cowardize, that is, not to fear and avoid what with all possible concern he should, and to fear and avoid what he should not. And if this be <hi>Courage,</hi> I must then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that I do not know what is <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:59847:124"/>
But neither may the <hi>Military</hi> Man be a Competitor here. 'Tis I confess great and brave for a Man in a just and laudable Cause, for the Defence of his Prince and Country, to fall a Sacrifice at the Head of an Army. And the <hi>Herald</hi>'s Office supposes as much. But there are also some Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays that qualifie the Glory even of this Action. For the Man is supposed to be engaged with multitudes and numbers which <hi>incourage</hi> as well as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,</hi> and to fight in a Heat, when his Spirits are raised, and his Blood runs high, so as scarce to be able to feel a Shot or a Stab that shall be given him, and to want Opportunity of Retreat, and to be kept from reflecting upon his Danger by Noise, Tumult and Confusion, and to have the Spur of Emulation, and the incentive of Anger, sometimes of Hatred and Revenge, and which is more than all the rest, the Hopes of a safe come off at last. Believe me, this goes a great way, and I question whether among those that venture themselves in War, one of ten thousand would do so, if he knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand that he should certainly die in the Field. But now to have a Man go
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59847:125"/>
alone and in cold Blood to the <hi>Stake,</hi> or to the <hi>Scaffold;</hi> When in every Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of his Advance 'tis still in his Power by compliance to recede from his dreadful undertaking, and there calmly and deliberately submit himself to <hi>certain</hi> Execution, and <hi>feel himself die</hi> with all his Thoughts, Reflections and Passions about him; this is Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage indeed, and such a Noble Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as might well deseve to be a <hi>Theatre</hi> to Angels and Men, yea even to God himself.</p>
                     <p>These are some of those great things that illustrate the excellency of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, and shew it to be one of the highest Degrees of Vertue, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it is intitled to an higher Degree of Glory: Which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture also expresly makes to be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Martyrs, who are said to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure tortures, and not to accept of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>that they might obtain a better Resurrection.</hi> A Better Resurrection, that is, a Resurrection to a Better State of Happiness, that being the only Measure whereby one Resurrection may be said to be Better than another. And says the Angel to St. <hi>John</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:59847:125"/>
those who are clothed with white Robes, and had Palms in their Hands, <hi>These are they which came out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rev. 7.14.</note> 
                        <hi>great Tribulation, and have wash'd their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple. And he that sitteth on the Throne shall dwell among them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now since there is a brighter Crown of Glory prepared for Martyrs, and those that suffer Persecution for the sake of Righteousness, all that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remains is to commend from the Premises these two Practical Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</p>
                     <p>First, That we entertain no hard Thoughts of the Justice or Goodness of God for suffering so many severe Persecutions in the Christian Church, some whereof were violent, as under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; some Fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent by Hereticks, as <hi>Arius, Nestorius,</hi> &amp;c. And some of a mixt nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting both of Fraud and Violence, when both Temporal and Spiritual Power did combine together (as

as now in the Papal See) against the Lord and his Christ. I say we should learn from hence not to censure the ways of God for this, nor to <hi>charge him foolishly,</hi> since there is so plentiful a Reward laid up for those that suffer in the Cause of Righteousness.</p>

                     <p>HAving hitherto Discoursed upon every Beatitude particularly by it self, I think it may not be improper for the further Accomplishment of this Work, to conclude all with a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the Beatitudes in General. Where there are three Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Enquiries that seem to demand Satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>The First is, Concerning the Manner and Way of this Divine Sermon, Why our Lord chose to deliver his Laws and Precepts by the way of <hi>Blessing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Second is, Concerning the Number of the Beatitudes.</p>
                     <p>The Third is, Concerning their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Method.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:59847:127"/>
For Satisfaction to the first Enquiry, I consider first, That Christ who came into the World upon an <hi>Errand</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> the greatest Love that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good God could express to a Creature, and who no doubt had also a Soul well tuned, and a Body well temper'd, and both set to the softest Key of Harmony and Sweetness, was willing to deliver his Laws in the most <hi>indearing</hi> and charming manner that could possibly be, that he might the better recommend both <hi>Himself</hi> and his <hi>Doctrin</hi> to the good Will of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and reconcile them thro the Love of the <hi>Former,</hi> to the Obedience of the <hi>Latter.</hi> Which is a very lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affectation of <hi>Popularity,</hi> first to engage Men's Affections to our <hi>Persons,</hi> that we may the better win them over to the Acceptance and Entertainment of our <hi>Doctrins.</hi> This indeed ought to be the Care and Endeavour of all Preachers; but there was this more particular reason for it in our Lord, because the Love of <hi>his</hi> Person was not only an <hi>Indearment</hi> of Obedience, but also a very considerable <hi>part</hi> and instance of it. He therefore instead of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59847:127"/>
using an <hi>Imperative</hi> Style, by down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right commanding such and such things, chose rather in a more gentle and condescending way to insinuate what was <hi>his</hi> Will, and <hi>our</hi> Duty, by pronouncing them <hi>Blessed</hi> that do so and so.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I consider that our Lord Christ being to act the <hi>Counter-part</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> and to relax the rigour of his Law, by being the Author of a milder Dispensation, thought fit to give an early and a solemn Specimen of his greater Mildness, by varying the Style of his Legislation from that used by <hi>Moses.</hi> And therefore whereas <hi>Moses</hi> deliver'd his Law after an <hi>Imperatorial</hi> way, by saying, <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> do this, and <hi>Thou shalt not</hi> do that: Our Good Lord chose rather to express his Law more tenderly and <hi>Humanly,</hi> by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of those that should observe it. And the rather because <hi>Moses</hi> had arm'd and immured his Law with <hi>Curses</hi> and <hi>Maledictions.</hi> First in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</hi> Secondly, more particularly, by annexing a Curse
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59847:128"/>
to particular Transgressions, as in that famous Commination in the 27 of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> to every Clause of which the People were to say <hi>Amen.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shew of what a different <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> the Christian Institution was from that of <hi>Moses,</hi> our Lord chose to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister his Law in a form of <hi>Blessing,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Cursings;</hi> thereby verifying those farewel words of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon to the Jews, in a larger sense than he intended them, <hi>God having raised up his Son Jesus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 3. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his Inquities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I consider that our Saviour was to deliver a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> a Law that required Love both as the <hi>Matter</hi> and as the <hi>Principle</hi> of Obedience. Love was both the <hi>thing</hi> to be done, and the <hi>Motive</hi> of doing it. The Son of God was to be the great Prophet of Love, Twas reserved for him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Express Image</hi> of him who is Love it self, and therefore the only Master fit to teach it. This was the <note place="margin">Luk. 12, 49</note> 
                        <hi>Fire</hi> which he came to <hi>kindle upon Earth,</hi> the most ardent and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love towards God and towards
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59847:128"/>
Men. This was to be the Substance and Accomplishment of his Law, and the distinguishing Badge of those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd Devotion to it. <hi>By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples,</hi> &amp;c. But now 'twould not have been agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for a Law of Love to begin its recommendation from such Arguments as should work upon the more <hi>Servile</hi> part of Man. <hi>Moses</hi> indeed deliver'd his Law with all the Circumstances and Arguments of <hi>Fear,</hi> and the Nature of his Law required such an Address, but 'twas fit that a Law of Love should come recommended to the World by Motives of <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly and Lastly, It may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consisted that this solemn Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Lord upon the Mount con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of Precepts. So very sublime and elevated, and withal so strange and unusual, as having had not Credit, if Reception, in the World before, that 'twas but necessary for the Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prejudice to set a Beatitude in the <hi>Front</hi> of every Duty, and to bribe the Passions of the Hearers with a forward Anticipation of Happiness, lest Men should say of the <hi>Commands</hi>
                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:59847:129"/>
of Christ, as the Prophet brings them in saying of his <hi>Person,</hi> that <hi>there is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Isai. 53.2.</note> 
                        <hi>no Form nor Comeliness, nor Beauty in them that we should desire them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For these and other like Reasons that may be added, our Divine and gracious Lawgiver was pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Laws rather by asserting the <hi>Blessedness</hi> than the <hi>Obligation</hi> of them. Which while I consider, I cannot but enter into a profound Admiration of the strange Goodness and Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Lord, that he should so far lay aside the Majesty of a <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> that he might the better act the part of a <hi>Friend</hi> and of a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> And to se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this Consideration the more home upon our Minds, let us by the aids of Fancy draw the Curtains of this Intellectual Scene, and imagin to our selves that we saw our Saviour seated upon the <hi>Mount of Blessing,</hi> with his Eyes devoutly sets towards Heaven, and his Hands affectionately stretch'd forth over the adoring and attentive Multitude, and with Looks full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the good of Souls, gravely and pathetically distilling down upon them the Dew of his Heavenly Doctrin
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59847:129"/>
and tempering his Authority with the Style of Goodness and Kindness, as well as his Divinity with the veil of Flesh. Who can with sufficient Wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template so pleasing a Scene of Love and Sweetness! And who, that well contemplates it, can find in his heart to transgress a Law delivered with so much Condescension, or offend a Lawgiver so infinitely, so amazingly good!</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the <hi>Number</hi> of the Beatitudes, why our Lord should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign <hi>Eight</hi> and no more, tis not easie to offer what shall satisfie all Minds. Were I minded to amuse my Reader, I could tell him that in the <hi>Mystic Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> 8 is the Number of Justice and Fulness, because it is first of all divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Numbers equally even, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into 2 Fours, which Division again is by the same reason made into 2 times 2, that is, 2 times 2 twice reckon'd. And by reason of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Divisions it received the Name of <hi>Justice.</hi> But I do not believe <note place="margin">Mr. Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Rosie-Crucian <hi>Infallible Actioms. Pag.</hi> 73.</note> our Saviour intended any <hi>Rosie-Crucian Mystery</hi> in this matter, tho a certain Gentleman of that Order would fain
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59847:130"/>
insinuate that he did, reckoning this among other Observations upon the Number 8, that there are 8 kinds of Blessed Men in the lesser World, <hi>The Poor in Spirit, the Mourners, the Meek, they that hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> &amp;c. But I think all that can here be warrantably and safely said is, that our Saviour intending (as he signify'd by his Ascent into the Mount) a Discourse of Perfection and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, consisting of such Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as were most perfective of Human Nature, and for the Practice of which he himself was most exemplary, was by his Design concern'd to instance only in the most select and excellent Duties both to God and Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon premising Humility as being a Duty common to both, and withal the Foundation of all the rest, he found remaining three extraordinary Duties relating to Man, <hi>Meekness, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulness</hi> and <hi>Peaceableness;</hi> and four to God, <hi>Mourning for Sin, Hungring and thirsting after Righteousness, Purity of Heart, and Suffering of Persecution for Conscience Sake.</hi> So that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour seems rather to have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a natural Measure, and to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59847:130"/>
take things as he found them, than to proceed by any Arbitrary Measure of his own. And this I think is the only ground of his assigning eight Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and not that he had any <hi>Fondness</hi> to the <hi>Number</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>Then lastly, as to the <hi>Order</hi> of the <note place="margin">Pag. <hi>114.</hi>
                        </note> Beatitudes Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Catechism</hi> remarks two ching. First, That the Grace first named is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principal Grace, and the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the rest, as he there shews in particular. Secondly, That there is an interchangeable Mixture of these Graces one towards God, and another towards Man, so interweav'd, that the first respects God, the next Man, the next God again, till you come to the last which respects God again. To Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify which Remarque he begins his Computation not from <hi>Humility,</hi> which is a general Fundamental Grace, but from <hi>Mourning,</hi> which is the first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one, and respecting God. So that the First and the Last both respect God, who is the true <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the First and the Last, and those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween divide between our Neighbour and God. To teach us, that to God
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59847:131"/>
belongs the <hi>Chief,</hi> the <hi>First</hi> and the <hi>Last</hi> of our Love, and that our Neighbour is to be regarded after and in subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to God. To this I further add, that there is also a gradual and descending connexion between all the Beatitudes, the latter still depending upon the former, as well as all the rest upon the first. For from Humility 'tis an easie descent to Mourning. When a Man takes a just Survey of his own Nothingness and Unworthiness by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating himself as a Creature and a Sinner, 'twill be so natural for him to mourn and be sorrowful, that the danger is of being overwhelm'd with too much Sorrow. Then from Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tis easie to advance to Meekness, it being one of the chief Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Sorrow to soften and melt down the Spirit, which when meekly disposed, will also be in a fair dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Hungring and Thirsting after Righteousness. <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteousness of God,</hi> says the Apostle, that is, is no way a Friend to the promoting of Righteousness; whence on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we may gather, that Meekness is a Friend to Righteousness; As it
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59847:131"/>
must needs be, since a calm and sedate Soul is most fit for attending to the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and for admitting the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Holiness,</hi> which as the Jews say, will not rest upon a <hi>turbulent Mind.</hi> And when once the Soul is wrought up to a quick and lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of what is Good and Righteous, 'tis then an easie step to Merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it being a very just and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to shew Mercy. Which also leads a Man to Purity of Heart, as that without which even Mercy it self will not find Mercy. From whence the very next step is to Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to which nothing more conduces than a Pure Heart, free from those Lusts and Sensual Affections which are the Seeds of Strife and Contention. And when a Man has attain'd to a peaceable temper, then is he fit for the greatest thing in the World, to be a Martyr, and will readily suffer Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution rather than occasion any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance either in the Church or State, and with the generous Prophet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be thrown overboard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease the Tempest. So admirably well contrived and full of Order was our Saviour's Discourse, as it became him
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59847:132"/>
who was the Wisdom of God, as well as the Light of Men, and in whom were <hi>hid all the Treasures of Wisdom</hi>

                        <hi>and Knowledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All now that further remains, is that by a strict Conformity to these Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Measures of Christian Perfection we endeavour to bring our selves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Number of these Blessed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whom our Saviour pronounces Happy here, and to whom he will say in a more Emphatical Accent, <hi>Come ye Blessed,</hi> hereafter.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>YOU obliged me so highly by acquainting me with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of so rare a Curiosity as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book, that should I dispute your Commands when you desire my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, I should hazard the Credit of my <hi>Gratitude,</hi> as much as by my ill discharging them I am like to do that of my <hi>Judgment.</hi> This, Sir, already reduces me to an even Poise. But to this the just Authority you have over me, and the Right your other Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give you to all the Service I can do, being added, and thrown into the Scale, do quite weigh it down, and leave no room for any Deliberation, whether I should obey you or no. Without therefore any further Demur or Delay I shall apply my self to the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59847:134"/>
Task you set me, in giving you my <hi>Free Censure</hi> of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Essay, which I shall do by reflecting upon what I think most liable to Exception in the same Order as the things lie before me.</p>
                  <p>Introduct. Pag. 1. Sect. 1. <hi>The Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing like the Eye, whilest it makes us see and perceive all other things, takes no notice of it self.</hi> What the Ingenious Author intends in this Period, or how to make out any consistent Sense of it, I do not understand. For if his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, That the Understanding while it is intent upon other things, cannot at that time take notice of it self; this comes to no more, than that when 'tis intent upon one thing it cannot attend to another, which is too easily and obviously true of all <hi>Finite</hi> Powers to be any great Discovery. But if his meaning be (as it rather seems, because of the Particle (All) and the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison here used) that the Understanding like the Eye, tho it maks us see all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, yet it takes no notice of it self, then 'tis a Contradiction to his whole following Work, which upon this Supposition must needs be very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably</hi> undertaken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59847:134"/>
Introduct. Pag. 2. Sect. 3. <hi>First I shall enquire into the Original of those Ideas which a Man observes,</hi> &amp;c. But sure by all the Laws of Method in the World, he ought <hi>first</hi> to have Defined what he meant by Ideas, and to have acquainted us with their <hi>Nature,</hi> before he proceeded to account for their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. For how can any Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be form'd with any certainty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an Idea, that it is or is not <hi>Innate,</hi> that it does or does not come in at the Senses, before the meaning of the Word Idea be stated, and the nature of the thing, at least in general, be understood? If the Nature of Ideas were but once made known, our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes would quickly be at an end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Original, whether from the Senses or not: But till that be done, all further Discourse about them is but to talk in the <hi>Dark.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to have been his <hi>first,</hi> and indeed <hi>main</hi> Business to have given us an account of the Nature of Ideas. And yet this is not only neglected in its proper place, but wholly omitted and passed over in deep silence; which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59847:135"/>
I cannot but remark, as a <hi>Fundamental</hi> defect in this Work.</p>
                  <p>In the three following Chapters our Author sets himself to prove that there are no <hi>Innate Principles.</hi> But before I consider whether there be or no, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise this double Remarque. First, That a thing may be false in it self, and yet not so because, or in vertue of such an Argument. Secondly, That tho a thing be really false, yet it may not become such a Man to deny the Existence of it, who by some other Principles of his may be obliged to hold the contrary. The first of these argues the Writer guilty of <hi>Inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> The Second of <hi>Inconsistency.</hi> Upon both which Accounts this other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very ingenious Writer seems in this part to be chargeable. Which from the Sequel I leave to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                  <p>His First Argument against <hi>Innate Principles</hi> is taken from the want of Universal Consent. <hi>There are,</hi> says he, Pag. 5. Sect. 4. <hi>No Principles to which all Mankind give an universal Assent.</hi> But in the first place how can this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:59847:135"/>
say so, since in several places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he resolves that Ready and prone Assent which is given to certain Propositions upon the first Proposal, into the <hi>Self-evidence</hi> of them? There are then even according to him <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident</hi> Propositions. And will he say that Self-evident Propositions are not universally assented to? How then are they Self-evident? There must be therefore, according to him, some Principles to which all Mankind <hi>do</hi> give an universal Consent. I do not say that this proves them <hi>Innate,</hi> but only that there are such Propositions.</p>
                  <p>Well, but how does he prove there are no such? why, he instances in some of the most Celebrated, and says <hi>pag.</hi> 5. Sect. 5. that <hi>All Children and Ideots have not the least apprehension or thought of them; and the want of that is enough to destroy universal consent.</hi> Now I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought that Universality of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent had been sufficiently secured by the Consent of all, and the Dissent of none that were capable of either. And what then have we to do with <hi>Ideots</hi> and <hi>Children?</hi> Do any or all of these <hi>Dissent</hi> or think otherwise? No,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59847:136"/>
that he will not say, because they think not at all, having (as he says) not the <hi>least Apprehension or Thought of them.</hi> And how then does the want of their <hi>Snffrage</hi> destroy universal Consent, when all Persons that think at all about such Propositions, think after one and the same way?</p>
                  <p>The most therefore that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor can mean by want of Universal Consent, is that every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son does not <hi>actually Assent.</hi> This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be granted him from the Instance of <hi>Ideots</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> But then the Question will be about the <hi>Consequence</hi> of his Argument, whether Actual Assent from every Individual be necessary to the Supposition of <hi>Innate Principles?</hi> Or, in other Words, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from there not being any Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which every individual Man gives an actual Assent, it follows that there are no Innate Truths. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is of Opinion that it does. <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. Sect. 5. <hi>It seems to me near a Contradiction to say, that there are Truths imprinted on the Soul, which it perceives or understands not.</hi> And again in the same place, <hi>To imprint any thing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59847:136"/>
on the Mind, without the Mind's perceiving it, seems to me hardly intelligible.</hi> And again, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Sect. 24. <hi>That a Truth should be Innate, and yet not assented to, is to me as unintelligible as for a Man to know a Truth, and be ignorant of it at the same time.</hi> Here we have both the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of the Author, and the <hi>Ground</hi> upon which it stands. The Consequence is this. If there be no Truths actually perceiv'd by all Minds, then there are none naturally imprinted. The Proof of it is this. 'Tis impossible that what is imprinted on the Mind, should not be perceiv'd by the Mind. Therefore if there be no Truths actually perceiv'd by all Minds, there are none naturally imprinted. Now on the contrary to this I thus oppose. If there may be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions made on the Mind, whereof we are not conscious, or which we do not perceive, then (by the Authors own measure) the not perception of them is no Argument against such Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Impressions. The Consequence is unexceptionable, not only as clear in it self, but as being the very <hi>Reverse</hi> of the Autho<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s own Argument. And now that there may be such Impressions whereof we are not Conscious, is what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59847:137"/>
the Author himself expresly does own, and what by his Principles he stands obliged to own.</p>
                  <p>First, 'tis what he does expresly own. For, says he, <hi>p.</hi> 38. Sect. 6. <hi>Being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Bodies that perpetually and diversly affect us, variety of Idea's, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care be taken about it or no, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the minds of Children.</hi> And yet they do not perceive them, as he had said before. Therefore by his own Confession there may be an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Ideas where there is no Perception. The same he confesses again, <hi>p.</hi> 61. Sect. 4. <hi>How often may a Man observe in himself, that whilst his mind is intently employ'd in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of some Objects, and curiously sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying some Ideas that are there, it takes no notice of Impressions,</hi> &amp;c. And again, Sect. 5. <hi>I doubt not but Children by the exercise of their Senses about Objects that affect them in the Womb, receive some few Ideas before they are born,</hi> &amp;c. And if before they are born, then certainly before they are conscious of them. There may therefore be Impression without Consciousness. Which he also plainly implies in his Account of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59847:137"/>
Which he does not make to be a recovery of Ideas that were <hi>Lost,</hi> but a Re-advertency or Re-application of Mind to Ideas that are actually there, tho' not attended to. <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>p.</hi> 65. Sect. 2. <hi>The narrow mind of man not being capable of having many Ideas under View and Consideration at once, it was necessary to have a Repository, to lay up those Ideas, which at another time it might have use of.</hi> And accordingly <hi>p.</hi> 66. Sect. 7. He calls them <hi>Ideas which are lodg'd in the memory.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 67 Sect. 8. He calls them <hi>Dormant Ideas.</hi> So that according to him to <hi>remember</hi> is to retrieve, not the Ideas themselves, (for they are supposed to lie <hi>Dormant</hi> in the Mind) but only the <hi>Perception</hi> or Consciousness of them. This he makes to be the business of Memory, and therefore there may be an imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ideas without Actual Perception, which may now, it seems, stand well enough together without any danger of a <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the Acknowledgment of this, his own Principles will also oblige him. For since in conformity to the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59847:138"/>
our Ideas to be derived from our Senses, or rather by our Senses from sensible Objects, he must needs sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (considering the variety of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects wherewith we are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded) that there are infinitely more Ideas impress'd upon our Minds than we can possibly attend to or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Which may also be argued from the Finiteness of our Faculties, as was hinted in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Well then, since there may be an Impression of Ideas without any actual Perception of them, whether there be any <hi>Innate Ideas</hi> or no (which I shall not now dispute) it does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that there are none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy are not universally perceiv'd. Which utterly <hi>silences</hi> that Argument taken from the Non-perception of them in Children. And since our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor both does, and is by his Principles obliged to allow that there are many Ideas impress'd upon us when we have no actual Perception of them, it does not certainly become him, tho there were really no such thing as <hi>Innate Ideas;</hi> and tho the Non-perception of them were an Argument against them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59847:138"/>
to bring this as an Argument against the Existence of any such, because they are not universally perceiv'd. This is not to agree with <hi>himself,</hi> however he may agree with <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our ingenious Author further argues against <hi>Innate Principles</hi> from the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the Perception of such which are presumed to be of that number, in that they are not the first that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the Minds of Children. <hi>Can it be imagin'd</hi> (says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. Sect. 25.) <hi>that they perceive the Impression from things without, and are at the same time ignorant of those Characters which Nature it self has taken care to stamp within?</hi> This I take to be a very uncertain way of arguing, and of less Cogency than the Former. For if <hi>Nullity</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception will not conclude against <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Principles,</hi> much less will the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of Perception be able to do it. And besides, there may be many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons drawn from the inward, and to us unknown Contexture of our Minds, and from the manner of that Original Impression (if any such there be) which would also be to us equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, besides the Order of External

that they are not consented to by all that judge any thing about them; If the former, that proves nothing, as we have shewn already; If the latter, then I deny the Proposition, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that there are not only as <hi>Certain</hi> but as <hi>Vncontested</hi> Propositions in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality as in any other Science. But our Author demands, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Where is that Practical Truth that is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received?</hi> I answer by refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to the 274 Page of his own Book, where he says <hi>Sect.</hi> 18. That this Proposition, <hi>Where there is no Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there is no Injustice,</hi> is a Proposition as certain as any Demonstration in <hi>Euclid;</hi> I add and as plain too. It needing nothing to assure the Truth of it but only the Explication of the Terms And I further remarque that in the same place he says that Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be placed among the Sciences capable of Demonstration. Well then, if there may be Propositions demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in Morality, then those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions must at last be resolved into <hi>Principles evident</hi> and <hi>incontestable.</hi> Since otherwise there can be no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. There are therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contestable Principles in Morality. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59847:139"/>
he confesses as much in express terms; <hi>I doubt not,</hi> says he in the same place, <hi>but from Principles as incontestable as those of the Mathematicks, by necessary Consequences, the measures of Right and Wrong might be made out to any one,</hi> &amp;c. Here he expresly owns incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Principles in Morality, that is, incontestable Truths, that is, Truths that cannot be denied, and therefore <hi>must</hi> be assented to. And how then can he with any tolerable <hi>Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency</hi> say that there are no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles universally consented to? If none are universally consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, then all are by some contested. And yet he says there are in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity incontestable Principles. How to adjust this I no more know, than he does to reconcile <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Mechanism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His next Argument is, That <hi>there cannot any one Moral Rule be proposed whereof a Man may not justly demand a Reason, Pag.</hi> 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. Well, what then? Therefore they are not <hi>Innate.</hi> I do not see the Consequence. Why may not the same Proposition be Innate, and yet deducible from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59847:140"/>
too, as well as the same Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the Object of both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Science?</hi> Why may not Conclusions be Innate as well as Principles? Why may not God be supposed for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Security of our Vertue to implant even those Practical Propositions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds, which are also capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being demonstrated from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason? Whether he has so done or no I do not dispute; I only say that their Dependence on Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is no Argument that he has not.</p>
                  <p>He argues again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. from Mens <hi>transgressing</hi> these Moral Rules with Confidence and Serenity, which he says they could not do, were they <hi>Innate.</hi> I do not apprehend here the least Appearance of a Consequence. Why may not an <hi>Innate Law</hi> be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd as well as a <hi>Written Law?</hi> An Innate Law only dictates that such a thing ought or ought not to be done, and so does a Written Law. He might therefore as well have concluded that there is no Written Law because it is Transgress'd, as that there is no Innate Law because it is Transgress'd.</p>

The Author seems to have been sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the Weakness of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore to strengthen it, says he, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. <hi>The break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Rule say you is no Argument that it is unknown; I grant it, But the generally allow'd Breach of it any where, is a Proof that it is not Innate.</hi> Here I remarque by the way that he grants that the Breaking of a Law does not prove it <hi>not known,</hi> and why then should it prove it not <hi>Innate?</hi> If a known Law may be transgressed, why may not an Innate Law; Innate being only another way of being known? But says he, <hi>The generally allow'd Breach of it proves it not Innate.</hi> I do not see the Necessity of this neither. The allow'd Breach of a Law is only a more aggravated Breach of it, and if the Breach of a Law does not prove it not to be Innate, why should the allow'd Breach of it do so? And besides, why may not an Innate Law be <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowedly</hi> broken as well as a Written Law?</p>
                  <p>But says our Author, <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. <hi>Did Men find such Innate Propositions
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59847:141"/>
stamp'd on their Minds, they would be easily able to distinguish them from other Truths, and there would be nothing more easie than to know what and how many they were.</hi> Perhaps not so very easie. For I see no absurdity in Supposing, and tis what I can very well conceive, that a Man may be sensible of a <hi>Truth impress'd,</hi> and yet not of the <hi>Impression,</hi> and so may not know that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, but think it came some other way, and consequently may not be able to distinguish it from some other that does so. The truth of this may be seen in the Instance of <hi>Inspiration.</hi> Since there have been Prophets (<hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 11.51.</note> for one) who were not able to distinguish Divine Inspirations from their own proper genuin Thoughts. 'Tis therefore no Consequence to say that there are no Innate Principles, because we cannot distinguish them.</p>
                  <p>These are the main Arguments, and to which all that is further offered may be reduced, whereby this Author im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugns the Doctrin of <hi>Innate Principles;</hi> and I think neither any nor all of them are sufficient for the Cause wherein they are ingaged. And I am so far from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59847:141"/>
being surprized at their <hi>Deficiency,</hi> that I think it absolutely impossible for him or any Man else upon his Principles, to prove that there are no <hi>Innate Truths.</hi> For since with those of the Peripatetic School he allows that Ideas are impress'd upon the Mind from sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Objects, he cannot (as another might) object against the <hi>Possibility</hi> of such Impressions. He cannot say they are capable only of a Figurative and Metaphorical Sense; Since according to him the same is litterally and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done every Day, every Hour, every Minute. No, he must grant that 'tis possible there may be such Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. All the Question then will be concerning the <hi>Timing</hi> of it, whether any of these Impressions be Original Characters or no! And why may they not be at first as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? How can he or any man else tell (upon his Principles) whether the Author of Nature has imprinted any such or no? Or whether we brought any with us into the World or no? However that be, I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd 'tis impossible for any man that holds <hi>Mental Impressions</hi> to prove the contrary; especially if with that he
<pb facs="tcp:59847:142"/>
allows the Possibility of <hi>Preexistence,</hi> which I believe no considering Man will say is Impossible.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I do as little believe there are any such things as Innate Principles strictly and properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, meaning by them certain Original Characters written upon or interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Mind in the very first Moment of its Being and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I say I do as little believe this as the Author himself. Not for the Reasons by him alledged, with the Cogency of which I am not satisfy'd, but because I do not allow any such thing as <hi>Mental Impressions,</hi> or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters written upon the mind, which if it pretend to any thing more than Figure and Metaphor, I take to be mere <hi>Jargon,</hi> and unintelligible <hi>Cant.</hi> You know Sir I account for the Mode of <hi>Human Vnderstanding</hi> after a very different way, namely, by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentialness of the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Ideal World to our Souls, wherein we see and perceive all things. For a fuller account of which I refer you to my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and to my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> lately publish'd. I cannot
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59847:142"/>
therefore by my Principles admit of any such Innate Characters in a strict and proper Sense. Only I may, and am also inclined to admit something of near Analogy with it. Supposing that God may and does exhibt some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Truths of the <hi>Ideal</hi> World more early, more clearly, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to the view of the Soul than others, that by these she may be the better directed to the Good of the Reasonable Life, as Animals by sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Instincts and Inclinations are to the Good of Sense. This is all that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be strictly either <hi>Possible</hi> or <hi>True</hi> in that grey-headed venerable Doctrin of Innate or Common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Having thus far considered our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Impugnation of Innate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I come now to examin the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal which he gives to <hi>Ideas.</hi> These he derives <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. from this double Fountain, <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</hi> Especially from the Former, telling us again and again, that <hi>the Senses let in Ideas and furnish the yet empty Cabinet,</hi> Pag. 8. Sect 15. That <hi>the Senses convey into the mind several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb facs="tcp:59847:143"/>
Perceptions of things,</hi> Pag. 37. Sect. 3. And that <hi>the Senses do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Soul with Ideas to think on,</hi> Pag. 44. Sect. 20. with many other such Expressions.</p>
                  <p>These indeed are pretty <hi>Smiling</hi> Sentences. But before we go a Step further I would willingly know of the Author what kind of things these Ideas are which are thus let in at the Gate of the Senses. This indeed I expected an Account of in the beginning of the Work; but since the Author has been pleased to cast a <hi>Shade</hi> upon this Part, I now demand, what are these Ideas? Why you shall know that presently. <hi>Whatsoever the Mind perceives in it self, or is the immediate Object of Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I call Idea,</hi> says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. <hi>sect.</hi> 8. Very good; So much my Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con would have told me. But this does not satisfy. I would know what kind of things he makes these Ideas to be as to their <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> Are they in the first place Real Beings or not? Without doubt Real Beings, as having Real Properties, and really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent one from another, and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things really different. Well, if
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59847:143"/>
Real Beings, then I demand, are they Substances, or are they Modifications of Substances? He will not say they are <hi>Modifications.</hi> For besides that a Modification of Substance cannot be a Representative of a Substance, there being no manner of likeness between a Substance and a Mode; if an Idea be a Modification only it cannot subsist by it self, but must be the Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Substance or other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of also there may be an Idea; which Idea being (as is supposed) only a Mode, must have another Substance, and so on without end. As for example, If my Idea of <hi>Figure</hi> be only a Mode, then it must have a Substance wherein to exist as well as Figure it self, which cannot exist alone; and since of that Substance whatever it be, there may be also an Idea, which is supposed to be a Modification, this Idea must also have another Substance, and so on to Infinity. He will not therefore, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, say that our Ideas are <hi>Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He must then say that they are <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi> Are they then Material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or Immaterial? If he says they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59847:144"/>
are <hi>Material</hi> Substances or Corporeal Emanations from sensible Objects, I would desire him to weigh with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and try if he can answer, what is <note place="margin">De inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend. Verit. Lib. 3. Part. 2. c. 2.</note> alledged by <hi>M. Malebranch</hi> against the Possibility of such Emanations. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, let him tell me how this can consist with the <hi>Impenetrability</hi> of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which must needs hinder these Corporeal Essluvias from possessing the same <hi>Vbi</hi> or Point, which yet must be supposed, if these be the Representers of Objects, since there is no assignable Point where the same, and where mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Objects may not be seen. This one Difficulty is enough to make this way <hi>impassable.</hi> But let him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell me how any Body can eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate such an inconceivable Number of these Effluvias so as to fill every Point of such vast Spaces, without the least sensible Diminution. Well, but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they could, let him tell me how these Corporeal Effluvias, sometimes of vast Extent and Magnitude, can enter the Fye; Or if they could, how they can do it in such Troops and Numbers without justling, refring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and inverting one another. Or if this might be avoided, where shall we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59847:144"/>
find room to receive such a numerous Company of Corporeal Images? And upon what part will you have them impressed? Upon the Soul? or upon the Brain? But who can understand either of these? How can an Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Substance, as the Soul is, <hi>receive</hi> any Stamp or Impression? And how can such a fluid Substance as the Brain is, <hi>retain</hi> any? The least jog of a Mans Head must needs obliterate such slight and Aerial Traces, as the Wind does the Figures that are written upon the Sand; Not to say that these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions coming on so thick one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another must needs work out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves almost assoon as they are in, and in a short time consume the very Brain too. But suppose we could get over all this, yet the greatest Difficulty is yet behind; How will such Corporeal Effluvias be able to represent immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and intellectual Objects? They will at the most be able but to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Material Objects, and not all of them neither, but only those whose E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manations they are. And what shall we do with Ideas that will not do their Office, that cannot represent a quarter of the things which we are concern'd to understand?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59847:145"/>
These and a thousand more Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities must he wade through that will assert our Ideas to be Corporeal Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias derived from external Objects. It remains then that they must be <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> Substances. And so without all question they are. <hi>All</hi> of them as to their <hi>Essence,</hi> and <hi>most</hi> of them as to their <hi>Representation.</hi> But how shall Bodies send forth such Immaterial Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? They can emit nothing but what is Corporeal, like themselves. How then shall they commence Immaterial? Body can no more <hi>emit</hi> Spirit, than it can <hi>create</hi> it. And what is there after Emission that shall be the Principle of Transformation? Some I know talk of strange Feats done by the Dexterity of <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> and <hi>Patiens,</hi> which they say refine and spiritualize these Material Phantasms; but I suppose our Author is of too Philosophical a Faith to admit of such a <hi>Romantick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The short of this Argument is, If our Ideas are derived from sensible Objects, then they are Material Beings, because Matter can send forth nothing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59847:145"/>
but Matter. But they are not Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Beings, for the Reasons alledg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Therefore they are not derived from Sensible Objects. Which I think has the force of Demonstration. And to this purpose it may be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd (what I hinted before) that as our Ideas are all of them Immaterial as to their Essence and Substance, so many, perhaps most of them, are also immaterial as to their Representation, that is, they represent after an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial manner, as the Ideas of Truth, Vertue, and the like, which <hi>Cartesius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Meditat. 6. p. 36.</note> makes to be the difference between <hi>Imagination</hi> and <hi>Pure Intellection,</hi> and whereof he gives an Instance in the Example of a <hi>Chiliagon,</hi> whose Angles we cannot represent in a distinct View, but may clearly <hi>understand</hi> it. But now how can that which represents after an immaterial manner come from sensible Objects? Again, we have Ideas of things that are not to be found in the Material and Sensible World, as of a Right Line, or an exact Circle, which our Author himself confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 283. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. not to be really extant in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And what does he think of the Idea of <hi>God?</hi> Will he say that <hi>that</hi> is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59847:146"/>
also derived from sensible Objects? Yes: For, says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 147. Sect. 33. <hi>If we examin the Idea we have of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible Supreme Being, we shall find that we come by it the same way,</hi> that is, by Sensation. But in the first place, how does this agree with what he says, <hi>pag.</hi> 341. Sect. 2. <hi>That we have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the existence of all things without us (except only of God) by our senses?</hi> So then it seems we do not know the Existence of God by our Senses. No? then neither have we the Idea of him by our Senses. For if we had, why should we not know his Existence by Sensation as well as the Existence of other things, which, as he says, we know only by Sensation? For, says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 311. Sect. 2. speaking of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Existence, <hi>We have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own existence by Intuition, of the existence of God by Demonstration, and of other things by Sensation.</hi> Then it seems we do not know the Existence of God by Sensation, but that of other things we do. But why are other things known by Sensation, but only because their Ideas come in at our Senses? For I suppose he will not say that the things themselves come in at
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59847:146"/>
our Senses; for then what need is there of Ideas at all? And if other things are therefore known by Sensation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Ideas come in by the Senses, then why is not God also known by Sensation, forasmuch as his Idea ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, comes also the same way? and yet he will not allow that God's Existence is known by Sensation; Which indeed is very true, but then he should not have said that the Idea of God comes in by the Senses.</p>
                  <p>But what a strange <hi>Adventure</hi> is it in Philosophy to make the Idea of God to come in by our Senses, and to be derived from Sensible Objects! For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Difficulties and Absurdities already touch't upon, what is there in the Material World that can resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God? Nay, what is there in the whole Creation that can represent <hi>him</hi> to our Thoughts? God himself cannot <hi>make</hi> an Idea of himself: For such an Idea, what-ever it be, must be a Creature; and can a Creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present God! Nothing certainly but God himself can do that. He must be his own Idea, or he can have none. There is but one possible Idea of God, and that is his <hi>Son,</hi> the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59847:147"/>
or Ideal World, <hi>the brightness of his Glory, and the express Image or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his Person.</hi> 'Tis he that is the Idea of God, and of the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that both <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>represents</hi> all things. And since the way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by our Senses turns to so poor an Account, I would desire our most Ingenious Author to consider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not abundantly more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and intelligible (not to say pious) to suppose that we see all things in God, or the Divine Ideas, that is, in the partial Representations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Omniformity. For our Author himself confesses, <hi>pag.</hi> 315. Sect. 10. that <hi>Whatsoever is first of all things, must necessarily contain in it, and actually have, at least all the Perfections that can ever after exist. Nor can it ever give to another any perfection that it has not, either actually in it self, or at least in an higher degree.</hi> God then, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, is all Beings; or, has the whole Plenitude of Being. And I wonder that this Principle had not led this Sagacious Person further. I know whither it would have carried him, if he had follow'd the Clue of it. For why should we seek any further, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59847:147"/>
puzzle our selves with unintelligible Suppositions? What else <hi>need,</hi> and what else <hi>can</hi> be the immediate Object of our Understanding but the Divine Ideas, the <hi>Omniform Essence</hi> of God? This will open to us a plain intelligible Account of <hi>Human Vnderstanding,</hi> yea of <hi>Angelical</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> too. Here I can tell what an Idea is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform Essence of God partially repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented or exhibited, and how it comes to be united to my Mind. But as for all other ways, I look upon them to be desperate. But these things are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by me purposely discours'd of elsewhere, and are also further to be <note place="margin">Reason &amp; Relig. p. 181.</note> deduc'd in my <hi>Theory of the Ideal World.</hi>

                  <p>Pag. 16. Sect. 3. <hi>Practical Principles must produce Conformity of Action, or else they are in vain distinguished from Speculative Maxims.</hi> 'Tis enough to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59847:148"/>
distinguish them from Speculative Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, if they are in order to Action, that is, if they are concerning such things as may and ought to be done by us, tho in the event they do not produce any such Conformity. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise a Law would not be a Law till 'tis obey'd.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 57. Sect. 15. <hi>There is nothing like our Ideas existing in the Bodies themselves. They are in the Bodies only a Power to produce those Sensations in us.</hi> The first part I acknowledge to be true: For certainly Heat in the Fire is no way resembling what I call Heat in my self, meaning by it either such a grateful or ungrateful Sensation as I feel, when I approach the Fire more or less. But the latter Clause I cannot approve, thinking it impossible that any Body should directly and properly produce any Sensation in my Soul. 'Tis God certainly that is the Author of all my Sensations, as well as of my Ideas. Bodies can only be Conditions or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional Causes of them.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59847:148"/>
Vertue and Vice, is the Approbation or Dislike, Praise or Dispraise which by a secret and tacit consent establishes it self in the several Societies of Men,</hi> &amp;c. Praise or Dispraise may be a probable Sign, or secondary Measure, but it can never be the primary Measure or Law of Vertue and Vice; whose difference must be founded upon more certain and immutable grounds of Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than the Praise or Dispraise of Men. For Praise or Dispraise does not <hi>make,</hi> but <hi>suppose</hi> the difference of Vertue and Vice as already set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and antecedent to it. A thing is not good because 'tis praised, but is therefore praised because 'tis good. And how comes this Praise or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise to be <hi>establish'd by such a secret and tacit consent,</hi> if there be not some other more certain measure of Good and Evil, according to which our Praise or Dispraise is to proceed?</p>

But I hope notwithstanding this, the Author will allow that there are also in reality Immutable Essences of things, independent on our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,

'Tis true indeed, we are fain to sort and rank things by their Nominal Essences, because the Real Ones are most times unknown; but that is no Argument against the Being of real Essences. And this is by the Author himself confess'd, <hi>pag.</hi> 234. Sect. 11. where he says that <hi>in our Ideas of substances we have not the Liberty as in mix'd modes, to frame what Combinations we think fit, to rank things by, but must follow Nature, and suit our Complex Ideas to real Existencies.</hi> So that here we have Patterns to follow, and I desire no more.</p>

Sect. 6. <hi>Were the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Body and Extension precisely the same, it would be as proper and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to say the Body of an Extension, as the Extension of a Body.</hi> Here he supposes it would be proper, to say the Extension of a Body upon that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, whereas indeed were they precisely the same; neither of them would be proper.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 244. Sect. 14. <hi>The Platonists have their Soul of the World, the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans their Endeavour towards Motion,</hi> &amp;c. These the Author reckons among unintelligible Forms of Speech, and supposes them to be no better than <hi>Gibberish.</hi> As to the Soul of the World 'tis a Subject of too great a Latitude to be discours'd of at present. But as to the Epicureans <hi>Endeavour</hi> towards Motion, that there is such a thing, he may be sufficiently convinc'd by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a pair of Scales, where tho the lesser Weight does not actually weigh down, yet that it presses and endeavours toward it is most certain, since otherwise as much Weight would be required to weigh it down as if it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59847:150"/>
were quite empty. But this we do not find; whence it must of necessity be concluded that the former Weight tho it did not pass into actual Motion, yet it did something toward it, that is, it <hi>Endeavoured.</hi> The same might also be illustrated from the Actions of the Will, some of which are perfect and compleat Determinations, others only <hi>Velleities</hi> or <hi>Endeavours.</hi> But if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would be further satisfied in this Matter, I desire him to read the 19 and 20 Chapter of Dr. <hi>Glisson, de Natura Substantiae Energetica,</hi> where he will find this Argument very curiously handled.</p>

                     <hi>Pag. 289. Sect. 2.</hi> Truth seems to me to signify nothing but the joyning or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of Signs, as the things signified do Agree or Disagree one with another. <hi>This</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59847:151"/>
indeed is Truth of the <hi>Mind</hi> or of the <hi>Subject,</hi> but not Truth of the <hi>Thing</hi> or of the <hi>Object,</hi> which consists not in the minds joyning or separating either Signs or Ideas, but in the Essential Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that are between the Ideas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And that these are such, our Author himself implies, by saying, <hi>as the things signified do Agree or Disagree with one another.</hi> Here then is Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Disagreement antecedently to any joyning or separating. And I very much wonder that our Author professing in the Title of the Chapter to discourse of Truth in general, and particularly of that Truth too which has been the Enquiry of so many Ages, should yet confine his Discourse to Truth of Words and Truth of Thoughts without the least mention of Objective Truth. Which indeed is the Principal Kind of Truth.</p>

Pag. 323. Sect. 14. <hi>Eternal Truths are so not from being written in the minds of Men, Or that they were before the World: But wheresoever we can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such a Creature as Man is, inabled with such faculties, we must conclude he must needs when he applies his thoughts to the consideration of his Ideas, know the Truth of certain Propositions,</hi> &amp;c. This is a true <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Account of Eternal Truths. But I demand? Are these Eternal Truths in being before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of Man or no? If not, how comes he to understand them when he does exist? What, does he make that to be true, which before was not so? But if they were in being before the Existence of Man, then their Eternity does not consist in their being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by Man when ever he shall exist, but in their own fixt and immutable Relations, whereby they have an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Aptness so to be understood. Which the Author himself seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by saying, <hi>He must needs so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them.</hi> Why must needs? But only <note place="margin">Reason &amp; Relig. p. 76.</note> because they are necessarily so and no otherwise intelligible. But of this I have discours'd elsewhere.</p>

He takes notice of one manifest Mistake in the Rules of Syllogism, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>No Syllogistical reasoning can be right and Conclusive, but what has at least one general Proposition in it.</hi> This our Author thinks to be a Mistake, and a manifest mistake. But perhaps if we rightly understand that Rule of Syllogism, there is no Mistake at all in it. All the Ground of the Dispute is from the Doubtfulness of what is meant by a general or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Proposition. A Proposition may be said to be universal either when a Note of Universality (as <hi>All</hi>) is prefixed before the Subject. Or when tho that Note be not prefixed, yet the Predicate is said of the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject according to the full Latitude of its Predication, so as to leave nothing of the Subject out, whereof the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate is not said. According to the former Sense of Universality it is not necessary that in every concluding Syllogism one Proposition be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. But according to the latter sense of Universality (which indeed is the most proper sense of it) it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary. And I dare challenge
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59847:152"/>
any Man to shew me one Instance of a concluding Syllogism that has not one Proposition universal in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sense. For even a singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is thus universal, since being Indivisible, it can have nothing said of it, but what is said of it wholly and universally, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it. The Author may see a further Account of this in Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> his Thesis <hi>de Propositione singulari,</hi> at the latter end of his <hi>Institutio Logicae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These, Sir, are the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Passages that at once reading I thought liable to Reflection in this Work, which notwithstanding these few <hi>Erratas,</hi> I think to be a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Performance, and worthy of the most publick Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. And tho I do not approve of every particular thing in this Book, yet I must say that the Author is just such a kind of Writer as I like, one that has thought much, and well, and who freely Writes what he thinks. I hate your <hi>Common-place</hi> Men of all the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the World, who tho they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen sometimes to say things that are in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59847:153"/>
themselves not only True, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, yet they never write in any Train or Order of Thinking, which is one of the greatest Beauties of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
                  <p>But this Gentleman is a Writer of a very different Genius and Complexion of Soul, and whose Character I cannot easily give, but must leave it either to the Description of some finer Pen, or to the silent Admiration of Posterity. Only one Feature of his Disposition I am concern'd to point out, which is, that he seems to be a Person of so great Ingenuity and Candor, and of a Spirit so truly Philosophical, that I have thence great and fair Inducements to believe that he will not be offended with that Freedom I have used in these Reflections, which were not intended for the lessening his Fame, but solely for the promoting of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>right Thinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this will justifie that part of the Reflections, where agreeing with the Author in the Proposition intended to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59847:153"/>
be proved, I lay open the insufficiency of his Proofs. For to say that a thing is false for such Reasons, when 'tis not false for such Reasons, tho it be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false, is as great an Injury to Truth, as to say a thing is false when 'tis not false. A false Inference is as much an Untruth, as a false Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and accordingly he that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Conclusion if false, may with as much reason reflect upon a wrong way of inferring it, tho the Conclusion it self be true. Which I mention with respect to the former part about Innate Principles, where tho I agree with the Author in the thing denied, yet I think his Reasons are not cogent.</p>
                  <p>After all, notwithstanding my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting from this Author in so many things, I am perhaps as great an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of him as any of his most sworn Followers, and would not part with his Book for half a <hi>Vatican.</hi> But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Writer has his Alloy, and I exempt not any Writings of my own from the like Defects. Of which perhaps, Sir, I have been convincing you all this
