            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe betwee,n the Right Honourable CITY of <hi>LONDON,</hi> and <hi>Robert Campion.</hi>
            </head>
            <head>Repreſented to Publick View, after Sixteen Years private ſad Sufferings, and attendance, early and late, upon the ſeveral Lord Mayors, Aldermen, and Common-Councels, without Relief.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ROBERT CAMPION,</hi> being by Trade a <hi>Tallow-Chandler,</hi> and aged above Sixty Years; and having a Wife aged above Sixty Years, and two Children; had, by his pains and care in his Calling, by Gods bleſſing, in his younger years, gained an Eſtate of One Thouſand Pounds, before the Troubles began, towards the maintenance of himſelf, his Wife and Children, and for their proviſion in the World: which he lent unto the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (in their neceſſity) to be repayed with Intereſt at ſix Months end; and had a Bond Sealed with the City Seal, for repayment thereof accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Bond bears date the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1643. to be paid upon the third of <hi>February,</hi> next enſuing the date. At which time the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Chamberlains Office, where the ſame was by the Bond to be paid, for the Intereſt of his Money, towards the livelyhood of himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; the Chamberlain refuſed to pay him, and adviſed him to go to the Court of Aldermen for his Money, which he did, Sir <hi>John Woollaſton</hi> being then Lord Mayor; who taking notice of the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion's</hi> good affection and forwardneſs to lend his Money, deſired a little patience for a Fortnight or three weeks, that the Court might examine what was become of the money lent: and after that deſired as much time longer: and then Alderman <hi>Andrews</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to bring a Petition to the Court of Aldermen, and Common-Counſel for his ſaid Money; And he attended their Honours four years; during which time, Sir <hi>John Woollaſton,</hi> Alderman <hi>Atkins,</hi> Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Gayr</hi> were Mayors.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> attending ſtill an anſwer of his Petition; when Alderman <hi>Warner</hi> was Lord Mayor, he directed him to put the ſaid Bond in Suit, which he did in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, 1648. But the City refuſed to appear; and thereupon Iſſues were awarded againſt them; But the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> being aged and not able to undergoe ſo tedious a Solicitation and proceeding at Law, petitioned the Court of Aldermen and Common-Counſel again, hoping that they would take his diſtreſſed condition into conſideration, after ſo many years: and ſo continued Petitioning every Lord Mayor, deſiring that he might have his Debt paid, according to Juſtice. Whereupon the Common-Counſel ordered a Committee the 19 of <hi>October,</hi> 1652. to conſider what might be the beſt and moſt effectual way and means for the payment of his Money. And upon their Report the 19 of <hi>April</hi> 1653. it was ordered at a Common-Councel, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for letting the City-Lands, ſhould be authorized to demiſe unto <hi>Robert Campion</hi> any of the City Lands demiſable, as he ſhould find out; reſerving the old Rent. Provided, the Fine do not exceed 600 <hi>l.</hi> Which Fine is ordered ſhall be forborn, during the pleaſure of this Court. The ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> having lent all his Money unto the City already, and not knowing how to raiſe 600 <hi>l.</hi> if the pleaſure of that Court had been to require it, ſtill Petitioned for his own money, or deſired that he might have the 600 <hi>l.</hi> paid in part of his Debt: which not being granted him, and he ſtill being preſſed by his wants to ſolicite for his Money, it was alleadged by ſome of the Common-Councel, that the Money was lent by him, was upon an order of Parliament; and thereupon they referred it to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to conſider, and report upon what Order of Parliament it was lent: And the Committee by their Report upon the 16 of <hi>March</hi> 1653. report, that upon Examination they could not find any Order of Parliament for borrowing or iſſuing out of the ſaid Money, but that the ſaid Money was lent upon the Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-councel, made the 18 of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1643, and upon the Security there mentioned only. Above a year after, the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> continuing to Petition, and crave that Juſtice might be done for him, the Common-counſel ordered the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1654. That the Chamberlain of the City ſhould pay unto the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion 600l.</hi> out of the firſt Moneys to be raiſed by Fines of Leaſes of the City Lands. Provided, that he deliver a Bond, given under the City Seal, for payment of one thouſand Pounds, a Debt due to him by the State, upon payment to him of the ſaid 600 <hi>l.</hi> and the Mayor, Commonalty, and City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> becoming bound to him by Bond of convenient Penalty to pay the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> ſo much Money of the ſaid Debt, as the City ſhall receive of the Parliament or State over and above the ſaid 600 <hi>l.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> having lent the City his ſaid Money, and being thus from time to time put off and deluded by them in his old age and neceſſity, was inforced through their opreſſion, to accompany his Petitions with more earneſt deſires and Speeches; and conceiving himſelf to be as bad as cheated of his Eſtate, ſeeing thoſe to whom he lent it, would not own it, but pretend it to be a Debt of the States, notwithſtanding their own reports to the contrary, and that they would not, nor could be inforced to appear at Law: The ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> being in almoſt a diſtracted condition, did ſpeak words to that effect, that he was cheated by the City and their Power; which being ſpoke to Alderman <hi>Fowk</hi> then Lord Mayor, he cauſed the ſaid <hi>Robert</hi> to be Arreſted, and laid in Priſon eleven weeks and two days in <hi>Newgate.</hi> And when he had procured Bail, and came again to proſecute his Petition, when Alderman <hi>Pack</hi> was Lord Mayor, the ſaid Mayor and divers of the Aldermen committed him to <hi>Woodſtreet</hi> Compter, where he was impriſoned again for ſome time; as appears by their Warrant, dated the 12 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1655. the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> being only provoked, and almoſt mad, through the oppreſſion which he then groaned under, for want of his Eſtate which he had lent unto the City, and came then to Petition for, after ſo many years fruitleſs attendance. The ſaid <hi>Robert Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> having undergone all this hardſhip, ſtill continued Petitioning, and deſiring that his Money might be paid according to <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> did nothing, ſo that another Order was directed to the ſaid Committee the 27 of <hi>March</hi> 1657, to <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> matter of Fact, and to conſider of a way for his Relief, and for the Relief of others in his condition, and to make Report thereof: For the effect of which Report, the ſaid <hi>Robert Campion</hi> was then attending.</p>
            <div type="finding">
               <p>WE whoſe Names are Subſcribed, authorized among others by Order of Common-Councel of the 18 of <hi>March</hi> 1652, to examine upon what Order of Parliament the ſum of one Thouſand pounds, for which Mr. <hi>Campion</hi> hath the Cities Seal, was lent, and how much all the mony lent upon the ſame Order is, and how much of ſuch money is Iſſued out, and upon what Warrants: do humbly certifie, that upon our Examination of the Matter, we cannot find any Order of Parliament for the borrowing or iſſuing out thereof, but we conceive that the ſaid money was lent upon the occaſion mentioned in the Act of Common-Councel made the 18 day of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1643, and upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity therein mentioned only, which we humbly ſubmit to the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Honourable Court, this 26 day of <hi>March</hi> 1653.</p>
