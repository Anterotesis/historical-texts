         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

yielding to much to that <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> ſpirit of the world, or rather to that principle of <note n="d" place="margin">James 3. 16. &amp; 4. 5.</note> envy, and malice, which Sathan the God of this world labours to throw in amongſt them; Is it not cauſe of much ſadneſs and grief, to ſee that a little difference in opinion produceth great breaches, and much eſtranged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in affection? and yet this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence being weighed in the ballance of true Judgement, will be found no difference amongſt them who are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saints. Indeed, <note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 2. 9 &amp; 3. 9</note> There are ſome who ſay they are Jewes, and are not, but doe lie; and theſe are ſome of them high in notion, but altogether without life, and power of godlineſs, and the difference between the Saints, and ſuch in point of ſound doctrine, is very great. But the Saints, who are truly ſo indeed, <note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> they all indeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: They all know, and profeſs, that there is but one body, whereof they are members: and that <note place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> there is but one Spirit, by which they
<pb facs="tcp:119914:3"/>
are united, and made one in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and that their hope, whereof they are not aſhamed, is one and the ſame, being effectually called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; they all profeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> one Lord, in whom they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and one faith, by which they believe, and one baptiſme, through which they are not onely made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Chriſt in his death, but alſo are made like unto him in his glorious reſurrection, unto newneſſe of life: And are alſo annointed with him, to hold forth the ſame to others; they all profeſſe one God, who is the <note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> Father, the Fountain, the Originall of all good; who is above all in reſpect of his glorious power, and through whoſe infinite love and goodneſs, they all obtaine life and happineſs; and who is in them all, to act and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on, unto eternall glory. Thus the Saints, who are ſo indeed, hold correſpondencie one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſubſtance of religion: and the difference between them is but a
<pb facs="tcp:119914:4"/>
ſeeming difference, a difference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of manifeſtation: for to every one of us is given grace, according <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt. The Lord diſpenſeth not alike to all, but to every one a meaſure as he will, and yet they may be all of one, and the ſame Judgement, though ſome of a higher, and ſome of a lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 34. 12. Heb. 11. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> had high and glorious manifeſtations, and yet he was of the ſame judgement w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the meaneſt of his Saints in that generation: <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> was taken up into the third Heavens, in reſpect of thoſe glorious revelations, and high diſcoveries of God made known unto him; <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 4. 12.</note> and yet he was as  the Saints were, that ſo he might perſwade them to be as he was, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor 9. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> yea, he ſubmitted to the weakneſs of the Saints, that he might thereby bring them up into ſtrength: Al the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among the Saints at this day is onely about externall, and outward formes; and obſervations, I which are <note place="margin">Col. 2. 17.</note> all terminated in Chriſt: when they
<pb facs="tcp:119914:4"/>
once come to know him, and are <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 4. 21.</note> taught by him, as the truth is in him; then they cannot look for him at any diſtance, for he is <note n="n" place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> in them the hope of glory. It is a great fault among children to begrudge one another of their fathers gifts: there be ſeverall attainments among Saints, or ſeverall degrees of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations: <note n="o" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 12. 1. 2</note> there be ſome babes, and ſome ſtrong men, <note n="p" place="margin">Heb 5. 13. 14.</note> and there is milk for the one, and ſtrong meat for the other, they that be ſtrong, were once weake, and they who are weak as yet, will in time grow ſtrong (my deare Friends) let us leave judging, and cenſuring one another, <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> for who art thou that iudgeſt another mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: let us indeavour unity, peace and concord; let us walk in love, oh <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 22.</note> if we could love one another with a pure heart fevently! with what ſweet imbraces ſhould we receive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy each other? how would our heavenly Father be glorified? how would truth be advanced, and appear

It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents

you with no new thing, but cleers up old truths, and diſtinguiſheth them from new errors. It comes not buſling forth, ſtuft full of humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, but it comes forward gently, and meekly, attended with divine evidence, and witneſs: (Dear Friends) firſt read, and then judge, but be not raſh in cenſuring; if any thing ſeem difficult, weigh the Scriptures in the margent, and yet if difficulties and doubts ſtill ariſe, <note n="c" place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> wait upon God by prayer, and ſupplication of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And he who is a Revealer of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and to whom interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe belong, ſhall in due <note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> time reveale the ſame unto you, If you cannot receive it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet ye may in time; but if not at all, yet take heed of condemning it for hereſie, blaſphemy. <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 9. 3.</note> Chriſt was called a blaſphemer, a Devil, and  that by Saints in profeſſion. Truth hath been adjudged to be falſhood and ſound doctrine hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereſie in all ages. If any
<pb facs="tcp:119914:6"/>
diſlike, or cannot receive it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome paſſages it may ſeem beyond his apprehenſion: Let him know that the maine end of this is, to carry up his heart to Chriſt above it ſelfe: and if on the other hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall deſpiſe it, and caſt it away as too much below them: let ſuch know, that it is not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 25.</note> and that the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men.</p>
            <p>To whomſoever it comes, it will bring this teſtimonie along, that it hath no ſelf-ends at all, but comes meerly out of love to poore ſouls.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. Since the Law was of ſuch infinite purity and righteouſneſs, and all men ſo prone to evil, and averſe to that which is good; yea, and alſo ſo weak, that they were not able (in the leaſt) to yield any ſutable obedience to the ſame: What then was Gods meaning to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them this Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God, who is infinite in wiſdom and goodneſs, yea, and in all other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perfections, had many excellent ends in giving them this Law, although they were not able to obey: As firſt, to ſhew his Soveraignty over them; he was <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 12.</note> their Lord, they his ſervantt; he wastheir
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119914:19"/>
King, they his ſubjects; and were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Lawes, which were holy, and righteous like himſelf. Secondly, God gave them this moſt holy Law, to let them <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 22</note> ſee what man was able to do in time of his innocency, before he wilfully diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and therefore he might juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exact the ſame at their hands. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God gave them this Law (eſpecially in ſuch a terrible manner) that it might (at leaſt) reſtrain them from outward <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 20.</note> and groſs enormities, and keep the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man in good behaviour. Fourthly, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20. and 7. 7.</note> this Law was given to diſcover ſin, that thereby they might be convinced of that moſt abominable and ſinful diſpoſition that was in them; for all men by nature are ignorant, and do not know ſin to be ſin: Beſides, man is a proud creature, and is not willing to know it, much leſs to own it to himſelf; therefore was this moſt pure and perfect Law given forth, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note> that they might not at all plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but be altogether without excuſe. But then fiftly, The main end, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intention of God in giving them this Law, was to give them to underſtand, that he was a God of ſuch infinite purity, <note place="margin">Habbak. 1. 13.</note> and of ſuch tranſcendent righteouſneſs,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119914:20"/>
that there was no favour nor comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 19</note> communion to be had or enjoyed with him, but rather a fearful expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fiery indignation, unleſs there <note place="margin">Levit. 11. 44.</note> were in them an anſwerable holineſs and ſutable righteouſneſs unto the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as there was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> of them any thing at all ſutable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but rather a nature and diſpoſition <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 13. and 9. 30. and 10. 3. 6.</note> quite and clean contrary to the ſame; his meaning therefore was, that they ſhould be driven out of themſelves, to look for righteouſneſs in the promiſed Seed, which was Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Gal. 2. 16, 17, 21. Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>

of greateſt concernment; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the greateſt part of them were ignorant of Gods meaning in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, there were but very few that knew any more than the outſide of it, namely, that God would raiſe up ſome man of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſhould deliver <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 17.</note> them from their bondage in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſettle them in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they ſhould be free-men, and enjoy peace and plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this (it is very probable) they expected ſhould have been fulfilled now in <hi>Moſes:</hi> For God had wonderfully manifeſted himſelf by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at the Red Sea, by many great and terrible works of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and now at this time alſo, <hi>Moſes</hi> was able to endure the preſence of God, and to hear him ſpeak, and to go up into the Mount when he call'd him: And becauſe <note place="margin">Dent. 5. 25, 26, 27.</note> they were not able to abide the ſight of God, nor hear his voyce, therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> muſt go to God, and bring them word what God ſaith, and then they will hear him, and be obedient; for they perceived that <hi>Moſes</hi> was very high in Gods favour, and therefore they deſired him to be a Mediator between God and them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But how did God take the matter?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119914:21"/>
Was he well pleaſed with them for this thing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, God did very well approve of them for deſiring a Mediator, for he ſaid, they had well ſpoken: But withal <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 18. and 18. 17.</note> he told <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was not the man in whom the promiſe muſt be fulfilled, for <hi>I will raiſe them up a Prophet of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brethren</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>like unto thee, and I</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>will put my words into his mouth, and he ſhall declare unto them all my Councel, and in hearkening unto him, they ſhall be happy; and he that will not hear that Prophet, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But if it was not the purpoſe of God, that they ſhould be happy by their obedience unto the Law, why then did he annex ſuch large promiſes unto the obſervation of it, and denounce ſuch heavy curſes and judgements, in caſe they diſobeyed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Lord having brought forth this people of Iſrael from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where they had been a long time under cruel Bondage, and minding (according to his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham)</hi> to take <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 5.</note> them to himſelf for a peculiar people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the Nations of the earth; was <note place="margin">Deut. 14. 2.</note> graciouſly pleaſed in giving them this Law, to enter into Covenant with them, herein promiſing to be their God, and <note place="margin">Exod. 19. 8.</note>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:119914:21"/>
that they ſhould be his people; to which <note place="margin">Chap. 24. 3</note> they did agree. Now this Covenant was two-fold, Inward, and Outward; or Spiritual, and Temporal. And ſo the Promiſes that were annexed to the ſame, were of a two-fold conſideration alſo. <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> That part of the Covenant which was outward, or temporal, was at large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and often repeated, and ſo were the promiſes which belonged to the ſame; but the inward (or Spiritual) part of it was not expreſſed, but implyed, and ſo were the promiſes.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What was the outward part of the Covenant, and the promiſes which belonged to the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The outward and temporal part of the Covenant was this: That if they would acknowledge the Lord to be their <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 3. Deut. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1</note> God, and diligently obey his voyce, and obſerve and do all his Commandments with their whole hearts; then the Lord promiſed to ſet them up on high, above all the Nations upon earth; to give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to multiply their Seed, to prolong their dayes, to give them peace and plenty, and to make them proſperous in every thing they ſet their hands unto. And on the contrary, if they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119914:22"/>
would not hearken unto his voyce, nor <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 14, 15. Deut. 28. 15.</note> obey his commandment, but walk after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods, &amp;c. then the Lord would make their plagues wonderful, and curſe them &amp; croſs them until he had deſtroyed them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What was the inward or Spiritual part of this Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Lord was pleaſed herein to Covenant, That foraſmuch as this Law was Spiritual, and their hearts were Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and altogether indiſpoſed to obey, <note place="margin">Pſal. 79. 19.</note> yet he himſelf would undertake for them; and though they were weak, and unable, yet he would lay help upon one that was mighty, and herein make over himſelf to <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note> be righteouſneſs unto them, and for them: And in this they were not to act, but believe that God (not for their <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 5. Iſa. 43. 25.</note> righteouſneſs, but for his own ſake) would be merciful to their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and freely forgive their ſin, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Juſtification and Sanctification un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And the Promiſes which were hereunto annexed, were Spiritual, and very myſtical; for here the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he would be their God, that he <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 13. Neh. 9. 10.</note> would fill their hearts with joy and peace in believing, that is, that he would (in the right apprehenſion of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119914:22"/>
ſo communicate and diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them in the ſweetneſs of his love, and the excellency of all Spiritual <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> and heavenly comforts; that they ſhould not now look upon him as an Enemy with terror, but ſhould have ſweet fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, as dear Children with a loving Father; that ſo partaking of his glory (in ſome meaſure) in this life, and living according to it, he would at length glorifie them with himſelf in eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But on the contrary, if they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> that is unbelieving, truſting in their own righteouſneſs, thinking to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his favour by their own outward and litteral obſervations; then he would leave <note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 9, 10.</note> them to their hearts luſt, and fill them with their own devices: And inſtead of enjoying him in the lively apprehenſion <note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 5.</note> of his love and favour, (which is Eternal life) they ſhould in this life, not onely be <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 65, 66, 67.</note> empty of all true and ſound comfort and joy, but alſo be filled with terror and horror of conſcience, vexation and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to be for ever ſeparated from <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 1. 9.</note> the preſence of the Lord, in endleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Did God give them any other Lawes beſides this Law of the ten Cammandments?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119914:23"/>
Or was the Covenant wholly comprehended in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did command them divers and ſundry Lawes and Ordinances, conteined in the Judicial and Ceremonial Lawes (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:) But they were wholly comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe ten words or ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for they (even thoſe ten words) were indeed the very ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the moſt pure, perfect, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will of God; yea, they being the righteouſneſs of God revealed, (which is <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3. Jer. 23. 6.</note> Jeſus Chriſt) for therein he was myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibited or held forth, for he is the Lord our righteouſneſs, and he is made of God righteouſneſs to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> and we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him: Neither was there any thing at all, which the Lord expected form his creature, in his obedience unto him, but what was wholly conteined in thoſe ten words.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>The Law-being delivered in ſo few words, and the Covenant therein conteined, being ſo dark and myſtical, How came they then to underſtand Gods meaning therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Lord was pleaſed in much wiſdom and goodneſs, to explain thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119914:23"/>
words, and to interpret his own meaning <note place="margin">Exod. 21, and 22, and 23.</note>

               </gap>herein; both as they concerned them in their duty to himſelf, and alſo as they conteined their duty and behaviour one towards another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> goes up into the Mount, where the Lord commands him in particular how they ought to behave themſelves one towards another, naming alſo certain feaſts-dayes, and other obſervations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Exod. 23. Exod. 24. 3, 4.</note> them; and <hi>Moſes</hi> writes all the words of the Lord in a Book, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares them to the people, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe obedience. And as this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined <note place="margin">Exod. 24. 12.</note> Gods Worſhip, and their duty therein, <hi>Moſes</hi> is again called up into the Mount, where he is forty dayes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nights; in which ſpace God ſhewes him a Pattern, commands him to make him a Sanctuary, that he might dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">Exod. 25, 26, 27, 28 29, 30.</note> them; and alſo gives him rules of a moſt exact and holy Worſhip, which he expects ſhould be ſtrictly performed by them; in which both holy place, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worſhip, he doth really (yet darkly) declare, that unleſs he dwell among them, and communicate himſelf unto them, they could not be a holy people. For indeed, that very Tabernacle, and afterward the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119914:24"/>
Temple, were repreſentations or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the humane body of Chriſt, in which the Lord would manifeſt himſelf, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> and dwell among them, as the Veſſels wherewith they miniſtred were holy: So the Lord would have them know, that he <note place="margin">Pſal. 29. 2.</note> could not be Spiritually worſhipped with Carnal hearts and hands.</p>
            <p>The Ark was a viſible Type of Chriſt, by whom the Lord would manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>The two Tables of the Covenant were <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. and 21. 6.</note> put into the Ark, to ſhew, that Chriſt was both the Law and the Covenant to his own; and that the righteouſneſs, which the Law required, was wholly in <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 9.</note> him.</p>
            <p>The Mercy-ſeat where God appeared, was placed above upon the Ark, to ſhew, <note place="margin">Iſa. 59. 21.</note> that God would not manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in mercy and goodneſs to any, but onely to them that were in Covenant with him in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Table, and the Shew-bread that ſtood upon it, was to teach them, that <note place="margin">Iohn 6, 48, 51.</note> Chriſt was both the Feeder and the food.</p>
            <p>The Candleſtick, with his ſeven Lamps alwayes burning, did ſignifie the wiſdom <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10, 14.</note> of the Spirit, without which, there was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119914:24"/>
no finding out the mind of God in theſe myſteries.</p>
            <p>The Oyl, wherewith the Lamps were <note place="margin">Exod. 27. 20.</note> dreſſed, and made to burn, was of pure Oyl-olive, beaten, and without mixture; to ſhew, that the true knowledge of God in the myſtery of Chriſt, was not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the help of humane wiſdom and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12</note> learning, but by the light and wiſdom of the Spirit onely.</p>
            <p>The Altar, and all thoſe Beaſts that were offered thereon, did ſignifie Chriſt, <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 4.</note> his death and ſufferings, who ſhould (by offering up himſelf to God once for all) both redeem them from the curſe of the <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> Law, and for ever perfect them that are ſanctified.</p>
            <p>The blood of thoſe Beaſts wherewith they were ſprinkled, did ſignifie the blood of Chriſt; wherewith the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be made, and whereby their <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> Conſciences were to be purged from the dead works of the Law, to ſerve the living God in Spirit and Truth.</p>
            <p>The Prieſts, which offered the ſacrifice were holy men, and conſecrated, and ſet apart for that ſervice; to ſhew, that God will be ſanctified in all them that draw near to him. <note place="margin">Levit. 10.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119914:25"/>
The ſacrifices might not be offered without a Prieſt, to teach, that there is not any ſervice can be acceptable to God, unleſs it were offered up to him in the Spirit and Power of Jeſus. <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The glorious and beautiful garments wherein <hi>Aaron</hi> did miniſter, did hold forth the infinite purity, and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency and righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus, in whom onely God is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The Onix-ſtones, whereon the names <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> of the Children of Iſrael were engraven, were put upon the ſhoulder-pieces of the Ephod; to teach, that true Iſrael in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are kept by the power of the Lord Jeſus through faith unto ſalvation; for he <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 24</note> is the wiſdom and the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation in all that do believe.</p>
            <p>The twelve precious ſtones, which were ſet with the names of the Children <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> of Iſrael, in the Breaſt-plate of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did declare; that Spiritual Iſrael that were in Chriſt, were a precious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> in the judgement and eſteem of God.</p>
            <p>The curious Girdle (wherewith all thoſe goodly garments were girded to the Prieſt, did hold forth the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 23</note> and truth of God, in making good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119914:25"/>
all his promiſes in Chriſt, in whom all <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> the promiſes of God are Yea, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The holy Anoynting Oyl, wherewith the Tabernacle, and all the furniture, and the Veſſels there of were Anoynted, did ſignifie the Anoynting of the Spirit, <note place="margin">1 John 2. 27.</note> which they that did believe ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receive: it might not be poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mans fleſh, neither might any man make the like to it, nor put it upon a <note place="margin">Acts 1. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>A.</hi> The Lord having in his eternal purpoſe, choſen to himſelf a people to <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> be heires of life by Chriſt Jeſus, did yet notwithſtanding for many generations, ſuſpend the manifeſtation of his love and favour unto all the people of the <note place="margin">Col. 1. 26.</note> world, except the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Iſraelites onely, whom he had brought near to himſelf, and to whom he manifeſted his great love, not onely in outward and temporal bleſſings, but chiefly in ſpiritual adminiſtrations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all forbidding them to have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 1, 2, 3.</note> with any nation whatſoever, unleſſe they would be circumciſed, and worſhip God according as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 48.</note> them; which thing occaſioned ſuch an enmity and hatred in all nations againſt the Iſraelites, that they would <note place="margin">Pſal. 83, 2. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c,</note> not be reconciled unto them at any hand: yea, though the enemies were very different in Religion and Idol-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and hated one another even unto death; yet they could agree together againſt the Iſrael of God, to root out <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 12</note> their name from the earth: And this enmity or hatred was not againſt them,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119914:28"/>
as they were men, or becauſe they were of different nations; but herein lay the enmity, becauſe the Iſraelites did worſhip the true God with ſuch holy worſhip as he had commanded, (the ſeed of the Serpent, or the Devil, in all falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> and religions, perſecuting the ſeed of the woman, or Chriſt and the Saints, in the true Religion, and pure worſhip of God in all agés) and ſo the hatred was not onely againſt the Iſraelites in their perſons, but even againſt the good wayes of God in his pure worſhip, and herein againſt God himſelf.</p>
            <p>The great myſtery, that the Gentiles ſhould be heires of life with the Jewes, <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 5, 6.</note> partakers of the ſame promiſes, and of the ſame body, was not yet revealed, but kept ſecret. But now they, who were <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13, 14, 15.</note> ſometimes afarre off, were made nigh by the bloud of Chriſt; for Chriſt, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting himſelf in the fleſh to death, did break down that partition wall, and that enmity that was between Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, being ſlain thereby; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 16.</note> they before were twain, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another, yet now by the death of Chriſt they were united and made one, and not onely reconciled to one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119914:28"/>
another, but alſo to God through faith in Jeſus. Thus the Gentiles by the <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 17. and 3. 9.</note> preaching of the Goſpel, came to know, that which before they did not know, even to believe their Son-ſhip, and their intereſt in the Covenant by Jeſus Chriſt; yet notwithſtanding they were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, as it was a Covenant of works for temporal bleſſings, for ſo it concerned the Iſraelites onely, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 35, 36.</note> as they acted to the command, ſo they proſpered in their temporal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; and this part of the Covenant was peculiar onely unto them. But as the Law was ſpiritual, and contained in it a Covenant of grace, ſo all the elect, both Jewes and Gentiles, were concluded in it, it being an eternal Covenant, made with all the Saints in Jeſus Chriſt, in the <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2, 3.</note> eternal purpoſe of God, before the world began; and in due time manifeſted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpenſation of God, who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will; (that is, who <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 11.</note> revealeth, and diſcovereth himſelf in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to whomſoever, after what way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and in what time ſoever, he himſelf pleaſeth.)</p>
            <p>But yet the Gentiles were not under
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119914:29"/>
thoſe legall ſervices, and formal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Covenant, as the Paſſeover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Circumciſion, all thoſe Sacrifices and Offerings, thoſe legall waſhings and cleanſings; in a word, all that Temple-worſhip whatſoever, they being all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, conſummated, and ended in Chriſt: for now in this way of Temple-worſhip, neither Jewes nor Gentiles were to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> God, he having withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his appearances out of all theſe things; but now both Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were to look unto God in Chriſt, in whom, and by whoſe moſt precious <note place="margin">Acts 13. 38, 39.</note> death and bloud-ſhedding, he declared himſelf to be fully ſatisfied for all thoſe tranſgreſſions and diſobediences, from which they could not be juſtified by the workes of the Law.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>The</hi> Gentiles <hi>indeed were not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe legall Worſhips and Services which the</hi> Jewes <hi>did: But were they not to make the Law of God the rule of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Law as it was delivered to Iſrael upon the Mount, ſo it was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the moſt holy and perfect will of God, and ſo it was the rule of their obedience: Now the Law being of a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119914:29"/>
twofold conſideration, it was the will of God, that their obedience ſhould be ſuteable thereto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As the Law was outward, and <note place="margin">Levit. 26.</note> reſpected onely the outward man; ſo it was his will, that they ſhould be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> in all things, to the very letter and form of all his commands, and herein they were to act with all their ſtrength, in caſe they would be outwardly happy.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, As the Law was ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and concerned the inward man, ſo their obedience was to be anſwerable to the will of God herein: Now it was <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> not the will of God, that they ſhould act herein, according to the letter, and think to attain Righteouſneſſe by a ſtrict per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any or all thoſe religious ſervices; but that they ſhould believe in him, who was prefigured in all thoſe <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 40.</note> ſervices (which was Chriſt) and caſt themſelves wholly upon God in him, for Righteouſneſſe, both unto juſtification and fanctification: But now Chriſt being come in the fleſh, and having in himſelf ended all thoſe ſignifications; it is the will of God, that both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mark 9. 7.</note> ſhould believe in him, and reſt confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured, that God is graciouſly well <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 18.</note>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:119914:30"/>
pleaſed with them, in him, having for his ſake forgiven them all their treſpaſſes: ſo that the will of God being the ruleof mens obedience, it is the will of God, that they ſhould not act according to <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 23.</note> the letter of the Law for life; but that they ſhould believe on the name of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, in whom is eternall life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is not the Law, even in the terrors of it, a good meanes to drive men to Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Law, as it was delivered to Iſrael on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was ſo holy, ſo pure, and of ſuch tranſcendent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that all the wiſdome and power <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 10, 11, 12.</note> of men could not deviſe any meanes, nor perform any action, that might in the leaſt be ſuteable to the will of God herein; they being by nature acted by a ſpirit or principle quite contrary to the moſt pure, holy, and righteous will <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 9.</note> of God: hereupon the Law was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death, threatning wrath upon every diſobedience; ſo that in this reſpect, the Law was, and is ſo far from being a meanes to drive men to God, that is, was, and is, rather an occaſion to drive them from him; either, firſt, into
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119914:30"/>
deſpair, if he ſhould turn their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 5.</note> looſe upon them: Or elſe ſecondly, by ſtirring up the enmity that is in the <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5.</note> minds of men, to make them hate God, and all the holy wayes of God: Or thirdly, (men being ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of God) are hereby ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Rom, 10. 3.</note> up to invent ſome way or worſhip of their own, whereby they may appear righteous before God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How could the Law, being ſo pure and holy, occaſion or ſtir up the enmity that is in mens minds againſt God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A man, in the ſtate of innocency, was able to look upon God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, every appearance and diſcovery of God unto him was pleaſant and delightful; and the more the Lord was pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf unto man, the more mans heart was enlarged to love him, and his commandments were not grievous; in this condition there was neither cauſe nor occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, much leſſe of enmity or hatred between God and him. But when man <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 1.</note> by ſin was fallen from God, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with Satan, who hated God; then he, who before was like unto God, <note place="margin">Pſal. 83. 3.</note> and loved God, was now become like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119914:31"/>
the Devil, and hated God; and this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or hatred was not againſt God, as he was a good and loving God, for that man was not now able to apprehend; but in that he was a juſt and a righteous God, for ſo he was pleaſed to appear unto him.</p>
            <p>Before the Law was given, the Lord manifeſted himſelf to men very ſeldome, and very low, and they knew but very little of him, except in the outward cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: all this while men were exceeding <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 13.</note> ſinful, and death had dominion over them, yet nevertheleſſe, God did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute every tranſgreſſion unto them, (though he often plagued them for their groſſe and greivous ſinnes) for there was no written precept; and the Law of nature was by ſin ſo blotted and blurred, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> that no man was able thereby to read, or know his duty: and now men were alive (at leaſt in their own conceits) they thought themſelves to be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and their conditions to be very good, ſo long as they abſtained from ſuch groſſeneſſe as very nature abhorred: becauſe they did not know ſin, many things that were very ſinful went currant for morall vertues, and many things that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119914:31"/>
were duties, were not looked upon as any thing at all; ſin was as it were dead, men were ſo benummed in it.</p>
            <p>But now when the Commandement (on the Law) came, when God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to appear in a moſt righteous Law, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> whereby every ſin and tranſgreſſion was brought to light, (it being, through the power of God, a diſcerner of the thoughts and purpoſes of the heart:) now ſin revived, for now ſin was diſcovered, whatſoever was contrary to the holy will of God, was known to be a ſin; and every duty was now known to be a duty: ſo that by the Law men were become ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> (that is) they were now made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their ſinful diſpoſitions, which before the Law came they did not know. But this was not all; for the Law did not onely diſcover ſin to be ſin, but alſo did occaſion ſin to be more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: That corruption of nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 11.</note> every man is tainted, and whereby every man is become prone to evil, that ſinning ſin, took occaſion by the Law or Commandement, to work in natural men all manner of evil; for the Law was ſo holy, and ſo high, that no man was able to attain to the perfection of it in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:119914:32"/>
the leaſt degree: and it was alſo the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of condemnation, threatening wrath, and curſe, upon every diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now men perceiving, that they were neither able to attain to that purity which the Law required, nor yet to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape that wrath which the Law threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that natural corruption, that ſinful <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 5.</note> diſpoſition, that is in every mans heart by nature, was hereby quickened and ſtirred up, through the working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to hate God, and to oppoſe him in all his holy and righteous wayes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances: and yet the Law is not ſin, <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> nor the cauſe of death unto any man, but holy, and juſt, and good: But ſin, (or the vicious diſpoſition of every mans heart) being carried on by the Devil, did ſo rage and ſwell againſt the purity <note place="margin">verſe 13.</note> and righteouſneſſe of God revealed in the Law, that they ſinned the more, and <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 22.</note> acted all manner of wickedneſſe with greater violence; even as a mighty ſtream being ſtopped, rages, and ſwells, and breakes down all dammes, and ſtops whatſoever: and hence it is, that the Commandement, which was ordained to life, was to them an occaſion of <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 13.</note> death, and thus ſinne by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119914:32"/>
became exceeding ſinfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Doth the Law occaſion ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or hatred in the Elect alſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Elect, and they that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to be conformed unto the Image of Chriſt, come under a two-fold conſideration. Firſt, as they are in the ſtate of nature: and ſecondly, as <note place="margin">Acts 2. 22, 23.</note> they are in a ſtate of grace. As they are in the ſtate of nature, ſo they are in the ſtate of enmity, and there is no difference herein between them and all other men (but onely in the account of God:) they hate God as much as any, oppoſe him as much as any, and had a hand, and gave their voyce in the crucifying of Chriſt as much as any men whatſoever; and in this condition the Law is to them the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death, and their hearts riſe againſt it, and they cannot endure to hear of the purity and equity thereof. But when they are once brought into the ſtate of grace, when they once apprehend the love of God manifeſted to them in <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 13.</note> Jeſus Chriſt, who is become their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; then they are delivered from <note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> the Law, as it did occaſion hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them; for in this reſpect Chriſt took it away, and nailed it to his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119914:33"/>
Croſſe, ſo that ſin, which was the cauſe of <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 15.</note> enmity, and the Law, which by occaſion did quicken and ſtirre up this enmity, were both nailed to the Croſſe of Chriſt, and ſlain together in his fleſh; and now <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 6.</note> the Elect or Believers are delivered from the Law, that they ſhould no longer ſerve in the oldneſſe of the letter, in feares and terrors, but in the newneſſe of the Spirit, with comfort and delight.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>The Law, or Commandement, being ordained of God unto life; How then did it become uſeleſſe and void?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God did indeed ordain or appoint the Law unto life, but not that any man ſhould attain unto life, by any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or outward obſervation of the ſame whatſoever; but that by believing in God, through him who was held forth, and prefigured in and by the Law, they might have eternal life; neither is the Law become uſeleſſe and void, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 18.</note> and earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away, than that one word of the Law ſhould fail; for it is a revelation of Gods perfect righteouſneſſe, commanding perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all men who are not in Chriſt; and it is a miniſtration of death and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 7.</note> condemnation, and bindes over every
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119914:33"/>
unbeliever, to anſwer for every diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, before the tribunal of Chriſt: It <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> ſerves ſtill to diſcover ſin; and thereby leaves wicked men without excuſe. In theſe and the like reſpects, the Law is holy, and juſt, and good, and ſhall not be diſſolved till all be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is the Law then of no uſe to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or the Elect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Elect, while they are in the ſtate of nature, and untill they be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and born anew of that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 1, 2</note> ſeed which lives and abides for ever, ſo long they are under the Law, and it threatens them, and curſes them (but it cannot condemn them, becauſe they are in Chriſt, in the purpoſe of God;) it commands their obedience, but doth not aſſiſt them to obey; it kills them, but cannot make them alive; yet it is in ſome ſence a Schoolmaſter unto them, to lead them to Chriſt (though not in the terrors of it, yet in the true ends, and right underſtanding of it) for Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſſe, <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> (that is) the main end, why the Law was given, was, that men ſhould look to Chriſt for righteouſneſſe. The Law therefore to the Elect, while they are in the ſtate of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119914:34"/>
nature, being rightly expounded to them, and truly apprehended by them, doth inſtruct them, that they muſt lay down all their own righteouſneſſe, which is (as they think) attained by the performance <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5.</note> of the duties of the Law, and reſt onely and wholly upon Chriſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for while they remain in unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracie, they verily think, that they are bound to act according to the Law for life, or elſe they ſhall be damned; they <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23.</note> being ſhut up all this while under the Law, as in priſon, unto the faith, which is afterward to be revealed, yea, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times alſo, when they are quickened, and made alive, and are ſet at liberty, or when they doe believe in Jeſus Chriſt in ſome meaſure; yet they are ſo held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpirit of bondage, that they ſtill <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> ſerve in the oldneſſe of the letter, in great fears and many doubts, and go heavily, and mourning, under the eaſie and light yoak of Chriſt, becauſe they apprehend in themſelves, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by others alſo, that although they do believe in Jeſus Chriſt for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, yet it is their duty to walk in a ſtrict conformity to the Law, or elſe they cannot be ſaved: and then finding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119914:34"/>
in themſelves, that they are not able to <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> walk ſo exactly as the Law requireth (it being weak, and yeilding them no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in the work) are many times ſo caſt down, and filled with fear, that they refuſe to be comforted; and the beſt they can attain unto in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this: that when they apprehend their walking to be ſomewhat, or in any good meaſure anſwerable to the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which the Law requireth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they find their hearts to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the ſame (as they are able to judge) then they think that God will accept of them for their uprightneſſe, although they cannot attain to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the Law requireth: But when they come to believe indeed, when <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> they are enabled to reſt confidently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt for righteouſneſſe unto life and ſalvation, then they ſee and <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 1. 4</note> know, that they are delivered from the Law, and that the Law, as it is the Law, hath nothing to doe with them, and that they are neither under the command of it, nor yet under the threats nor curſes <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 6.</note> of it; the Law, in this reſpect, being dead unto them, and they dead unto it; and that they are to ſerve now no longer in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119914:35"/>
weakneſſe and fear, but in power and with delight; for they are under the new Covenant, which is a Covenant of grace, and being under grace, are thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and accepted.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Was not the Covenant of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law, and were not the believing Iſraelites under the Covenant of grace? What then is this new Covenant? Or why is it called a (new) Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Law did contain in ita Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and a Covenant of grace: The Covenant of works was outward, and reſpected onely the outward man; and in this they acted for temporal things: But the Covenant of grace was inward, and in this they were not to act, but to believe to eternal life. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works was very literal, and largely expreſſed, and they were all very well acquainted with it: But the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace was ſpiritual, and very little of it expreſſed, but ſhadowed out under divers Ordinances, and obſervations, and therefore very few of them did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, or had any knowledge of it; but imagined, that by their outward obſervations they had done all that was commanded: Now this Covenant, as it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119914:35"/>
was thus outward, and reſpected onely outward and temporal things; ſo it is an old Covenant, and is vaniſhed away; and in this reſpect, the Covenant of grace <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note> is called, a better Covenant, becauſe it conſiſts of better promiſes, which are, life and glory in Chriſt Jeſus: And a <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 9.</note> new Covenant, and not like the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with them, when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which Covenant they brake, that is, they underſtood not his meaning in the very outward Covenant, but ſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own luſts in the ſame, therefore he would utterly aboliſh, and take away that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Again, it is called a new Covenant, though it be the ſame with the former Covenant, which was made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and with the Iſraelites at the giving of the Law; for even the Covenant of grace was very dark and myſtical, made forth under types and ſignifications, and therefore very imperfect and weak, and <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> yielded very little or no ſtrength; and therefore was diſanulled, becauſe of the weakneſſe and unprofitableneſſe <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 18, 19.</note> thereof: But the new Covenant (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt or that better hope in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119914:36"/>
Goſpel-dayes) is ſtrong in the Spirit, and brings in life and power into the hearts of them who are entred therein, whereby they are enabled to ſerve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</p>
            <p>Again, under the ſervices of the Law, Chriſt, the ſum and ſubſtance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was vailed and hidden, very few knew but little of him: But now under <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 11.</note> the new Covenant, the Saints all know him from the leaſt to the greateſt, they <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18</note> of weak faith, and they of ſtrong, every one in their meaſure; for they all with open face, as in a glaſſe, behold him, and are thereby changed into his image, from one degree of glory to another.</p>
            <p>Thus, and in other reſpects, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, in the dayes of the Goſpel, is called a new Covenant.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not God promiſe in the new Covenant, to write his Lawes in their hearts, and in their mindes? How then are the Saintsfreed from the Law?</hi> Jer. 31. 33.</p>

them in their obedience; and Chriſt, who was the ſum and ſubſtance of the Law, was revealed or made known but in a very ſmall meaſure; the Spirit in thoſe <note place="margin">Joh. 7. 39.</note> dayes run very low, the Lord being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to vail and cover his glory until an appointed time: But the Law which <note place="margin">Iſai. 31. 6.</note> God promiſed to put into their mindes, is Chriſt, who indeed is the Law and the Covenant; for now Chriſt being glorified, and having received of God authority, and power, or the promiſe of the Spirit, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again, the Law was a miniſtration of <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 9.</note> condemnation, and threatened wrath upon every diſobedience, which cauſed terrors and fears even in the beſt of them. But Chriſt, who is the new Covenant, is a miniſtration of righteouſneſſe; that is, in the Goſpel Chriſt is made known to be the righteouſneſſe of God, which the <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:119914:37"/>
Law required, he having perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law, in all the high demands thereof, by walking exactly in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commands of the ſame; and not ſo alone, but alſo hath ſtopped the mouth <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> of the accuſing and condemning power of the Law, by yeilding and ſubmitting himſelf in the fleſh to death and curſe; and thus Chriſt is the Saints righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to juſtification, fulfilling the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law for them. And <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> Chriſt in the new Covenant is alſo a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of life, and peace in the Saints, fulfilling daily the righteouſneſſe of the Law in them; (that is) the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now united and made one with Chriſt, and one with God in Chriſt are thereby enabled to act righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, and doe not look unto the <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> Law for their pattern, but unto Chriſt the truth of that pattern; for <hi>he is the way, the truth, and the life;</hi> and thus the Law, as it comes from <hi>Sinai,</hi> is ſilenced to believers, they being neither under commanding, nor yet the condemning power of it: But as the Law comes from <note place="margin">Iſai. 2. 2, 3.</note> Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as Chriſt is both the Law and the Covenant, ſo the Saints are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 21</note> Law to God, but under the Law to

Chriſt, he being a Law of the Spirit, and a Law of life in their hearts, freeing them from the Law of ſin and death, and quickening and raiſing their hearts to life and glory, by and in himſelf.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Law, as it comes from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and is figured in ſtones, ceaſeth to the Saints, and the duties and commands thereof, ceaſe to be the duties of the Law, but are the duties and commands of the <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> Goſpel, even the commands of Chriſt, new commands, or the Law of Chriſt. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 8.</note>

Q. <hi>How comes it to paſſe (ſeeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Law, were under the ſame Covenant for life and ſalvation, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel, and they that were ſaved under the Law, were ſaved by faith in Chriſt as well as under the Goſpel) or what may be the reaſon, that the Saints, or true Believers, act now more lively and chearfully, and are quickened up to a more cloſe and holy walking with God in theſe Goſpel-dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more than under the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Covenant of grace was the ſame indeed under the Law, as it is under the Goſpel; but it was very myſtical and obſcure, even to them that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for it pleaſed God to cloud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that they could not ſee him, or but very little of him.</p>
            <p>When they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he <note place="margin">Exod. 13. 21.</note> went before them in a cloud, in a very dark and obſcure manner.</p>
            <p>At the giving of the Law, he appeared <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 21.</note> in ſmoak and thick darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> had built the Temple, which was a figure or type of Chriſt, as they were performing religious ſervices therein, it is ſaid, that the Lord diſcovered himſelf in a cloud, <hi>a cloud filled the houſe.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 5. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it appears, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearences
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119914:38"/>
of God unto them in thoſe dayes were very much clouded, they ſaw very little of him, even what he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to let out in a few outward ſervices, ſuſpending of purpoſe the manifeſtation of his glory untill the fulneſſe of time. Now while the Lord was pleaſed thus darkly to reveal himſelf, then he was pleaſed to accept of weak faith, and mean ſervices.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Iſraelites were under a mixt Covenant, partly inward, and partly outward: the inward part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was Chriſt, was clouded, and very dark, as was ſaid before, and very <note place="margin">Lev. 26. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> little notice taken of it by the greateſt part of them. But the outward part of it was very plain and eaſie, and they all knew it very well, and acted generally according unto it, and minded earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> long life, and outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therein, more than heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> or the ſweet and comfortable enjoyment of God, in the lively apprehenſion of his love and favour.</p>
            <p>But now Chriſt, who indeed is the <note place="margin">Iſai. 59. 21.</note> new Covenant, (for he is the ſubſtance of all thoſe former Covenants) being come, and having acted his part in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119914:39"/>
fleſh, is now revealed in the Spirit; for <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17</note> he is that Spirit or power of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, proceeding eternally from the Father upon the Son, and from the Son upon the Saints, and into their hearts: and now the Saints look not for Chriſt <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 20, 21.</note> in outward obſervations, but in inward and ſpiritual demonſtrations of infinite love, ſhed abroad in their hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> they are transformed, and conformed, unto Chriſt their head more and more: <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> Neither doe the Saints now look to any outward Covenant, for there is no promiſe made unto them of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Mark 10. 30.</note> or temporal things, but with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and that they ſhall be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their conditions: But the Saints <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 6.</note> look unto Jeſus, who is the author and finiſher of their faith, and count it all joy, when they are accounted worthy to ſuffer <note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> rebuke for his name.</p>
            <p>And this is the true reaſon, why the Saints walk with God ſo chearfully and joyfully, becauſe they clearly ſee, that they are not juſtified by, or for, any work, or merit, or worth of their own, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 16.</note> by the free grace and love of God, in and for the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Lord our righteouſneſſe, <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6.</note>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:119914:39"/>
both unto juſtification, and alſo unto ſanctification.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is juſtification? Or how may ſinfull men be ſaid to be juſtified, or made righteous before God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Juſtification is an act of Gods free grace and love, whereby he (through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt) <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 24.</note> hath freely forgiven the ſinnes of all his elect, and accepts of them (in him) as perfectly juſt and righteous.</p>
            <p>But more plainly, Juſtification is that, <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7, 8.</note> whereby God himſelf is pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend, and to cloath himſelf with our fleſh, and in our nature, and our fleſh, to fulfill all the righteouſneſſe of the Law for us: and alſo to ſubject himſelf in the fleſh to death and curſe, hereby paying <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> all our debts, and ſatisfying divine Juſtice on our behalf, and ſo became our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe for juſtification: All which he hath done freely, without any deſert, or deſire, on our part.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not the Scripture ſay, that we are juſtified by faith? What is faith? And how are we juſtified by the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There be in Scripture divers kinds <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22.</note> of faith mentioned, by reaſon whereof, many think, that they believe to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119914:40"/>
and are deceived; for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is free on Gods part, and without any condition at all on our part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if faith were a condition of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it were not free, juſtification being an act of God in his eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> and purpoſe, before the world began; if faith were a condition thereof, then are we juſtified for ſome fore-ſeen grace in us, and not freely by his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 5, 6.</note> faith is neither a meanes, nor yet any condition of juſtification, but rather an evidence, or demonſtration thereof; for true faith is that, whereby we cloſe <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19, 20. Joh. 6. 44.</note> with God in the promiſe of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in and by Jeſus Chriſt: Now this faith is not in us by nature, but is wrought in the heart, by the manifeſtation of God <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> in the ſoul: When the Lord is pleaſed to reveal Chriſt in the ſoul, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the ſame, that he is well pleaſed with him in Jeſus, and that he hath freely forgiven all his ſinnes, meerly for the merit and righteouſneſſe of Jeſus, and that now he accepts of him as righteous, in his beloved Son; and that in Chriſt he hath adopted him to himſelf, to be his Son: now when the ſoul apprehends <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 21</note> this, then it is thereby enabled to believe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119914:40"/>
it, and reſts upon it. And thus true faith doth not act in the workes of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely believes it when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the ſoul; and then believing, <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1, 2</note> hath peace with God, and can look upon him with comfort, and can joy in him in all tribulations. Now no man can believe <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 44.</note> in Jeſus Chriſt, untill he be revealed unto him by the Father: and according to the meaſure or degrees whereby God is pleaſed to diſcover himſelf to any man, ſo he can believe or confide in him more or leſſe: ſo that it is plain, that faith is no meanes or condition of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; but by faith we believe it, and reſt confidently aſſured of it when it is revealed, and ſo have joy and peace in believing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not the Scripture ſay, that</hi> Abraham was juſtified by works? <hi>what</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 21.</note> 
               <hi>ſay you then of good workes (as prayer, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing the word, repentance, and all other duties of piety and charity) are not they required as good meanes of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The ſcope of that Scripture is not to declare, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did act any thing in the work of juſtification; for it is ſaid, that <hi>Abraham believed God, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3.</note>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:119914:41"/>
               <hi>it was accounted to him for righteouſneſſe:</hi> and thoſe good works, whereby <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 22.</note> is ſaid to be juſtified, doe rather declare him to believe, and his faith to be a live, than any way to act in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of juſtification, For faith, as is ſaid before, doth not juſtifie, but believes it, and applies it: true faith works by love, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> and ſhewes what houſe it comes of, by actions of piety and mercy.</p>
            <p>There is a faith which is dead, it being nothing elſe, but a perſwaſion of a carnal <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 20.</note> heart, which is deceitfull, and of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men brag and boaſt, and cry religion, religion; but they doe not walk in love, neither toward God nor men; and this faith profiteth nothing, or profitable to no man, and is no better than the faith of Devils.</p>
            <p>But true faith where it is indeed, it proceeds from a holy ſeed, being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 44.</note> by the manifeſtation or diſcovery of God in the ſoul, and hath for its ground a word of promiſe, not onely without, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 9.</note> but, eſpecially within, and is reall, and not in imagination; ſo alſo it acts like it ſelf, and is profitable every way.</p>
            <p>Firſt toward God, it gives him the glory of all his wiſdome, power, juſtice,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119914:41"/>
mercy, and goodneſſe, when men can ſay indeed, <hi>In the Lord have I righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 45. 24.</note> and in <hi>the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting</hi> 
               <note place="margin">and 26. 4. Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
               <hi>ſtrength:</hi> when a man can ſay, <hi>now I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> yea, I can doe all things, be any thing, ſuffer any thing, through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me: <hi>I can be abaſed, and I can abound;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>I can as well be content to be hungry, as to be full fed;</hi> to be poor as to be rich, to ſuffer as to raign, to dye as to live; when <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> a man can live in God, and unto God, above all this world, and eſteem all things but droſſe and dung, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>And true faith is alſo profitable to men, when it is exerciſed in godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, building up one another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting one another, and (if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) reproving one another; when it works in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, releiving the oppreſſed, and by doing to every man as we would be done unto. This is living faith, and it <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> is thus evidenced to be alive.</p>
            <p>Thus we are not juſtified by, nor for, our good workes; for we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created a new in Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119914:42"/>
unto good workes, that we ſhould walk inthem: Juſtification, where it is indeed, will evidence it ſelf by acts of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is ſanctification? And how is it wrought?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As Chriſt is made of God righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto us for juſtification, ſo alſo for ſanctification: as he is our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe he perfectly fulfilled the righteouſneſſe of the Law for us, and paid all our debts, yeilding up himſelf to death for us: ſo alſo he is become our ſanctification, by fulfilling the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 4.</note> of the Law in our hearts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by living in us. As we are juſtified <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> by his death, ſo we are ſaved, or ſanctified, by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſfe.</p>
            <p>Sanctification is an act of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love, whereby he takes us out of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the old man, and puts us into <note place="margin">2 Cor, 5. 17</note> Chriſt, or the new man; and this is the new creation, or the new creature, when a man that before was unholy, profane, and to every good work void of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is now become (through the power of Chriſt living in him) holy, unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ready to every good work; and this is wrought by the power of God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119914:42"/>
revealing Chriſt in the ſoul; when Chriſt is revealed in the ſoul to be white and <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 10.</note> ruddy, the moſt excellent, the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, one, in whom God is well pleaſed, and in whom his ſoul delighteth, yea, and <note place="margin">Iſai. 42. 1.</note> by whom, and in whom, he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with poor ſinners, and delights in them: then that ſoul is raviſhed with his beauty, which is his love, and with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18</note> or apprehending of it, is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the ſame Image of love more and more. Chriſt is the Saints life, and <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3, 4.</note> this life is hid in God, untill it be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when Chriſt, who is our life, doth appear in the ſoul, then the ſoul lives in his life, and appeares with him in glory.</p>
            <p>Now every one in whom Chriſt lives indeed, he conformes them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in death, if Chriſt be riſen in the ſoul, then the old man is crucified, that <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> the body of ſin might be deſtroyed; and the ſoul is dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God in holineſſe, through Jeſus Chriſt, who lives in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Where Chriſt is riſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there is a conformity in life: Chriſt being (the life living) in the ſoul, the ſoul muſt needs live indeed, and live
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119914:43"/>
unto God, and not any longer to the fleſh; for to be carnally minded is death, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note> but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace: and thus is Chriſt our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when he ariſes and appeares in our hearts, whereby he transformes and changes us into his own Image, even his Image of glory more and more.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not the Lord in Scripture call men to repentance, and promiſe them life upon condition of the ſame; yea, the Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11</note> 
               <hi>doth ſolemnly proteſt, that he delights not in the death of him that dieth, but rather that he ſhould repent, and turn, and live: And again, why will yee die? repent, and turn, and live yee. And our Saviour ſaith, except yee repent, yee ſhall all periſh: and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles exhort them in the Acts, to repent for the remiſſion of ſinnes; and that their ſinnes might be blotted out. And again, if we confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe. Doth it not from all theſe places appear very plain, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is neceſſarily required, as a meanes, or at leaſt a condition of life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is in Scripture a twofold repentance ſpoken of, a repentance of the Law, and a repentance of the Goſpel.</p>

The repentance which is of the Law, is ſuteable to that Covenant of workes, which the Iſraelites were under for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings; when they at any time acted contrary to the command, then <note place="margin">1 King. 8. 33, 35, 46, 47.</note> the Lord plagued them, ſometimes with famine, peſtilence, warre, captivity, &amp;c. untill they did repent; and when they repented, or ceaſed from their wicked wayes and works, then the Lord would alſo repent, or remove the judgement; for temporal bleſſings were promiſed upon condition of outward obedience, and temporal puniſhments were diverted, or turned away, upon their legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ceaſing from their evill wayes.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> propheſie, the Iſraelites were many of them in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity already, and the reſt of them were threatened: and when the Lord by the Prophet called for repentance, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thought it was to ſmall purpoſe to <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 2. and 33. 10.</note> repent, ſeeing their fathers had eaten ſour grapes, and their teeth were ſet on edge; and that it was but a light buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to promiſe them any good, upon condition of repentance, ſeeing they did but pine away in their fathers ſinnes.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119914:44"/>
To which the Lord commands the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to tell them, that it was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was their own ſin which was the cauſe of their miſery; and that if they <note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> would return from their idolatries, and other abominations, he would ceaſe from puniſhing of them, and hereupon uſes that ſolemn oath, <hi>As I live, I have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in plaguing you,</hi> I had rather yee would turn from your evill wayes, and live in your own land: why will yee die? or why will yee be ſlain, or die by famine, or peſtilence, &amp;c. And ſo our Saviour tells thoſe, which ſpake to him of <hi>Pilates</hi> cruelty, that unleſſe they did repent, they <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 2, 3</note> ſhould likewiſe periſh, meaning that ſome temporal judgement would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them; and thus legal repentance <note place="margin">1 King. 21. 27, 29.</note> ſerved onely for the preventing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of temporal puniſhments.</p>
            <p>But repentance which is of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is not any meanes or condition of life; for eternal life is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; and it <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> is a free gift, and not purchaſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor yet promiſed, nor given upon condition of repentance; for it is <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38, 39.</note> not ſin, nor Satan, nor death it ſelf, can make a ſeparation between them that are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119914:44"/>
elected, and the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, which is eternal life: The Lord, <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 19. Tit. 1. 2.</note> who hath promiſed, is not a man that he ſhould lie, or the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent in this reſpect. Now this repentance is called godly ſorrow, and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10</note> it is wrought by the working power of Gods love in the ſoul apprehended by faith, and is a fruit of faith.</p>
            <p>There is a worldly ſorrow, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or worketh death, being wrought by the apprehenſion of death or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this is in wicked and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men, fear of death drives them to <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3.</note> a kind of repentance; yea, and the Saints ſometimes having attained but a ſmall meaſure of the apprehenſion of Gods love in Jeſus Chriſt, being under a ſpirit of bondage, and looking upon God as he <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> manifeſted himſelf upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> are ſo filled with fear and terror, which cauſeth abundance of ſorrow, even mourning and grieving exceedingly, becauſe they can grieve no more; and that meerly upon this ground, that if their ſorrow were in any good meaſure anſwerable to their ſin; then they hope that God will pardon them, apprehending in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and being told ſo by others, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119914:45"/>
if they doe not ſoundly repent, mourn, and grieve for their ſinnes, heartily and ſeriouſly confeſſe them, with a reſolution to leave and forſake them, that God would not, nay could not, pardon them; and all this from miſ-underſtanding of Scripture, as <hi>he that hideth his ſinne ſhall</hi>

               <hi>confeſſe our ſinnes, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive,</hi> &amp;c. concluding from the very letter of theſe Scriptures (not having the true meaning thereof explained unto them) that unleſſe they firſt grieve, and mourn, and confeſſe, God will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and ſo goe heavily under this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for want of better information: but true repentance, which is repentance indeed, doth not proceed from a bare hope of pardon, but from ſence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don already apprehended, for as no man can believe his juſtification, until God hath revealed it to him by Jeſus, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man repent truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, untill he firſt underſtand and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God, for Chriſts ſake, hath forgiven him all his treſpaſſes: And this <note place="margin">Act. 11. 18. 2 Cor. 7. 10</note> repentance is called, a repentance unto life, or a repentance flowing from life,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119914:45"/>
or evidencing life; and life (which is Chriſt) is very deſireable unto all them <note place="margin">Act. 16. 30.</note> who have but the leaſt ſence or taſte of it; and it is alſo active whereſoever it is, and puts men upon all enquiries, what muſt we doe that we may have life: thoſe Converts in the Acts, had but a <note place="margin">Acts 2. 23. and 3. 13.</note> little before been very forward in the crucifying of Chriſt, and denied him in the preſence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to let him goe: Yet now when they hear the Apoſtles preach remiſſion of ſinnes in his name, and that there is <note place="margin">Acts 2. 36.</note> no other name given under heaven whereby they muſt be ſaved, but the name Jeſus onely, and that God hath advanced him on high, and given him all power to bring all thoſe to life and ſalvation that deſiſt from their evill wayes, and believe in his name: Now when they <note place="margin">ver. 37.</note> heard this they were pricked in their hearts; now Chriſt, who is life, began to ſtirre or act: a little in their hearts; and now what ſhall we doe men and brethren, that we may have and enjoy more life? To whom the Apoſtle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, repent, not that repentance doth <note place="margin">ver. 38.</note> purchaſe pardon, but if yee doe indeed believe in Jeſus, and if he be come into
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119914:46"/>
your ſoules, then yee can repent indeed, and by your true and ſound repentance yee may be aſſured, that your ſinnes are forgiven, for yee ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which ſhall ſeal the ſame unto you; and it is further ſaid, that <hi>(the ſame day) there were added three</hi>

               <hi>he is faithfull and juſt to forgive,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle ſeemes in this place to deal with two ſorts of men.</p>
            <p>The one ſort are very high in notion and opinion, and think themſelves to be the men that are in Chriſt, and have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father in the Son, and yet notwithſtanding they walk contrary to him in their practice: nay, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that cannot be, for God is light, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> 
               <hi>with him is no darkneſſe at all;</hi> God is a holy and righteous God, and will doe, neither can he doe any thing, but what is moſt pure and juſt: and if any ſay that they have fellowſhip or communion <note place="margin">ver. 6.</note> with him, and yet are not conformable to him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, they lie, and doe not the truth: and if they ſay (as many doe) that they have no ſin, Chriſt hath finiſhed tranſgreſſion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119914:46"/>
and made an end of ſin in them, ſo that let them doe what they will, they cannot ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>they deceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves,</hi> ſaith he, their <note place="margin">ver. 8.</note> deceived heart hath turned them aſide, and <hi>there is no truth in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other ſort are ſuch, as in whom Chriſt is revealed, but yet in a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and theſe are ſtill in feares and doubts, and would gladly know how they may be aſſured, in ſome comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure, of the favour of God, and of the pardon of their ſins.</p>
            <p>To theſe he anſwers; <hi>If yee walk in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the light, as he is in the light,</hi> &amp;c. God is a holy God, a moſt pure Spirit, with whom is no iniquity; and if he by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in your ſoules, hath wrought you to a love of purity and holineſſe, and alſo to a loathing of all ſin and wickedneſſe, then yee may be ſure yee have fellowſhip with him, and the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth you from all ſin.</p>
            <p>But if they further ſay (as many a poor ſoul doth) yea, <hi>but we find that ſin is not dead in us, but lively; and corruptions ſtrong, a Law in the members leading us into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, the good that we would doe we doe not, the evill which we would not doe, that we doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:119914:47"/>
The Apoſtle anſwers, your condition is good, if God by his Spirit in you, hath <note place="margin">ver. 9.</note> brought you to ſee and confeſſe this; yee need not be diſcouraged, for God is a faithful God, he never begins a good work, but he will perfect it; he hath already pardoned your ſinnes, and he will more and more aſſure your hearts thereof, by cleanſing you by degrees from all your corruptions.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If juſtification and remiſſion of ſinnes be free, without any condition, deſert, or deſire on our part, why then doth our Saviour teach us to pray for it, ſaying,</hi> forgive our debts? <hi>And if men be juſtified, and their ſinnes be forgiven before they repent; then what need have men to repent at all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although juſtification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes be free, and undeſerved, yet it is not preſently revealed to the ſoul, ſo ſoon as men believe, but it is brought home to the ſoul a little at once, <note place="margin">Mark 4. 26. 27, 28.</note> by degrees, according as they are enabled to believe, neither doth the Lord diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf in his love to all in a like meaſure, for it pleaſeth him divers times, to ſuffer many of his dear ones to ſit a great while in darkneſſe, and to ſee but <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 7, 8, 9.</note> a very little light, and to have but a ſmall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119914:47"/>
meaſure of the comfortable aſſurance of his love: Theſe he holds in ſuſpence, and therefore they cry, and pray, <hi>forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> not being aſſured of the pard on thereof.</p>
            <p>Yea, others alſo that have attained to a higher degree of aſſurance, and are able to conclude, and that ſafely, that their ſinnes are forgiven, and that Chriſt is their righteouſneſſe unto juſtification; yet ſeeing their own weakneſſes, and knowing that they are ſanctified but in part, and having a law in their members, rebelling againſt the law of the mind; <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 18, 19.</note> they have need, and doe pray for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of Gods love to perfect their ſanctification, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have a further evidence of their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;</hi> that is, Lord work in us ſuch a holy frame of ſpirit, that ſeeing thou haſt freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us (through Chriſt) all our ſinnes; we may alſo freely for thy ſake, forgive our offending brother his trepaſſes; and that our readineſſe and willingneſſe to pardon others, may evidence unto us, that thou haſt forgiven us; ſo that we are not taught to pray for pardon of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119914:48"/>
ſin, as though the Lord would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us untill we pray for it, but rather that God would manifeſt himſelf ſo to us in acts of ſanctification, as may teſtifie unto us our juſtification. And although repentance is not neceſſary as a meanes of remiſſion, and ſo of life: yet it is a neceſſary conſequence or effect of life: as the fruit is not a meanes, or a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life to the tree, but an effect or evidence of life in the tree; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that Chriſt ſhould be in the ſoul, and not act like himſelf, according to that degree and meaſure, in which he manifeſts himſelf therein.</p>
            <p>Now repentance is not onely a ſorrow <note place="margin">1 King. 21. 27.</note> for ſin, for that may be in wicked men; neither is it a bare confeſſion joyned with the former, for both theſe may be done for ſelf-ends: But when a man doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed apprehend the love of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, freely juſtifying and pardoning all ſin and tranſgreſſion whatſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any deſert, or deſire; and not onely ſo, but alſo ſanctifying, and ſaving him from all ſin for the future: then his ſoul is melted and diſſolved into godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 4, 5</note> mourning, and grieving (not for fear of death and hell, but) becauſe he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119914:48"/>
hath walked ſo contrary to God, who hath ſo farre condiſcended in love to him; and hereupon falls to confeſſe all ſin, and to rip up his heart, and to ſearch out his moſt ſecret ſinnes, as well as thoſe that be more outward: and deſires to appear before God the moſt vile and abominable ſinner in the world in his own eyes, deſerving nothing but wrath and condemnation, and admires at the infinite love and goodneſſe of God in Jeſus Chriſt, thus pardoning and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him: and prayes earneſtly unto God, that he will make further diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 12.</note> of his love unto him in Jeſus, that he may be more vile in his own eyes, and that he may now hate and abhorre all ſin, which is ſo contrary to the holineſſe of God: that Chriſt may live more in <note place="margin">Eph 3. 17.</note> him, and that he may henceforth be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled through him, to walk in all well pleaſing. And thus the Saints, though they be already juſtified and pardoned, yet cannot but repent; for if Chriſt, <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> who is the root, be within, repentance, which is a fruit thereof, will appear in the branches: and thus the Saints can mourn after Chriſt, and <hi>bleſſed are they</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that ſo mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:119914:49"/>
Q. <hi>Seeing that the Saints or Believers are ſanctified but in part, and have fleſh as well as ſpirit, and are compaſſed about, not onely with many infirmities, but alſo with many enemies, which are ſtrong and potent: Whereby are they then quickened?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The chief help or meanes, whereby the Saints are quickened up to holineſſe, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> is Chriſt himſelf, dwelling in them, and acting them by his ſpirit, or power, to all well pleaſing: but there are other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate meanes, which he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſanctified to that end; as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13. Eph. 6. 18.</note> his Word in the reading and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as alſo godly conference with one another, and prayer.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How can the Scriptures, being but the writings of men, be of any force to help us grow in grace? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although the Scriptures were written by men, yet they were not the device of mens braines or wits, but they <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> were the words of God, inſpired into men by the holy Spirit, neither did men write them at their own pleaſure, but how and when the Lord, who is that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, pleaſed: and they are profitable to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119914:49"/>
teach, inſtruct, to reprove, and correct; <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> yea, there is in the Scriptures whatſoever is neceſſary to be known to ſalvation, they being a revelation of the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and perfect will of God in every diſpenſation; and they are alſo mighty through Chriſt, for indeed to the Saints Chriſt is the Word, and the Word is Chriſt; and when he is pleaſed to come <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> forth in it, read, or preached, then it caſts down ſtrong holds; then it divides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder between ſoul and ſpirit, between men and their beloved luſts; then it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues every high thought, and brings eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing into ſubjection that exalts it ſelf againſt Chriſt; and then when he is pleaſed to come forth thus in it by his Spirit, then it transformes the ſoul into the ſame nature, or Image of it ſelf, which is Chriſt: And here is the power of <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> binding and looſing, or the power of the keyes. There is in the word a double power or efficacy, when it comes in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is both for ſoftening and for har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening of mens hearts, and it alwayes doth the work to which it is ſent, it is called, <hi>a ſharp two-edged Sword, the Sword</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:119914:50"/>
Now no mans word can work any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon mens hearts, they may bleſſe, or they may curſe; and all to no purpoſe: they may bind and looſe at their own pleaſure, but there is nothing done in the ſoul, but where this word comes indeed in the name, that is, in the power and authority of Chriſt, there it doth the work effectually, and there is no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it either makes men fruitful and meet for ſalvation, or elſe hardens them, and binds them over to damnation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Yea indeed, Chriſt is the Word, and he came from the boſome of the Father, and he onely doth reveal the Fathers will: But doth he not doe it by viſions, and revelations of the Spirit, rather than by a written word, which is ſo full of contradictions; or ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt hath alwayes manifeſted himſelf, or the Fathers will, by viſions and revelations, but yet in a different way in every diſpenſation: when the Goſpel was firſt preached, he was pleaſed to reveal himſelf unto the Apoſtles, for the moſt part, without any written word; (they having but a few dark prophecies and types which made mention of him) and therefore they were enabled extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily <note place="margin">Acts 2. 6, 11.</note>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:119914:50"/>
to declare, both in word and writing, the whole will and counſell of God; and the word ſo ſpoken and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, being a revelation of Chriſt through <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 1</note> the Spirit, was written and ſpoken for our inſtruction: Chriſt now reveales himſelf to us alſo by the ſame Spirit, and to the ſame ends and purpoſes, but not in the ſame manner, nor in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Chriſt by revelation enabled them <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 2, 3.</note> to ſpeak and write a myſtery; and by revelation he enables us to know and <note place="margin">Acts 10. 44, 45.</note> underſtand that myſtery, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and written by them: They were inſpired by the Spirit immediately to <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 1.</note> write and ſpeak the mind of God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: To us it is given, to underſtand and believe the will of God, in the myſtery <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13. 1 Cor. 2. 12 10.</note> of Chriſt, by attending upon reading, exhortation, and doctrine, even by the ſame Spirit. The Apoſtles were ſent to preach the Goſpel, and faith comes by <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> hearing, and hearing by the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle, a teacher of the Gentiles; and unto him was this <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 8.</note> grace given, that he ſhould preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt, &amp;c. The Goſpel muſt be preached; but every preaching is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119914:51"/>
not the preaching of the Goſpel; for ſome men preach neither Law nor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but their own fancies: others preach juſtification by the duties of the Law, <note place="margin">1 Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 7</note> knowing neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm: and others jumble Law and Goſpel together, ſaying, that men muſt believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and <note place="margin">Acts 15. 1.</note> yet they muſt walk in a ſtrict performance of the duties of the Law, or elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved: But the Goſpel, where it is purely preached, is not with wiſdome of words, to exerciſe or ſet forth mens <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4, 5.</note> humane arts, and acquired abilities, but in the evidence and power of the Spirit, to perſwade men to believe: the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel is not to chide or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile men for not believing, but to beſeech <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> men to be reconciled to God. The preaching of the Goſpel is not to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wrath and vengeance againſt ſin and <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> ſinners, but to offer termes of peace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and ſalvation, through Chriſt Jeſus, to the worſt of ſinners.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Lord hath in much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodneſſe manifeſted his will in a written word, for he very well knew what was in man: many Prophets of old did run before they were ſent; but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119914:51"/>
becauſe they ſpake not according to the <note place="margin">Iſai. 8. 20.</note> Law and the Teſtimony (their written word) their was no light in them.

            <p>Q. <hi>What is Prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Prayer is much ſpoken of, and much uſed among men, but it is not very well underſtood, for many people can, and doe utter words and ſentences, which the Saints in Scripture have uſed in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119914:52"/>
prayer, and yet they doe not pray: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not every lifting up of the voice to God, nor every lifting up of the heart to God, for the moſt wicked man may <note place="margin">Numb. 23 10.</note> pray, and that earneſtly, and that for life and ſalvation, and yet not pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; yea, a believer, and one that is in Chriſt, may be very fervent in prayer, and yet not being rightly catechized and <note place="margin">Pſal. 80. 4.</note> inſtructed in the nature of true prayer, may not be accepted, but offend in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Prayer is not a work of wit, or memory, or of any other common gift of the Spirit; but true and right prayer, as it goes up to God through Chriſt, ſo it comes down firſt from God by Chriſt, and is indeed the interceſſion of Chriſt <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> in the ſoul: for no man knowes how, or what to pray for as he ought; yea, the Saints themſelves are compaſſed with many infirmities, and many of them lie under many outward croſſes, &amp;c. by <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> reaſon whereof, they may, and doe now and then uſe prayer in a carnal manner: now it is the Spirit which removeth or helpeth againſt theſe infirmities; when the Spirit prevailes (as it doth for the moſt part) in the Saints, then it aſſures them of the love of God, and overcomes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119914:53"/>
all feares and doubts, and carries them up to God with free acceſſe, making them to know, that God is not delighted with eloquent words and ſpeeches, or ſentences finely framed, and artificially drawn into a method: But that he is well pleaſed with Chriſt, and delights in nothing but Chriſt, and if he be in the ſoul, though at preſent they cannot utter many words, or outward expreſſions; nay, if they can but groan in ſpirit, he knowes the meaning thereof, for he <note place="margin">ver. 27.</note> knowes the heart, and underſtands the mind of the ſpirit: If prayer proceed from a mans own ſpirit, then it is alwayes for ſelf ends; but if it be the interceſſion of Chriſt in the ſoul, then it is alwayes agreeable to the will of God; for he (even Chriſt) maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If prayer be the interceſſion of Chriſt in the ſoul, then how is it ſaid, that he is at the right hand of God, and maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, and is gone into heaven, there to appear in the preſence of God for us? And why then are we commanded to pray to the Father in the name of Chriſt:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt is indeed at the right hand

            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:119914:54"/>
And for that we are to pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of Chriſt, it is not meant, that we muſt often uſe or repeat the name of Chriſt, or in word beg, or crave any thing at the hand of God for Chriſts ſake, for ſo a wicked carnal wretch may doe: but to pray to the Father in the <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> name of Chriſt is, to pour forth the ſoul unto the Father, in the power and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Son, for God looks not at any thing in all this world but Chriſt: men may be high in gifts, and notions, and may make admirable prayers for words and ſentences, and alſo for method and form, but if Chriſt be not there, and <note place="margin">Prov. 28. 9.</note> if the prayer goe not forth in the Spirit and power of Jeſus Chriſt, then the Lord regards it not, but loaths it, and caſts it away, as abominable.</p>
            <p>To pray then in the name of Chriſt is, when the ſoul goeth forth into the armes of Gods love, by the Spirit and power of the Lord Jeſus, who is the Son of his love.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Seeing that men of themſelves cannot pray aright, and that the Lord, to whom we are to pray, knowes our wants before we pray: What need have we then to pray.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 32.</note>

               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:119914:54"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> As men cannot pray of themſelves, ſo neither can they live of themſelves, for the life which the Saints now live in the fleſh, is not by any power of their own, but by the power of Chriſt living <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 20.</note> in them; ſo that there is not onely a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of life in them in whom Chriſt lives, who is the life, but an impoſſibility of not living. In like manner, though men cannot pray acceptably by their own power or worth, yet if Chriſt, who is the mediator, and interceſſor, live in them, there is not onely a neceſſity of praying, but it is altogether impoſſible <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10. Rom. 8. 15.</note> that they ſhould not pray, Chriſt being in their hearts the Spirit of ſupplication, and of adoption, cauſing them to cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> Yea, in him they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 12.</note> with boldneſſe unto the throne of grace: And though the Lord doe know our wants, yet he hath commanded us to <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37</note> pray, <hi>ask and yee ſhall have,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>full:</hi> Now although the Lord command us to pray, he doth not intend that we ſhould make Idols of our prayers, and

            <p>Q. <hi>But is not the Lord ſaid to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God, with whom is not the leaſt ſhaddow of turning; and if he have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Although the Lord be altogether unchangeable, and unalterable in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and determinations, yet he would <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 6.</note> have his children make known to him their needs by their requeſts: neither is there the leaſt ſhadow of change in him, when he beſtowes mercies and bleſſings upon them, in anſwer to their prayers:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119914:55"/>
for whatſoever good thing he purpoſeth to his children, yet before he beſtow it <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 1.</note> upon them, he uſually ſtirreth up their hearts to pray for the ſame: Now the Lord whatever he gives to the Saints, he gives it them in Chriſt; and what the Saints pray for, they requeſt and beg the <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 26.</note> ſame in the Spirit and interceſſion of Chriſt, for he is the way, by which the Lord comes down to us in all good; and <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 6.</note> he is the way alſo, by which we goe up to God in prayer and thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>Now as it is impoſſible, that God ſhould alter his determinations, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of mercies, ſo alſo is it, that the <note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 6.</note> Saints ſhould not pray for bleſſings and favours, being quickened up thereto by the Spirit of Chriſt living in them: ſo <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> then, God is not changed, but the change is in the Saints, for many times when God entends a bleſſing, his children are not fit to receive the ſame; then he by that Spirit of adoption, quickens them <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 17.</note> up to pray, and yet delaies them; that by the continual uſe of this heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and by the ſpirit of judgement, and burning, their corruptions may be <note place="margin">Iſai. 4. 4.</note> conſumed and deſtroyed, and their hearts brought into a more holy and humble
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119914:56"/>
frame, and they at length, by this meanes, made fit to receive the mercy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If men cannot pray unill they be moved, or quickened thereunto by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: how then ſhall it be known when the Spirit moves? or which, or when, is the moſt convenient, and fitteſt time for prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That no man is able of himſelf, without the help of the Spirit, to make any prayer acceptable to God, hath been already ſhewed; prayer being a work of that Spirit of adoption, called the Spirit <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> of the Son, and is nothing elſe, but an effect of that power in the Son, given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the Father: men may uſe words or formes of prayer, but none can pray indeed, but they who have received this ſpirit of adoption, and are thereby <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 23.</note> become the Sonnes of God; and they, who are thus become Sonnes, have not the Spirit by fits and ſtarts, but the Spirit, or the Lord Jeſus, who is that Spirit, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> dwells in their hearts, and is continually exciting, and ſtirring up their hearts to prayer, and every good thing: But it is not alwayes apprehended alike; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, by reaſon of temptation, want of watchfulneſſe, and other infirmities of the fleſh, it is clouded, and acts not ſo
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119914:56"/>
clearly as at other times; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it will in due time break through <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> all difficulties, and remove all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and acts like it ſelf, and miniſters matter of prayer upon all occaſions: ſo then, whenſoever the Lord preſents oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion or opportunity of prayer, then he by the ſame calls for prayer, and then is the Spirit ready to quicken and help, if it be not quenched with carnall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 19.</note> of the fleſh, as worldly cares, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrowes, worldly joyes, &amp;c. Now if there be any time, wherein the Lord doth not miniſter occaſion of prayer and praiſe, then that is no time for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thanksgiving; but there is no time in the whole life of a Chriſtian, in which the Lord doth not miniſter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 17, 18.</note> of prayer and praiſe, therefore the Saints ought to pray continually, and in every thing to give thanks: Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as the Saints ought upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to lift up their hearts to God, ſo alſo they are to take the fitteſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; for prayer is not a light buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but of great weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is called, <hi>a pouring forth of the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 15</note>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119914:57"/>
for this ſerious buſineſſe is, when we can ſet about it with leaſt diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when we can beſt ſequeſter our ſelves from all other occaſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and attend upon that work with freedome of Spirit. And as we muſt <note place="margin">1 Pet. 47.</note> take the fitteſt time, ſo alſo we muſt watch unto it, that is, ſo order our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affaires, that there may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time; and ſo watch over our own hearts in the ſtrength of Chriſt, that <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18.</note> they may be alwayes well diſpoſed to <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 1.</note> prayer, and not to flag or faint, though we meet with many delayes, and other diſcouragements, but to continue inſtant <note place="margin">Col. 4. 2.</note> in the ſame, watching when God will give in occaſion of thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not God give us other helpes alſo, to build us up in grace and holineſſe? What ſay you of the Sacraments? Is not Baptiſme of great uſe in theſe dayes of the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The word Sacrament is no where to be found in all the Scripture, and for Baptiſme, the Scripture mentions divers Baptiſmes, as the baptiſme of water, the <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 2. Mark 1. 8.</note> baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt, and of fire, and the baptiſmes of ſufferings, all which <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 50.</note> were beautiful in their ſeaſons, and ſome
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119914:57"/>
of them are ſtill of great concernment to the Saints.</p>
            <p>The baptiſme of water was the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>John,</hi> who was ſent of God, to <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> prepare the way of Chriſt: Iſrael had <note place="margin">Deut. 1. 6.</note> dwelt long enough in that Mount of out-ſide obſervations; for although they had their legall waſhings and cleanſings, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> which were, and might be called bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, yet all theſe could not waſh away <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> one ſin from the conſcience, but ſerved onely to cleanſe them from legall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, though they were not without their ſignifications. But now the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and his miniſtry, was migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 17.</note> for he came in the ſpirit, and power of <hi>Elias,</hi> and was a ſign of a great change of adminiſtrations, for he called them to repentance, even to repent of <note place="margin">Mat. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> all that out-ſide, and formal religion, which they had ſo hotly purſued; for they were generally grown ſo corrupt, and ſo blockiſh, and blind withall, that they imagined, that by the bare out-ſide <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 9.</note> performance of thoſe legal clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they were ſufficiently ſanctified, though they continued in the practiſe of moſt groſſe and notorious ſinnes: But <hi>John</hi> tells them plain, that although
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119914:58"/>
God had long endured, and born with their hipocriſies and formalities, yet now he would bear no longer, for he had <hi>now laid the axe to the root of the trees,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and if any tree were barren, or did not bring forth good fruit, it was to be hewen down, and caſt into the fire;</hi> hereby giving them to underſtand, that unleſſe they did deſiſt from all their wicked and ungodly wayes and courſes, and amend their evill lives, <note place="margin">Luke 3. 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> there was no remiſſion of ſinnes to be expected, nor true ſanctification to be attained, notwithſtanding all their legal and ſtrict performances; and hereupon calls them to his baptiſme, declaring plainly unto them, that though many of them thought he was the Chriſt, yet they <note place="margin">Luke 3. 15, 16.</note> were deceived, for he was but ſent to prepare his way; and that his baptiſme was but with water, which could onely waſh away the filth of the body; but could goe no further; but yet by the ſame they were to be inſtructed, that there is one among them already in the fleſh, even Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall baptize them with the holy Ghoſt, and with fire;</hi> that is, waſh and cleanſe their ſoules, from all the filth and guilt of ſin that was upon them: And thus <hi>John's</hi> miniſtry was to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119914:58"/>
prepare the way, or to manifeſt Chriſt already come; and his baptiſme did <note place="margin">John 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note> hold forth the baptiſme of Chriſt in the Spirit, which was to follow in its ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>If</hi> Johns <hi>miniſtry and baptiſme ſerved onely to prepare the way of Chriſt, or to manifeſt Chriſt in the fleſh; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, or type out unto them the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſt; why then was it needfull, that Chriſt himſelf ſhould be baptized of</hi> John?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſt indeed was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> but not out of any need to ſhew forth ſorrow for ſin, he being altogether without ſin; nor yet was he baptized out of any neceſſity to be inſtructed in the myſtery of the Spirits baptiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Chriſt ſubmitted to <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme for our ſakes onely, the head that had <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> no ſin, for the body that was full of ſin.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme was part of the Law, and it was the laſt and moſt lively Ceremony of it, and Chriſt ſubmitted unto the ſame, that he might fulfill all righteouſneſſe for us.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſme was of the Law, and not of the Goſpel, is evident from his preaching; for <hi>John</hi> preached

               <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 2. Matth. 10. 7</note> Chriſts Diſciples preached ſaying, <hi>The Kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> Both <hi>John</hi> and Chriſts Diſciples by their Baptiſm, which was in cold water, could but waſh mens bodies, and call upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to expect remiſſion of ſins one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus, who was to waſh away the filth of their ſouls, even with a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual water, or Baptiſm of his Spirit.

            <p>And for Chriſts Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, to Baptize all Nations, that is not to be underſtood of Water-Baptiſm, as appeareth by his own words, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. when being riſen from the Dead, and now ready to aſcend into his Glory; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints them with the work whereto he is <note place="margin">Acts 1. 4.</note> now ſending them; commands them not

            <p>And in another place, all that were ordained to eternall life, believed.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But if it was not the command of Chriſt, that they ſhould baptize with Water, why then did they they uſe it after his aſcenſion, and if Water-Baptiſme was to ceaſe and have an end at that time, why then do not the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures declare the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As for the Apoſtles baptizing with Water after Chriſts aſcenſion, it was not from any command of Chriſt, as one of them doth teſtifie.</p>
            <p>The Baptiſme of Water or <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:119914:61"/>
was very famous, and of great note in that time, and therefore could not at preſent be very eaſily laid down, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very many other Legall obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And again, it is not to be queſtioned, but that the Apoſtles themſelves were ignorant of many things, after they had received the Spirit abundantly; for <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 10. 28, 29, 34.</note> was ignorant, that he might eat with the Gentiles, or that God had a purpoſe, by Jeſus to bring in the Gentiles. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt goe to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be reſolved <note place="margin">Act. 15. 2.</note> about Circumciſion, and there were thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Jewes which did believe, and yet <note place="margin">Act. 21. 20.</note> they were all zealous of legall rites. God did not reveal himſelf all at once, but by degrees.</p>
            <p>Again, the Apoſtles uſed water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme as they uſed Circumciſion, to avoid contention among the Saints: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Act. 16. 1.</note> they uſed it ſometimes when it was <note place="margin">Act. 8. 36.</note> deſired; and to ſtoop to the weakneſſe of many young believers, they became all things to all men, that they might not <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 20, 21, 22. and 10. 33.</note> offend any, but ſave all if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And for the Scriptures to declare againſt water-baptiſme to be uſed in the dayes of the Goſpel, there be many
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119914:61"/>
Scriptures that ſpeak much to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of the Gentiles utterly diſclaimes it, <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſent me not to baptize, but to preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme,</hi> now water-baptiſme is not the ſame with the Baptiſme of the <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 16.</note> Spirit, for they are two diſtinct things, one is <hi>Johns,</hi> and the other is Chriſts, and if they were both one, then they that have the one, muſt alſo have the other: and they that cannot have the one (of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) neither can they have the other. Again, it is not water-baptiſme that can <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23. Rev. 3. 12. John 3. 6.</note> make us one with Chriſt, or give us a new name, or make us partake of the divine nature, &amp;c. and therefore water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not that one Baptiſme, nor left us in command in the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>Q<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The baptiſme of water hath been uſed in all the Churches of Chriſt, from the very time of the Apoſtles, and that with warant from Scripture; for Infants were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed under the Law, and Circumciſion was a ſeal of the Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Covenant is the ſame now as it was then, and Baptiſme is come in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119914:62"/>
the room of Circumciſion, and is a ſeal of the Goſpel-Covenant, and therefore Infants may be baptized; and the Apoſtle tells the</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, <hi>that their fathers were all baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea. And Saint</hi> Peter <hi>ſaith, that Baptiſme doth now ſave us, how can it then be denied, that Baptiſme, even of water, doth not ſtand us in great ſtead, even in the dayes of the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Whatſoever was practiſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians, is already declared: how they to prevent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrife, did condeſcend to the weakneſſe of many; knowing, that in time, the Baptiſme of the Spirit, which is a Baptiſme of Fire, would eat up the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Water, as the fire that came down upon <hi>Elijahs</hi> Sacrifice, did lick up <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 38.</note> all the water that was in the Trench. But whatſoever hath been done in Water-Baptiſme ſince that time, it is hard to ſay, is, or was done with warrant from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but is to be feared was rather a part of that miſtery of iniquity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7.</note> to work even in the Apoſtles time.</p>
            <p>And that Baptiſme is come in the room of Circumciſion, was never yet made good by Scripture, nor never will.</p>
            <p>It is true, God made a Covenant with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119914:62"/>
               <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave him alſo Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10, 11,</note> as a ſign or ſeal thereof: But the Covenant which God made was twofold. Inward, and Outward.</p>
            <p>The Inward part reſpected his ſoul, in the ſweet enjoyment of Gods love and favour by Chriſt Jeſus, both in this life and in eternall glory.</p>
            <p>The Outward part of it, reſpected the outward man, the enjoyment of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with long life and proſperity therein.</p>
            <p>Now ſo farre as the Covenant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and reſpected his ſoul, ſo farre Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion could not be a ſeal thereof: for nothing could ſeal the true ſpirituall <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13. and 4. 30.</note> love and favour of God to his ſoul, but the Spirit, whereby all believers were, and ſtill are, ſealed to the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
            <p>But as the Covenant was more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that he ſhould be the Father of many nations, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould his ſeed be called, and that he would give the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to his ſeed, for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion; ſo farre Circumciſion was a ſeal of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>But now in the daies of the Goſpel, the new Covenant, is a ſingle Covenant, <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:119914:63"/>

                  </gap>eb. 8. 9.</note> promiſes, than earthly <hi>Canaan:</hi> For the Covenant which God makes with his people now, is altogether inward, and Spirituall, which is Chriſt; and there is no ſeal of this Covenant, but that Spirit, or the Lord Jeſus, called <hi>the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And to make Water-Baptiſme, or a Carnall thing, to be a ſeal of a Spiritual Covenant, which is Chriſt in the ſoul, ſealing up the love of God to the ſame to all eternity; argues much ignorance in the miſtery of God, and carnall minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the things of God, in a great meaſure.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> their Fathers were baptized in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> the Cloud and in the Sea. That is no warrant for Baptiſme at all.</p>
            <p>But he ſpeaks it rather to take them off from depending upon outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For thus he ſeems to ſpeak. Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were high in outward Ordinances, but they were not very high in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for they were overthrown in the wilderneſſe, and theſe things were written for your example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:119914:63"/>
And for that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20. 21.</note> where he is ſpeaking of the Floud, and that in the Arke but a few, even eight ſouls were ſaved by water; and that by a figure Baptiſme doth not ſave us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt underſtand, that the Ark ſaved thoſe eight ſoules from the water. And then that the figure here ſpoken of, is not between the floud, and water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. But between the Ark which ſaved them from thoſe great waves, and Chriſt who ſaves us from the ſea, even the red ſea of Gods fierce wrath; as they that did believe, and obeyed, and prepared an <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> Ark, were put into it by God, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from death; So all that do believe <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> are ſhut up in Chriſt, and made one with him, and ſo ſaved from wrath.</p>
            <p>For ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, Baptiſme doth now ſave us, but not the waſhing away of the filth of the fleſh with water, but the anſwer of a good conſcience to God by the reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead,</p>
            <p>If Chriſt be not riſen in the ſoul, and if he raiſe not the ſoul from death, that man is not baptized indeed, though he be waſhed in water a thouſand times.</p>
            <p>And as for Infants that they ſhould be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119914:64"/>
baptized, there is not the leaſt intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the Scriptures that they, whiles they are ſuch, ever were, or ever ſhould be baptized.</p>
            <p>If Water-Baptiſme were any thing, or had any thing in it, yet infants are in no capacity at all to apprehend it, no not ſo much as in ſignification: yet they which make a prop of it to hold up their totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdome, can ſee good reaſon for it, and draw goodly conſequences from Scripture to help forward the practiſe of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Though there be nothing in it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is not, it being an outward ſigne; may we not uſe it therefore in obedience to Chriſts command, as a ſign of our ingrafting into him, and as an ordinance that gives us admiſſion into Curch-fellowſhip with the Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The commands of Chriſt are not empty and barren commands, but full of power and efficacy.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt coms forth in a command, then there is a work wrought indeed.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt ſay to a dead man live, then <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 14.</note> is he quickned indeed.</p>
            <p>If he command a man to believe, then there is faith and confidence wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:119914:64"/>
If he command the Saints to love one another, then it is effected indeed.</p>
            <p>Chriſts commands where they come, and he himſelf come along in them: (or <note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 11. Heb. 4. 12.</note> elſe they are not his commands) they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return in vaine, but do certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their work, not in imagination; but in reality and truth.</p>
            <p>Now if Chriſt had commanded to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize a man, or an infant, in water, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome notable work would have been wrought thereby.</p>
            <p>But we ſee in experience, that to dip, or to ſprinckle, in, or with a little cold water produceth no effect in the inward man. Therefore to Baptize with water, as a command of Chriſt, is to offer inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Chriſt, and to make the commands <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> of Chriſt (which are full of power and life) to be empty and fruitleſs commands, which is not ſafe to imagine.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Chriſts Kingdome is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Kingdome, and is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And as it is not attained, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it enjoyed with any outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p>Indeed under the Law, they had their outward Ordinances, and Services, and all of them had their ſignifications, ſhewing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119914:65"/>
forth ſomething of Chriſt, of his death, and reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Kingdome was more Carnal <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 10.</note> than Spiritual; and they were led on in it by outward and carnal obſervations. But now Chriſt having finiſhed all his work in the fleſh, and being come again in the <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 21.</note> ſpirit, he exerciſeth all his Kingly power in the ſoul; and this Kingdome of Chriſt <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> is the Kingdome of Heaven, and there is no ſignification in it at all, but all is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For it is the glory of God begun in the ſoul, (not in imagination, but in <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> deed and in truth) which is to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by degrees in this life, though not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly untill the life to come. Neither is there any outward ordinance, or obſervation, that can hold proportion or correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with this Spiritual Kingdome, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted above all the Hills, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <note place="margin">Iſa. 2. 2.</note> above all ſignifications.</p>
            <p>Now Water-Baptiſme can no way ſhew forth our union with Chriſt, for <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> that is a Spiritual union, and Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a Carnall ordinance, and holds no proportion with the former.</p>
            <p>Againe we are not made one with Chriſt, as we are one fleſh with him, but as we are one Spirit with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119914:65"/>
Chriſt by taking our fleſh, became <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> or God one with us in the fleſh, but now the Lord, who is that Spirit, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 17.</note> takes us into the ſame Spirit, and ſo we are made one Spirit with him.</p>
            <p>To this very end the glorious God did abaſe himſelf, and clothed himſelf with our fleſh, and took it into union with himſelf: that ſo by this meanes, he might alſo receive all them that do truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, into union with himſelf by the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p>So that it is not the Baptiſme of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that can ingraft us into Chriſt, or make us one with him: But by the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 7.</note> of the eternall Spirit, are all the Saints united to him, and partake of the <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> ſame Divine nature with him.</p>
            <p>And further, Water-Baptiſme can give us no true fellowſhip with the Saints, for where the Saints have true fellowſhip one with another, they have this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 7.</note> together in Chriſt. So that this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip conſiſts not in being of the ſame opinion, or forme one with another. But in partaking of the ſame Spirit, are united into one body together in Chriſt. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all Baptized into one</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Body, whether we be Jewes or Gentils.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:119914:66"/>
So that it is not water-baptiſme that can give any true fellowſhip with the Saints, but onely a carnall admiſſion into an outward fellowſhip with men of the ſame form, which may hold for a time, <note place="margin">Act. 5. 1, 2.</note> and afterward come to nothing. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> may have for a time an outward fellowſhip with the Apoſtles? and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> with <hi>Phillip,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Act. 8. 18. &amp;c.</note> reſt of the Saints in <hi>Samaria.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> That our Saviour Chriſt did give Bread and Wine unto his Diſciples, in remembrance of his death, which he was now ſuddenly to accompliſh, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: but that he left it with them, as an ordinance to be performed by all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the dayes of the Goſpel, is to be enquired into: Our bleſſed Lord, a little before his ſuffering, told his Diſciples, that he had a great deſire to eat one <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 15</note> Paſſeover more with them before his death; and being come into the houſe, as they were eating together, he tells them plain, that one of them ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him into the hands of the chief Prieſts and Elders, &amp;c. and that he was

to undergoe great ſufferings, yea, and <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 21, 22, 23.</note> death alſo; and that all this was no more than what was written of him, though they were ignorant of it: and that they muſt now enjoy his company but a very little while: for as he came forth from the Father into the world, <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 28.</note> ſo he muſt now leave the world, and goe to the Father, upon this heavy, and ſad, and indeed unexpected newes, his poor weak Diſciples (who looked for better things from their Maſter, at leaſt in their own conceits) were ſo preſently filled with ſorrow, that they knew not what to <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 6.</note> ſay, much leſſe what to doe; whereupon our Saviour, ſeeing them take the matter ſo to heart, and knowing that his death <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 22</note> was of ſo great advantage unto them, takes occaſion to inſtruct them in the knowledge and ends of the ſame; that as his departure from them was cauſe of great grief and ſorrow unto them, ſo the remembrance of the great benefits which ſhould redound unto them thereby, might a little ſtay and comfort their hearts, untill he did appear to them more fully.</p>
            <p>To this end he took bread, and brake <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28.</note> it, ſaying, <hi>This is my body which is given
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119914:67"/>
for you;</hi> as if he had ſaid, as I break this bread, and give it unto you, ſo my body is given, and muſt be broken for you, even for your ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And taking the cup, he ſaith, <hi>drink yee all of it, for it is the New Teſtament in my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>bloud,</hi> or a ſignification of the bloud of the New Covenant, which is my bloud, <hi>that muſt be ſhed for you,</hi> and many others alſo, or elſe yee cannot have remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
            <p>And for a help to their weak faith, and comfort in their ſad condition, he ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo unto them, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> as if he had ſaid, I know, that for the preſent you are almoſt overwhelmed with grief and ſorrow, becauſe I ſay ſuch things to you; yet let this be a little comfort to you, make uſe of Bread and Wine, in-remembrance that my death is of great advantage to you: and though I goe away in the fleſh, yet it <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 22.</note> ſhall not be long ere I ſee you again in the Spirit, for I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, but will come to you in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, which is the Spirit of truth, and then your hearts ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man be able to take from you: ſo that from hence it may appear,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119914:67"/>
that this action of Chriſt, and likewiſe his command, was rather to comfort and ſtay the hearts of his poor, ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, fainting (then) Diſciples, than to be a ſtanding Ordinance for all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers afterwards.</p>
            <p>Q <hi>But it is not ſaid in many places in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that this Ordinance was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 2. 46.</note> 
               <hi>in uſe even among the Apoſtles themſelves, and many other Saints, after the Aſcenſion of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts. 20. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt, and ſending down of the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Apoſtles indeed are ſaid to break bread, and that from houſe to houſe, but every breaking of bread there ſpoken of, cannot be ſaid to be the Lords Supper; for it is ſaid, <hi>that they did eat their meat with gladneſſe, and ſingleneſſe of heart:</hi> whereby it may appear, that by breaking of bread, in that place, is rather meant, the Saints mutuall love, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and entertaining one another into their houſes, with feaſting and rejoycing, than eating the Lords Supper: for it is ſaid, <hi>that the multitude of them that believed were of one heart, and of one ſoul; neither</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 32, 33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>ſaid any man, that the things which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed were his own, but they had all things common:</hi> The preaching of the Apoſtles was of ſuch power and efficacy, that it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119914:68"/>
wrought great effects, there was none that lacked, they that were poor were provided for, out of the goods of them that were rich.</p>
            <p>But if by breaking of bread in this, or other places, be meant the eating the Lords Supper, yet it was uſed as a thing indifferent, and of chriſtian liberty; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a binding Ordinance, for the Apoſtles were willing to uſe all means, and content to ſtoop to weak Faith, and mean capacities, ſo that they could winne any to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But the Apoſtle</hi> Paul <hi>writing to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>tels them, that he had received of the Lord that which he delivered unto them.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>For having blamed them for their abuſe of that Ordinance, comes at length to certifie them in the true and right uſe thereof, ſaying that the end of it was to ſhew forth the Lords death till he come. And further ſhewes the danger of unworthy receiving, and Gods hand already upon them for the ſame. Doth it not hereby appear very plaine, that the Lords Supper is uſed from Chriſts own command, and is dangerous either to omit, or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame unworthily?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True indeed the Apoſtle writes theſe very words to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119914:68"/>
withall he ſhewes the reaſon why he deals thus tenderly with thnm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. becauſe he could not ſpeak unto them as Spirituall, he could not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, how they ſhould enjoy Chriſt, and be made one with him in the Spirit: for they were yet babes, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing of Chriſt, but what was held forth unto them in viſible demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or outward and carnall ordinances. <hi>I have fed you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with milk, and not with meat; for ye are not yet able to beare it, for ye are in a great meaſure Carnal, and walk (not in the Spirit but) according to man, or as men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Apoſtle ſhews that there be degrees of attainments among the Saints: There be Children, and there be Men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. There be Saints that be in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 12. 13.</note> a great meaſure Carnal, and there are Saints that be Spiritual.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his 1 <hi>Epiſt. 2. Cap. 12. 13, 14. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſes</hi> ſpeaks of three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of attainments. Little Children, Fathers, and young Men.</p>
            <p>Little Children, are ſuch as are weak in Faith, and under many feares, and <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 12. 13. 14.</note> doubts.</p>
            <p>Fathers are ſuch as have attained to a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119914:69"/>
higher degree of the knowledge of God in the myſtery of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Young Men, are they that know their Union with the Father in the Sonne, and who alſo live in this Union, and are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth in the ſtrength of the ſame, to overcome Sinne, and Satan, and the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Children, and therefore the Apoſtle feeds them with Milk, Chriſt is very tender of his Lambs, he will carry them in his boſome, if they cannot goe, he willead them by <note place="margin">Iſa. 40. 11. and 42. 1.</note> the hand; if they cannot digeſt ſtrong meat, he hath Milk for them, he will not ſuffer one of them to periſh, or to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry. But Children are not alwayes Children, they grow in time to be Men, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 11.</note> and then they put away childiſh things: For while they are Children and uſe Milk, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 13.</note> they are unskilfull in the word of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe or miſtery of Chriſt. But when they come to a full age, then they are <note place="margin">14.</note> able to uſe ſtrong meat, or underſtand myſteries; their ſences being exerciſed to diſcern both good and evill.</p>
            <p>Now to theſe Children, the Apoſtle commends Chriſts practice to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their weak and ſad eſtate, ſaying,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119914:69"/>
that there by they might be put in mind of Chriſts death till he come.</p>
            <p>Intimating thereby, that though they were yet babes, and carnal, and ſo not able to apprehend their union with Chriſt in the Spirit: yet the time would come, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 7. Joh. 14. 18.</note> that Chriſt ſhould appear in their hearts in a more glorious manner; and then they ſhould ſee him, and know him in the Spirit, with farre more comfort, delight, and ſatisfaction; than in or by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or fleſhly Ordinances whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>And that this comming of Chriſt is ſo <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 29.</note> to be underſtood, is plain from his own words, when he telleth his Diſciples, <hi>That he will not drink any more of the fruit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 28. Mark, 9. 1.</note> 
               <hi>of the Vine, untill the day that he drink it new with them in his Fathers Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where he declareth very plain, that though now he condiſcended to their weakneſs, and gave them thoſe viſible ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſignes and pledges that his love was very great towards them, in thus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them: yet when the Kingdome <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> of God ſhould come, or that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf come into their hearts in the ſpirit, or comforter, (which was fulfilled in the <note place="margin">Act. 2. 1, 2.</note> day of Pentecoſt) then they ſhould be
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119914:70"/>
enabled to know, and apprehend the love of God in, and through him, more than by any outward obſervations.</p>
            <p>Yea, thoſe heavenly joyes, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſolations, ariſing from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhed abroad in the ſoul, ſhould be abundantly more full of delight, and ſatisſaction unto them, than the drinking of Wine, <hi>For his Love is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>than Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To dwell in the uſe of outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to put us in mind of Chriſts death, is with <hi>Mary</hi> to ſtand weeping at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 12.</note> when Chriſt is riſen and gone, and deſerves juſtly that reproof which ſhe met with in ſo doing; <hi>Why ſeek ye the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 5.</note> 
               <hi>living among the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that the Apoſtle tells them the danger of unworthy receiving, he ſeems hereby to rebuke them for, or to warn them of two great faults herein; the which are alſo very common among them that reſt in outward Ordinances; either they make Idols of them, and think to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> attain ſomething by the uſe of them: or elſe they uſe them careleſly, hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head, not conſidering what they go about, but meerly for cuſtome, and ſo
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119914:70"/>
prophane the ſame: <hi>For which,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God is diſpleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed this Bread and Cup, was as well to teach them, their fellowſhip with Chriſt in ſuffering, as to put them in <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> mind of his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye ſhall indeed drink of my Cup.</hi> And if <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12.</note> we ſuffer with him, we ſhall raigne with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But our Saviour Chriſt tells the Jews,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 53. 54.</note> 
               <hi>that except they eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drink his bloud, they have no life in them. And that whoſo eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his bloud, hath eternall life, for his fleſh is meat indeed and his bloud is drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and whoſoever eat thereof ſhall live for ever. Doth it not hence appear that in the partaking of this ordinance of the Lords Supper, that the Souls of true believers are nouriſhed, and fed up to eternall life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True indeed our Saviour ſpeaks theſe words to the Jewes, but that he doth not mean, nor intend, the eating and drinking of Bread and Wine, is <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 28.</note> plainly declared in the ſame Chapter, at the 28 Verſe the people aske him, <hi>What</hi> 
               <note place="margin">29.</note> 
               <hi>they ſhould do that they might work the works of God.</hi> He anſwers them, <hi>That the work</hi>

               <hi>of God is to believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi>

               <hi>that we may believe.</hi> For our Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Moſes;</hi> in the deſart, did eat Manna, even bread from heaven, and therefore they had reaſon to harken to <hi>Moſes.</hi> But <note place="margin">32.</note> if thou ſhew no ſign, nor work no great work, why ſhould we hearken to thee, or believe in thee?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour anſwers; <hi>Though your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had Manna under</hi> Moſes, <hi>yet it was not that bread</hi> (meaning the bread of life, <note place="margin">33.</note> becauſe they that did eat there of were dead;) <hi>but my Father gives you the true bread.

            <p>By all which paſſages it doth appear very plain, that by eating and drinking the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, is not to be carnally underſtood, of eating bread and drinking wine: but ſpiritually of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him, and being united, and made one with him: As Verſe 56. <hi>He that</hi>

            <p>And this River, whoſe ſtreams make joyfull this City, is that unſpeakable and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119914:73"/>
unconceiveable Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, when the Lord is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, or manifeſt himſelf to poor Saints, <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 23.</note> ſo as to let them ſee and know their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption by Jeſus, and to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their union in the Spirit with him in Jeſus: And alſo that now he loves them as he loves Jeſus Chriſt, they being taken into the ſame Spirit, or divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with him: from hence then grows up this tree of life. Then the poor Saints apprehend life, life eternall, and they now begin to live indeed. Not any more a carnall, but a ſpirituall life, not onely a naturall, or temporall: but an eternall life.</p>
            <p>Chriſt who is this tree of life, lives in them, and becauſe he lives, they ſhall live <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 19.</note> alſo.</p>
            <p>And this tree of life, or Chriſt living, and growing in them, it beares twelve manner of fruits, or abundance, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of heavenly graces, and comforts. <hi>Love, joy, peace, gentleneſſe, kindneſſe, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>

For Chriſt who is eternall life ſhall ſo <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 8.</note> manifeſt himſelf to them, that they ſhall ſee him, and by beholding of him, ſhall be made like unto him, and transformed into his Image, even his Image of glory: and ſhall ſo live in the ſame, from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another, as it is perfected in this life, untill it be compleated in endleſſe glory.</p>
            <p>Now they in whom Chriſt (who is this tree of life) thus dwells, and manifeſts himſelf, need not dig for water, or run to broken Ciſterns, fleſhly and carnall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and thence return empty; men may like the Prodigall, live upon huskes till they are almoſt pined: But if ever they come to themſelves, if ever the Lord be pleaſed to clear up their eyes, ſo as to let them ſee, and apprehend their union with him in the Spirit through Chriſt Jeſus. Then they will ſay, <hi>In my Fathers</hi>

               <hi>houſe is bread enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they will ſee and know, that Chriſt is this bread of life, and this water of life, and that whoſo eates and drinks <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 48.</note> thereof, that is, ſo believes on him as to be united and made one with God in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall never hunger nor thirſt after any barren or empty comforts, from outward <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But they which believe not in him, and are not thus united and made one with him in the Spirit; though they eat his fleſh, and drink his bloud, namely, in the <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 26, 27.</note> carnall and outward uſe of Bread and Wine; yet they have no life in them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they enjoy any true comfort in him, nor eternall life by him, but ſhall goe into condemnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. But is it not ſaid in the Scriptures, that Chriſt died for all men, and that as by the offence of one, judgement came upon all</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>men to condemnation; ſo by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life? How ſay you then, that ſome go into condemnation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſts death did in ſome reſpect reach forth it ſelf unto all men, God had a glorious deſign in making of man, and for this end, did bring forth this outward creation of all things, to be ſubſervient to his glory, to help forward this deſign: yea, and the Lord was rich in mercy, and ſtore, and abundantly provided afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to keep this deſign on foot; for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119914:74"/>
Chriſt was that Lamb, <hi>prepared and ſlain</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 20. Rev. 13. 8.</note> 
               <hi>before the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Chriſt had not died in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and account of God, before man had actually ſinned, then there had been an utter ſubverſion and diſſolution, not onely of mankind, but alſo of the whole Creation, by mans ſin: But now the death of Chriſt, coming between divine wrath, and the whole creation, did ſtill give a being unto the ſame, that it ſhould be ſerviceable, in helping forward this glorious deſign.</p>
            <p>And upon this account meerly it is, (namely, by the death of Chriſt) that all men, even the moſt wicked, enjoy a temporall life, health, riches, yea, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">Pſal 36. 6</note> things whatſoever: for in this ſence he is ſaid to ſave, or preſerve man, and beaſt, for he doth good to all, and makes his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 45.</note> upon the juſt and unjuſt, namely, the Sun and Rain of his outward providence: and thus Chriſt died for all men, and ſo he is the Saviour of all men.</p>
            <p>But there is a more eſpecial ſalvation, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He is the Saviour of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but eſpecially of them that believe:</hi> and this ſalvation is not that outward
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119914:75"/>
or temporal ſalvation, but an inward and ſpiritual one, and is peculiar onely to them that believe in him, and are made one with him; and upon this ground it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, as <hi>by the offence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 18.</note> 
               <hi>of one, judgement came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> as if he had ſaid, that as <hi>Adam</hi> by ſinning brought all men into a ſtate of ſin, and ſo of condemnation, ſo all that are juſtified unto life, are made juſt by the free gift and grace of God, by faith, in the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that the words doe not extend, that as all men fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo all, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſhould be juſtified and ſaved by Chriſt, but onely they, who by faith lay hold on the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: the which the Apoſtle declares at large, in the 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Chapters.</p>
            <p>In the 3. Chapter he proves all men to be under ſin, and that by the workes of <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9. 10, 11.</note> the Law no man can be juſtified; and that God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a <note place="margin">verſ. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 25.</note> propitiation, that whoſoever believes ſhould be juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in his bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:119914:75"/>
In the 4. Chapter he tells them, that <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 13.</note> even <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by, or for any work which he wrought, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and that faith <note place="margin">22.</note> was reckoned unto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo it ſhall be to all that doe <note place="margin">24.</note> believe.</p>
            <p>In the 5. Chapter he tells them, that <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> juſtification by faith, brings peace and joy into the ſoul, which juſtification by the work of the Law could not doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the work was ever doing, but never done, and they looked upon God in that <note place="margin">3.</note> eſtate, as ever angry: But now, ſayes he, we have peace with him, and can joy in <note place="margin">18.</note> tribulations; for though in <hi>Adam</hi> we were under condemnation, yet now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus, and looking to him for righteouſneſſe, we are juſtified unto life.</p>
            <p>Thus the Apoſtle is farre from intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general redemption, but an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſalvation by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar onely to them that believe.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But the Apoſtle writing to</hi> Timothy, <hi>exhorts,</hi> that prayer be made for all men, <hi>becauſe he will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth: and further ſaith,</hi> that Chriſt is the Mediator between God and man, who gave himſelf
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119914:76"/>
a ranſome for all: <hi>And the Apoſtle</hi> John <hi>ſaith,</hi> That Chriſt is the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world. <hi>How ſay you then, that ſalvation is peculiar onely to them who doe believe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the clearing of this, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Scriptures muſt be inquired into. The Apoſtle indeed exhorts, that prayers, interceſſions, and giving of <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1, 2.</note> thankes be made for all men, for Kings, and all in authority, and gives a twofold reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt in reſpect of themſelves, that ſo they might live in quietneſſe, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon reſpects God, it is his will, he is well pleaſed with our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">3.</note> for them; becauſe he will bring ſome of all ſorts (high and low) to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, that ſo they may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And if he ſay, what muſt we pray for <note place="margin">4.</note> the Gentiles, for our Governours are no Jewes? is it lawfull to pray for them? Yea, ſaith the Apoſtle, God will have all to be ſaved, Gentiles as well as the Jewes, for there is but one God, and he is the God of the Gentiles as well as of the <note place="margin">5.</note> Jewes; and there is but one Mediator
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119914:76"/>
between God and man, even the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf, to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <note place="margin">6.</note> the Gentiles as well as the Jewes, and this myſtery was not known to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, but now in due time it is to be manifeſted; and for this very purpoſe, ſaith he, I am ordeined a Preacher, and <note place="margin">7.</note> an Apoſtle, to bring this good tydings to the Gentiles, and to aſſure their hearts, that if they believe in Chriſt they ſhall be ſaved; and thereof you need not doubt, for as Chriſt, who is truth, is in me, ſo that which I ſpeak is truth.</p>
            <p>And hereto agrees that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34. That <hi>God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 10. 34, 35.</note> (Gentiles as well as Jewes) <hi>he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him:</hi> ſhewing plainly, that the purpoſe of God in bringing in the Gentiles, was a ſecret to that day, but now was revealed.</p>
            <p>And where the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Chriſt is the propitiation for the ſinnes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>of the whole world,</hi> he doth not mean, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular perſon in the world, but onely they, <hi>who walk in the light, as God is in the light,</hi> even theſe the bloud of Chriſt doth cleanſe from all ſin: for ſaith he,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119914:77"/>
               <hi>If we ſay, that we have no ſin, we deceive our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9.</note> 
               <hi>ſelves, and the truth is not in us:</hi> But if we ſee our ſinnes, and confeſſe that we are ſinners, his promiſe is, to forgive, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe. And <hi>theſe things I write unto you, to warn</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>you that yee ſin not,</hi> yet nevertheleſſe, if yee be overtaken (as who is not) be not diſcouraged, for <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt, who is perfectly righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes, and not for ours onely,</hi> who are Jewes, but for all them that thus have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, among the Gentiles alſo, in all Nations throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p>And that this Scripture is thus to be underſtood, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes plainly, <hi>Col. 3. 10, 11. Where</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is neither</hi> Greek, <hi>nor</hi> Jew, <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>

               <hi>nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion,</hi> Barbarian, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, <hi>Bond, nor Free, but Chriſt is all, and in all;</hi> he doth not mean, that <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> &amp;c. are all one, and Chriſt is in them all, as to every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among all theſe, but onely thoſe among them, who, in the verſes before, had put off the old man, and had put on the new: namely, ſuch as had mortified
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119914:77"/>
their earthly members, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, inordinate affections, &amp;c. in the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> and had put off anger, wrath, malice, blaſphemy, filthy communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. in the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> which were the deeds of the old man; and who alſo were renewed in knowledge, according to the Image of God, which is Chriſt, the new man, in wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe, &amp;c, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Among theſe, ſaith he, there is no difference, though ſome of one nation, and ſome of another, ſome bond, and ſome free, for they are all one in Chriſt, and he is all to them, and all in them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But doth not the Prophet</hi> Iſaiah <hi>ſay, That</hi> he <hi>(meaning Chriſt)</hi> was wounded <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5, 6</note> for our tranſgreſſions, and by his ſtripes we are healed; And (all) we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, <hi>even all without exception: And that</hi> he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death? <hi>Whereby it appeares, that his death was an undertaking for all, good and bad, wicked rich men that ſaw no need of him; Where then is the difference? Or how can God be ſaid to reſpect perſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:119914:78"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Prophet in the former chapter, had largely declared, what joyfull and <note place="margin">Iſai. 52. 1, 2.</note> glorious dayes ſhould be in the time of the Goſpel, and exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the conſideration of the ſame; yea, and to account the feet of them beautiful, that ſhould bring them ſuch good newes. <note place="margin">7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And under the Type of the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whether they ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, <note place="margin">11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and from whence they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly return, he prophecieth of their deliverance from the ſpiritual bondage and thraldome of ſin by Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhould both deal prudently, and alſo proſper in his deſignes; and though he <note place="margin">13.</note> ſhould appear in a very deſpicable form as to men, and his viſage ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">14.</note> through ſufferings; yet he ſhould be <note place="margin">15.</note> exalted, and be very high, and ſprinckle many Nations with his bloud, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But who, ſaith the Prophet, will believe this report, or to whom ſhall this arm, <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note> or power of the Lord (even Chriſt) be revealed.</p>
            <p>Why, what was the reaſon?</p>
            <p>Becauſe the people ſhould be very high in expectation, and look for ſuch a Chriſt as ſhould, even like <hi>David,</hi> defend them
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119914:78"/>
from outward enemies, warre, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</p>
            <p>But it was the pleaſure of God, that Chriſt ſhould grow up by degrees, as a <note place="margin">2.</note> tender plant, n otregarded, and as a root out of a dry ground, which no man looks after; to have no beauty or comlineſs that <note place="margin">3.</note> we ſhould deſire him. A man of ſorrows and griefes, from whom all men ſhould <note place="margin">4.</note> hide their ſaces: yet <hi>ſurely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he hath borne our griefes, and carried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5.</note> 
               <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed: All</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>we like Sheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But who are they that the Prophet is now ſpeaking to? Or who doth he here ſpeak of? Is he not ſpeaking to Iſrael, a people whom God did own above all people in the world, and whom, by an outward choice, he had brought near to himſelf, above all Nations whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</p>
            <p>Yea, and moreover, was not Iſrael af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh a type of Iſrael in the ſpirit, for all were not Iſrael in the ſpirit, which which were ſo in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:119914:79"/>
Yea, and the Prophet often calls them <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which doth uſually ſignifie the Saints and Believers in the <note place="margin">Iſa. 52. 1, 2</note> dayes of the Goſpel; and in ſpeaking to theſe, he doth figuratively ſpeak of all the Saints, who ſhould believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt hath for theſe born and endured ſorrowes and griefes, for their <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 5.</note> tranſgreſſions was he wounded, and his chaſtiſement was their peace, and they were healed by his ſtripes.</p>
            <p>Theſe were his loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael which were gone aſtray, and <note place="margin">6.</note> turned after their own wayes; and that they might be reduced, and brought home again, the Lord ſaid all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 24</note> upon him.</p>
            <p>With theſe he was content to make his grave, though they were wicked in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 9.</note> that ſo he might be their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and make them righteous in himſelf: yea, he emptied himſelf, and lay down in death, that they, who were rich and full in their own apprehenſions, might empty themſelves, lie down in ſhame, and receive of his fulneſſe: for <note place="margin">10.</note> theſe did the Lord bruiſe him, and for theſe was his ſoul made an offering.</p>
            <p>And to what end was all this? That he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119914:79"/>
might ſee his ſeed, that he might thereby <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> redeem a people from all iniquity, and conform them to himſelf in all holineſſe, and ſo preſent them to the Father in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſpotleſſe and blameleſſe, for this was the good pleaſure of the Lord, and it was proſperous in the hand of Chriſt, for he did it effectually.</p>
            <p>Yea, Chriſt did prolong his dayes, (though he died as to the fleſh) and ſaw the travell of his ſoul, and the fruit <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 11.</note> of his ſufferings, and was ſatisfied in the ſame, for his bloud was not ſhed in vain: for by his righteouſneſſe many (not all) were juſtified, becauſe he bare or ſuffered for their iniquities: therefore God hath exalted him, and made him glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">12.</note> he poured out his ſoul to death, and bear the ſinnes of (not all; but) many.</p>
            <p>Thus this Scripture being duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all men may hence judge, whether the Lord, by the Prophet, intends a general redemption of all without exception; or of a peculiar people, even myſtical Iſrael, whom he hath adopted to himſelf <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 18.</note> in Jeſus Chriſt, for Sonnes and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for though the Lord be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, as to any outward
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119914:80"/>
appearance, he regards not any man, as he is a man, as he is a Jew, nor as he is a Gentile, as he is rich, or as he is poor, bond, or free; but as he is in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him. <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 6.</note>

            <p>In this ſence the Lord doth accept perſons, for he accepts of theſe in Chriſt, and as for others, who are not in Chriſt, he regards them not, be they Jew or Gentile, high or low, noble or baſe, he accepts of none, but in whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, and manifeſts himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is not God in all men? Is not he one and the ſame, and doth not he infinitely comprehend all things in himſelf? All come from his fulneſſe, and he dwells in all, and every one in his fulneſſe; for he cannot be divided, a piece in one, and a piece in another, but he is all, and in all, and to all, onely there is not the ſame manifeſtations, in ſome he lies hid, and in others he ſhines forth, and we are ſaid to be the off ſpring of God, and to live, move, and have our being in him: How then can it be, but that all muſt be ſaved, ſeeing God is in all, and all are in him?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That God doth infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all things in himſelf, and that

all things, even the whole creation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his fullneſſe, is a truth: yea, that God is in all men, in ſome ſence, or reſpect, is alſo granted.</p>
            <p>Man being created in the Image of God, was thereby able to act according to God, but having by ſinne defaced this Image, he was now become more like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan than God: And though he had loſt all his wiſdome, and ſtrength to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, in things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: yet there remained ſo much of <note place="margin">Rom. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </note> the light of nature in him, namely his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural underſtanding, and reaſon which ſerved him, and whereby he was enabled to act in moral, and civill things, and to <note place="margin">20.</note> leave him without excuſe: For without underſtanding, and reaſon, he could not be able to glorify God, as God, in the <note place="margin">21.</note> outward creation.</p>
            <p>Now this natural underſtanding and reaſon, as it is purely natural, ſo God ownes it as a ſparke of his Image, but as it is corrupted, and defiled with ſinne, ſo he diſowns it: and this is that which doth <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> accuſe, or excuſe.</p>
            <p>When naturall men led on by the light of nature, did act according to reaſon, or <note place="margin">14.</note> judgement, then their conſcience did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <note place="margin">15.</note>

them: But when they acted contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reaſon, even from corrupt, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principles; then their naturall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was againſt them, and accuſed them.</p>
            <p>And this naturall principle hath many names, even in Scripture; ſomtimes it is <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 19. 21. 28.</note> called, <hi>a knowing of God;</hi> or, <hi>a knowledge of God:</hi> Sometimes <hi>mans righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 10. 3.

For there is not any action in the world <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> that is naturally, and civilly good, but in this reſpect it is of God. Neither can God ly hid in this reſpect in the moſt wicked or carnal men. For even they, many times, do act things in themſelves, that are naturally, and civilly good.</p>
            <p>And thus all men may be ſaid to be the off-ſpring of God, not onely becauſe they all came from him, as their original, but alſo as they are acted by him, through a ſpirit, or principle of nature, to walk ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,

and civilly in things of outward concernment.</p>
            <p>But now there is a more ſpecial, and ſpiritual in-dwelling of God in the Saints, namely the eternal in-dwelling of his love in Jeſus Chriſt; wherely he hath from all <note place="margin">Eph. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> eternity choſen them, and made them one with himſelf in Chriſt: And in due time in their ſeveral generations hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, and doth manifeſt, and reveal this love which is Chriſt in their hearts, which <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 6.</note> doth aſſure them of their adoption, and of their union with him. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are carried forth to live up to him, yea to live in him, being transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more and more into his own glorious <note place="margin">1 Cor. 23. 18.</note> Image, even by his ſpirit dwelling in them.</p>
            <p>Now that God is not thus in all men, (namely in his love in Jeſus Chriſt) is clear both from Scripture, and common experience.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in the eighth Chapter of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the firſt Verſe, layes this down as a firme concluſion: <hi>That there is no condemnation to them that are in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who are they? <hi>Such as walk not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:119914:82"/>
Now to walk after the ſpirit, is to be led forth by the ſame, <hi>to mortifie the deeds of the body, that henceforth they might not ſerve ſin.</hi> For Jeſus Chriſt, who is in them a law of the Spirit, which is a law of Life, doth free them firſt from ſinne, and then <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> from death.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome that walk after the <note place="margin">Verſ. 5. 6. 7.</note> fleſh, and mind, or are led onely by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall principle, and this tends onely to death: becauſe this ſpirit, or carnal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is at enmity againſt God, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, nor can be ſubject, or obedient to Chriſt, (who is the Law of life, or power of God to ſalvation in all that do believe) but is full of ſelf-righteouſneſſe, acting by legall and fleſhly performances for life, and happineſs. And being thus earnal in their minds, cannot pleaſe God: <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> becauſe partaking not of Chriſt, or of that ſpirit wherewith he is annointed, they are not, nor cannot be any of his. <note place="margin">9.</note> But walk in the vanity of their own minds, <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> having nothing but darkneſſe in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and by reaſon of that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <note place="margin">17.</note> are eſtranged from the glorious <note place="margin">18.</note> Light and Life of God, even Jeſus Chriſt, and being hardned by continual cuſtome <note place="margin">19.</note> in ſinne, become at length inſenſible,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:119914:82"/>
and give themſelves over unto laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wantonneſs, to act all manner of uncleanneſſe, and that with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <note place="margin">20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the Saints have better learned Chriſt, for they being annointed with, and receiving of his Spirit, do therefore mind the things thereof, and are led forth thereby into all well pleaſing actions. <note place="margin">Col. 1. 10.</note> Chriſt who is the Life, being riſen in their hearts, the old man, or body of ſinne <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> is deſtroyed, mortified, and put off, by little, and little, even as he is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>But the wicked, even the children of diſobedience, or unbeliefe, they have no <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 5.</note> fellowſhip in Chriſts Kingdome, which is Spiritual, nor no inheritance in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, which is in glory eternal, <note place="margin">6.</note> though they deceive themſelves: For the wrath of God cometh and abideth on <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note> them.</p>
            <p>And thus it is clear from Scripture, that God is not in all men, in his love in Jeſus Chriſt, for he is where he comes in Chriſt, both Light, and Life, and where he is thus, he acts like himſelf: And it is alſo as plain in our daily experience, how that the Saints, in whom Chriſt dwels, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:119914:83"/>
who are united to him, and made one with God in him; that they are carried forth in the ſtrength of his quickning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to ſhew forth the prayſes of him, who hath called them out of darkneſſe, into <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> his marvelous Light.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, we ſee worldly wicked men, live many of them more like bruite beaſts, than reaſonable creatures: pampering and feeding themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Jude. 12.</note> fear, ſwilling and wallowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own vomit, like filthy ſwine, ſporting, and delighting themſelves in their own luſts, and windy fancies, and deceivings, belching out the rottenneſſe <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 13.</note> of their own hearts, by curſed oathes, and blaſphemies, making a continual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ade of mocking, backbiting, ſtander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fighting and quarrelling, ranting and roaring; in a word, living in all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and dying without repentance.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plain in experience, that there be many, (yea too too many) who are ſo farre from living in God, and God living in them by Jeſus Chriſt; that they are rather poſſeſt of Satan, who lives in them, and leads them captive at his own <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 26.</note> pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus both Scripture and Experience,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119914:83"/>
do clearly witneſſe, that God is not in all men, in a way of life, and ſalvation, which is by Chriſt Jeſus: But in a common ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or common and outward providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo he acts, rules, and orders all men.</p>
            <p>Neither can God be ſaid to be in the Saints in his fulneſſe; for the fulneſſe of the Godhead dwels onely in Chriſt; and the Saints receive of that fulneſſe which <note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> is in him.</p>
            <p>For though they partake of the ſame ſpirit, or divine nature with him, yet it is ſtill in that meaſure, or degree as he is pleaſed to let out, or to manifeſt him ſelf by.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the head, and the Saints are <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 4.</note> the body, or members, now all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as they have ſeveral offices, ſo they have ſeveral capacities, for God hath ſet all the members in the body, every <note place="margin">Col. 2. 10.</note> one in due place and office, that it might be compleated in the head, which is Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And from Chriſt, or the head, the whole body being fitly joynted together, receiveth nouriſhment, to every part a meaſure, even to encreaſe and edifie it <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> ſelf in love.</p>
            <p>Neither is this to divide God, for as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119914:84"/>
he cannot be devided, ſo neither can he be comprehended, for he fills all things, <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 24.</note> and ſo he fills the Saints, yet while they walk in fleſh, they are not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him in his fullneſſe: But they are all ſo filled, according to their ſeveral meaſures, to advance the good of the whole.</p>
            <p>And that God may be in men in his love in Jeſus Chriſt, and ever lie hid, and not appear; is contrary to Scripture and right reaſon: <hi>For God is light; and with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 5.</note> 
               <hi>him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi> And where God comes in this Light, which is Chriſt, there he expels darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Saints indeed, while they are in the ſtate of nature, are in darkneſſe, becauſe <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> they want the manifeſtation of God, or revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All this while they are in the love of God, but this Love is not yet ſhed abroad in their hearts, the ſeed was ſown, but it was not yet quickned up to life: But when the appointed time is come, that <note place="margin">Joh. 11. 44. Luk. 7. 44. Mark. 4. 28.</note> Chriſt will ſay, <hi>come forth, and I ſay unto thee ariſe: Then appeares firſt the blade, then the eare, then the full corne in the eare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not in all men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119914:84"/>
but onely in the Saints: who are elected in Chriſt Jeſus in the purpoſe of of God before the world began, that they ſhould be thus conformed unto the Image of his Sonne, and ſo be holy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him in love.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But election doth not relate to perſons, but to the things in the perſons, for Gods love &amp; hatred is not toward, the perſons of men, but toward the good or evill in the perſons; and this is Typed out in</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau, <hi>which as good and evill dwell in every man, as they were in the womb of one</hi> Rebecca: <hi>for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men are but outward formes, in which good and evill is acted, and theſe outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can act nothing, but are acted themſelves either by a good or an evill ſpirit: How then can God be ſaid to elect, or not to elect, to ſave or not to ſave the perſon of a man which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſhall be nothing when the spirit ceaſes to act in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That election doth not relate to mens perſons, but to the good things acted in the perſons: is a meer fancy, and quite contrary to the mind of God revealed in the Scripture. Firſt we muſt conſider what the perſon of man is, and what makes him a man, or perſon: and then ſecondly prove, that election
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119914:85"/>
relates to the perſon. For the firſt in ſhort, a man, and every man conſiſts of two main parts: The body and the ſoul, <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 7</note> without the ſoul or ſpirit, the body is but a dead carcaſs: and without the body, <note place="margin">James. 2. 26.</note> the ſoul hath no reſidence, or place to act in, and cannot act at all: Therefore it muſt be concluded, that if either be wanting, there is not a man, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: A man then is a perſon conſiſting of a reaſonable ſoul and humane body. Now that election doth relate to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus conſidered, and not to the good things acted in the perſon, is eaſily made good in Scripture. The Apoſtle in the Epheſians chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. verſ. 4. 5. 6. 7. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">Eph. 1.</note> the Saints, or rather bleſſeth God on their behalf, for that <hi>he had choſen them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">4.</note> 
               <hi>in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love:</hi> And <hi>that he had adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">5.</note> 
               <hi>them to be Children by Jeſus Chriſt, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his free grace, even his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> And <hi>that they were accepted in the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6.</note> 
               <hi>beloved for no other end, but for the praiſe of his glorious grace: And not onely ſo, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through the riches of his grace, wherein he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">7.</note> 
               <hi>abounded towards them, they were redeemed from Sinne and Satan, Hell, and Death,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:119914:85"/>
their ſins being forgiven them through his bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence it is plain, that perſons and not things are here intended. For it is not ſaid, that God had choſen holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or unblamablneſſe in them, but them to be holy and unblamable. Neither is it ſaid that God had predeſtinated the good things in them to the adoption of Children: But them to the adoption of Children.</p>
            <p>Again if election relate not to perſons but to things; I wonder what redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; remiſſion of ſins mean in this place, and many others; what can good things be redeemed from? and how can good things ſtand in need of remiſſion of ſins? And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle 1. Chapter. 1. 2. Tells the ſtrangers <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> that were ſcattered, <hi>that (they) were</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>elect according to the fore-knowledge of God,</hi> and not the good things in them: And <hi>that this election is aſſured to them through ſanctification of the Spirit, that thereby they might believe, or be obedient, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>be sprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what can be added to good things, or how can good things believe?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119914:86"/>
or be ſprinkled with the bloud of Jeſus, or have remiſſion of ſins?</p>
            <p>Againe, if gods anger be not againſt the perſons of men, as well as againſt ſin in the perſon, then why did he ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avenge himſelf upon ſin in the perſon of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Was it ſin or Chriſt that cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46.</note> 
               <hi>me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> are <note place="margin">Gen. 25. 23.</note> brought in to be a type of this great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, being both in the wombe of one <hi>Rebecca;</hi> it makes nothing to this purpoſe, that God ſhould elect the good things in a man, and not the man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were men, and both of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and both of them the ſonnes of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and both in <hi>Rebeccas</hi> womb at one and the ſame time; and yet one of them elected, and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, to ſhew, that the purpoſe of God in election, was not out of any fleſhly or carnal reſpects: <hi>But meerly according to his own good pleaſure.</hi> For <hi>all are not</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>neither becauſe they are</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, that there is fleſh and Spirit
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119914:86"/>
both in the Saints, yet that is no ground to conclude, that God will deſtroy the fleſh and ſave the Spirit, and not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but rather that God will ſave the the Saint or perſon, and deſtroy the fleſh.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the perſons of men are but outward formes, and act not, but are acted, and therefore ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and damnation belongs not to them. I hope then, that if it be made to appeare, that mens perſons do act; then it will be alſo granted, that ſalvation and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs to them.</p>
            <p>And for the word perſon, or man, it is all one; and that by perſon or man is meant the whole man, and ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Now that ſin is acted by the whole man, is very clear in Scripture. In the third of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. It is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at large, how the Serpent begiuled <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> the woman.</p>
            <p>Firſt he is dealing with her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the thing muſt needs have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <note place="margin">1.</note> through her eares, for the devill was yet without doors.</p>
            <p>Next ſhe looked upon it with her eyes, <hi>for ſhe ſaw the fruit that it was good.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then her affections were wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119914:87"/>
               <hi>And ſhe deſired it.</hi> At length the will conſented, <hi>and ſhe took it with her hand and did eat;</hi> yea, <hi>and gave her husband and he did eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who doth not ſee here an act of the whole man?</p>
            <p>And it is juſt ſo in every actual ſin: for though Satan be gotten within, yet he can force no man to ſin; but is dealing with the underſtanding, to deceive that. and the underſtanding being deceived, cannot force the Will, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>The Saints, though they were in the ſtate of election in the purpoſe of God, yet for the preſent being fallen under ſin, were in a condition of darkneſſe and death, and were in ſlavery to ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: And being no way able to free or deliver themſelves, therefore was Chriſt Gods elect, or his righteous ſervant, that he by undertaking for them in the fleſh, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> and by raiſing and quickning them in the ſpirit, might bring them out of priſon and captivity, make them free men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the Father in himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo meanes the Apoſtle, when he tells the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that now it is Gods <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 10.</note> deſign, in the diſpenſation of the fullneſſe of times; to gather into one ſweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or holy fellowſhip, all the Saints that are elected in Chriſt, or which are in Chriſt in his purpoſe, which is all one, which are in heaven, and in earth; <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Jewes, or Gentiles; circumciſed or uncircumciſed, bond or free;</hi> even in him,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119914:89"/>
as the Saints are in Chriſt by vertue of Gods election.</p>
            <p>So God will gather them together, and ſo raiſe them by Chriſt, that they ſhall now know, and believe their union with God in Chriſt, and their union one with another, even in him.</p>
            <p>And to this end, <hi>all things were made by</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 16, 17. Col. 2. 9, 10.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Yea, Chriſt fits in the Saints, as a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and purifier of ſilver, and by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 3.</note> of judgement and burning (which is himſelf) doth purifie the ſonnes of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> even them which he hath brought near to himſelf, and burnes up all their droſſe, the briars and the thornes, their ſinnes and corruptions; that they may come forth a veſſell for the refiner, and <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 4.</note> fit for the Maſters uſe: That they may offer to the Lord in righteouſneſſe, or give up themſelves wholly to him in Chriſt; and whoſoever of the Saints reſt or build upon any formes or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances below Chriſt, the fire of Chriſts Spirit ſhall conſume theſe works; yet they being built upon, or intereſted in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.</note>

Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved by him, yet ſo as to be purified by fire.</p>
            <p>And thus God will come forth, and is already come in the Saints (not in all men) deſtroying and conſuming all ſin and unbelief, and doth daily gather them together into one body in Jeſus, and will by Jeſus bring them into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, their originall and fountain, after he hath firſt ſeparated between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and the vile, between the Saints and their beloved luſts.</p>
            <p>Chriſt came not to ſave the good, or the believing part of men, for there was no good, nor believing part at all in man; for man was quite and clean loſt and <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 11.

            <p>The good things, and believing part in the Saints, is Chriſt, and he was never loſt, and the Saints partaking of him, are united to him, and ſo are ſaved in and by him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And that this may not ſeem ſtrange, he tells us, that Chriſt is already by his <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note> Spirit quickening our mortall bodies more and more to holineſs; and will in <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> the end change them, and make them like his glorious body, even by his mighty power.</p>

            <p>But the Lord, who is infinite in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did ſee and behold all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing was created, for all things were in him, although they were not <note place="margin">Iſal. 46. 10.</note> brought forth or manifeſted: And in his fore-knowledge, and in himſelf, he beheld all men, when as yet there was none of them; yea, even then he beheld them in their ſeverall conditions, both in their creation, and in their fall.</p>

And was pleaſed alſo in the very ſame inſtant, and according to this fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, out of the abundant riches of his love in Jeſus Chriſt, to chooſe out ſome poor miſerable fallen wretches, and to make known to them the exceeding and <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> ſuper-abundant treaſures of his grace and favour in him, in their ſeverall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo to unite them to himſelf in <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 5, 6.</note> Chriſt; that they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glorious grace, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 23.</note>

               <hi>I ſaid in my heart,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Oh that God would manifeſt himſelf to them, and make them ſee, that they be but beaſts in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here is no great ſtrength in all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſurrection of the body.</p>
            <p>For the bodies of wicked men ſhall be <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> raiſed as well as their ſouls, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for things done in them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>all that are in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 28. 29.</note> 
               <hi>the graves, ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth. They that have done good, to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, and they that have done evill, to the reſurrection of damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that he intends here a reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body, is plain.</p>
            <p>For he had ſpoken of a ſpiritual reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the 25. Verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>the hour is comming, and now is, that the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 26.</note> 
               <hi>dead ſhall hear his voyce, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi>

            <p>Meaning the dead in ſinne, whom he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119914:94"/>
would quicken by his power to newneſſe of life.</p>
            <p>For although the Saints dye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this life, yet they doe not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh as to their bodies, for <hi>they are but</hi>

               <hi>fallen aſleep,</hi> and <hi>they ſleep in Chriſt;</hi> and this is in reſpect of their bodies; (for their ſoules, or ſpirits cannot be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid to ſleep) <hi>And Chriſt will raiſe them up at the</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle met with ſome among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that denied the reſurrection of the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. with whom he <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> ſeemes thus to reaſon.</p>
            <p>The reſurrection of Chriſt hath been <note place="margin">4.</note> preached among you, and you cannot but believe it, becauſe it was not onely <note place="margin">5.</note> foretold by Scripture, but was witneſſed <note place="margin">6.</note> alſo by many who had ſeen him after he <note place="margin">7.</note> was riſen.</p>
            <p>Now if this be a truth, how then ſay <note place="margin">12.</note> ſome among you, that there is no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead?</p>
            <p>For if there be no reſurrection of the <note place="margin">13.</note> dead, (or of mens bodies) then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſt is not riſen.</p>
            <p>And if Chriſt be not riſen, then we have <note place="margin">14.</note> preached in vaine, and ye have believed in vaine, and ye are yet in your ſinnes. <note place="margin">15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:119914:95"/>
Yea, and if Chriſt be not riſen, then the Saints that are fallen aſleep in him, <note place="margin">18.</note> are periſhed, and God hath ſent us to bear witneſſe to a falſhood, if the dead riſe not.</p>
            <p>For if Chriſt be not riſen, then the dead ſhall not riſe.</p>
            <p>But if Chriſt be riſen (as indeed he is) <note place="margin">20.</note> then it is impoſſible that the dead ſhould not riſe.</p>
            <p>For Chriſts reſurrection is a pledge, a firſt fruits of the reſurrection of the body.</p>
            <p>But if there be no reſurrection, we and <note place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> all the Saints, are the miſerableſt men in the world.</p>
            <p>And if the dead riſe not, why do I put my ſelf to paine?</p>
            <p>Why do I ſuffer reproaches, ſtripes, impriſonments, watchings, faſtings? &amp;c. <note place="margin">30.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Why am I alwayes in Jeopardy of my life? Nay, Why do I dye daily?</p>
            <p>What advantage is all this to me if <note place="margin">31<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> there be no reward, no reſurrection?</p>
            <p>And the Saints in the 11. <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> 35. <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> are ſaid <hi>to be tortured, mocked, ſcourged, impriſoned, ſtoned, ſawne aſunder, tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

Why ſo? Did they not run with the world, into every exceſſe of riot? Did they not ſaile with every wind, turne with every tide? Yea, did they not ſweare and ſwagger, rant and roare, and ſay with the Epicure, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for</hi>

            </p>
            <p>No ſaith the Text. <hi>They looked for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſurrection:</hi> a reſurrection to life and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reward, for they knew full well, <hi>that if</hi>

               <hi>they ſuffered with him, they ſhould raigne with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was this reſurrection, which they expected, that firſt &amp; ſpiritual reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, namely a riſing out of ſin, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, ignorance, &amp;c. to live in newneſſe of life, for that the Apoſtles, and the other Saints, had attained to in their ſeveral meaſures, or elſe they had not been able to endure ſuch ſharpe ſufferings for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But as their ſufferings were outward in <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 23.</note> the body, ſo they waited for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the adoption, even the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies,</p>
            <p>So that the reſurrection here ſpoken of, can be no other, but that great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſurrection, when all men ſhall be <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 16. 17.</note>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:119914:96"/>
raiſed, and both ſouls and bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to ſuffer, or to raigne together.</p>
            <p>And for that general Judgement, which is ſaid to be a diſpoſing of all things, both good and evill, to a full end, and period, or perfect ſtate of life, and death, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and paine, ſalvation, or damnation.</p>
            <p>Let us a little conſider what theſe good and evill things are, that ſo we may be able to judge of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>The good things in the Saints, <hi>are faith, hope, love, joy, peace, gentleneſs, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22. 23.</note> 
               <hi>meekneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being the divine nature, or Chriſt in the Saints, <hi>the hope of glory;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note> cannot be capeable of pleaſure or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for they were never loſt: But the poor Creature was loſt, and <hi>Chriſt came to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And by taking the poor creature into the divine nature, or the ſame ſpirit with himſelf, ſaves the loſt creature, and not the good things in the creature.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the evill things in evill men are, <hi>unbeliefe, wrath, hatred,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>mallice, envy, thefts, murders, adulteries, Idolatries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And theſe being the devill in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with whom the creature is made
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119914:96"/>
one in ſin, what pain, or torment, or damnation can befall theſe; when the perſons by whom, and in whom, they were acted, periſh like bruite beaſts and have no reſurrection? <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34. Joh. 6. 57.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as God by taking his own into himſelf; ſaves them ſouls and bodies together with, and in him.</p>
            <p>So the wicked and unbelievers, who <note place="margin">Mat 25. 41.</note> are not in Chriſt, or Chriſt in them, but are one with the devill in ſin; are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 29.</note> ſoules and bodies, condemned to be deſtroyed in, and with the devill, and ſin.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this reſurrection and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is already begun, for the Saints are riſen with Chriſt, and Chriſt is daily raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in himſelf.</p>
            <p>But the perfection and full completion thereofis, and ſhall be when all the Saints are gathered into Chriſt, to make him compleat in eternal glory.</p>
            <p>And ſo likewiſe this Judgement is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun already, the Judge ſits every day, Chriſt is refining, and purifying the ſaints with fire and Fullers ſope, (the power of <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 2, 3.</note> his ſpirit) deſtroying all their luſts, and corruptions, ſubduing their vile bodies, <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> and will at length change them, and make them like his glorious body.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119914:97"/>
And he is alſo daily judging the wicked.</p>
            <p>Firſt in themſelves, convincing them <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 8, 9.</note> of ſinne, and yet hardning them therein.</p>
            <p>And then he is judging them by the Saints, for when they behold the godly, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 1 Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 16.</note> and undefiled converſation of the Saints, they are aſhamed, and condemned in their conſciences, though they hate them for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now though Chriſt be thus judging daily; yet the perfection of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the righteous Judgement of God;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>when he ſhall render to every man according to his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To them who by patient continuing in well doing, ſeek for glory and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity: namely to them who are in Chriſt and are acted, and carried forth by him, to ſet forth his praiſe, and glory to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; to them he will give eternal life, or glorifie them with himſelf in his eternal glory in heaven.</p>
            <p>But to them who are contentious, and <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> do not obey the truth, (which is Chriſt) but obey unrighteouſneſſe, (which is the <note place="margin">9.</note> devill) indignation, and wrath, tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and anguiſh, everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and <hi>go ye</hi>

            <p>Q. <hi>Heaven, and hell are miſteries, and admit of divers acceptations, as Gods right hand, and his left, his love, and his wrath, pleaſure, and paine, ſalvation, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but properly heaven, is where God is, and that is in every man: And hell is where Satan is, and that is in every man. For there is in every man light and darkneſſe, good and evill,</hi> Michael, <hi>and the Dragon: Now as</hi> Michaell <hi>caſts out the Dragon; ſo darkneſs, unbelief, and all ſin ſhall be caſt out of man; Chriſt ſhall make a ſeparation, for all things that are good, as</hi> love, joy, peace, delight, holineſſe, <hi>&amp;c. and God ſhall be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and gathered into one body of unity, and concord, in glory, which is in heaven. And on the contrary, all evill, as</hi> hatred, ſorrow, ſinne, error, death, and darkneſſe, and devils; <hi>ſhall be gathered into one body of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and torment which is hell. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſaid,</hi> Revelation, 21. 8. <hi>That</hi> the fearfull, and unbelieving, and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and murderers, and ſorcerers, and Idolaters, and all liars, ſhall have their part in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death. <hi>Yet thoſe words can have no relation to mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119914:98"/>
for if they have, what will then become of all men? for what man is there, which hath not one or other of theſe ſins in him? but great is the miſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſt in the fleſh, the truth manifeſt in a form, ſo here is a miſtery wrapt up in theſe words; for this evill is not threatned againſt the perſons of any, no not of the moſt wicked, but againſt theſe, and all other particular ſins, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which break through the perſons of men, which being put together, make up a perfection of wickedneſſe: And which as a body of uncleanneſs dwells in men; and this the Apoſtle calls fleſh, and ſin, even in himſelf. And this is that which muſt</hi> be caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone. <hi>The wrath of God ſhall never ceaſe burning up theſe luſts, in this body of ſin and death, untill it hath quite conſumed them. For what other heaven can be intended, or expected; but a glorious u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of all good things into God; or what other hell can be imagined, but a caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of all evill things into Torment, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and darkneſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That heaven and hell are miſteries, and are alſo of various ſignifications, is not denied, for the kingdome of heaven is ſometimes taken for the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 1. and 22.</note> of the Goſpel, and ſometimes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119914:98"/>
for the inward life, and power of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 17 21.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hell is alſo taken ſometimes for the grave, and ſometimes for Satans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in mens hearts; for he is called <hi>the prince of the power of the aire, the spirit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that rules in the hearts of the Children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi> And although heaven and hell be miſteries, yet they are not altogether miſteries. The Scriptures are miſteries, but yet they are miſteries revealed, Chriſt ſpake ſometimes plainly, and ſpake no parable, heaven and hell are miſteries yet miſteries revealed; for there are theſe three things in all miſteries. 1. The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, or litteral narration. 2. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and meaning. And thirdly, the truth, or ſubſtance and reality. And the firſt, and the ſecond of theſe, be meer nothings, without the third. True indeed where God is, there is heaven, for God dwells in glory, which is heaven, and by his glorious appearance in his Saints, he <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1.</note> brings heaven into their hearts. Againe, hell is where Satan is, and that is in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. For he dwels and raignes in them, and hath his kingdome in their hearts; ſometimes he ſteales into the Saints, and troubles them, and diſturbes <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 15.</note> their peace, and cauſes mutinies in the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119914:99"/>
ſoul, but he dwels not there long, for Chriſt and he cannot dwell long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Chriſt caſts him out, and ſuffers him no more to enter, that is not to raigne. <note place="margin">Mar. 9. 25.</note> And that God is not in all men, in his love in Jeſus Chriſt, which is heaven, hath been ſhewed already. But he is onely ſo in his Saints whom he doth not onely act, and order, by outward, and generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> But alſo hath taken them into himſelf, through his Son by his ſpirit; and they are ſo united or made one with himſelf in that eternal ſpirit, that they are thereby carried forth of themſelves to <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> live with him, and in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt makes in them a ſeparation indeed, for he caſts out by degrees the old man, with all his deeds, which is that body of ſin the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of, &amp; which is not wholy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 26.</note> while the Saints abide in the fleſh; and ſo he is gathering all the Saints, which are thoſe good things, for the Saints are himſelf (into God, which is unity in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) bleſſedneſſe, heaven.</p>
            <p>But as for the wicked, Chriſt is not in <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 44.</note> them, nor they in him, nor of him, but of their father the devill. And being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 8.</note> and made one with him in ſinne; ſo they are carried on by him, to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119914:99"/>
live in all ungodlineſſe with him, and ſo muſt needs be in hell: for Satan hath his kingdome in their hearts: hence it is, that out of that bottomleſſe pit proceed <note place="margin">Mark 7. 21, 22.</note> murders, adulteries, &amp;c. and whatſoever is evill, and of the devill.</p>
            <p>And hence it is alſo, that wicked men <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5.</note> are many times tormented with helliſh feares and terrors. And thus wicked men are in hell, when they think themſelves to be in heaven, even in this life.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially, by hell torment, to <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 9.</note> which the wicked are reſerved untill the judgement of the great day, to ſuffer the <note place="margin">Jude 7.</note> vengeance of eternal fire: when all ſin, and all ſinners, and devils, and wicked <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 41</note> ſpirits ſhall be gathered into one body, and confounded, or caſt into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of torment, or lake of fire, which ſhall be kindled with the wrath of God like a river of brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the evill or puniſhment threatened in the 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. cannot relate to mens perſons, becauſe if it ſhould, what would then become of all men, there being not a man that hath not one or other of theſe ſinnes in him,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119914:100"/>
and ſo conclude it to be a myſtery wrapt up in a form of words.</p>
            <p>To which it is anſwered, that the Saints are in Gods eſteem without ſin, for he <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 7. Numb. 23. 21.</note> lookes upon them in Chriſt, and as Chriſt, and ſo he cannot behold iniquity in them.</p>
            <p>Again, the Saints are born of God as to the divine nature in them, and <hi>all that is born of God ſins not, neither can, for the ſeed</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>of God remaines in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to ſay and affirm, that the Saints ſee an end of ſin in them, and that Chriſt hath finiſhed tranſgreſſion in them, and that let them doe what they will they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin; and yet to conclude, that the puniſhments there ſpoken of cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to mens perſons, becauſe the Saints muſt needs be guilty, as having ſin in them; if this be not a myſtery, or rather a contradiction, let all men judge.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Saints, even the beſt of them, are in hell before they be in heaven, for they all paſſe through a ſtate of nature, a kingdome of ſin, where while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unregenerated, they are in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan, <hi>without Chriſt, and without God in the world:</hi> But when God reveales <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2. 3, 12.</note> Chriſt in the ſoul, when they are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and born anew, when Chriſt who is

both light and life appeares, then they are tranſlated out of this kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> and entred into heaven; then they are in the glory of God, for God dwells in glory, and when he hath taken any ſoul into himſelf in the leaſt meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, then that ſoul is in heaven.</p>
            <p>And this is many times but a low and <note place="margin">Mark 8. 23, 24.</note> clouded condition, and great mixtures of light and darkneſſe, day and night, peace and trouble, becauſe they cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing of God, but through a veil, or fleſhly ordinances, and formes of worſhip, and therefore ſee and enjoy him <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9, 10.</note> very imperfectly; and yet they are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this low condition.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt comes forth in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit indeed, and transformes them into his Image of glory, that is when they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend their union with God in Chriſt, and that they partake of the ſame ſpirit, or <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> divine nature with Chriſt, and that God loves them in Chriſt, and as Chriſt, they <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 23.</note> being one with him, and of him.

carnal ordinances; and here they ſee God cleerly, and not in ſhadowes and formes, and enjoy him purely in the ſpirit, without the help of any created thing. Then God is the Saints light, for they are entred into that City which needs not the light of the Sun: <hi>Where all teares are wiped away, where there is no death, neither ſorrow,</hi>
