            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh's</hi> SCEPTICK.</head>
            <p>The <hi>SCEPTICK</hi> doth neither affirm, neither denie any Position: but doubteth of it, and opposeth his Reasons against that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or denied, to justifie his not Consenting.</p>
            <p>HIs first Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth, from the consideration of the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongst living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both in the matter and manner of their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60803:3"/>
and the several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Some living Creatures are by copulation, and some without it, and that either by Fire as Crickets in fornaces; or corrupt water, as Gnats; or slime, as Frogs; or dirt, as Worms; or herbs, as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-worms: some of ashes, as Beetles; some of trees, as the Worms <hi>Psenas</hi> bred in the wild Fig-tree; some of living creatures putrified, as Bees of Bulls, and Wasps of Horses. By Copulation many creatures are brought forth alive, as Man; some in the egg, as Birds; some in an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60803:3"/>
unshapen piece of flesh, as Bears. These great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences cannot but cause a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and contrary tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and qualitie in those creatures, and consequently, a great diversitie in their phantasie and conceit; so that they apprehend one and the same object, yet they must do it after a divers manner; for is it not absurd to affirm, That creatures dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so much in temperature, and yet agree in conceit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one and the same object?</p>
            <p>But this will more plainly appear,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seeing</hi>
               </note> if the instruments of Sence in the body be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for we shall find, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60803:4"/>
as these instruments are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and disposed, so doth the Imagination conceit that which by them is connexed unto it. That very object which seemeth unto us White, unto them which have the Jaundise, seemeth Pale, and Red unto those whose Eyes are bloud-shot. For so much then as living creatures have some white, some pale, some red eyes, why should not one and the same object seem to some white, some red, to some pale? If a man rub his eye, the figure of that which he beholdeth seemeth long, or narrow; is it then not likely, That those creatures which have a long
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60803:4"/>
and slanting Pupil of the eye, as Goats, Foxes, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do convey the fashion of that which they behold under another form to the imagination, than those that have round Pupils do do?</p>
            <p>Who knoweth not, that a Glass presenteth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward object smoother, or greater, according to the making of the glass? If it be hollow, the object seemeth smaller than it is, if the glass be crooked, then the object seemeth long and narrow. And glasses there be, which presenteth the head of him that looketh in them, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, &amp; the heels upwards. Now then, seeing the eye
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60803:5"/>
which is the instrument of Sight, in some living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is more outward, in some more hollow, in some plain, in some greater, in some less; it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Fishes, Men, Lions, and Dogs, whose eyes so much differ, do not conceive the self same object after the same manner, but divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the eye; which offereth it unto the phantasie.</p>
            <p>The same reason holdeth in Touching;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </note> for seemeth it not absurd to think, that those creatures, which are covered with Shels, those which are covered with Scales, those which are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60803:5"/>
covered with Hairs, and those which are Smooth, should all be alike sensible in Touching? and every one of them conveigh the image, or qualitie of the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which they touch, in the very same degree of heat or cold, of driness or moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, roughness or smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>So might it be shewed in Hearing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </note> for how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we think that the Ear, which hath a narrow passage, and the Ear, which hath an open &amp; wide passage, do receive the same sound in the same degree? or that the Ear; whose inside is full of hair, doth hear in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60803:6"/>
same just measure, that the Ear doth whose inside is smooth? Since experience sheweth, that if we stop, or half stop our Ears, the sound cometh not to us in the same manner and degree, that it doth if our ears be open?</p>
            <p>The like may be thought of Smelling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
               </note> for man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self abounding with Fleagm, is otherwise affected in smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than he is, if the parts about the head be full of bloud; and many things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a delightfull smell to some living creatures, which smel to other living creatures seemeth not to be so.</p>
            <p>In the Taste the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son appeareth;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </note> for to a rough
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60803:6"/>
and drie tongue, that very thing seemeth bitter (as in an Ague) which to the moister tongue seemeth not to be so. Divers creatures then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tongues drier, or moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temperatures, when they tast the same thing, must needs conceit it to be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the instrument of their tast is affected, either bitter, or sweet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For even as the hand in the striking of the Harp, though the stroak be one, yet causeth a sound, sometimes high, sometimes base, according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the string that is struck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Even so one and the same outward object is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60803:7"/>
judged of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and divers qualities of the instrument of Sence, which conveieth it to the imagination. Oyntment is pleasing to Man; but Beetles and Bees cannot abide it. Oyl to man is profitable; but it killeth Bees and Wasps. Cicuta feedeth Quails, and Henbane Sows; but both of these hurt Man. If a Man eat Ants he is sick; but the Bear being sick, recovereth by eating them.</p>
            <p>If then one and the very same thing to the red eye seem red, to another pale, and white to another: If one and the same thing, seem
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60803:7"/>
not hot or cold, drie or moist, in the same degree to the several creatures which touch it: If one and the self same sound seem more shrill to that creature which hath a narrow ear, and more base to him that hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ear: If the same thing, at the same time, seem to afford a pleasant and displeasant Smell to divers and several creatures: If that seem bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in tast to one, which to another seemeth sweet, that to one hurtful, which to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemeth healthful, I may report how these things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear divers to several crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and seem to produce divers effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60803:8"/>but what they are in their own nature, whether red or white, bitter or sweet, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or hurtfull, I cannot tell. For why should I presume to profer my conceit and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, in affirming that a thing is thus, or thus, in its own nature, because it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me to be so, before the conceit of other living creatures, who may as well think it to be otherwise in each one nature, because it appeareth otherwise to them than it doth to me?</p>
            <p>They are living creatures as well as I, why then should I condemn their conceit and phantasie, concerning any thing, more than they may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60803:8"/>
mine? They may be in the truth and I in errour, as well as I in truth, and they err. If my conceit must be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before theirs, great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that it be proved to be truer than theirs. And this proof must be either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, or without it; without it none will believe; Certainly, if by demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then this demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must seem to be true, or not seem to be true; if it seem to be true, then will it be a question, whether it be so indeed as it seemeth to be; and to alleadge that for a certain proof, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and questionable, seemeth absurd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60803:9"/>If it be said, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Man judgeth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the outward object, than the imagination of other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures doth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be credited above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (besides that which is already said) this is easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by comparing of Man with other creatures.</p>
            <p>It is confessed, the Dog excelleth Man in smell, and in hearing, and whereas there is said to be a twofold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, one of the mind, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the tongue, and that of the mind is said to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in chusing that which is convenient, and refusing that which is hurtfull in knowledge, justice, &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60803:9"/>
This creature chuseth his food, refuseth the whip, fawneth on his Master, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth his house, revengeth himself of those strangers that hurt him. And <hi>Homer</hi> mentioneth <hi>Argus,</hi> the dog of <hi>Ulisses,</hi> who knew his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster having been from home so many years, that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, all the people of his house had forgot him. This creature, saith <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> is not void of Logick; for when in following any beast, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to three several ways, he smelleth to the one, &amp; then to the second, and if he find that the beast which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth be not fled one of these 2 ways, he presently without
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60803:10"/>
smelling any further to it, taketh the third way, which, saith the same Philosopher, is as if he reasoned thus, the Beast must be gone either this, or this, or the other way; but neither this nor this, <hi>Ergò,</hi> the third: and so away he runneth.</p>
            <p>If we consider his skill in Physick, it is sufficient to help himself; if he be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a dart, he useth the help of his Teeth to take it out, of his Tongue to cleanse the wound from corruption; he seemeth to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Precept of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who saith, that the Rest of the Foot is the Physick of the Foot, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60803:10"/>
therefore if his foot be hurt, he holdeth it up that it may rest; if he be sick, he giveth himself a Vomit by eating of Grass, and recovereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the Dog then we see is plentifully furnished with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward discourse.</p>
            <p>Now outward speech is not needfull to make a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reasonable, else a dumb Man were an unreasonable Creature.</p>
            <p>And do not Philosophers themselves reject this as an ene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ie to knowledge? &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are <hi>Silea</hi> when they are instructed; and yet even as Barbarous ans strange people of speech, but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it not, neither do we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60803:11"/>
perceive any great difference in their words: but a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there seemeth to be, and they do expres their thoughts and meanings one to another by those words. Eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so those creatures, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called unreasonable, do seem to parlie one with another; and by their speech to understand one the other. Do not Birds by one kind of speech call their young ones, and by another cause them to hide themselves? do they not by their several voices express their several passions of joy, of grief, of fear in such manner, that their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows understand them? Do they not by their voice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60803:11"/>
things to come? But we will return to that creature we first did instance in. The Dog delivereth one kind of voice when he hunteth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he howleth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when he is beaten, and another when he is angry. These creatures then are not void of outward speech.</p>
            <p>If then these creatures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Man in sence, &amp; are equal to him inward &amp; outward discourse, why should not their conceits &amp; imaginations conveigh the outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in as true a manner as ours? and if so, then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their imaginations are divers, and they conceit it diversly according to their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60803:12"/>
divers temperaments, I may tell what the outward object seemeth to me; but what it seemeth to other creatures, or whether it be indeed that which it seemeth to me, or any other of them, I know not.</p>
            <p>But be it granted, that the Judgement of Man in this case, is to be preferred before the Judgement of Beasts; yet in Men there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; both in respect of the outward shape, and also of the temperature of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For the bodie of the <hi>Scythian</hi> differeth in shape from the bodie of the <hi>Indian,</hi> the reason of it ariseth (saith the Dogmatiques) from a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60803:12"/>
predominancie of humours in the one more than in the other; and as several hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are predominant, so are the phantasies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits severally framed and effected. So that our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men delight in one thing, the <hi>Indian</hi> not in that, but in another which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not. This would not be, if their conceits and ours were both alike, for then we should like that which they do, and they would dislike that which we would dislike. It is evident also, that men differ very much in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of their bodies, else why should some more easily digest Bief than Shel-fish?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60803:13"/>
and other be mad for the time, if they drink wine? There was an old woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Arbeus,</hi> which drunk three drams of <hi>Cicuta</hi> (every dram weighing sixtie Barley corns, and eight drams to an ounce) without hurt. <hi>Lysis,</hi> without hurt, took four drams of Poppie; and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> which was Gentleman-Sewer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> was very cold whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he stood in the sun, or in a hot bath; but very not when he stood in the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. <hi>Athenagoras</hi> felt no pain if a Scorpion stung him. And the <hi>Psilli</hi> (a people in <hi>Lybia,</hi> whose bodies are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom to serpents) if they be stung by serpents, or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60803:13"/>
Asps, receive no hurt at all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> which inhabit the river <hi>Hydaspis,</hi> do eat serpents and scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without danger. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thericus</hi> a Chyr<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gian, at the smell of a Sturgeon, would be for the time mad. <hi>Andron</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> was so little thirstie, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out want of drink, he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through the hot and drie countrey of <hi>Lybia. Tyberius Cesar,</hi> would see very well in the dark. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> mentioneth of <hi>Thratius,</hi> who said, that the image of a Man went always before him.</p>
            <p>If then it be so, that there
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60803:14"/>
be such differences in Men, this must be by reason of the divers temperatures they have, and divers disposition of their conceit and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, if one hate, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other love the very same thing, it must be that their phantasies differ, else all would love it, or all would hate it. These Men then, may tell how these things seem to them good, or bad; but what they are in their own Nature they cannot tell.</p>
            <p>If we will hearken to mens opinions, concerning one and the same matter, thinking thereby to come to the knowledge of it, we shall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60803:14"/>
find this to be impossible; for, either we must believe what all men say of it, or what some men onely say of it. To believe what all men say of one and the same thing, is not possible; for then we shall believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties; for some men say, That that very thing is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, which other say is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant. If it be said we must believe onely some men, then let it be shewed who those some men are; for the <hi>Platonists</hi> will believe <hi>Plato,</hi> but the <hi>Epicures Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> the <hi>Pythagorians Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorus</hi> and other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the masters of their own Sects: so that it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60803:15"/>
to which of all these we shall give credit. If it be said, that we must credit the greatest number, this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth childish, for there may be amongst other Nations a greater number which denie that very point, which the greatest number with us do affirm: so that hereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can certainly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
            <p>This Argument seemeth to be further confirmed, if the differences of the Sences of <hi>Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Touching,</hi> and <hi>Tasting</hi> be considered; for that the Sences differ, it seemeth plain.</p>
            <p>Painted Tables (in which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60803:15"/>
the art of Slanting is used) appear to the Eye, as if the parts of them were some higher, and some lower than the other, but to the Touch they seem not to be so.</p>
            <p>Honey seemeth to the Tongue sweet, but unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Eye: so Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth recreate the Smell, but it offendeth the Tast. Rain-water is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Eyes, but it hurteth the Lungs. We may tell then, how these things seem to our several sences, but what they are in their own nature we cannot tell: for why should not a man credit any one of his sences as well as the other?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60803:16"/>Every object seemeth to be presented diversly unto the several instruments of Sence. An Apple to the Touch seemeth smooth, sweet to the Smell, and to the Eye yellow; but whether the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have one of these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties onely, or more than these qualities, who can tell? The Organ hath many Pipes, all which are filled with the same blast of wind, varied according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the several Pipes which receive it: even so the qualitie of the Apple may be but one, and that this one qualitie may be varied, and seem yellow to the Eye, to the Touch smooth, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60803:16"/>
sweet to the Smell, by reason of the divers instruments of the Sence, which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this one quality di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly,</p>
            <p>It may be also, that an Apple hath many qualities besides, but we are not able to conceive them all; because we want fit means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to apprehend them: for suppose that some Man is born blind, and deaf, and yet can touch, smell, and tast; this man will not think that there is any thing, which may be seen or heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he wanteth the Sences of hearing and seeing, he will onely think there are those qualities in the object, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60803:17"/>
by reason of his three Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he conceiveth: Even so the Apple may have many more qualities; but we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we want fit instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose.</p>
            <p>If it be replied, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ordained as many instruments of Sence, as there are sencible objects; I demand, What Natures? for there is a confused contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about the very Essence of Nature. Some affirming it to be one thing, others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, few agreeing: so that what the qualitie of an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, or whether it hath one qualitie or many I know not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60803:17"/>Let a man also consider, how many things that are seperated, and by themselves appear to differ from that which they seem to be, when they are in a mass or lump; the scrapings of the Goats horn seems white, but in the horn they seem black, but in the lump white. The stone <hi>Taenarus,</hi> being polished, seemeth white, but unpolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rough, it seemeth yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Sands being seperated, appear rough to the Touch, but a great heap, soft. I may then report, how these things appear, but whether they are so indeed, I know not.</p>

make evident without all contradiction.</p>
               <p>Some natural benefits that a Citie also may have for the excellencie of Art, or work-manship of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial commodities above any other place, either through the qualitie of the Water, or other matter whatsoever, or some hidden mysterie of the inhabitants in working there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be a great help for the enlargement and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a citie.</p>
               <p>The command of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie that affordeth some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per commoditie, is of it self sufficient mightily to bring a Citie to great wealth, and to advance it to great power,

and draweth thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencie and concourse, much advantagious also, as well for the publick weal, as the private person.</p>
               <p>A Citie also may be Lord of much Merchandize and traffick, by means of the commodious scituation to many Nations, to whom it serveth and hath relation to, as Ware-houses, Roomth and Store-houses, by reason whereof, the nations adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do use to resort thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to make their provisions of such things. And this consisteth in the largeness of the Ports, the fitness of the gulphs and creeks of the seas, in the Navigable rivers

and channels, and the plain and safe ways that leadeth to the Citie, or that come, or turn by or near it.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60803:29"/>
hereof, where the Customs are very small.</p>
               <p>By reason whereof, all such as have erected new Cities in times past to draw concourse of people unto it, have granted large immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and priviledges at the least, to the first inhabitants thereof.</p>
               <p>The like have they done that have restored Cities emptied with Plague, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with Wars, or afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Famin or some other scourge of God.

            <p>That the <hi>Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is upheld by the two great pillars thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Civil <hi>Justice,</hi> and Martial <hi>Policie</hi>; which are framed out of <hi>Husbandrie, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> and <hi>Gentrie</hi> of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>THey say, that the goodliest <hi>CEDARS</hi> which grow on the high mountains of <hi>Libanus,</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60803:32"/>
thrust their roots between the clifts of hard Rocks, the better to bear themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the strong storms that blow there. As Nature hath instructed those kings of Trees, so hath Reason taught the Kings of Men, to root themselves in the hardie Hearts of their faithfull Subjects. And as those kings of Trees have large Tops, so have the Kings of Men large Crowns; whereof as the first would soon be broken from their bodies, were they not underborn by many branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; so would the other easily tytter, were they not fasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their heads, with the strong chains of Civil <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60803:32"/>
and Martial <hi>Discipline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For the administration of the first, even God himself hath given direction, <hi>Judges and Officers shalt thou make, which shall judge the People with righteous judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the first Laws of the world and nature, that Force is to be repelled by Force. Yea <hi>Moses</hi> in the 20 of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> and else where, hath delivered us many Laws and Policies of War. But as we have heard of the neglect and abuse in both, so have we heard of the decline and ruine of many Kingdoms and States long before our days: for that Policie hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60803:33"/>
never yet prevailed (though it hath served for a short season) where the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit hath been sold for the natural, and the outward shew and formalitie for the substance. Of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fourth, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that age witness, that he used but the name of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and good order, being more learned in the Law than in doing right, and that he had by far, more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than conscience. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the unjust Magistrate that fancieth to himself a sollid and untrasparable bodie of Gold, every ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wit can vitrifie, and make trasparant pierce, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60803:33"/>
their corruptions; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, because not daring, they cover their knowledge, but in the mean while it is also true, That constrained dissimulation, either in the proud heart, or in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, either in publick estates, or in private persons, where the fear of God is not prevalent, doth in all the leisure of her lurking, but sharpen her teeth, the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie being no less base, than the forced malitious. Thus it fared between the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of <hi>England</hi> and their Kings, between the Lords of <hi>Switzerland</hi> &amp; their people, between the <hi>Sicilians</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> between the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi>

and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Burgoign,</hi> between <hi>Charls</hi> the Ninth and the <hi>French</hi> Protestants, and between <hi>Henry</hi> the third, his successor, and the Lords of <hi>Guise,</hi> and hereof in place of more particulars, the whole world may serve for examples.</p>
            <p>It is a difficult piece of Geographie, to delineate and lay out the bounds of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but it is easie enough to conceive the best use of it, and by which it hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it self in lasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it hath ever acquired more honour by perswading, than by beating; for as the bonds of Reason and Love are immortal, so do all other

chains or cords, both rustie and rot Noble parts of their own Royal and Politick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

                  <salute>Honourable SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Was lately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, by two Gentlemen, my ancient Friends, to acquaint your Honour with some offers of mine, made heretofore for a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Guiana,</hi> who were of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60803:37"/>
opinion, That it would be better understood now, than when it was first propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which advice having sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted my dispair, I have presumed to send unto your Honour the Copies of those Letters which I then wrote, both to his Majestie, and to the Treasurer <hi>Cecill,</hi> wherein as well the reasons that first moved me are remembered, as the objections by him made, are briefly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>What I know of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of that place, not by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, but what mine eyes hath seen, I have said it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but it was then to no end: Because those that had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60803:37"/>
the greatest trust, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to believe it, not because they doubted the Truth, but because they doubted my Disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards themselves; where (if God had blessed me in the enterprise) I had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Majesties favour and good opinion. Other cause than this, or other suspition they never had any. Our late worthy Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was extream curious in searching out the Nature of my offences, The Queens Majestie hath informed her self from the beginning, The King of Denmark at both times of his being here was throughly satisfied of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60803:38"/>
they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise never have moved his Majestie on my behalf.</p>
               <p>The Wife, the Brother, and the Son of a King, do not use to sue for men suspect; but Sir, since they all have done it out of their charitie, and but with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to me alone. Your Honour (whose respect hath onely relation to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties service) strengthened by the example of those Princes, may with the more hardness do the like, being Princes to whom his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties good estate is no less dear, and all men that shall oppugne it, no less hatefull, than to the King himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60803:38"/>It is true Sir, That his Majestie hath sometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That his Councel knew me better than he did; meaning some two or three of them. And it was indeed my infelicitie; for had his Majestie known me, I had never been here where I now am: or had I known his Majestie, they had never been so long there where they now are. His Majestie not knowing of me hath been my ruin, and his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties misknowing of them, hath been the ruin of a goodly part of his estate: but they are all of them now, some living and some dying, come to his Majesties know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60803:39"/>
But Sir, how little soever his Majestie knew me, and how much soever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them, yet have I been bound to his Majestie both for my Life, and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, of which, but for his Majestie, nor Life, nor ought else had remained. In this respect Sir, I am bound to yield up the same life, and all I have for his Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; to die for the King, and not by the King, is all the ambition I have in the world.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS I have not hitherto given you any Account of our proceedings and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages towards the <hi>Indies,</hi> so have I no other subject to write of, than of the greatest misfortunes that ever befel any man: for whereas, for the first, All those that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate between <hi>Cape de Verd</hi> &amp; <hi>America,</hi> to pass between fifteen or twentie days at most, we found the wind so contrary, and which are also contrary to nature, so many storms and rains, as we spent six weeks in the passage, by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60803:43"/>
reason whereof, and that in so great heat we wanted wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for at the Isle <hi>Prano</hi> of <hi>Cape de verd,</hi> we lost our Anchors and Cables, and our water Casks, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the Island with a <hi>Hurlicano,</hi> and were like all to have perished. Great sickness fell amongst us, and carried away great numbers of our ablest men both for sea and land. The 17 of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> we had sight of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> and soon after came to Anchor in five degrees at the River <hi>Galliano,</hi> here we staid till the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> landed our sick men, set up the Barges and Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops, which were brought out
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60803:43"/>
of <hi>England</hi> in quarters, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Ships, and took in fresh water, being fed and cherished by the <hi>Indians</hi> of my old acquaintance, with a great deal of love &amp; respect, my self being in the hands of death these 6 weeks, &amp; was not able otherwise to move than as I was carried in a chair, gave order to 5 small Ships, to sail into <hi>Orinoque,</hi> having Captain <hi>Kemis</hi> for their Conductor towards the Mynes, and in those five Ships five Companies of 50 under the command of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Parker,</hi> and Captain <hi>North,</hi> brethren to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> and the Lord <hi>North,</hi> valiant Gentlemen,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60803:44"/>
and of infinite patience for the labour, hunger, and heat which they have endured, my son had the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Captain <hi>Thornix</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> the fourth Company, Captain <hi>Chidley,</hi> by his Lieutenant, the fifth: but as my Sergeant Major Captain <hi>Piggot</hi> of the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> died in the former miserable passage, so my Lieuetenant Sir <hi>Warham</hi> S. <hi>Leiger</hi> lay sick without hope of life, and the charge conferred on my Nephew <hi>George Raleigh,</hi> who had also served long with infinite commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but by reason of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and of Sir <hi>Warhams</hi> was not so well obeyed as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60803:44"/>
the Enterprize required. As they passed up the River, the Spaniard began the War, and shot at us both with their Ordinance &amp; Muskets, whereupon the Companies were forced to charge them, and soon after beat them out of the Town. In the assault, my son (more desirous of honour than safetie) was slain, with whom (to say truth) all the respects of this world have taken end in me. And although these five Captains had as weak Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies as ever followed vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Leaders, yet were there amongst them some twentie or thirtie valiant adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gentlemen, and of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60803:45"/>
courage, as of my sons Company, <hi>Mr. Knivet, Mr. Hammon, Mr. Langworth, Mr. Iohn Pleasington</hi>; his Officers, <hi>Sir Iohn Hamden, Mr. Symon Leak</hi> Corporal of the Field, <hi>Mr. Hammon</hi> the elder Brother, <hi>Mr. Nicholas</hi> of <hi>Buckingham, Mr. Roberts</hi> of <hi>Kent, Mr. Perin, Mr. Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham, Mr. Mullinax, Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his brother, <hi>Mr. Wray, Mr. Miles Herbart, Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hall,</hi> &amp; others.</p>
               <p>Sir, I have set down the names of these Gentlemen, to the end, that if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie shall have cause to use their service, it may please you to take notice of them for very sufficient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60803:45"/>
The other five Ships staid at <hi>Trinidado,</hi> having no other Port capable for them near <hi>Guiana.</hi> The second Ship was commanded by my Vice-Admiral Capt. <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> of whom (to do him right) he is one of the sufficientest Gentlemen for the Sea that <hi>England</hi> hath. The third by <hi>Sir Warham</hi> S. <hi>Leiger,</hi> an exceeding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant &amp; worthy Gentleman. The fourth by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn Fern.</hi> The fifth by Captain <hi>Chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> of <hi>Devon.</hi> With these five Ships I daily attended their Armando of <hi>Spain,</hi> which had they set upon us, our force divided, the one half in <hi>Orinoque,</hi> an hundred
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60803:46"/>
and fiftie miles from us, we had not onely been torn in pieces, but all those in the River had also perished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no force at all for the Sea-fight; for we had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have been burnt by their sides, had the Armando arrived: but belike, they staid for us at <hi>Margarita,</hi> by which they knew we must pass to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Indies:</hi> for it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Majestie to value us at so little, as to command me upon my Alleageance, to set down under my hand the Countrey, and the River by which I was to enter it, to set down the number of my men, and burthen of my Ships, and what Ordinance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60803:46"/>
every Ship carried, which being known to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, and by him to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a dispatch was made, and letters sent from <hi>Madrid,</hi> before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the <hi>Thames</hi>; for his first letter sent by a Barque of Advise, was dated the 19 of <hi>March</hi> 1617. at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which letter I have here inclosed sent to your Honour, the rest I reserve, not knowing whether they may be intercepted or not. The second by the King, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the second of <hi>May,</hi> sent also by a Coronel of <hi>Diego de Polonieque,</hi> Governour of <hi>Guiana, Elderedo,</hi> and <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dado.</hi> The third by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60803:47"/>
of <hi>Porericho,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Polonieque</hi> the 15 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at <hi>Trinidado.</hi> And the fourth was sent from the Farmer and Secretarie of his Customs in the <hi>Indies.</hi> At the same time, by that of the Kings hand, sent by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, there was also a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the speedie levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three hundred souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ten pieces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be sent from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricho,</hi> for the defence of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> an hundred and fiftie from <hi>Nuevo Remo de Grando,</hi> under the command of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Anthony Musica,</hi> and the other hundred and fiftie from <hi>Portricho,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by C. <hi>Franc. Laudio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60803:47"/>Now Sir, if all that have traded to the <hi>Indies</hi> since his Majesties time knew that the Spaniards have flayed alive all the poor men which they have taken, being but Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men, what death and cruel torment shall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect if they conquer us? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they have hitherto failed grosly, being set out thence as we were, both for number, time, and place.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to make an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for not working the Myne, (although I know his Majestie expects) whom I am to satisfie so much, as my self, having lost my son, and my estate in the Enterprise, yet it is true, that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60803:48"/>
took more care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the passage leading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, than they did the Town, which by the Kings instructions they might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, the Countreys being <hi>Aspera &amp; Nemosa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is true, that when Capt. <hi>Kemish</hi> found the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver low, and that he could not approch the Banks in most places near the Myne by a Mile, and where he found a discent, a volley of Muskets came from the woods upon the Boat, and slew two Rowers, and hurt six others, and shot a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Gentleman of Captain <hi>Thornix,</hi> of which wound he languisheth to this day. He,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60803:48"/>
to wit, <hi>Kemish,</hi> following his own advice, thought that it was in vain to discover the Myne; for he gave me this for an excuse at his return, that the Companies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in the Town of S. <hi>Thome</hi> were not able to defend it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the daily and nightly assaults of the Spaniards, that the passages to the Mynes, were thick and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable woods, and that the Myne being discovered, they had no men to work it, did not discover it at all: for it is true, the Spaniards having two gold Mynes near the Town, the one possessed by <hi>Pedro Rodrigo de Paran,</hi> the second by <hi>Harmian Frotinio,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60803:49"/>
the third of silver, by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Francisco,</hi> for the want of <hi>Negroes</hi> to work them: for as the <hi>Indians</hi> cannot be constrained by a Law of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, so the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> will not, nor can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the labour of those Mynes, whatsoever the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadochio, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador saith. I shall prove under the Proprietors hand, by the Custom-Book, and the Kings Quinto, of which I recovered an Ingot or two: I shall also make it appear to any Prince or State that will undertake it, how easily those Mynes, and five or six more of them may be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and the most of them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60803:49"/>
in those parts, which never have as yet been attempted by any, nor by any passage to them, nor ever discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the English, French, or Dutch. But at <hi>Kemish</hi> his return from <hi>Orinoque,</hi> when I rejected his counsel and his course, and told him that he had undone me, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my credit with the King past recoverie, he slew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for I told him, that seeing my son was slain, I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not if I had lost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more in opening of the Myne, so my credit had been saved: for I protest before God, had not Capt. <hi>Whitney</hi> (to whom I gave more countenance than to all the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60803:50"/>
Captains of my Fleet) run from me at the <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and carried another ship with him of Captain <hi>Wolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons.</hi> I would have left my body at S. <hi>Thomes</hi> by my sons, or have brought with me out of that or other Mynes, so much Gold-oar, as should have satisfied the King. I propounded no vain thing; what shall become of me I know not, I am unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in <hi>England,</hi> and my poor estate consumed, and whether any Prince will give me bread or no I know not. I desire your Honour to hold me in your good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to remember my service to my Lord of <hi>Arrundel</hi> and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60803:50"/>
                  <hi>Pembrook,</hi> to take some pitie on my pour Wife, to whom I dare not write for renewing her sorrow for her son; and beseech you to give a copie of this to my Lord <hi>Carew</hi>: for to a broken mind, a sick bodie, and weak eyes, it is a torment to write many Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I have found many things of importance for discovering the state and weakness of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which if I live, I shall hereafter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto your Honour, to whom I shall remain a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servant.</p>

               <p>I Was loath to write, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know not how to comfort you, and God knows, I never knew what sorrow meant till now. All that I can say to you is, that you must obey the will and providence of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Queens Majestie bare the loss of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> with a magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous heart, and the Ladie <hi>Harrington</hi> of her son. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your heart (dearest <hi>Bess</hi>) I shall sorrow for us both, I shall sorrow the less, because
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60803:51"/>
I have not long to sorrow, because not long to live. I refer you to Mr. Secretarie <hi>Winwoods</hi> Letter, who will give you a copie of it, if you send for it, therein you shall know what hath passed; I have written that Letter, for my brains are broken, and it is a torment for me to write, and especially of misery. I have desired Mr. Secretarie to give my Lord <hi>Carew</hi> a copie of his Letter. I have clensed my ship of sick men, and sent them home; I hope God will send us somewhat before we return. You shall hear from me if, I live, from the New-found land, where I mean to make clean
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60803:52"/>
my ships and revictual; for I have Tobacco enough to pay for it. The Lord bless and comfort you, that you may bear patiently the death of your valliant son.</p>

                  <p>I Protest before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of God, That as Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> died heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken when they failed of their enterprise, I could will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly do the like, did I not contend against sorrow for your sake, in hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide somewhat for you and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60803:52"/>
to comfort and releive you. If I live to return, resolve your self that it is the care for you that hath strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my heart. It is true that <hi>Kemish</hi> might have gone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Myne, &amp; meant it, but after my sons death, he made them beleive he knew not the way, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused himself upon want of water in the River, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting many impediments left it unfound. When he came back, I told him he had undone me, and that my credit was lost for ever; he answered. That when my son was lost, and that he left me so weak, that he resolved not to find me alive, he had
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60803:53"/>
no reason to enrich a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Rascals, who after my sons death made no account of him. He further told me that the English sent up into <hi>Guiana,</hi> could hardly defend the Spanish town of S. <hi>Thome</hi> which they had taken, and therefore for them to pass through thick woods it was impossible, and more impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to have victual brought them into the Mountains. And it is true, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Diego Polenego,</hi> and other four Captains being slain, whereof <hi>Wats</hi> slew one, <hi>Plessington, Wats</hi> servant, and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Moroccoes,</hi> one of his men, slew other two. I say five of them slain in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60803:53"/>
of the Town, the rest went off in a whole bodie, and took more care to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the passages to their Mynes (of which they had three within a League of the Town, besides a Myne that was about five miles off) than they did of the Town it self. Yet <hi>Kemish</hi> at the first was resolved to go to the Myne; but when he came to the banck side to Land, and had two of his men slain outright from the bank, and six other hurt, and Captain <hi>Thornix</hi> shot in the head, of which wound, and the accident thereof, he hath pined away these twelve weeks.</p>
                  <p>Now when <hi>Kemish</hi> came
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60803:54"/>
back and gave me the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reasons which moved him not to open the Myne, the one the death of my son, a second the weakness of the English, and their impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to work and to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualled; a third that it were a follie to discover it for the Spaniards; and lastly my weakness and being unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; and that I rejected all these his Arguments, and told him, that I must leave him to himself to resolve it to the King and State, he shut up himself into his Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, and shot himself with a pocket Pistol which broke one of his ribs, and finding that he had not prevailed, he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60803:54"/>
thrust a long Knife under his short ribs up to the handle and died. Thus much I have written to M. Secretarie, to whose Letters I refer you to know the truth. I did after the sealing break open the Letter again, to let you know in brief the state of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. which I pray you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to my Lord of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> and <hi>Silvanus Scory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the rest, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poor man so exposed to slaughter as I was; for being commanded upon mine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance to set down not onely the Countrey but the very River by which I was to enter it, to name my
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60803:55"/>
Ships number, men, and my Artillerie. This now was sent by the Spanish Ambassador to his Master the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King wrote his Letters to all parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> especially to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <hi>Palamago</hi> of <hi>Guia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Elderado,</hi> and <hi>Trinidado,</hi> of which the first Letter bore date 19 of <hi>March</hi> 1617, at <hi>Madrill,</hi> when I had not yet left the Thames, which Letter I have sent to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie. I have also other Letters of the Kings which I reserve, and one of the Councels. The King also sent a Commission to leavie three hundred souldiers out of his Garrisons of <hi>unie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gno
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60803:55"/>
de Granado è Portricho,</hi> with ten pieces of brass Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to entertain us; he also prepared an Army by sea to set upon us. It were too long to tell you how we were preserved, if I live I shall make it known; my brains are broken, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not write much, I live yet, and I told you why. <hi>Witney</hi> for whom I sold all my Plate my <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and to whom I gave more credit and countenance than to all the Captains of my Fleet, ran from me at the <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> and <hi>Wolleston</hi> with him, so as I have now but five Ships, and out of those I have sent some into my Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60803:56"/>
a rabble of idle Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scals, which I know will not spare to wound me, but I care not. I am sure there is never a base slave in all the Fleet hath taken the pain and care that I have done, that have slept so little, and travelled so much, my friends will not believe them, and for the rest I care not; God in heaven bless you and strengthen your heart.</p>

               <p>SInce the death of <hi>Kemish,</hi> it is confessed by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Major, and others of his inward friends, that he told them, that he could have brought them unto the Myne within two hours March from the River side; but because my son was slain, my self unpardoned, and not like to live, he had no reason to open the Myne either for the Spaniard or for the King; they answered, that the King (though I were not pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) had granted my heart
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60803:57"/>
under the Great Seal. He replyed, that the grant to me was to no man, <hi>non Ens</hi> in the Law, and therefore of no force; this discourse they had, which I knew not of till after his death: but when I was resolved to write unto your Honour, he prayed me to joyn with him in excusing his not going to the Myne, I answered him I would not do it; but if my self could satisfie the King and State, that he had reason not to open it, I should be glad of it: but for my part, I must avow that he knew it, and that he might with loss have done it; other excuses I would not frame: he told me
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60803:57"/>
that he would wait on me presently, and give me better satisfaction: but I was no sooner come from him into my Cabbin, but I heard a Pistol go over my head, and sending to know who shot it, word was brought me that <hi>Kemish</hi> shot it out of his Cabbin window to cleanse it; his boy going into his Cabbin, found him lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his bed with much bloud by him, and looking in his face saw him dead; the Pistol being but little, did but crack his rib, but turning him over found a long Knife in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, all but the handle.

               <head>Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his <hi>Wife,</hi> after his Condemnation.</head>
               <p>YOu shall receive (my dear Wife) my Last words in these my Last lines; my love I send you, that you may keep when I am dead, &amp; my counsel, that you may remember it when I am no more. I would not with my will present you sorrows (dear <hi>Bess</hi>) let them go to the grave with me, and be buried in the dust. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is not the will of God that I shall see you any more, bear my destruction patiently, and with an heart like your self.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:60803:62"/>First I send you all the thanks which my heart can conceive, or my words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, for your many travels and cares for me, which though they have not taken effect as you wished, yet my debt to you is not the less; but pay it I never shall in this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I beseech you, for the love you bare me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that you do not hide your self many days, but by your travels seek to help the miserable Fortunes, and the Right of your poor Child, your mourning cannot avail me that am but dust.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that my Lands were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60803:62"/>
conveyed (<hi>bona side</hi>) to my Child, the writings were drawn at Midsummer was twelve moneths, as divers can witness, and I trust my bloud will quench their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice who desired my slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that they will not seek also to kill you and yours with extream povertie. To what friend to direct you I know not, for all mine have left me in the true time of triall. Most sorrie am I, that being thus surprised by death, I can leave you no better Estate, God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all my determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that great God which worketh all in all, and if you can live free from want, care
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60803:63"/>
for no more, for the rest is but a vanitie; Love God, and begin betimes, in him you shall find true, everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and endless comfort, when you have travelled and wearied your self with all sorts of worldly cogitations, you shall sit down by sorrow in the end. Teach your son also to serve and fear God whilest he is young, that the fear of God may grow up in him; then will God be an Husband to you, and a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, an Husband and a Father, that can never be taken from you.</p>

                  <hi>Baylie</hi> oweth me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, and <hi>Aryan</hi> six hundred; in <hi>Jernesey</hi> also I
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60803:63"/>
have much owing me. (Dear wife) I beseech you, for my Souls sake, pay all poor men. When I am dead, no doubt you shall be much sought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for the world thinks I was very rich; have a care to the fair pretences of men, for no greater miserie can be fall you in this life, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey unto the world, and after to be despised. I speak (God knows) not to disswade you from Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for it will be best for you, both in respect of God and the world. As for me, I am no more yours, nor you mine, death hath cut us asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp; God hath divided me from the world, &amp; you from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60803:64"/>
me. Remember your poor Child for his Fathers sake, who loved you in his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est estate. I sued for my life, but (God knows) it was for you and yours that I desired it: for, know it, (my dear Wife) your Child is the Child of a true man, who in his own respect despiseth Death and his misshapen &amp; ugly forms. I cannot write much, (God knows) how hardly I steal this time when all sleep, and it is also time for me to seperate my thoughts from the world. Beg my dead bodie, which living was denied you, and either lay it in <hi>Sherborn</hi> or in <hi>Exeter</hi> Church by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60803:64"/>
and mother. I can say no more, Time and Death calleth me away. The ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God, powerfull, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and inscrutable God Almightie, who is goodness it self, the true Light and Life, keep you and yours, and have mercy upon me, and forgive my Persecutors and false accusers, and send us to meet in his glorious kingdom. My dear Wife farewel, Bless my Boy, Pray for me, and let my true God hold you both in his Arms.</p>

                  <salute>Most excellent Prince,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IF the Ship your Highness intends to build, be bigger than the <hi>Victorie,</hi> then her beams, which are laid over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart from side to side will not serve again, and many other of her timbers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stuff, will not serve, whereas if she be a size less, the timber of the old Ship will serve well to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new.</p>
               <p>If she be bigger she will be of less use, go very deep to water, and of mightie charge, our Channels decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60803:65"/>
every year, less nimble, less mannyable, and seldom to be used <hi>Grande Navio, grande fatica,</hi> saith the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</p>
               <p>A Ship of six hundred Tuns, will carrie as good Ordinance as a Ship of twelve hundred Tuns, and where the greater hath dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her Ordinance, the less will turn her broad side twice, before the great Ship can wind once, and so no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in that over-plus of Guns. The lesser will go over clear where the greater shall stick and perish; the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser will come and go, leave or take, and is yare, whereas the greater is flow, unmany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60803:66"/>
and ever full of encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>In a well conditioned Ship, these things are chiefly required.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That she be strong built.</item>
                  <item>2. Swift it sail.</item>
                  <item>3. Stout-sided.</item>
                  <item>4. That her Ports be so laid, as that she may carry out her Guns all weathers.</item>
                  <item>5. That she hull and trie well.</item>
                  <item>6. That she stay well, when boarding, or turning on a wind is required.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To make her strong, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the care and truth of the work-man; to make her swift, is to give her a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60803:66"/>
large Run, or way forward, and so aftward, done by art and just proportion, and that in laying out of her bowes before, and quarters behind, the Ship-wright be sure, that she neither sink nor hang in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, but lie clear and above it, wherein Ship-wrights do often fail, and then is the speed in sailing utterly spoiled.</p>
               <p>That she be stout-sided, the same is provided by a long bearing floar, and by sharing off from above wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the lower edge of the Ports, which done, then will she carry out her Ordinance all weathers.</p>
               <p>To make her to hull and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60803:67"/>
to trie well, which is called a good sea-Ship, there are two things principally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the one that she have a good draught of water, the other that she be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: And this is seldom done in the Kings Ships, and therefore we are forced to lye, or trie in them with our main Course and mizen, which with a deep keel and standing streak, she would perform.</p>
               <p>The extream length of a Ship makes her unapt to stay, especially if she be floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and want sharpness of way forward. And it is most true, that such over-long Ships, are fitter for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60803:67"/>
Seas in summer, than for the Ocean, or long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and therefore an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot by the Keel, and thirtie five foot broad is a good proportion for a great Ship.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that all Ships sharp before, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long floar, will fall rough into the sea from a billow, and take in water over head and ears; and the same qualitie have all nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-quartered ships to sink after the tail. The high Cargeing of ships, is that that brings many ill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it makes them extream Lee-ward, makes them sink deep into the seas, makes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60803:68"/>
them labour sore in foul weather, and oft-times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set. Safetie is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected than shews, or nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for ease; in sea-journeys both cannot well stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and therefore the most necessarie is to be chosen.</p>
               <p>Two Decks and an half is enough, and no building at all above that, but a low Masters Cabbin, Our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Mariners will say, that the ships will bear more well enough; and true it is, if none but ordinarie Mariners served in them. But men of better sort, unused to such a life, cannot so well endure the rowling and tumbling from side to side, where the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60803:68"/>
seas are never so little grown, which comes by high Cargeing. Besides those high Cabbin-works aloft, are very dangerous in fight, to tear men with their splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Above all other things, have care that the great Guns be four foot clear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove water when all lading is in, or else these best pieces are idle at sea; for if the Ports lie lower, and be open, it is dangerous; and by that default was a goodly Ship, and many gallant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lost, in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eigth, before the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in a Ship called by the name of <hi>Mary-Rose.</hi>

            <head>Sir <hi>WALTER RALEIGH'S</hi> SPEECH Immediately before he was beheaded.</head>
            <p>UPon <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iudes</hi> day, the Lieuetenant of the Tower had a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to bring his Prisoner to the Kings-Bench in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall,</hi> where the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General demanded Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, according to the Judgement pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him at <hi>Winchester,</hi> the Lord Chief Justice caused the Indictment, Verdict, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60803:72"/>
Judgement to be read, and after asked him, what he could say, Why he should not die according to the Law; his answer was, That this fifteen years he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the meer mercy of the King, and did now won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how his Mercy was turned into Justice, he not knowing any thing wherein he had provoked his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties displeasure, and did hope, that he was clear from that Judgement by the Kings Commission in making him General of the Voyage to <hi>Guiana,</hi> for (as he conceived) the words, <hi>To his trustie and welbeloved subject,</hi> &amp;c. Did in themselves imply a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60803:72"/>
But Master Attorney told him, these words were not sufficient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Whereupon he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the opinion of the Court, to which the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice replied, it was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in Law.</p>
            <p>Then began Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to make a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the events and ends of his Voyage, but he was interrupted by the Chief Justice, who told him, that it was not for any offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there, but for his first fact that he was now called in question, and thereupon told him, That seeing he must prepare to die, he would not add affliction to afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60803:73"/>
nor aggravate his fault, knowing him to be a man full of miserie; but with the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster oyl and wine for the comfort of his distressed Soul. You have been a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, &amp; a great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, imitate therefore that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captain, who thrusting himself into the middest of a Battel, cried aloud, <hi>Mors me Expectat, &amp; ego Mortem Expectabo,</hi> as you should not contemn so to do, nor should you fear death, the one sheweth too much boldness, the other no less cowardize, so with some other few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions the Court arose, and Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60803:73"/>
into the hands of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conveyed him to the Gate-house in <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon Thursday morning this Couragious, although Committed Knight, was brought before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-house, where there was a Scaffold erected for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading, yet it was doubted over-night that he should be hanged, but it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. He had no sooner mounted the scaffold, but with a chearfull Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and undaunted Look, he saluted the Companie. His Attire was a wrought Night-cap, a Ruff band, a hair-coloured Sattin Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60803:74"/>
with a black wrought Waste-coat under it, a pair of black cut Taffety Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, a pair of ash-coloured Silk Stockings, &amp; a wrought black Velvet Night-gown; putting off his Hat, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Speech to the Lords present, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>My honourable Lords, and the rest of my good friends that come to see me die, Know, that I much rejoyce that it hath pleased God to bring me from darkness to light, and in freeing me from the Tower, wherein I might have died in disgrace, by letting me live to come to this place, where though I lose my life, yet I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60803:74"/>
shall clear some false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unjustly laid to my charge, and leave behind me a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a true heart, both to my King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Two things <hi>Sir W. Raleigh</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of.</note>Two things there are which have exceedingly possest and provoked his Majesties indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against me, <hi>viz.</hi> A Confederacie, or Combination with <hi>France,</hi> and disloyal and disobedient words of my Prince. For the first, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie had some cause, though grounded upon a weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to suspect mine inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>French</hi> faction, for not long before my departure from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Agent took occasion, passing by my house, to visit me, had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60803:75"/>
some conference, during the time of his abode, onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my voyage, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, I take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Another suspition is had of me, because I did labour to make an escape from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> to <hi>France</hi>; I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but that willingly, when I heard a rumour, That there was no hope of my life, upon my return to <hi>London,</hi> I would have escaped for the fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of my Life, and not for any ill intent or conspiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the State.</p>
            <p>The like reason of suspition arose, in that I perswaded Sir <hi>Lewis Steukly,</hi> my Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, to flee with me from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60803:75"/>
               <hi>London</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> but my Answer to this is, as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That onely for my safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and nought else, was my intent, as I shall answer before the Almightie.</p>
            <p>It is alleadged, That I feigned my self sick, and by art made my bodie full of bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters when I was at <hi>Salisbury.</hi> True it is, I did so; the reason was, because I hoped thereby to defer my coming before the King and Councel, and so by delaying, might have gained time to have got my Pardon. I have an Example out of Scripture for my warrant, that in case of necessitie, and for the safeguard of life, <hi>David</hi> feigned himself foolish and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60803:76"/>
mad, yet was it not imputed to him for sin.</p>
            <p>Concerning the second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation laid to my charge, that I should speak scandalous and reprochfull words of my Prince, there is no witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me but onely one, and he a Chimical <hi>French</hi>-man, whom I entertained, rather for his Jests than his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: this man to incroach himself into the favour of the Lords, and gaping after some great reward, hath falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused me of Seditious speeches against his Majestie; against whom, if I did either speak, or think a thought hurtfull or prejudicial, the Lord blot me out of the book of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:60803:76"/>It is not a time to flatter or fear Princes, for I am a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to none but Death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a charitable conceit of me. That I know to swear is an offence, to swear falsly at any time is a great sin, but to swear false before the presence of Almightie God, before whom I am forthwith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, were an offence unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable; therefore think me not now rashly, or untruly to confirm, or protest any thing.</p>
            <p>As for other objections, in that I was brought perforce into <hi>England,</hi> that I carried sixteen thousand pounds in money out of <hi>England</hi> with me, more than I made known; that I should receive Letters
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60803:77"/>
from the <hi>French</hi> King, and such like, with many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations he utterly denied.</p>
