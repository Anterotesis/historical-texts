         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

should more particularly dedicate
this my hoped Consolation, (right
Honourable able and right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,)
the Lord in his wisedome
and mercie (I trust) directed me
vnto your selues, as those whom it doth in a peculiar
manner concerne. That like as he hath appointed you
<pb facs="tcp:6904:3"/>
to these places, so ye may euer haue before your eies, the
speciall ends for which he hath assigned them to your
trust, &amp; for which you must be answerable to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Maiesty. The first and chiefe whereof (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue)
is this, That his pure religion, honour, and true
worship, may be set vp, and aduaunced in them;
the next, that the wealth and sauing of all his poore
people in those places, both of their soules and bodies,
may be by you procured, so farre as in your power
shall lie. And these things to be effected principally,
by a learned, holie, and faithfull Ministerie, protected
and assisted by a godlie Magistracie, and by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and spreading all good learning and knowledge
amongst them. To this purpose God hauing ordained
schooles of learning to be a principall meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a barbarous people to ciuilitie, and thereby to
prepare them the better to receiue the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Iesus Christ; as also for the breeding and
nourishing of such a holie Ministerie, with a wife and
godlie Magistracie, and people to be perpetuallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued;
your care as I take it, in the next place (that
I may speak with all reuerence and submission) ought
to be for prouision of meete schooles and Seminaries
for them, according to the natures and conditions of
the places, and as God shall raise vp meanes thereto.
And for those which are alreadie so prouided and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
<pb facs="tcp:6904:3"/>
that the best orders may be knowne and
receiued, for the speediest aduancement of the best
learning in them, and for accomplishing all the good
thereby desired; and withall for supply of what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
helpes Gods goodnes shall vouchsafe, for bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and nourishing, and also preseruing all true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and grace amongst them.</p>
            <p>The benefit therefore and comfort of such small
mites, as his heauenlie bountie hath vouchsafed me,
which may be helpefull hereunto, I do most thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and cheerefully, as from his goodnesse, tender
vnto you to this end; And more specially to you, right
Honour able and right Worshipfull the Gouernour,
Councell and Companie for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and of the
<hi>Sommer Ilands;</hi> that planting in a right order,
beginning with the Lord, and the carefull planting
and watering of his sacred Religion, you may finde
a more happie growth, and increase, and euermore
sound and lasting ioy to your owne soules. First, the
mite of my Schoole-labours trauelled in, now manie
yeares for all inferiour and ruder places, whereunto
what blessing his heauenlie bountie hath giuen, I
leaue to the iudgement of all true harted wel-willers
vnto good learning. Secondly, I desire to commend
vnto you, for them, and that vpon vndoubted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
the helpe, and benefit of another poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb facs="tcp:6904:4"/>
which he of his goodnes hath likewise granted
vnto me, namelie of a little Treatise called, <hi>The true

the witnesse of sundrie godlie learned, (of whom I
haue for manie yeares intreated the examining; and
censuring of it, after the publique authorizing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)

And vnto the same adioyned the <hi>Rule of true

wherein I haue followed, (so neare as I haue beene
able) the perfect patterne of our blessed Sauiour:
which two so conioyned, may be for directing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
euerie soule (which hath grace to vse them,
and to put them so in practise) as their Sea-card and
Compasse, to keepe them in the right course to their
intended Point; that they may not be carried ouer
farre, nor fall too short of their desired hauen; Yea
to performe that for them, which neither Card nor

            <p>And finally, what straits or miseries soeuer they
shall come into, either by Sea or land; that but onely
crying vnto the Lord, they may be graciously heard;
and mercifully deliuered in due time, according to that
which shalbe most for the glorie of his Maiestie
and their owne saluation, with the good of his people.</p>
            <p>Though the dedication and patronage of my
Schoole-labours belong vnto our most hopefull and
illustrious Prince, and so in like maner of my <hi>Watch</hi>
vnto most Honourable personages (to whom I am
euer bound) yet I know that the tender of the assured
benefit thereof, after so long triall in the right vse
and practise of them, euen vnto your Honours and
Worships, for these poore soules, and for your more
happie execution of your charge, will be most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

Yea (giue me leaue to speake iointlie and freelie, yet
in all humble duty vnto you all before mentioned, both
right Honourable and right Worshipfull) euen yee
are they to whom the charge of these poore Countries
and places are committed in speciall manner, and the
prouiding for them. If therefore you should not vse
all holie meanes for the honour of our God, with the
<pb facs="tcp:6904:5"/>
sauing and preseruing of all those soules, and their
posteritie, and gaining the verie sauage amongst
them vnto Iesus Christ, whether <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi>
but onelie respect your owne ends and proiects, you
could neuer stand before his heauenlie Maiestie, to
answere his Highnesse for it; especiallie, if hee most
graciouslie offering you helpes thereto, you should not
embrace them accordinglie, and to your vtmost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
see them put in execution. You cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the wofull estate of all sorts, so long as they
remaine in ignorance and blindnesse, without the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, and much
more of all such, as haue bene nourished long in feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
superstition and Idolatrie: and aboue all other,
those who haue bene bred in a manifest, and most
palpable, and euen a visible adoring of Sathan; nor,

vengeance to all who know not God, and
which obey not his heauenly Gospell.</hi> Who
must then be punished with euerlasting perdition,
when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to
be made maruellous in all them that beleeue. Oh set
before your faces the miserable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and so the danger of all liuing in blindnesse, whilst
they so remaine. If we beleeue the word of the Lord,

that may concerne your owne blessed estate and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
and your ioyfull appearing before the high
Tribunall of our Lord and Sauiour, and then there
will be no more need to mooue you therein, nor anie
other whom the charge of soules concernes, who shall
consider hereof aright, to do your vtmost endeuour
for their saluation. There will be no more need to call
on you to see the gospel of Christ planted among them,
or to prouide them of faithfull Ministers, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
by all possible meanes all other helps, or that, that
which hath bene most charitablie giuen, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
collected to these ends, may be rightlie employed,
and whatsoeuer else the Lord shall hereafter affoord
for their benefit, chieflie to bring them into and keep
them in this narrow path. Wofull is the case of all
those, amongst whom Sathan reignes, and who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him instead of Christ, as all such do, who know
him not, and much more those poore <hi>Indians,</hi> among
whom he (as is reported) is visibly adored &amp; sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
vnto, as their God. Maruell not if honest and
vnderstanding Christians be so hardly drawne ouer
<pb facs="tcp:6904:6"/>
to these places, as namely into <hi>Virginia,</hi> or so much
as to perswade their friends to such a voyage, when
as there are in the same so manifold perils, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of falling away from God to Sathan, and that
themselues, or their posterity should become vtterly
sauage, as they are. This holy care being first had,
for their soules and eternall happinesse; and withall,
that there be no wrong offered to the poore sauage
there, nor scand all giuen to them, there may be a
greater hope of a happy Plantation, and that he will
in mercy afford a plentifull supply of all good things,
and raise vp many to be benefactors and furtherers,
and giue a prosperous successe to all your holy ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
with assurance of his fauour present, and for
euermore. But if thorough the wickednes or offensiue
carriage ef Ministers or people, minding nothing
but for their owne aduantage, these poore soules shall
take occasion to conceiue euill of the Lord, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
all this hope is vtterly ouerthrowne, in the
very hauen.</p>
            <p>Here upon in my desire of their conuersion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
with the sauing and preseruation of our owne
countrie-men there alreadie, and which hereafter
shall go to them, and of all other in these ruder coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and places, I haue bene bold to tender these my
poore trauels, vpon much hope and confidence: That
<pb facs="tcp:6904:7"/>
first euen this course of instruction, to be presented
vnto you, being embraced and rightly put in practise,
a most speedy and sure foundation, may be layd for all
future good learning, in their schooles, without any
difference at all from our courses receiued here at
home; and whereby both Maisters and Scholars, may
proceed speedily, and cheerefully, and with certaine
assurance of a blessing; and that so from vs may be
sent continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll supplies of teachers to proceed in the

goodnesse) tender to any by your selu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke full demonstration of it to them, like as I haue
formerly done to the most learned and fit that I could
chuse to this purpose, as appeareth in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sure, in the closing vp of this little Treatise.
And withal, to help that we may haue by the same, not
onely the puritie of our owne language preserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all our owne people th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be readily learned in the Schooles, together with the
Latin, and other tongues, and so more propagated to
the rudest <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> yea to the very heathen
&amp; sauage, brought vp amongst them, the more easily
thereby to reduce them all (as was said) to a louing
ciuility, with loyall and faithfull obedience to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
and good Lawes, and to prepare a way to
pull them from the power and seruice of Sathan, that
<pb facs="tcp:6904:7"/>
they may ioyntly submit themselues to Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Watch,</hi> being agreeable to the word
of the Lord, as I trust euery one that tries aright shal
find it, I dare boldly a vow, that euery soule that shall
truely put in practise, first that <hi>Rule and Way of
life</hi> to walke in it, shall find more true comfort by it,
then by all the commodities in <hi>Virginia,</hi> yea more
true ioy, with all heauenly riches and felicity, then
all the golden mines of the <hi>Indians</hi> can possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vnto them. Secondly, for that <hi>Rule of Praier</hi>
in the same, that euery one who shall learne to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it, as the Lord Iesus hath taught him, shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whatsoeuer good thing his soule shall desire:
and finally, that so watching and praying, he shall be
kept safe, euen in the midst of Diuels and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other perils, and haue the Lord to be vnto him,
as he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> God all-sufficient, whither
soeuer he calleth him, to be seene of him in the Mount,
and the inheritance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to him and his, so
walking, for an euer lasting possession.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I presumed to tender vnto you (right
Honourable and right Worshipfull) whatsoeuer the
Lord hath vouchsafed me, whereof I haue had hope,
that it might help you in your gouernments and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
for the good of those poore people committed to
you, and specially which might further the happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb facs="tcp:6904:8"/>
of that so much desired Plantation, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of the heathen, and training them vp in good
learning, and the feare of the Lord, and that so from
the children, it may please God more easily to deriue
the same vnto their fathers, from the younger to the
ancients; and so in time, by some of themselues so trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp, to propagate it to all their posterity: which
(if after further triall made by you) it shal be as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
accepted, as it is heartily and cheerefully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
according to that which I haue receiued from
the Lord, I shall not onely haue more cause to blesse
his heauenly Maiestie, but also be encouraged still to
prosecute these poore trauels, and to study the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good of them all during life, especially for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poore natiues in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and all other of

            <p>Concerning the singular benefits and blessings which
come by good learning,<note place="margin">Of the rare benefits of learning no good man euer doubted</note> like as to euery particular soule,
and so to whole nations, no man truly wise did euer yet
make doubt. No not anie one who hath knowne aright
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6904:9"/>
what learning meant; or who vnfainedly loued his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the soules of Gods people, or the Gospel of Christ.
For what maketh a nation to be a glorious nation, but
that the people are a wise and an vnderstanding people?
What is it whereby we come so neare vnto the Highest,
or to that blessed estate from which by our first parents
we are so fallen, and to which we must be renewed and
restored, if euer we shall inherit againe the tree of life, as
by true vnderstanding and knowledge, especially if the
same be sanctified vnto vs? Yea, what is it else whereby
we excell the beastes, but by this diuine reason, with
which the more we are enlightened by the spirit of the
Lord, through the meanes of learning, the more we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
the more we do excell? Or who is he that can giue
God that glorie for which he was created, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from hell, or can in anie measure honour him as he
ought to do, to his owne saluation, but onely he who is
endued with right knowledge and vnderstanding? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
whence is that inhumanitie, as amongst manie
of the Irish, the Virgineans, and all other barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their extreme ignorance of our holy God,
and of all true and good learning?</p>
            <p>If anie man should dislike of learning,<note place="margin">The licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of some learned or abusers of learning, ought not to cause vs to thinke the worse therof.</note> or thinke that
there is ouer-much of it, for the strange licentiousnesse
and outragious courses of sundrie learned ones, or for
that so manie do abuse their learning, euen to their own
perdition, without vnfained repentance; why doth not
the same man dislike also of the light, yea of riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and pleasures, all which are abused commonly by
the selfe same men, as they haue occasion, as much as
learning is? Good learning is indeed the heauenly light,
the truest honour, the best riches, the sweetest pleasure.
Learning is all, and all in all, if we beleeue that wise <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:6904:10"/>
or anie of the graue Sages who haue euer liued
since the beginning of the world. Neither is the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these men the cause of their licentiousnesse, but
this is it in truth; either that being left vnto themselues,
to humble them thereby, they haue put out that light of
learning which checked and controlled them, and haue
chosen, in their courses, to liue in darknesse rather then
in the light; or for that God hath therfore in his heauie
displeausre and most iust iudgement (as we are to feare
of manie of them) giuen them vp to such palpable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the midst of the shining light of this last age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>they loued darknesse rather then the light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 3. 19. 2. Thes. 2. 10.</note> or at least
for that they <hi>receiued not the loue of the truth, that they
might be saued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wholly to conuince all sorts,<note place="margin">Learning is the glorie of man, in the verie naturall mans account</note> that learning is the
true light, and that principall part of mans glorie; let any
naturall man aske of his owne heart, whether if he would
haue his child brought vp to make a worthie man, he
would not haue him trained vp in the most excellent
learning, notwithstanding all the abuses of it, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
can be deuised against it. And why should anie
one who knoweth but the law of nature, much more the
diuine law of our holy God, <hi>(that whatsoeuer we would
that men should do to vs euen so we should do to them)</hi> once
grudge or disdaine that vnto others, which of all other
things he most desireth for himselfe &amp; his? Why should
he not as well repine against them for the vse of light,
seeing the Lord in his rich bountie, in like maner gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the light of true learning to be communicated to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one, chiefly for his soule, as he shall be capable, as
well as he hath the light of the day for the bodie; and also
hath charged all most strictly, to seeke after it aboue all
other things. According to that of <hi>Salomon: Wisedome is

amongst vs, especially the true professors of Christs glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

who was not likewise an earnest furtherer of the

at least, and vnder other faire pretences) the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp of the schoole dores, and the bringing of all good
learning into open contempt or base esteeme. And the

               </gap>rne therefore towards our proposed marke,<note place="margin">The first and principall meanes of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the schooles of learning.</note>
&amp; to consider of the meanes whereby the Lord bestowes
this heauenly gift of all true knowledge and good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
is not the first and principall the right education
of children in the Grammer schooles, which God hath
ordained to be his nurseries of all learning and vertue?
In verie many of which schooles abroad the contrarie
rudenesse is notwithstanding verie much to be pitied
and layed to heart of all; like as it hath bene long, and is
at this day too generally complained of, and that to be
feared not without iust cause.<note place="margin">In what schooles the best learning &amp; nurture are to be found.</note> Of which sort are all those
wherein the schollers are so brought vp, as that they are
made more vnfit for anie calling, or so much as to take

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6904:11"/>
nurseries are onely such, wherein learned Maisters and
Vshers, being incouraged with meete maintenance and
due rewards, do follow the best &amp; most approued cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">A wonderfull differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those scholes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, &amp; the rest.</note>
labouring constantly to put the same in vre. For in
these a wonderfull difference will appeare, when they are
compared with those other, in which the right meanes
and orders are litle knowne, and lesse regarded to be put
in practise.</p>
            <p>And first to begin with the matter of learning,<note place="margin">1. The matter of learning easie in such schooles.</note> which
ordinarily and in it selfe, through our naturall blindnesse
and dulnesse is so hard and vnpleasant; it is made in these
schooles most easie, and replenished with all sweete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>Secondly for the manner of proceeding,<note place="margin">2. The maner of procee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular order without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</note> it is in these
schooles so direct and orderly, to the verie highest top
of all perfection in the same, that the things taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do euer giue light to those that follow after; and the
later do so hang vpon the former, as that they haue a
continuall dependance, and also the scholars haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
helpe and vse of all those things which they haue
learned before. There is moreouer in them a very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
array, as in a well gouerned armie, each knowing his
owne ranke and office,<note place="margin">The painefull schoolmaster may there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a rich blessing.</note> without the least disorder or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
Whereupon the painfull Schoolemaister may,
through Gods blessing, as certainly expect much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
fruit of his labours, as anie other man in all the
world. That euen as the best husbandrie bringeth forth
vsually the greatest increase, the shortest and safest cut
in nauigation, doth fetch in soonest the double gaine; so
the shortest and fairest way of teaching, shall bring in
speedily double learning without anie losse or danger.
So as it must needs be great follie to go further about
with more trouble and perill, where a shorter and more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6904:11"/>
sure line is plainly directed and pointed out vpon infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
experience.</p>
            <p>But for the fruits hereof they will be found such,<note place="margin">The fruite hereof able to encourage each Maister to take the vttermost paines to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the best manner.</note> as are
able to allure and encourage euerie one, to take the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
paines to seek out &amp; to practise the best meanes
which euer God shall afford. For in the meaner schooles
will soone appeare such a change, from raw and rude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,

whereof proues such a reproach vnto them. Hence also
after sundrie yeares so euilly spent, manie of them return
home againe, almost as rude as they went thither, or are
sent abroad to be vnprofitable burdens, both of the

Whereas now in sundrie of them, yea some which are

So that tast wheresoeuer you pleased, you might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
find most sweete contentment; if thus the best cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

then it would come to passe, that whereas now there is
litle or nothing in verie manie of them, wherein the eye

Maisters should be much more encouraged to go on
with cheerefulnesse, in seeing Gods blessing vpon their

The children should euer likewise haue their emulation
increased,<note place="margin">Maisters and schollars should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all alacritie.</note> which of them all should most excell. And to

with little fruite, amongst a blinde, and superstitious
people, was wont much to lament, that he was enforced
to labour in a barren soyle where salt had bene sowen:
whence he vsed to affirme that the chiefe hope of Gods
church for all such pleaces so nuzled vp in rudenesse and
superstition, was to come out of our Grammar schooles.
And indeede for bringing men vnto ciuility, the very
heathens saw this to be the onely way, according to these
verses of the Poet, which are familiar to euery child.</p>
            <q>

            <p>To shut vp this point;<note place="margin">Discharge of debt to all.</note> this (I trust) shall bring a

blessing in due time to euerie one, when this way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to learning, shall become so plaine and direct,
as that each poore mans child may with a litle cost and
labour get some vnderstanding, to know how to serue
the high God, and his owne necessary occasions: and
that the children, and posteritie of those, may come
to the knowledge of the truth, who themselues haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

ought each of vs to seeke, as he offereth opportunity, to

thus: <hi>Wherefore it is not amisse (saith it) if one seeing by

might by experience proue the like, &amp; then by proofe reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably

(that I may speake in modesty as the truth is) all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
do well know, that they are such, as do onely set
downe the same in a generall maner; or do write of some
one piece or two alone, or at most of some few parts of
Grammar learning and matters appertaining thereunto;
and the principall of them vnknowne to the common
sort of teachers: or else they are beyond the capacity and
reach of the meaner sort (for whom this is cheifly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;)
or at least, they haue specially fitted their course,

But none whom I know, or haue heard of, haue in this
kind of search and triall, gone through the seuerall parts
of our Grammarschoole learning, applying themselues
for the weakest, &amp; for the common countrey Schooles,
thus leading them as by the hand, thorow all the whole

            <p>Neither haue I in this,<note place="margin">This worke hath not bene proceeded in by priuate conceit.</note> followed mine owne priuate
conceit, but besides searching by reading, triall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation,
I haue first for many yeares inquired further
(as I said) the best courses, from the most experienced,
who haue proued them: euen of such as haue sent most
excellent scholars vnto the Vniuersities; as I haue bene
assured from some of the chiefe in the same. Secondly I
haue made triall to see a demonstration of euery thing.
Thirdly I haue had (so much as I could) the iudgement
of all the learned, with whom I could confer or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.
Fourthly, so far as I haue bene able, I haue procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
yearely trials to be made by some of the best autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6904:19"/>
learning, and iudgement that I could obtaine this
fauour of, &amp; haue intreated them to censure all things
frankely, and to direct vs wherein they found or thought
vs defectiue, to confirme and encourage vs wherein we
proceeded in a right course.</p>
            <p>Neither haue I conferred with any louing friend
hereof (so farre as I remember) who hath not approued
of the course, and wished all good successe to this my
trauell.<note place="margin">Nor posted on, but haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned slowly.</note> So that I haue not posted it forward, but hasted
slowly; and vsed so farre as God hath granted me oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuniy,
all meanes of due preparation, and of mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation:
thus enquiring of (as I said) and conferring
with so many of the best experienced, as either my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or greatnesse of the charges in trauell would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
And moreouer before I published any thing hereof
in print, I sent some draughts, vnto sundry learned, for
their helpe and direction, though not to the hundredth
man to whom I desired. For that I was neither able to
get copies enow written, nor to procure them written
truly, much lesse to be at the charge to send the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abroad
into all parts, to many, who I know would willingly haue
laid to their hands, and added their experiments. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein also, in steed of sending any moe written co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
abroad, I after a time, by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of some faithfull
and iudicious welwillers to this worke, thought it best
to follow that worthy President of most happy labours,
<hi>Maister Perkins;</hi> who when he was in hand with his
Probleme, being aduised to send some copies first to his
learned freinds, answered that he could not get copies
enow written, &amp; though he procured some writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth,
and by good scholars, yet they were so defectiue, as that
he could not well send the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for that cause he would
print some few of them first, which might go forth to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6904:20"/>
the view of the world, and so he might heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
censure of all, and receiue the helpe of his freinds,
and then reforme accordingly. Thus did I aduenture
to send forth the former draught of my Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mar Schoole,
with some other parts belonging to the same to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
view of all, that I might the sooner heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the free censures and better directions of all louing
freinds, and welwillers vnto this worke, so to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
trying, reforming and supplying, like as I haue
continued vntill this day.</p>
            <p>In the whole worke,<note place="margin">The Author assumeth to himselfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wants &amp; errors.</note> as I promised not any thing but
my trauell, which I haue striuen to performe with all
the poore ability which the Lord hath vouchsafed me,
so I take nothing to my selfe, but onely the wants and
errours. The rest is his who hath giuen this desire, and
prolonged my life, granted me vnderstanding, strength,
and opportunitie to bring it thus farre forward. What
directions or experiences herein, I haue receiued from
others, as yet, or lately liuing, I would haue set downe
with their names adioyned, like as I haue done of some
(which I know might haue brought much credit to the
worke, for the authority of sundry of them; and thereby
euerie one of them haue had their due) but that they did
not thinke it meete, desiring to be concealed. What I
haue gathered out of the writings of the chiefe learned
who haue reuiued learning in this last age, as <hi>Sturmius,
Melanchton, Erasmus,</hi> &amp; others, either shortly set downe,
or plainly poynted at in them; I haue omitted likewise
to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion particularly; not any way to wrong or detract
from them, but partly for that I did not note the places
at my reading of them; and moreouer for that I thought
that labour more troublesome then profitable to the
Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6904:20"/>
Neither take I vpon me any way to prescribe to the
meanest,<note place="margin">Prescribeth not to anie.</note> knowing my self so far inferiour to the greatest
part, but do begin to thinke more and more, of this
weightie calling, as <hi>Paul</hi> did of the sacred Ministerie, and
to breake out into that his admiration, <hi>who is sufficient
for these things?</hi> who is meete to haue the treasure both
of Church and Common-wealth, with the hopes of all
posteritie committed vnto him, and much more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
perpetuall rules in this behalfe? Much lesse do I
pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ume to teach them of most excellent gifts; but as
a poore fellow labourer for the common good, and a
willing learner of all, I do humbly desire the iudgement
and helpe of all the chiefe learned, both for their cause
who wish this, and for the vniuersall benefit of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
age, and of all posteritie. That I may see still both
what they approue in the courses set downe, also what
they disallow, and likewise vpon what grounds; what
may be bettered, what is yet wanting, and what is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <p>Thus is my hearts desire, to trauel in it still, according
as I haue begun, vntill the Lord shall accomplish the
whole worke, which although it should be seuen yeares
more, yea many moe before; yet the Lord prolonging
my dayes, I shall euer increase in reioycing in my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
assurance of the rich blessing, which God will
giue vnto it, &amp; thinke all my labour most happily spent.
But herein let not any man expect from me great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in a lofty kind of verse or prose, or eminency in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
orations, or the like, this I leaue to our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
renowned schooles of Westminster, Eaton, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,
and the rest both in London &amp; elsewhere, and to
our Schoolemaisters of chiefe fame, whose breeding &amp;
imployment in schooles hath bin accordingly; and who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6904:21"/>
haue ancient scholars long exercised in these kinds. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom I am so far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enuying any excellent
learning in them, that I wish all others partakers of the
like in their kind. And for my selfe I content me with
this mercie from the Lord, and blesse him for it, that I
haue trauelled chiefly for our meaner &amp; ruder schooles;
and that he hath vouchsafed me this fauour, to bring my
worke so farre forward, as to helpe to direct hitherto,
according to the things mentioned in the Contents.
Yet this I humbly desire of all such of principall note,
for education, gifts and experience, to further vs with
their better directions in all these exercises and the rest;
&amp; now God hauing so accomplished my desire for the
first foundation, and let me see his blessing vpon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ons, I will labour to follow them in what I am too
short, as fast as his goodnesse shall enable, vntill I shall
likewise find by experience, wherein that excellency and
comfort of theirs doth consist, and come as neare vnto
them as I can. Though therein, <hi>Cum in primis non liceat;

            </p>
            <p>For the length of the worke in the Grammar schoole,<note place="margin">Reasons for the length of the worke.</note>
I haue in many things contracted very much in this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And for those things wherein I may seeme ouer
tedious, as namely in the first entrance of children, in
teaching Accidence and Grammar, also for construing,
parsing, and making Latine, I would haue all consider
how therein I haue contended to direct the carefull
Maister, to incite both himselfe, and his little ones, as by
play, to make the least to loue the Schoole and learning;
and for that those things being well performed, all the
difficulty is past. Yea in all such places I would wish you
euer still to remember this, that I wrote not for the great
learned, but chiefly for the simplest, &amp; yong beginners,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6904:21"/>
both teachers and learners, with whom I cannot be too
plaine; although I haue and do still striue to abridge
whatsoeuer can be, so as I may be well conceiued of
all, for whom I labour; and in the end of euery chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
haue vsually repeated briefly the sum thereof. And
knowe withall, that I haue thought it my dutie to set
downe whatsoeuer I haue found to be profitable, that
out of them all, the best may bee setled, being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the trials of many. In which respects some of
great learning, who perused the work formerly, haue not
seene how it could well be any shorter, nor what might
well be spared, especially being thus offered to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
censure. Consider moreouer what great volumes
haue bene written of some one of these points alone,
whereas my indeuour hath bene to go thorowe them
all, shewing in euery one, what I take to be principally
necessary or behooffull. And finally remember that
which <hi>Martiall</hi> wittily and truly affirmeth:
<q>
                  <l>Non sunt longa quibus nihil est quod demere possis.<note place="margin">Martial. Epig.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Those for whom it hath bene labored in, who wil not
vouchsafe it the reading because of the length, would
much lesse haue taken the paines, or haue bene at the
cost, to haue trauelled, searched, and tried to haue
found it out. Although this I dare constantly auow, and
keepe within my bounds, that it had counteruailed
vnto me both the labour of an hundredth times rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it ouer, and as manie times the charges, if I had
knowne but the things from my first entrance into teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which God hath now thus made knowne to all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the freeing both of my body and minde from much
toyle and griefe. Notwithstanding that I then both read
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6904:22"/>
all whom I could get in this argument of teaching, and
also had from the beginning for sundry years the aduice
and direction of<note n="*" place="margin">Master <hi>Iohn Ireton</hi> of <hi>Keg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> one in whose house I liued, who was
well knowne to be inferiour to few in all excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and euen in this kinde amongst other. Neither do I
doubt, but that whosoeuer he be that would do good in
this function, especially of the new beginners, and shall
peruse the worke with desire to make his benefit of it,
shall meete with some one thing alone or other in it,
(which if he will practise it aright) he will freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

&amp; so in the table in the end, to reade what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,

that I may omit nothing which concerneth their helpe,<note place="margin">Better for the learners that the worke should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlarge then too short.</note>
&amp; may be vnderstood of all, then by being ouer-short, to

and expositions, to make them plain. Because co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly
the learners do imagine that they haue gotten that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by them which indeed they are ignorant of, and so
ceasse from searching further; although for those who
vnderstand them fully, or haue meanes to haue them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6904:22"/>
plainly opened, they are of most singular vse, for the
easie remembring and practise of the things contained
in them.</p>
            <p>Moreouer howsoeuer I should not be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

any one of them in the absolute perfection,<note place="margin">This trauell happily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, if but to effect these things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> yet I euer
thought from the beginning that my trauell should be
most happily employed, if I might effect but only these
things following, or some of them, as namely:</p>
            <p>If I might but set others on work,<note place="margin">1. If but to set others on work hereby.</note> to search yet further,
or to make trial of these experiments or better, for the ful

of some others who haue most happily trauelled herein.
And the rather, for that sundry of chiefe experience in
this kinde, are so hardly drawne to impart that which
they know; either for lacke of opportunities, or lest they
should be thought to presume ouer much, or suspecting
the censures of others, or for some like by respects, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
both Church and Common-wealth are depriued of
their due; to wit, of such singular helpes as might excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
tend to the benefit of them both.</p>
            <p>Or thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Or to make known sundrie most profitable bookes and helpes.</note> if I might but make known amongst alsorts,
sundry most profitable bookes and helpes which God
hath to this end prouided, both for Maisters and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
which haue formerly bene hid, and are vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne

            <p>Or fourthly,<note place="margin">4. To helpe all desirous to doe good, and yet toyle without fruit.</note> if I may but only help such of my brethren

neuer knew any good proceedings, and liue as burdens
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6904:23"/>
to the publike hurt, for lacke of direction in this behalfe.
That so not any one, who maketh conscience of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and will inquire, should be vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>Yea fiftly,<note place="margin">If but to gain one yeare.</note> if I might but helpe the common sort,

&amp; lessening of charges, chiefly for the poorer. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that my vndoubted hope is, that by these courses
alone almost double sound and good learning may be
gained, in regard of that which hath bene and is in many
country Schooles, for vnderstanding, speedinesse, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and delight. That little children being rightly
trained vp, may do more at nine or ten yeares old, then
in many places at fourteene or fifteene, as Master <hi>Askam</hi>
saith, concerning the Northern parts in his time; when
they went to the schoole little children, and came away
great lubbers; alwaies learning, little profiting, learning
without booke euery thing, and vnderstanding within
booke little or nothing, as he rightly affirmeth. And for
the further euidence hereof, that so much more good
may bee done hereby, it is very apparent in this. That
a great deale may be gained by three or foure of these
helpes alone,<note place="margin">For that so much may be gained by three or foure of these helps alone.</note> which either are not knowne, or not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the ordinary Schooles.</p>
            <p>As first, by winning a yeare or two in the beginning,
by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etting them to schoole so soone as they are able to
learne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by causing all things in Schools to be done
with vnderstanding. Of the benefite whereof see <hi>Chap.
5.</hi> of the Grammar Schoole.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by making the Scholars very perfect, first in
their grounds, viz Accidence, chiefly in Nounes and
Verbes, after the maner which is shewed there; and after
likewise in the Grammar it selfe, for the perfect vse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6904:23"/>
and applying of the rules. This will gaine
much in time, and more in ease and certainty then can be
imagined.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by making them very perfect in their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as they proceed.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, by the knowledge and practise of the rule of
construing, and of translations formed according vnto
the same, for all the lower sort.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, by hauing in all things the most easie, sure, and
excellent patternes to follow; which, they being kept
vnto constantly, must needes come in time to expresse
very liuely, or at least come neere vnto them. To omit
the benefit of increasing in our owne toung as in the
Latin; and all things for going certainly without stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or doubting, and much more by their growing in
their writing, together with their other learning, &amp; that
by one and the same labour.</p>
            <p>Now if by these few so much may be gained, and
much more by all the rest together, being constantly
practised: then let euery man iudge what we might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
expect, if many moe learned well-willers, would
adde still but each his seuerall experiment.</p>
            <p>These same, amongst others, haue bene the seuerall
ends, whereat I haue aimed, and thought my labours
should be happily emploied, if I might in any sort at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto them. Wherein how farre the Lord hath
vouchsafed to fulfill my desire, I refer it to euery one
who hath or shall duely make triall of that which I haue
written.</p>
            <p>That I do in this worke so much account of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
translations,<note place="margin">Reason of the high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> which I so oft mention in the
Grammar schoole, as namely Chap. 8. where I shew the
manner, vse and benefit of them, I hope that this wil be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6904:24"/>
found true by experience, that after children haue bene
well trained vp in their Accidence, and a litle entred and
acquainted with them, following the courses directed for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they will go ouer their whole Authors so translated,
by the help of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before they could haue gone through
one third part of them without. And also that they will
learne their authors far more perfectly for each good vse,
and keepe them much more surely, with lesse labour or
trouble; besides that they shall continually learne by
them to make Latine truly and purely, and to get matter
and phrase, aswell as to construe and parse. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
because in all the formes which shall vse them,
chiefly in the higher, they wil be found for the most part
to be in stead of the Maisters or Vshers labour, and euer
certaine, teaching English as wel as Latine, without any
of the inconueniences vsually imagined; so that there be
a wise direction and ouersight, as in all other things, that
they be vsed aright.</p>
            <p>Besides experience, the reasons are most euident, as
I haue shewed in their place;<note place="margin">Chap. 8.</note> especially by making all
their authors to be so easily and soone vnderstood,
and then for the continuall practise by them of the
Grammar <hi>Analysis</hi> and <hi>Genesis:</hi> and finally that by them
may be such a daily vse of translating both into English
&amp; Latin: all which are so highly commended by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for the speedy getting of any tongue. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the two first leaues of <hi>Master Askams</hi> Schoolmaster
whom I principally esteeme and propound,<note place="margin">Master <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skams</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the practise of translating.</note> do giue
sufficient testimony. Hee in the very entrance of his
booke, sharply reproouing the common order of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Latins practised in Schooles; and hauing shewed
how by that (as it is comonly said) children are vtterly
marred, and also hauing giuen most manifest reasons of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6904:24"/>
the hurt which comes thereof, for the feare that children
are driuen into: affirming moreouer, that nothing hath
more dulled the wits, or taken away the wils of children
from learning, then that: and lastly how they learne
euill choise of words, wrong placing, and ill framing of
sentences, and that which they must vnlearne againe;
he afterwards speakes thus, concerning this kinde of
translating, and the benifits of it.</p>
            <p>There is a way (saith he) touched in the first booke
of <hi>Cicero de Oratore,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This is well worthie the marking of all.</note> which wisely brought into
Schooles, truly taught, and constantly vsed, would not
onely take away that butcherly feare of making Latines,
but also with ease and pleasure, and in short time, as I
know by good experience, worke a true choise, and
placing of words, a right ordering of sentences, an easie
vnderstanding of the tongue, or readinesse to speake,
facilitie to write, a true iudgment both of his owne and
other mens doings; what toung soeuer he doth vse.
Then he setteth downe the manner, how the child
should be taught to translate a peece of <hi>Tully,</hi> or a like
Author thus plainly, &amp; afterwards out of his translation
to turne it into the Latin of the Author againe; and then
by comparing with the Author to see how neere he
came, and where he missed; so to amend it, still striuing
vntill he come to expresse his Author truly. By this he
saith, the maister may teach all those things which are
most tedious and difficult without any errour, and the
scholar may learne without any great paine, the Maister
being led by so sure a guide, &amp; the scholar brought into
so plaine and easie a way. This is the summe of <hi>Maister
Askams</hi> speech.</p>
            <p>Now these Grammaticall translations of our lowest
Schoole Authors, do performe the same things for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6904:25"/>
all young scholars farre more surely and speedily.</p>
            <p>More surely, because the scholar translating into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
of himselfe, vnlesse the Maister vse maruellous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
before in making him very perfect in the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing
of it, and as much after in perusing &amp; amending
euery thing which is faulty, the child wil misse in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
and if he translate falsly into English, or misse of the
Grammaticall order, he can not translate into the same
Latine againe, vpon sure grounds and reason, vnlesse
he go by rote, as we say. Moreouer that labour for so
perusing the translations, of euery one of each forme
thorough a Schoole, would be endlesse in the greater
schooles, and much more when they haue turned it into
Latine, for comparing all with the Author, and reducing
each thing into the right order; whereas these being so
translated vnto their hands, do first guide them certainly
how to construe or to translate, to reade all things which
they learne by them, into a true translation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to turne them perfectly into the Latine of the
Authour againe.</p>
            <p>These do it also more speedily,<note place="margin">More spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</note> in as much as they may
reade ouer many lines turning them into English or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
before that they can write one. Although that kind
of translating by pen of themselues, both into English
and Latine, hath also her due place and singular vse,
for some speciall benefits thereof, as writing true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographie,
and the like, as I shall shew in the handling
of it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">This verie course in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect practised by Maister <hi>Askam.</hi>
               </note> this very course of translating peeces of

in writing pure Latine, that (as he saith) some in seuen
yeares in the Grammar Schooles, yea some in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,
could not do halfe so well. So afterwards he
saw the like in his happiest Schollar that euer England
had bred, our late Queene, who made vs all happie;
who, as hee saith, did so farre surpasse all of her yeares
in excellencie of Learning,<note place="margin">This way of translating the chiefe &amp; sure meanes to attaine speedily to any tongue. Maister <hi>Askams</hi> Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Lib. 2. p. 33.</note> and knowledge of diuers

            <p>And that I may adde but one other testimonie of a

of that right noble, and memorable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
Sir <hi>Iohn Harington,</hi> (who now rests and reignes
with the Lord) hauing speech with Maister <hi>Touey,</hi> who
had bene a Schoolmaister, equall (as he was indged) to
most of the chiefe in that kind; but was then wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for the attendance and tuition of that young
Noble-man (with whom he also liues now in heauen,)
I desired to know this of him: that whereas I had writ
vnto him formerly, to haue taken some paines, in setting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6904:26"/>
downe the shortest and best way of teaching, according
to his experience; and now there was a rare fame, that
God had giuen an extraordinarie blessing to his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
with that young Noble-man, so that he did of a
sodaine go farre beyond most others of his time, (aboue
all former expectation:) that he would vouchsafe to
impart vnto me, in a word or two, what were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
meanes he had vsed thereto. He acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
thankfully, that he had indeed seene much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Gods mercie therein, told mee, that this was
the principall and summe of his course: That he had
bene enforced to begin againe, euen from the verie Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence,
causing him to get the perfect vnderstanding
of the Rules, for the meaning and vse, though he could
not the words in so short a time; and after that, he had
caused him to practise continual translating into Latine,
after this manner. That he himselfe had chosen easie
places of <hi>Tully,</hi> and other familiar Authors, which the
Gentleman knew not, and caused him to turne them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Latine, and after brought him to the Author, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
that which he had written, to the same, iust accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this last manner mentioned out of Maister <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kam.</hi>
After, rounding me in the eare, he said; But shall
I tell you, <hi>It was by Prayer,</hi> quoth he. Hereupon, after
my returne, I set my selfe to put all these in practise, yet
more seriously then formerly I had done. But for this
kinde of translating, finding the toyle and impossibilitie
of it, first to translate peeces fit for euerie Forme, and
after to examine euerie ones exercise, how he had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,
and to correct them; I wholly bent my selfe to
trie how this might be done, thorow the seuerall lower
Formes, that they might haue most practise of it.</p>
            <p>Thus trying sundrie waies, which were ouer-long to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6904:26"/>
recite, and amongst others, hauing seene in a chiefe
Schoole in <hi>London,</hi> good vse of verball translations; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
some other things, I began to thinke, that by
the meanes of translations of the first Authors which
Scholars learne, this translating might be practised in
each lower Forme continually. But there were yet two
maine difficulties, which had formerly hindred me from
any such vse of them. First, that our vsuall translations
did direct the young Scholars vncertainly, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
amisse, being oft rather to expresse the sense, then
the words in anie right order of Grammar; and that
the learners must go by memorie, and as it were by rote,
more then by anie certaintie of Rule, vnlesse they were
of better iudgement. And secondly, that for this and
other inconueniences, translations were generally in
disgrace in Schooles. Therefore, this then I thought
necessarie to be my first labour, to finde out some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
rule to follow, according to which to frame these
translations, and which might be the guide of all.</p>
            <p>And herein I,<note place="margin">To whom the finding out of the rule, and of translations thereby is acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> vnder Iesus Christ, acknowledge my
selfe be holden for the rule of construing and translating,
in the beginning of my Schoole labours, now aboue

            <p>And so from that time vntil this day,<note place="margin">Labour to find out the rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to frame the translations accordingly.</note> I haue still bene
labouring to find out the rule more exactly, &amp; to frame
the translations according to the same. Secondly, this
hath bene my next studie, to seeke out the right vses and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6904:27"/>
benefits of these translations,<note place="margin">And also the right vses &amp; benefits of them.</note> and so in all things to set

most easily and surely to reape the fruite of them.

amongst other experiments, for the vse of all schooles, so
vpon certaine proofe by my selfe, and other of better
iudgement, I might at length commend them to all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and so helpe to bring in that excellent vse of them
(which <hi>Maister Askam</hi> aduised) euen into the Schooles,
in which they had bene so formerly distasted, as that it
was thought a Paradox, but to name the vse of transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>Now vpon this rule,<note place="margin">Vpon what things all the chiefe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of these translations depend.</note> and the expressing euerie thing

as I am fully assured,<note place="margin">Certaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of these translations rightly vsed.</note> by long experience, through the

in learning, farre more then can be well conceiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
due triall made, and that with much lesse trouble to
the Maister then otherwise: and with farre more delight,
certaintie, ease, and cheerfull emulation to the scholar.
I haue therefore thought it my dutie, after my vnfallible
experience of them, rightly vsed, so as I haue plainely
set downe the maner in this second edition of my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6904:27"/>
Schoole, and after my so long and painfull trauell,
to find out the Rule most certainly, with the best, and
most profitable vses thereof, to commend them more
confidently vnto all our Schooles, and to all desirous to
recouer speedily the knowledge of their Latin tongue,
or to increase therein. In a certaine affiance, that all who
shall vse them aright, shall see a rich blessing, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience:
yet lest in anie thing I should be thought
too peremptorie, I intreate the learned first to make
proofe, then to iudge hereof according as they find.</p>
            <p>For anie further apologie therefore for my bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,<note place="margin">Further Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, except, 1. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors desire to do all this good.</note>
in these endeuours, I trust that some few of the
reasons lightly touched before, may be defence suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
And first my vnfained studie to do all this good to
all sorts, without the least iniurie to anie one, so farre
forth as I shall know it, or without inuerting anie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

of manie of my brethren, to enter vpon so hard a
taske, yet the weaker, the more meete haue I bene, to
haue a compassionate feeling of the wants of others; and
more like to applie my selfe to the capacitie of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and most ignorant: whereas the great learned and
acute do oft times thinke, that what they themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
all others should presently conceiue, though
the most of the simple comprehend litle or nothing of it
fully, as they should.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all these experiments gathered to our hands.</note> for that in these my poore labours, euerie

haue I endeuoured to rely vpon that his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that thus seeking first the kingdome of God, and

from his Maiestie, but found him faithfully and
true; yea, exceeding bountifull, aboue all that I could
conceiue, in all things wherein his goodnesse hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

nothing doubt, but through the mercie of the Lord, this
labour being intended to these verie ends, and prooued
to be answerable thereunto, without inconueniences in
the right vse of it, as my assured confidence is; I cannot

all others partakers of the comforts, which to that end
he hath vouchsafed vnto me, following so neare as I can,
that direction mentioned before, in the Preface before
our common Grammar. Thirdly remember that report

(these things being rightly weighed) but all who are

My sonne comes on neuer a whit in his writing.
Besides that his hand is such,<note place="margin">Murmurings of Townes for charges ill bestowed and children spoiled.</note> that it can hardly be read;
he also writes so false English, that he is neither fit for
trade, nor any employment wherein to vse his pen.
When all in a towne generally, shall murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs, in this or the like manner, that their children
do no good vnder vs, but lose their time, and spend
their friends mony, being brought vp idlely, made fit

them? That it were much better to turne the
maintenance giuen to the schoole, to beare the charges
of the towne for other duties and seruices, then so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably

            <p>Moreouer how must this needs trouble vs,<note place="margin">Some to crie out against our seueritie.</note> when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

            <p>Finally,<note place="margin">Terrour for for lacke of growth of Gods religion.</note> what a terrour shall this be vnto vs, and
what a wounding to our consciences, when we shall but
thinke, how the Lord and all good men, may most iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay this vnto our charge, that the cause hath bene
chiefely in vs, that Gods religion, hath not thriuen any
better in our Land, in so long a time; but that Popery,
ignorance, Atheisme, and all irreligiousnesse, haue
farre more growne vp in many places? If we had bene
as carefull to season our youth, in the truth of Christ,
and to settle them in the grounds of his holy religion,
truly professed amongst vs, to their saluation, as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
schoolemaisters are to corrupt them with Idolatry,
and superstition, vnto perdition, the knowledge and
loue of Gods true worship, and pietie, had flourished
amongst vs, euery where long ago, all Popery and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
rooted out. And what answer can we thinke to
make to God, for his religion, and people, for so many
who haue bene lost, chiefly through our lacke of care?
How should these things touch euery one of vs, euen
to the very hearts, and cause vs to bethinke our selues
at length, of this our weighty function, to the end to
take away all this reproch, and to begin to recouer the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6904:30"/>
credit of our worthy profession.</p>
            <p>You know well,<note place="margin">The charge committed to vs.</note> that we are they to whose charge
that rich treasure, both of Church and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth
is committed in trust, (as was said) and the hope of a
more happy age hereafter yet to come. We are they
who helpe either to make or marre all; for that all the
flower of our Nation, and those who become the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of all the rest, are committed to our education, and
instruction: that if we bring them vp aright, there is great
hope, that they shall prooue goodly lights, and marks
to all the rest of the Land, especially, to the townes and
countries where they are; and cleane contrarily, most
wofull ensamples (as are euery where to be seene) if
they be spoiled through vs, or for lacke of our better
care. So that we must needs do the greatest good or
the greatest euill. As we are before them, so we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that they shall prooue for the most part after vs.
We are therefore the men, vpon whom the flourishing
of this our Canaan, doth very much depend. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
then but know, that as our worke aud charge are
so weighty, and in course of education next vnto the
worke and charge of the holy Ministery, which we
also are to helpe to furnish: so our account must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that which our God hath trusted vs withall,
and our reward answerable; dreadfull, if we haue bene
negligent; glorious, if we haue bene faithfull.</p>
            <p>We cannot be ignorant, how our enemies the <hi>Iesuits,</hi>

the Vniuersitie, now sundrie yeares ago, and which I do
gladly acknowledge, to the praise of God, that it hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6904:31"/>
from the first relation put more life vnto me in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The summe of it was this.</p>
            <p>The Iesuites,<note place="margin">The combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Iesuites ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs. October, 28. 1608.</note> the Popish schoolemaisters beyond the seas,
do combine themselues together, and all, or at least manie
schooles do reade the same bookes at one time, and the same
places, and do change euery quarter, and set vpon the schoole
dores, the Authors, place, lectures, exercises, euerie quarter,
newly printed, and for this they haue great suite made vnto
them by the Printers. This haue I lately learned of certaine
whom I vsed beyond the seas to this end. <hi>Thus farre my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

I cannot certainly affirme, yet for the generall, we
all who vnderstand anie thing, do know that it is most
certaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who are these who thus combine? are they not
the principall plotters of the ruine of all the Churches of
Christ, and of Common-wealths, as they are cried out
of, euen in the Popish countries themselues; the arch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of Christ and his Gospell, and the chiefe vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the throne of the Beast, to make him king of
kings, and Lord of Lords. And what is their purpose in
seeking out the most excellent courses of getting most

where they come, to bewitch all with an opinion of
their learning, the more easily when their time serues to
cut the throats of all, who truly and sincerely professe
Christs Gospell, and to possesse their places. Yea if it

shall be thought necessary, by that time, that by reason of

the rest of themselues, by ordinary helpes.</p>
               <p>16. In Greeke to take their Lectures of themselues, to

Greeke backe againe, out of a translation, Latine, or English;
also to construe, parse, and to prooue it out of the same.</p>

to reade the Hebrew also out of the translation; which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of daily reading somewhat out of the translations into
the Originals, must needs make them, both very cunning in
the Tongues, and also perfect in the Texts of the Originals
themselues, if it be obserued constantly; like as it is in the
daily reading Latine out of the translation.</p>
               <p>18. To answer most of the difficulties in all classicall

bodging at all; and to furnish with copie of Poëticall phrase,
out of the best Poëts.</p>
               <p>22. So to imitate and expresse <hi>Ouid</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> as you
shall hardly discerne, vnlesse you know the places, whether
the verses be the Authors or the Scholars: and to write
verses ex tempore of any ordinarie theame.</p>
               <p>23. To translate forth of English or Latin into Greeke.
Also to write theames or verses in Greeke.</p>
               <p>24. To pronounce naturally and sweetly, without vaine
affectation; and to begin to do it from the lowest fourmes.</p>
               <p>25. To make right vse of the matter of their Authors,

                     </gap>pistles, Ouids Metamorphosis,</hi> and so on
to the highest. To helpe to furnish them with varietie of the
best morall matter, and with vnderstanding, wisdome, and
precepts of vertue, as they grow; and withall, to imprint
the Latin so in their minds therby, as hardly to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>26. To answer concerning the matter contained in
their Lectures, in the Latin of their Authors, from the

               <p>27. To construe anie ordinarie Author ex tempore.</p>
               <p>28. To come to that facilitie and ripenesse, as not onely
to translate leisurely and with some meditation, both into
English and Latin, as before in the sections 10. and 11. but
more also, to reade anie easie Author forth of Latin into
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6904:36"/>
English, and out of English to reade it into Latin againe, as
<hi>Corderius, Terence, Tullies Offices,</hi> &amp;c. To do this in
Authors and places which they are not acquainted with, and

               <p>29. To write fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worthie helpes and meanes to be had in the Vniuersities.</p>
               <p>31. To be acquainted with the grounds of Religion, and
to haue the summe, and all the chiefe Histories of the Bible.
To take all the substance of the Sermons, if they be plainly
and orderly deliuered: and to set them downe afterwards in
a good Latin style, or to reade them extempore into Latin out
of the English. To conceiue and answer the seuerall points of
the Sermons, and how to make a briefe repetition of the
whole Sermon without booke.</p>
               <p>32. To be set in the high way to attaine to the puritie and
perfection of the Latine tongue by their further labour aud
practise in the Vniuersitie: hauing both the rules &amp; grounds
thereof, and also varietie of the best phrase meete and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for them.</p>
               <p>33 To grow in our owne English tongue, according to
their ages, and growths in other learning: to vtter their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the same, both in propriety, and purity; and so to
be fitted for diuinity, law, or what other calling or faculty
soeuer they shalbe after employed in.</p>
               <p>34 Finally, thus to proceed together with the tongs; in
the vnderstanding and knowledge of the learning, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contained in the same, to become alike expert, in all good
learning, meete for their yeares and studies; that so procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6904:36"/>
still, after they are gone from the Grammar Schooles,
they may become most exquisite in all kinds of good learning,
to which they shall be applied.</p>
               <p>These things may be effected in good sort, through Gods
blessing, in the seuerall fourmes, as the scholars proceed, by
so manie in each fourme as are apt and industrious, onely by
the directions in the Grammar schoole constantly obserued.
If the Maisters being of any competent sufficiencie will take
meete paines: and the Scholars being set to schoole, so soone
as they shall be meete, be kept to learning daily, without
loitering, hauing bookes and other necessarie helpes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements:
and by their par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nts care caused to do their
exercises at home, and be euer kept in meete awe, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to their Maisters. But out of these I will extract
onely those which I take most necessarie and profitable for
schooles (not to trouble with ouer manie) and set them
downe briefly in the Grammar Schoole. That so all scholars
of anie towardnesse and diligence, may be made good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
and euerie way fit for the Vniuersitie by fifteene
years of age, or at least by that time that they shall be meete
by discretion and gouernment, which is commonly sixteene
or seuenteene. And all this to be done with delight aud cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie,
both to Maisters and Scholars; with strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
amongest the Scholars themselues, without that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
terrour and crueltie, which hath bene practised in
manie plaees, and without so much as seueritie amongst
good natures.</p>
               <p>How greatly all this must needs tend to the furtherance
of the publike good, euerie one may iudge; which it will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

still, so much the more as the Lord vouchsafeth a further
supply, to the seuerall meanes and courses after set downe,
by adjoining daily moe helpes and experiments, especially of
the learned. Of whom my hope is stil, according to my earnest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6904:37"/>
desire, that they will lend their helping hands, to the full

excellent furtherance in a right vse of them, for all the
seuerall parts of good learning in Schooles, for obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

and namely for thus running through all our ordinary
classicall-schoole authors, and attaining to the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
and faculties in Schooles, as any one shall haue
occasion to vse them.</p>
               <p>First, for the more speedy and right reading of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,

<hi>A Plaine Method for speedy learning to reade,</hi> by <hi>Iohn

their mindes in proprietie and puritie, for their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therein, as they proceede in Latine: and also for
them who would teach strangers our language, or
learne it. See after.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for better learning the Accidence and first
grounds of Grammar (whereas children are vsually very
long in getting their Accidence, and oft, when they
haue done it, are little the better for it, especially for the
vnderstanding and right vse of it) to the end that the
learner may get it sooner &amp; more profitably: for a right
vnderstanding and vse thereof, and for answering any
necessary question belonging to it, and for better kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
all in memory, to be able thereby to proceed most
speedily, pleasantly and certainely in their construction,

               <p>Thirdly, for more speedy construing the Latin Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,

little direction, euer prepare their lectures afore-hand
at home ouer-night: such peeces (I meane) as they are

any of them, or so much helpe of the Maister as is
vsuall. So that they will, by the helpe of them, fall to
their priuate studies of themselues. And for things to be
learned without booke, namely their Authors in verse
so translated, they will be able thereby so to keep them,
as by the meanes thereof, and their other helpes, from
quarter to quarter, to say them without booke, construe,
and to giue all the chiefe difficulties of them, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little priuate labour, thus to keep them better in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
and haue vse of them continually.</p>
               <p>Hereof I might giue you instances of experiments,
according to which you might iudge of them; but I
passe them ouer, standing vpon so euident grounds of
reason, as hath bene shewed before, and as I shall more
fully manifest (God willing) in the Grammar-Schoole,
chap. 8. where I shall set downe the vse of them, with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If you desire a praxis of all or most of the chiefe rules
of the <hi>Syntax</hi> or construction shortly comprized, take
Maister <hi>Leeches</hi> Dialogues,<note place="margin">For a practise of the chiefe rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, Maister <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Dialogues</hi>

Grammar-questions: which Dialogues are so contriued
of purpose for children to that end: and so likewise
translated into English, as they may be gone through
for each good vse so soone as any of the former.</p>
               <p>By that time that children haue gone through these
bookes so translated, and haue by this practise attained
vnto the knowledge and right vse of their Grammar
rules, especially that golden rule of Construing: for
construing, parsing, &amp;c. they will be able, easily, with
much lesse toyle of the Maister, to go through all other
classicall-Schoole-Authors, by such helpes and meanes
as God hath further prouided.</p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:6904:39"/>
bookes, which are not so translated grammatically:
first, the other translations of them may be of very good
vse thus farre foorth. As namely, first to giue the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
some light for the right vnderstanding &amp; meaning
of the Authors (which vnderstanding of the matter is a
maine foundation for the speedy attaining to any such
learning, especially for getting the Languages, as I haue
shewed elsewhere) as also for resoluing the Authors,
and affoording some good English phrase, with varietie
thereof to expresse their minds. And withall, that by the
right vse of such translations, they may the more easily
learne the manner of our vsuall translating of Authors,
or anie other worke, respecting onely the matter and
intent of the Author, whereof our commonest vse is:
and so for reading forth of Latin into our owne tongue,
to expresse the sense onely, not directly, <hi>verbatim,</hi> or
grammatically, but obseruing perfect sense, good phrase,
and purity of our tongue, and so back againe out of the
English into a good Latine style in like manner. For the
right learning of these Authors doth not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the construing and parsing of them, as in getting
by them the matter, phrase and style of the Author, and
to these ends and purposes amongst others, as I take it,
they haue bene translated, and are many of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to most.</p>
