            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Army under the Command of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax</hi> did come to <hi>Guild-Hall,
London,</hi> to receive an Accompt of the Lord Major and Aldermen appointed as
Commiſſioners by Ordinance of Parliament of the 15 of February, 1644. For
the Aſſeſſing and Levying of 5800 <hi>l. per</hi> Month, upon <hi>London</hi> &amp; the Liberties,
which is their proportion according to their divident in like caſes. And upon
Examination finding that the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties are very much in Arreare to what is
grown due, &amp; other Counties hath paid; the City of <hi>London</hi> having formerly had the Honour to
be good examples and leaders unto all other Counties in matters of publique concernment. The
ſaid Committee from the Honourable Houſe of Commons, with the Lord Major and Aldermen
aforeſaid, having ſummoned all the Collectors of the ſeverall Wards, and their reſpective Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
to enquire of them the true cauſes of the ſlack comming in of the Moneys Aſſeſſed
upon the ſeverall Wards. For the ſpeedy bringing in whereof, they were appointed
Collectors; and finding amongſt other cauſes this to bee the maine; <hi>(viz.)</hi> The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
and tenderneſſe of the Collectors in executing the power of the Ordinance by
way of diſtreſſe upon the Goods of their Neighbours that doe delay or refuſe to pay the ſaid
Aſſeſſement; which neglect of the ſaid Collectors cannot bee borne with, in regard of the
preſſing neceſſities of that happy Army under the immediate Command of the Victorious
Generall Sir <hi>Thomas Fairefax;</hi> whom God hath made Inſtrumentall, not onely to keepe
the Enemy from our Gates; but alſo to ſcatter their greateſt Forces, and drive them to
the moſt remote Parts in the Kingdome, who are yet in purſuit thereof; which gives us
great hopes of a ſpeedy period to our bleeding Calamities, and doth invite the beſt
endeavours of all that are deſirous of a ſetled and well-grounded Peace, to give the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
all due encouragement.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſaid Committee, with the Lord Major and Aldermen aforeſaid, have
thought fit to deſire the Miniſters of the ſeverall Pariſh Churches and Chappells within the
City and Liberties, That they on the next Lords-Day doe effectually ſtirre up their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners
ſpeedily and chearefully to pay in their Aſſeſſements to the ſeverall Collectors,
and to continue the payment of the remainder, as the ſame ſhall grow due. And to let
them know, in caſe they ſhall continue to delay or refuſe the payment thereof, That the
reſpective Collectors are enjoyned upon the Penalties expreſs'd in the ſaid Ordinance of
the 15 of <hi>February,</hi> to diſtreine their Goods, and make ſale of the ſame. And that none
doe miſtake or cenſure the proceedings of the ſeverall Collectors, who without reſpect
of Perſons are to doe their Duties according to the ſaid Ordinance: But if any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
