         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THe People,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Treatiſe.</note> whom God
choſe to preſerve the
true Religion until the
preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
may ſerve for an Excellent
Model of a Man's Life, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to Nature. We ſee in
their manners the moſt Rational
ways of Subſiſting, of employing
our time, and of living in Society;
and we are capable of Learning
from 'em not only Morality but
alſo Oeconomy and Policy.</p>
            <p>Yet thoſe manners are ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from ours, that they offend
us at the firſt bluſh. We ſee
among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> neither thoſe
Titles of Nobility, nor that Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of Conditions, which is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

them but Labourers and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
all working with their Hands,
all married, and counting the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Children for a great
Happineſs. The Diſtinction of
Meats and living Creatures Clean
and Unclean, &amp; their frequent Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
ſeem to us odd and Caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ceremonies, and their bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
give us a diſguſt. Moreover,
we ſee, that this People were very
Inclinable to Idolatry; that the
Scripture upon that account ofte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

who has not yet rid himſelf
of thoſe Prepoſſeſſions, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
with is Scene of ſtrange
Manners. He attributes all without
Diſtinction to the Imperfection of
the old Law, or believes, that under
that veil are concealed Myſteries,
which he does not underſtand.
Thoſe who have not ſufficient faith
and uprightneſs of Heart are
tempted upon theſe appearances to
deſpiſe Scripture it ſelf, which
ſeems to 'em filled with low things,
or from thence to draw ſuch ill
conſequences, as may in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
Authoriſe their vices. But
when we compare the manners of
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Grecians, Egyptians</hi> and other
People of antiquity whom we moſt
eſteem, thoſe Prejudices immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
vaniſh. Viſible it is, that
there was in them a noble ſimplicity
better than all the Refinements in
the world; that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had
all that was good in the manners of
the other People of their time;
that they were exempt from moſt
of their Defects; and that they

had beyond others the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
advantage of Knowing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was to be referred all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Life: ſince they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the true Religion,
which is the foundation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
            <p>We learn then to diſtinguiſh
amidſt what their manners have
of Offenſive, and That which is
Really blameable; That which
proceeds only from the diſtance of
Times and Places, being of it ſelf
indifferent; and that which being
good in it ſelf diſpleaſes us ſolely
through the corruption of our
Manners. For a great part of the
difference between them and us,
does not proceed from our being
more enlightned by <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> but
the reaſon is, we are leſs Rational.
'Tis not <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> has introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that great inequality of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that contempt of Labour,
that love of Sports, that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of women and young Perſons, that
averſion of a plain and frugal Life,
which renders us ſo different from
the Ancients. Thoſe ſhepherds and
Plough-men, whom we meet withal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34948:6"/>
in their Hiſtories, and amongſt
whom money was of ſo little
uſe, and great Fortunes ſo rare,
might more eaſily have been made
good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than our Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Lawyers, Trades-men, and
many People who ſpend their lives
in an idle, inglorious and uneaſy
Poverty.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, I do not pretend
here to make a Panegyrick but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
plain Relation, ſuch as thoſe
of Treavellers, who have ſeen very
diſtant Countries. I ſhall ſet down
for good, what is good; for Evil,
what is Evil; for Indifferent, what
is Indifferent. I only demand,
that the Reader may lay aſide all
manner of Prepoſſeſſions, that he
may judge of theſe manners only
by right reaſon and good
ſenſe. I deſire him to quit the
Particular Ideas of his Country,
and his Age to conſider, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
in the times and places, wherein
they lived, to compare 'em with
the adjacent Nations, and by thoſe
means to underſtand their ways and
Maxims. For 'tis to be altogether
Ignorant of Hiſtory not to ſee the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34948:7"/>
great difference, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Times and Places produce
in manners. The <hi>French</hi> inhabit
the ſame Country, that was Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the <hi>Galls</hi> and afterwards by
the <hi>Romans.</hi> How far are the
<hi>French</hi> now from either of their
ways of Living; and how different
from their own Country-men, who
lived three or four hundred years
ago? And in this very age what
coherence is there between our
manners and thoſe of the <hi>Turks, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
or <hi>Chineſes?</hi> So that if we
joyn thoſe two kinds of diſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
we ſhall not need to wonder, that
the men who lived in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> had
manners different from ours; we
ſhall rather admire at what we find
conformable.</p>
            <p>We muſt not however Imagine,
that thoſe changes are Regular, and
always go in an equal Progreſs. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
very neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
are very different through
the Diverſity of Religions and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments;
as at preſent <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>Africa,</hi> which under the <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
were much united. On the
contrary, a near Relation there is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34948:7"/>
between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which
had none in the time of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
'Tis the ſame thing by Proportion
in the difference of times. Thoſe
who know not Hiſtory, having
heard ſay, that the men of former
ages were more plain than us, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the World to refine dayly
more and more, and that the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we look back into Antiquity,
the more groſs and Ignorant we
ſhall find the Wretches to have been.
Yet it is not ſo in thoſe Countries,
that have been inhabited ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by divers Nations: The Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
there happening, have from
time to time brought Miſery and
Ignorance into them after Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Politeneſs. Thus <hi>Italy</hi> is
in a much better condition than it
was eight Hundred years ago:
but eight hundred years before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the firſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> it was more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and more magnificent, than it
is now. And truly to mount up
eight hundred years higher, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the time of the foundation
of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall find the ſame
<hi>Italy</hi> very poor and ſavage. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have their age in Proportion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34948:8"/>
as well as men: the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eſtate of the <hi>Grecians</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Alexander;</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> under
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
            </p>

               <p>THe Patriarchs lived nobly in
much Liberty and great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance:
and yet their Life was
plain and laborious. <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34948:9"/>
knew all the order of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours,
and did not alter his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ſeeing he marryed in his own
Family. He took great care to
give a wife of the ſame Race to
thoſe Sons, whom God had promiſed
him: and <hi>Iſaac</hi> cauſed <hi>Jacob</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

'em betimes ſolid and ſerious
<hi>Abraham</hi> had lived above an age
with <hi>Sem,</hi> and might learn from
him the State of the World before
the Deluge. He all along lived
with his father <hi>Thara,</hi> and was at
leaſt Seventy years old, when he
loſt him. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was Seventy five,
when <hi>Abraham</hi> dyed, nor did he ever
quit him that we know of. And it
is the ſame in Proportion with the
other Patriarchs. Living ſo long
a time with their Fathers, they
took advantage of their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and their Inventions; they
purſued their Deſigns and confirmed
themſelves in their Maxims; they
remained conſtant and equal in
their conduct. For it was not eaſy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34948:9"/>
to change, what had been well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by men who were ſtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and the old men kept up their
Authority not only over the young

who were not ſo far advanced in
Age as themſelves.</p>
               <p>The memory of paſt things
might eaſily be preſerved by the
Tradition only of Old men, who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
love to tell Stories, and
had ſo much leiſure to do ſo. Thus
they had no great need of writing,
and the truth is, we ſee no mention
of writing before <hi>Moſes.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it ſeems difficult, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

'Tis More probable, that
writing was found out before the

that were not ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Moreover the Patriarchs were
careful to preſerve the memory of

the moſt conſiderable things which
happened to 'em, by <hi>Altars,</hi> ſetting

                  <hi>Jacob</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
the Stone, which he made

Sepulcher of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the Well called
<hi>Shebah,</hi> and all the others, which
the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſaac</hi> makes mention
of. Sometimes they contented
themſelves with giving new names
to places without making any
change in them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
ſay as much of their <hi>Hero's,</hi> of
whom the moſt Ancient come near
the time of the Patriarchs: All
<hi>Greece</hi> was full of their Monuments,
and <hi>Aeneas</hi> alone did give names to
ſundry places in <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The names of the Patriarchs
were alſo a kind of more plain and
familiar Monuments. They all
ſignifyed ſomething, and uſually
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34948:10"/>
ſhewed ſome Particular circumſtance
of their birth, or ſome bleſſing of
God. Thus it was as an abridged
Hiſtory; for they took care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to their Children the Reaſon
of thoſe names, ſo as they could
not afterwards pronounce them
without refreſhing their memory.
This care of Poſterity, and this
foreſight of the future ſhews
great and noble Spirits.</p>
               <p>The Patriarchs were perfectly free,<note place="margin">Family.</note>
and their Family was a State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Father was King. For what
did <hi>Abraham</hi> want of that which
makes up a Sovereign, but vain
Titles and troubleſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?
To no body he was ſubject:
Kings made allyances with him;
and when he pleaſed, he made
War and Peace. Princes did court
the Allyance of <hi>Iſaac:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 26. 28.</note> and <hi>Iſmael
Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were preſerved in

as Inferiour to <hi>Amraphel</hi> or
<hi>Abimelech,</hi> becauſe the Scripture
does not call him King as well as
them. He was ſurely of as great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34948:11"/>
Eſtimation as one of thoſe four
Kings which he defeated with his
Domeſtical troops, and the help of
his three Allyes. The greateſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, he did not confine himſelf
like them within walls, and his
State followed him, wherever he
was pleaſed to Encamp. All the
Hiſtories we have that are worthy
of credit, ſhew us in thoſe times
but very ſmall Kingdoms in the

we ſhall find 'em much ſmaller a

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34948:11"/>
the Preſent that he made to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſhews what ſort of Cattle they
were, which they bred, Goats,
Sheep, Camels, Kine, and Aſſes.
There were neither Horſes nor
Hogs. It was that great number of
Herds and Flocks, which made
them ſo much eſteem Wells and
Cyſterns in a Country that has no
other River than that of <hi>Jordan,</hi>
and where it rains but very ſeldom.
They had Slaves too, of whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

Thus there muſt have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably

The Bracelets and Pendants, which

               <p>With all theſe Riches, very La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious

more eaſie to ſet up Tents than to

But the good and honeſt
people lived openly and without

               <p>The principal occupation of the

remained Seventy Seven years with
his Father, waiting for that bleſſing,
which was due to him by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

he to entertain thoughts of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He courted <hi>Rachel,</hi> but could
not obtain her till after Seven years
Service. Thus was he at length
marryed at Fourſcore and four
years old. <hi>Leah</hi> is given him againſt
his will: Her he kept, that he
might not leave her diſhonoured:
But as there was no law, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
the having of ſeveral

whom he had promiſed to marry.
As ſhe was found to be barren, She
preſented her Husband with a Slave,
that he might have Children. This
was a kind of Adoption, practiſed

augmented to the number of thirty
five, whoſe names we are now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
withal. But thoſe tribes of
<hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were compoſed of
Families gathered together to keep
good order in Aſſemblies and in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages;
whereas thoſe of the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>
were diſtinguiſhed Naturally,
and were but twelve Families de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
from twelve <hi>Brethren,</hi> that
is to ſay <hi>Relatives,</hi> according to the
Language of the Eaſtern People,
and truly noble, if ever any men
upon Earth were noble. They had
preſerved in it's purity the nobleſs
of the Patriarchs; the Law having
renewed the Prohibition of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Strangers: And if in ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
this was not obſerv'd,<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 5</note> they
took care to mark out thoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
as Irregular, which we may
ſee in the Genealogy of JESUS
CHRIST. Their families were
very ſetled and bound by the law to
certain Lands, where they of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
remain'd during the nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, we ſpeak of. Now we
ſhould (methinks) Eſteem a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very noble, that could ſhew ſo
long a Train of Generations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>without
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34948:18"/>
miſ-allyance, and without
change of abode. Few great men
there are in <hi>Europe,</hi> who can prove
ſo much.</p>
               <p>That which deceives us, is, we
do not ſee among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
like to thoſe of our Nobility.
Each man was called plainly by his
own name: But their names
ſignified great things as well as thoſe
of the Patriarchs. They often
added the name of the Father ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make diſtinction or for Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's
ſake, to ſhew that the <hi>Father</hi>
was a man of Reputation.<note place="margin">Ib. 10. v. 68.</note> We ſee
in <hi>Homer</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> took it likewiſe
for a mark of honor. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they gave for Surname
the name of the mother, as
when the Father had ſundry wives,
or when the mother was more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious.
Thus <hi>Joab</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are ever called the Children
of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> who was <hi>David</hi>'s
Siſter. They alſo diſtinguiſhed
'emſelves ſometimes by the top of

City, or their Country, or by their
Nation, if they were Originall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Strangers; as <hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34948:18"/>
                  <hi>Ornan</hi> the <hi>Jebuſite.</hi> Neither had
the <hi>Greeks</hi> any other Surnames than
thoſe they drew from their Father
or their Country. The <hi>Romans</hi>
had Family-names, to which they
only added the marks of ſome great
Office or of ſome Illuſtrious Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
But in the Publique acts they
evermore put their Fathers name.
Several Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> ſtill do
the ſame: And a great part of our
Surnames come from the proper
names of Fathers, which have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to the Children. As for Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Lordſhips, they are but of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſeven hundred years Antiquity
as well as the Lordſhips themſelves.
We muſt not then wonder to ſee in
the Scripture <hi>David</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Jeſs,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> the ſon of <hi>David,</hi>
no more than to ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> the
ſon of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Lagus</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>The principal diſtinction, which
Birth made among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was
that of the Prieſts and <hi>Levites.</hi> All
the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was conſecrated
to God, and had no other ſhare
than the Tenths and the firſt fruits,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34948:19"/>
which it received from the other
Tribes. Amongſt all the <hi>Levites</hi>
none but the Deſcendants of <hi>Aaron</hi>
were Prieſts or Sacrificers; the reſt,
who were only <hi>Levites,</hi> were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the other Functions of
Religion, in the Singing of
Pſalms, in looking to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
or the Temple and in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the People. The moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
was always that of <hi>Judah;</hi>
and it was the moſt numerous of all
too: and from thence Kings and
the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf was to come,<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10</note>
according to the Prophecy of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
That of <hi>Ephraim</hi> held the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
rank by reaſon of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
Moreover, in each tribe the eldeſt
Branches and the heads of each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
were conſidered; and all this
made <hi>Saul</hi> ſay, being ſurprized at
the honours he received from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel;

               <p>Age did likewiſe make a great
Diſtinction, and the name of <hi>Old

<hi>Dignity.</hi> And indeed nothing but

Age and experiences could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

               <p>Without doubt 'tis this which
moſt of all palls thoſe, who are not
acquainted with Antiquity, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteem our Manners. When
we talk to 'em of Ploughmen and
Shepherds, they figure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſuch Peaſants and Country
Fellows as ours, leading a gloomy
and painful life in Poverty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
without Valour, wit or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34948:20"/>
They do not conſider, that
what renders our Peaſants ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is their being as the Servants
of all other men; not only labouring
for their own Subſiſtance, but for the
furniſhing of things neceſſary to all
thoſe, whom are look'd upon to be
above them in the World. For the
Country-man it is, who nouriſheth
the Citizen, the Officer of Juſtice,
the Gentleman &amp; the Eccleſiaſtick;
and what means ſoever are made uſe
of to convert money into commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
or commodities into money,
they muſt all ſtill have relation to
the Fruits of the Earth, and the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures which it nouriſhes.
Yet when we compare together all
thoſe different degrees of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we place in the loweſt Form
thoſe who till the ground and look
to Cattle, and have more Eſteem for
groſs and uſeleſs Citizens, without
vigor of body, without induſtry,
without any merit; becauſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more money, they lead a more
eaſy and more pleaſurable life.
But if we fancy a Country, where
the difference of Conditions was
not ſo great; and where doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34948:21"/>
was not to live Nobly, but to
preſerve carefully ones Liberty, <hi>that
is,</hi> to be ſubject only to the Laws
and the Publick Power, ſtanding on
ones own Bottom without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on any body, and contenting
ones ſelf with a little rather than
doing any low paltry baſe thing to
grow rich; a Country, where they
deſpiſed Idleneſs, Effeminacy, and
the Ignorance of things neceſſary
for Life, and where they had a leſs
value for Pleaſure than for Health
and Strength of Body: In ſuch a
Country it would be much more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and Gentile to Plough or keep
a Flock (let the words ſound ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo odly) than to play and
ſport away a mans whole life.
Now we need not have recourſe to
the Common wealth of <hi>Plato</hi> to
find men of this quality and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſince thus it was, that the
greateſt part of the world lived,
during near Four thouſand years.</p>
               <p>To begin with what we are beſt
acquainted, ſuch were the Maxims
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> In
<hi>Homer</hi> we ſee every where, Kings
and Princes living upon the Fruits
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34948:21"/>
of their Lands and their Flocks,
and labouring with their own
hands. <hi>Heſiod</hi> has made a Poem
on purpoſe to recommend the
Country-life and toil, as the only
honeſt means of ſubſiſting and
growing rich. And he blames his
<hi>Brother,</hi> to whom he addreſſes it,
for living at the expence of others
by pleading cauſes and ſoliciting
Affairs. That employment he
brands with the name of Lazineſs,
which among us is the calling of ſo
many People. And we may ſee by
the <hi>Oeconomicks</hi> of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that
the <hi>Grecians</hi> had diminiſhed
nothing of that Eſteem for Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
even in the time of their
greateſt Politeneſs.</p>
               <p>We ought not therefore to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the Aſſiduities of the Ancient
<hi>Romans</hi> in the improvement of their
lands, to their Barbarity and groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in learning: 'Tis rather a
ſign of their good ſenſe. As all
men are born with arms and bodies
proper for Labor, they believed
that all were obliged to make uſe
of them, and that they could not
employ 'em better, than in drawing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34948:22"/>
from the Earth a certain ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and ſo growing Innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rich. Nevertheleſs it was not
Avarice which engaged them in
that way of living, ſeeing they
(as 'tis well known) deſpiſed
Gold, and the Preſents of Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Neither did this hinder them
from being a brave and a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
People; in regard it was at
the ſame time, that they ſubdued
all <hi>Italy,</hi> and acquired thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Forces, which they employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
afterward in the conqueſt of the
World. On the contrary, a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and frugal Country-life was
the Principal cauſe of their great
Strength, making their Bodies ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt,
&amp; hard'ned to Labour, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoming
them to ſvere Diſcipline.
Whoſo knows the life of <hi>Cato</hi> the
Cenſor cannot ſuſpect him guilty
of baſeneſs of heart or of Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Spirit. Yet that great
man, who had paſſed through all
the Offices of the <hi>Republick,</hi> when
it was in it's greateſt Force, who
had govern'd Provinces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Armies; a great Oratour;
a great Lawyer, and great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34948:22"/>
This great man did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to write a Treatiſe concerning
all the ways, that are neceſſary for
the emproving of Lands and
Vineyards, and how Stables and
Houſes were to be built for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of Cattle, and how a
Preſs was to be made for Wine or
Oyl; and all theſe to the moſt
minute Circumſtances: Inſomuch
as we may ſee, that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
acquainted with them, and
that he wrote for Uſe and not for
Oſtentation.</p>
               <p>Let us then confeſs ſeriouſly,
that the contempt we have for the
Country toyl and labour, is not
founded upon any ſolid reaſon; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Labour perfectly well
ſuits with courage, with all the
Virtues of War and Peace, and
likewiſe with true Policy. But
from whence comes this Contempt?
'Tis requiſite to diſcover it's true
ſource. It only proceeds from the
Cuſtomes and ancient Manners of
(our) Nation. The <hi>Franks</hi> and
other <hi>German</hi> People lived in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
covered with Woods; where
they had neither Corn nor Wine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34948:23"/>
nor good Fruits. Thus they were
forc'd to live on Hunting, as the
Salvages of the Northern parts of
<hi>America</hi> do at this Day. But
having paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> and ſetled
themſelves in better Territories,
they were willing to take advantage
of the conveniencies of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Arts and Commerce; but
they were loath to take the pains
neceſſary thereunto. They left thoſe
Occupations to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom
they for their own parts had ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and remained in their primitive
Ignorance, which at length they
took a pride in, and fixed to it an
<hi>Idea</hi> of Nobility, which (we) can
hardly rid our ſelves of. But as
much as they debaſed Agriculture,
ſo much they extoll'd Hunting,
which the Ancients had a much leſs
Value for. They have made a
great Art of it, and improv'd it
with all manner of artifice; they
have neither ſpared pains nor Coſt
in it, and have made it one of the
moſt general Profeſſions of their
Nobility Yet, to conſider things
in themſelves, The labour, which
tends to the Cultivating of Lands
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34948:23"/>
and to the breeding of Domeſtique
Animals, is aſſuredly as much to
be valued, as that which only
makes to the taking of wild Beaſts,
of ten times at the expence of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
Lands. The moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of a man, who looks to a
great Farm, is without queſtion as
beneficial as the violent and uneven
exerciſe of the Hunter, and Oxen
and Sheep are Creatures at leaſt as
uſeful to life as Dogs and Horſes.
So that we may doubt, if our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
be more Rational in this point
than thoſe of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>Beſides not only the <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> honoured Agriculture as
well as the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> The <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
too <hi>(Phenicians</hi> originally)
made a mighty ſtudy of it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Eight and twenty
Books,<note place="margin">Vanon Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Argument. The <hi>Egyptians</hi>
honour'd it to that degree,<note place="margin">Xenoph. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>econ</note> as to
adore thoſe living Creatures, which
were made uſe of in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Affair. In the
greateſt Power of the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
they had in each province Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendants
to look to the Tillage
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34948:24"/>
of Lands; and <hi>Cyrus the younger</hi> took
delight to planting and cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Garden with his own hands.
As for the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> we cannot
doubt, but they were great Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men,<note place="margin">He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

if we conſider the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
of the Plains of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
which brought forth two or three
hundred Grains for one. In Short,
the Hiſtory of <hi>China</hi> tells us, that
Agriculture was there likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much in vogue in their beſt and
moſt Ancient times. It was only
the Conqueſts of the Northern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which have cauſed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Labourer to be ſlighted through
the whole World.</p>
               <p>Let us then lay aſide thoſe low
and ſcurvy <hi>Ideas,</hi> which we have
taken up from our Infancy. Inſtead
of our Villages, where we ſee on

thoſe great Farms, which the

neat. Deſcriptions hereof may be
ſeen in <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Columella.</hi> Thoſe
Slaves were for the moſt part
much more happy than (our)
Peaſants; well fed, well cloath'd,
without any care of their Wives

Country have not diſdained this
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34948:25"/>
Profeſſion, which of all is the moſt
Ancient, their lives were much
more happy, becauſe they were
more Natural. They lived much
Longer and in better Health; they
had Bodies more adapted to the
Fatigues of War and of Voyages;
and their Wits were more ſolid
and more ſerious. Being leſs idle,
the time was leſs irkſome to 'em;
and they did not make it ſo much
their cue to taſt of Pleaſures;
Labour rendring them ſenſible of
the leaſt divertiſement. They
thought leſs of what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and had leſs Intereſt to do it:
For their plain and frugal life gave
no occaſion for great Expences or
great Debts. And conſequently
there were not ſo many Law ſuits
nor Deſtructions of Families; not
ſo many frauds and violences; nor
ſo much of every Crime, that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
or real Beggary cauſes thoſe
to commit, who neither can nor
will Work. The worſt is, the
Examples of the Rich and Noble
hurries away all others, and is the
occaſion, that all thoſe, who fancy
'emſelves ſituated above the dregs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34948:25"/>
of the People, are aſham'd to work,
eſpecially in Lands. This is the
cauſe of ſo many efforts to ſubſiſt by
induſtry; this is what makes us daily
invent new artifices for the paſſage
of money from one Purſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
How innocent all theſe ſame
forced ways of Living are, God
knows: For the moſt part they
are at leaſt very brittle and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
whereas the Earth will ever
nouriſh thoſe, who cultivate it, if
others deprive them not, of what
it beſtows. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only
ſought their ſubſiſtance in the moſt
natural Goods, Lands and Cattle,
from whence all muſt neceſſarily be
drawn that makes men rich by the
Manufactures of Merchandiſe, the
Rents or Commerce of money.</p>

               <p>THeir Land was that Land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to the Patriarchs,
whereof the Scripture ſo often ſay's,
that it <hi>Flowed with Milk and Hony,</hi> to
denote it's great Fertility. This
Country, which is ſo hot in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of ours, is very far in the
Temperate Zone between the 31
and the 33 degree of Latitude.
It is bounded on the South by
great Mountains, which put a ſtop
to the burning air of the Deſarts
of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and they continue very
far to the Eaſt as well as thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts.
The <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea,
which bounds it on the Weſt, ſends
thither refreſhing breezes: And

calls <hi>the great Sea;</hi> for the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
were little acquainted with the
Ocean, and ſo they gave the name
of <hi>Sea</hi> to Lakes and to any large
conflux of waters. The Inner
part of the Country is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifyed
with Mountains and Hills, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
for Vines, Fruit-trees
and ſmall Cattle: And the frequent
Valleys gave way to a number of
Torrents very neceſſary to water
the Country, which had no other
River beſides <hi>Jordan.</hi> The Rains
there fall very ſeldom, but are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Regular; coming in the Spring
and Autumn; which the Scripture
calls the <hi>Rain of the Morning and the
Evening,</hi> conſidering the year as a
Day. In Summer the abundant
dews ſupply the rarity of the
Showers. There are Plains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

that variety of the Earth in a little

There remains enough to nouriſh

doubt, if the nouriſhment, that

furniſh 'em with wool and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables

the Tribute of Moneys, which he

from the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſeven thouſand
five hundred Rams and as many

this, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lived plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that all the good land they
had, was carefully cultivated; ſince
there were few woods, they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parks for hunting, nor avenues

We ſee by the Canticles of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
their Gardens were full of Fruit-trees

The Law of the <hi>Jubile</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

By theſe means Diſquiet

of his Inheritance,
knowing, it would never go out

was likewiſe a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Duty, founded upon the Law of

when King <hi>Ahab</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded

For this reaſon, they were
charged with no other payment
than the tenths and firſt fruits.
Thus all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were almoſt
equal in their eſtates as well as in
Nobility: And if the multiplying
of a Family obliged 'em to ſhare
the Lands into more portions, the
Cattle might ſupply the want of
Lands.</p>
               <p>Thus Cattle and other moveables
were that which mainly occaſioned
the inequality of eſtates. That
was all the ſubſtance of the <hi>Levites,</hi>
ſeeing they had no Lands, and had
preſerved the Paſtoral life ſo much
eſteemed of by the Patriarchs.
They bred the ſame kinds of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
and ever more Females than
Males: Other wiſe it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded

It does not appear that they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

much about the ſame time. Thoſe,
who have but the leaſt knowledge

and how many Machines are

If from that time they were found
out, they had already very much
refined them, and ſuch arts too, as
only ſerve for ornament, and if
they had ſome ſecret to do things
more eaſily and with leſs clutter,
it was undoubtedly a great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Let this be ſaid by the by,
for to ſhow, that Antiquity at ſo
monſtrous a diſtance, was not groſs
and ignorant, as ſome fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:
And truly the World was

               <p>But whether thoſe two famous

was miraculous and inſpired by
God, as the Scripture ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate;
it does not appear, that

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34948:34"/>
there were a midſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> any
Artificers by Profeſſion, who
wrought for the Publick. When
<hi>Solomon</hi> undertook the building of

of the King of <hi>Tyre. You know,</hi>
ſaid he to him, <hi>that I have no body

work in wood like the Sydonians:</hi> and
he ſent for an excellent founder of
Mettals, <hi>Hiram</hi> by name, to make
the ſacred Veſſals.<note place="margin">7. 13.</note> In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Sauls</hi> Reign 'tis ſhown, that
there was not any workman,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 19.</note> who
knew how to forge Iron through
all the Land of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that
they were forced to go down to
the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> to refit their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Husbandry. The truth
is, this was an effect of the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
oppreſſion to hinder them from
making of arms. But ſeveral
years after, <hi>David</hi> was conſtrained
in his flight to take <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword,
which muſt have been ſomewhat
heavy for him, and that out
of the Tabernacle of the Lord,
where it was hung up as an eternal
Monument of his Victory. This
makes me believe, there were no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34948:34"/>
Arms to be bought. It is alſo
probable, that they ſold no Bread,
ſince on the ſame occaſion, the
Prieſt <hi>Abimelech</hi> was reduced to
give <hi>David</hi> of the hallowed
Bread: Which alſo ſhews, they
kept little bread in their Houſes,
peradventure by reaſon of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
heat of the Country.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 24.</note> In like
manner the Witch, whom <hi>Saul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed

ſhe might recover him from his
weakneſs. At <hi>Rome</hi> there were no

               </p>
               <p>Entring into the particulars of
Trades, we ſhould know, that
moſt were of no uſe at all to them.
Their plain way of Living, and

we cannot well be without,
and wherewith our womaniſh vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
rather than any real Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraits
do trouble and perplex us.
And as to things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
neceſſary, there were very few,
but which they knew how to make
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34948:35"/>
'emſelves. Whatſoever ſerved for

houſes. The women made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

from <hi>Calypſo</hi>'s houſe,<note place="margin">Od. 5.</note> it was
he alone that built and rigged out
his own ſhip. By which we may ſee
the wit &amp; humou of thoſe ancient
times. 'Twas an honour for every
one to know, how to do every thing
himſelf, that was uſeful to life, and
not to depend on another: And
this is, what <hi>Homer,</hi> moſtly calls
Knowledge and wiſdom. Now

of workmen of fine linnen, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of Potters, who wrought
for the King, and dwelt in his
Garden. All this ſhows the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
that was paid to arts, and the
care which was taken to preſerve
the memory of ſuch Perſons, who
applyed themſelves that way.<note place="margin">Iſai. 3. 3.</note> The

is that of the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi>
who deſcribing the affluence

                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 27.</note> than pure
Wheat, Oyl, Grapes, and Balm,
all Merchandiſes, which the Earth
it ſelf produces.</p>
               <p>Such were the Occupations of
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and their Manner of
Subſiſtance. Let us now go on
to ſomething more particular, and
deſcribe as far as poſſible their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
their Lodgings, their Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
their Food, and all their way
of Living. They roſe betimes
in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Scripture
ſhows in an infinite number of
Places, that is to ſay, as often as
mention is made of any important
action. From whence it proceeds,
that in it's ſtyle. <hi>To riſe betimes,</hi>
ſignifies <hi>to do a thing with care and

               <p>AS to the Habits of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
we cannot know exactly the
form of them. They made no
figures, and we cannot be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
of ſuch things but only by
the eyes. But we may gueſs at

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34948:37"/>
I do not only ſpeak of thoſe
<hi>Gothick</hi> Pictures, wherein all perſons
of what time and Country ſoever
are cloathed like thoſe, whom the
Painter was uſed to ſee, <hi>that is,
French</hi> and <hi>Almains</hi> two or three
hundred years ago: I ſpeak of the
works of the greateſt Painters, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Rafael, Pouſſin,</hi> with ſome
few others, who have ſtudyed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
and the manners of all ages.
The reſt of the Painters under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
no other Artifice than juſt to
paint the <hi>Levantines,</hi> ſuch, as they
ſaw them at <hi>Venice,</hi> and other Ports
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Hiſtories of the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the new Teſtament in the
garb of their own Country. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
as moſt part of the figures
of the holy Hiſtory are copyed
from theſe kinds of originals, they
have filled us with impreſſions
from our infancy, and we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to repreſent the Patriarchs
to our ſelves with Turbants and
Beards down to their girdle, and
the Phariſees in the Goſpel with
Bonnets and Pouches. In all this
there's no great harm to be miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en:
but 'tis much better not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34948:37"/>
be deceived. The Ancients uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wore long habits, as moſt people
in the world do ſtill at this day, &amp; as
they in <hi>France</hi> did but two hundred
years ago. It is much eaſier and
ſooner done to cover our ſelves at
one bout, than to cloath each part
of the body, one after another:
And thoſe long Veſtments have
more dignity in 'em and more real
beauty. In hot Countries they
have ever worn their habits large,
and have been in little pain to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their arms or legs, or to wear
any other ſort of ſhooes than Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins
tyed after different ways.
Thus their cloaths hardly had any
faſhion; being only pieces of Stuff,
that were made according to the
Largeneſs and figure, which the
habit was to have, where there
was nothing to cut, and little to
ſow. They did not alter their modes,
as at this day they do not change
them throughout all the <hi>Levant.</hi>
Beſides, women and young People,
who uſually invent Modes, had
there very little Authority. From
thence it comes, that they kept
ſuch great Magazeens of Cloaths,

They uſually gave two <hi>changes of

wherewith to vary, and might
wear one, while the other was

               <p>Their Stuffs were for the moſt
part made of wool. In <hi>Egypt</hi> and
<hi>Syria</hi> they wore linnen and cotton:
But ſilk was ſtill unknown in the

which did not become common on
this ſide the <hi>Indies,</hi> until above
five hundred years after JESUS

cloaths conſiſted in the colour or
fineneſs of the Stuffs. The white,
the Purple-red, and the Violet
were moſt eſteemed; and it ſeems,

of cloaths were fringes and
borders of Purple or Embroidery,
with ſome Claſps of Gold or Jewels
in places where they were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
Their magnificence conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in often changing, and in wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none, but what were very
neat and whole. Beſides we ſhall
not doubt, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were
cloathed very plainly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
how plain the Garments
were of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the time of their greateſt

               <p>The Habits, which the Scripture

                  <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Habit did only
conſiſt. The Tunick was large;
but when they were to walk or be
in action, they made uſe of a Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
Hence comes that Phraſe
ſo frequent in Scripture, <hi>Ariſe, Gird
up thy Loins, and do this.</hi> The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
had their heads cover'd with
a kind of a round and wreathed
ornament as well as the <hi>Perſians</hi> and
<hi>Chaldeans;</hi> for it was a token
of mourning to go bare-headed:
And they wore their hair; ſince to
ſhave the head was another mark of
mourning. As for the Beard 'tis
very certain, they wore it long,
by the example of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.</note>
whom <hi>David</hi> ſent to the King
of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and whom that
ill-adviſed King caus'd to be ſhaved
by way of affront: Inſomuch as
they were compell'd to remain
ſome time at <hi>Jericho</hi> to let their
beards grow, before they durſt
ſhow their faces. He alſo cauſed
their Garments to be half cut off
after a manner, which makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
they wore 'em long. They
bathed often, as People ſtill do in hot
Countries, and waſhed their feet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34948:39"/>
oft'ner than they bathed: for that
wearing only Sandals, they could
not walk without gathering up
duſt. And upon this account the
Scripture frequently ſpeaks of their
waſhing of their feet, when they
came into a Houſe, or went to eat
or to ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as water dries
the skin and hair, they anointed
themſelves either with plain Oyl

For this abſtinence from certain
meats was uſeful both for Health
and for Manners. It ſerv'd not
only to quell their unruly Spirits,
that God had impos'd upon 'em
that Yoke, but likewiſe to divert
them from things hurtful. They
were forbidden to eat of blood
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34948:45"/>
or of Fat; both being difficult to
digeſt. Swines fleſh is alſo very
heavy upon the Stomach. The
ſame holds good with thoſe Fiſh,
that have no ſcales, whoſe Fleſh is
oily and fat, whether it be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
as that of Eeles, or it be hard
as that of Tunnies, Whales and
other Fiſhes of that kind.<note place="margin">Paedag. 2. 1.</note> Thus

               <head>CAP. XII. Purifications.</head>
               <p>THe Purifications commanded
by the Law had the ſame
grounds with the Diſtinction of
Meats. Neighbouring Nations
practis'd them or ſuch like others;
and they were uſeful for Health
and for Manners. The cleanneſs
and neatneſs of the Body is a
Symbol of the purity of the Soul,
and is a pretty natural conſequence
of it: ſince that naſtineſs does
commonly proceed from Sloth,
from a contempt of others, and a
lowneſs of Heart.</p>
               <p>The external purification is in
Scripture called <hi>Sanctification;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it makes men ſenſible of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34948:46"/>
Interiour purity, wherewith we
ought to approach holy things.
Neatneſs is otherwiſe neceſſary to
maintain Health and prevent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
eſpecially in hot Countries.
And indeed men naturally are there
more cleanly: The heat inviting
them to ſtrip themſelves to bath,
and change their cloaths often:
Whereas in cold Climates People
dread the Water and Air, and prove
more dull and Lazy. Certain it is,
that the Sluttiſhneſs, wherein moſt
of our common people live, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the poorer ſort, and thoſe
within Cities, does cauſe and keep
on foot many and many Diſeaſes.
What would it be in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where the air is more eaſily
corrupted, and where water is
more ſcarce? Moreover the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
made little uſe of Linnen, and
Woollen is not ſo eaſily to be cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Let us admire herein the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and goodneſs of God, who
had given his People Laws ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways profitable: Since they
ſerved at once to accuſtome them
to Obedience, to reſtrain them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34948:47"/>
from Superſtition, to regulate
their manners, and to preſerve
their Health. It is thus, that in
the Structure of <hi>Animals</hi> and Plants
we ſee ſo many parts, which ſerve
for ſeveral uſes. Now it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
that the precepts of neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſhould make a part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For that conſidering the inner
Corners of Houſes, and the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
actions of life, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the fear of God, could
cauſe them to be obſerved. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
by theſe ſenſible things God
formed their Conſcience, and wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to acknowledge that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was concealed from him, and
that it was not ſufficient to be pure
only in the eyes of men.</p>
               <p>This is the foundation of thoſe
Laws,<note place="margin">Levit. 11. 3. 22.</note> which commanded bathing
and waſhing of cloaths,<note place="margin">Numb. 3. 24.</note> after the
having toucht a dead body or,<note place="margin">Lev. 14. 35.</note> an
unclean Creature,<note place="margin">Lev. 13.</note> and in ſeveral
the like encounters. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the Purifications of Veſſels

where there appeared any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Women after their lyings
in;<note place="margin">Evang. 40.</note> and the Separation of Lepers:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34948:47"/>
Tho the white Leper, which the
Scripture only mentions, is rather
a Deformity than a Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The Separation from Strangers
was a neceſſary conſequence of theſe
Laws. For altho moſt of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
People had likewiſe their
Rules for the choice of Meats and
for their Purifyings, they were not
the ſame. So that an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had
always a right to preſume, that
the Stranger he met withal, had
eaten of Swines fleſh, or of meats
offer'd to Idols, or had toucht
ſome unclean Beaſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was not permitted to eat
with <hi>Aliens,</hi> nor to enter into
their houſes. And this ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was likewiſe uſeful for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
ſerving as a Barrier againſt
their being too much with ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which is ever pernicious to
the Commonalty, and which was
much more ſo in thoſe conjunctures
of time by reaſon of Idolatry.
The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were extremely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to this Maxime: the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſhewing that they would not
eat with the <hi>Hebrews;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 43. 32.</note> and <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>
teſtifying,<note place="margin">Herod. 2.</note> that they would

neither Kiſs a <hi>Greek,</hi> nor make

thoſe, who have moſt of 'em, and

               </p>
               <p>Yet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

tho they comprehended them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
under the name of <hi>Gojim</hi> or
Gentiles. All Idolaters they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,
particularly the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.
For they were not the
only people, who practis'd Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;
it was in uſe among the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> and among all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants

               <p>AFter that way the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
liv'd, Marriage was no great
trouble to 'em: it was rather an
eaſe according to it's Inſtitution.
Laborious were the Women as
well as the men, and work't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Doors, while their Husbands
were imployed in the Field. The
Women dreſs'd the meat, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it up to the Table; which is
ſeen in <hi>Homer</hi> and ſeveral parts of
Scripture. When <hi>Samuel</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

               <p>It was the Women, that made

               <p>All theſe works are done pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately

Wherefore the Ancients did
not fancy them worthy to employ
men; and very kindly left 'em to
women, naturally more neat, more
ſedentary,<note place="margin">Jud. 8. 5.</note> and more addicted to
Little buſineſſes. They lived apart
from the men and much retired,
principally the Widows. <hi>Judith</hi>

               <p>The Marriages of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>

of Religion, that I know

or went to the Temple, or
ſent for Prieſts: All paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
their Friends or Relations;
nor was it other than a civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
As for the Circumciſion
of Children, that was in truth an
Act of Religion, and very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
when any one was to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the allyance of <hi>Abraham:</hi> But
it was likewiſe performed within
doors by Relations, without the
miniſtry of any publick perſon. In
all theſe Ceremonies take care we
muſt, not to let our ſelves be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by modern Pictures, as I
have already ſaid of Apparel.</p>
               <p>Far from fearing the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Children, the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>
did hugely deſire it. Beſides
their natural Inclination, the Law
gives great motives to it. They
knew, that God in creating the
World, and in repairing it after the
Deluge, had ſaid to mankind:
<hi>Encreaſe and Multiply, and fill the
earth.</hi> They knew, that to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
he had Promiſed an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
poſterity; and finally that
amidſt them was to be born the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34948:51"/>
SAVIOUR of the World. And
by thoſe ſordid Intereſts they were
not preſs'd, which in this age
make people look upon the bleſſing
of Marriage as a great misfortune.
Their frugal way of living was
the occaſion, that as long as their
Children were little, they coſt
'em little to feed, and yet leſs to
cloath; for in hot Countries they
often let 'em go naked: And
when they were bigger, they
helped them in their Labour, and
ſpared them Slaves and hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
Wherefore they had few
ſlaves in proportion.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Ziba</hi> the
Servant of <hi>Saul</hi> cultivated the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> with his
Fifteen Sons and twenty ſlaves.
They were not in pain to provide
for their Children; ſince there
was no Fortune to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and all their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to leave to their Sons
the Inheritance, they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their Progenitors, better
cultivated, if poſſible, and with
ſome Herds more.<note place="margin">Numb. 27. 8.</note> And their
Daughters, as they did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in defect of Males, were
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34948:52"/>
accordingly marryed rather for
allyance than for eſtate.</p>
               <p>Thus it was a Conveniency to
have many Children; as it was an
honour too. They deem'd that
man happy, who ſaw himſelf Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a large Family, and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with a great number of
Children and Grand-children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready to receive his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to execute his orders:
and they did not fear his name
would be Forgotten as long as his
Poſterity ſubſiſted. Thus when
the Scripture ſets down the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Children, 'tis uſually for
to commend the Fathers: as thoſe
two Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 10. 4. 12: 14.</note> of whom
one had thirty ſons,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 11. 21.</note> the other
forty with thirty Grand-ſons; as
<hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. 13. 21</note> of whom it reckons nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ſons, bating thoſe by Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines;
as <hi>Rehoboham,</hi> who
had twenty eight ſons and
ſixty Daughters; and <hi>Abijah,</hi> who
had two and twenty Sons and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Daughters. Thus did the
Poets crack of the fifty Children
of <hi>Priam:</hi> for the <hi>Greeks</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity
in no leſs eſteem. As
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34948:52"/>
Virginity was not yet known for
a virtue, in this State they only
conſidered the miſchief of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
and they thought thoſe maids
unhappy, who dyed without being
marryed.<note place="margin">Jud. 11. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Electra</hi> complains ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
hereof in <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and it
was the ſubject of the Regrets of
<hi>Jephtha</hi>'s Daughter. Wherefore
it was a ſhame for a marry'd wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be barren; as we ſee in
the mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> and many
others; and this misfortune they
looked upon as a curſe of
God.</p>
               <p>This care of Poſterity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the memory of the Dead
was the foundation of that Law,
which commands the Brother to
marry his Brother's widow, in
caſe he dyed without Children.
This right was eſtabliſhed in the
time of the Patriarchs, as appears by
the Hiſtory of <hi>Thamar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 38. 8.</note> and they
look'd upon it as a pious duty,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 6.</note>
that the name of the deceaſed
might not fall into oblivion. So
the Children were attributed to
him by a kind of adoption. From
thence come the two <hi>Genealogies</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:34948:53"/>
of JESUS CHRIST accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 1.</note>
For thus it was that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had two
Fathers;<note place="margin">Luke 3. 23.</note> the one by Birth, and
the other by this Adoption of the
Law. Beſides, this ſame marriage
with a Siſter-in-law was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the firſt natural right,
which allowed even the marrying
one's own Siſter, before God had
forbidden it.</p>
               <p>The deſire it was of having a
great number of Children, which
moved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to take ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wives at a time: altho they
were reſerv'd enough as to the uſe
of marriage. From it they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
not only during the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellies
and the other unfitneſs of
their wives, but during all the
time they were nurſes, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi>
moſt commonly during three years:
And we do not ſee, they could
diſpence themſelves from nurſing
their own Children. Wherefore
we ought not to think it ſtrange,
that God tolerated <hi>Poligamy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jud. 4. 19.</note>
which had been introduc'd before
the Deluge, tho it was contrary
to the firſt inſtitution of marriage.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34948:53"/>
For when it was inſtituted in the
Terreſtrial Paradice, there was
not yet any Concupiſcence: And
ſince that by the new law it was
raiſed to the dignity of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">As the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hold.</note>
'tis accompany'd with very
Strong graces; but in the interval
when grace was much leſs, and
that ſin reigned, it was the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God to uſe a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.
Wherefore 'tis with
<hi>Polygamy</hi> as with divorce, of
which JESUS CHRIST told
the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 8.</note> that in them it was
ſuffer'd for the hardneſs of their
hearts. Beſides their Wives they
were allow'd to have Concubines,
who uſually were Slaves. Above
them the Legitimate wives had
nothing more than the dignity,
which rendred their Children
heirs. So that the name of <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binage</hi>
did not ſignify Incontinency
as among us: it was only a leſs
ſolemn marriage.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Liberty was
ſo far from making Wed-lock more
commodious, that the Yoke was
the more heavy. An husband
could not ſo equally ſhare his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34948:54"/>
heart amidſt ſeveral wives, as to
give 'em all contentment. He
was fain to govern them with an
abſolute authority, as the <hi>Levan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
do ſtill at this day. In mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
there was no longer an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Friendſhip and of Society.
It was yet more difficult, that
Rivals could agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
There muſt needs have
been continual Diviſions, Cabals,
and Domeſtick Wars. All the
Children of one woman had as
many Step-mothers, as the Father
had other wives. Each one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
his mother's Intereſts and
look'd upon the Children of other
Women as Strangers or enemies.
Hence comes that manner of
Speaking ſo frequent in Scripture:
<hi>He is my Brother and the ſon of my
Mother.</hi> We ſee examples of theſe
diviſions in the Family of <hi>David,</hi>
and ſtill much worſe in that of
<hi>Herod.</hi> As to the Liberty of Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Divorce, it had likewiſe ill
conſequences. They more lightly
engaged and venturd 'emſelves the
leſs for one another; and the
multiplicity of marriages might
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34948:54"/>
riſe to ſuch an exceſs, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Palliated Debauch. 'Tis
well known, what a diſturbance it
occaſion'd at <hi>Rome</hi> after the fall of
the <hi>common-wealth;</hi> whereas that
as long as good manners were
kept up there,<note place="margin">Gell. 4. 3.</note> no Divorce was
ſeen untill the year 523: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Laws permitted it.
The Children alſo ſuffer'd very
much by it; they remained Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans
in their Parents life-time:
And hard it was for 'em to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the becoming odious to one
of the two, and the not ſiding with
the one or other.</p>

ſeems to have been much the

by Labour and Exerciſes, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34948:55"/>
their minds by Learning and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.
A great value they had
for ſtrength of Body; and 'tis the
moſt uſual commendation, that the
Scripture gives to warlike men;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2 3.</note>
as to <hi>David</hi>'s brave and ſtout Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.<note place="margin">Ejuſd. 18. 27.</note>
Foot-races muſt have been
one of their principal exerciſes,
ſince they knew people by ſeeing
them run afar off, as thoſe who
brought the news of <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat:
Moſt ſurely they muſt have
ſeen them run often. 'Tis alſo ſaid of
<hi>Aſahal Joab</hi>'s Brother,<note place="margin">2. 18. Zach. 12. 3.</note> that he ran
like a wild Roe. The Prophet
<hi>Zachariah</hi> ſpeaks of an heavy ſtone,
which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> takes for one of
thoſe Stones that ſerved to try the
Strength of men, by eſſaying
who ſhould raiſe it higheſt. So
that we may believe, they had too
that kind of exerciſe.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 20.</note> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhews, they uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
archery. But bodily exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
they never made an important
Occupation, as the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who
reduc'd it to an art, which they
term'd <hi>Gymnaſtick:</hi> becauſe they
exerciſed themſelves all naked, and
they ſought the utmoſt perfection
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34948:55"/>
in it. At great charges they
built places very ſpacious and
magnificent for exerciſes: They
had maſters, and under them a
great number of men for the
teaching young People. In ſhort,
there were among them <hi>Athletae</hi> by
profeſſion, taking up all their life-time
with thoſe exerciſes. To
fall into thoſe curioſities the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
were too ſerious: And it
was an odious novelty, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the moſt renown'd <hi>Antiochus</hi>
they built a <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> after the
<hi>Grecian</hi> mode in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Mat. 1. 15.</note> They
contented themſelves with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of a Country-life,<note place="margin">2 Mac. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 91. 2.</note> and with
ſome military exerciſes, as did
likewiſe the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither had they need of great
Study to form their wits, if by Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
we underſtand the knowledge
of Sundry Languages, and the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of many Books, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
underſtand it. Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongue
was ſufficient for them,
and that was the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> ſuch as
we ſee it in the Scripture. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Hiſtories and Poems were of
no uſe to 'em,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 4.</note> ſince theſe were
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34948:56"/>
full of the names of the Falſe
Gods, which they were not ſo
much as to utter. So that all their
Grammar conſiſted, as that of the
ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> in ſpeaking their
own tongue well, in reading and
writing correctly, with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
it did not appear, that they
had reduced it into Art, or learnt
it by Rules. Their Letters were
thoſe, we now call <hi>Samaritan,</hi> for
that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> have preſerved
them. And as they are neither
ſmooth nor eaſy to form, we may
queſtion, whether the art of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was very common among the
<hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo much the more in
that the Learned are called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<hi>Sopherim i.e. Scribes</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the moſt ancient Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And indeed a people given
to Husbandry have leſs need of
writing than Merchants and men of
buſineſs.<note place="margin">Deut. 66. 7. &amp;c.</note> But 'tis credible, the moſt
part knew how to read;<note place="margin">Joſ. 2. contr. App. 6.</note> ſince to
all it was recommended to learn the
Law of God, and to meditate on it
day and night;<note place="margin">Orig. cont. Celſum. lib. 4.</note> and this Study was
their ſole Occupation on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:34948:56"/>
That book was ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
them perfectly. In it they
ſaw the Hiſtory of the World till
their eſtabliſhment in the Land of
Promiſe, the Origine of all nations,
that were known to 'em, and
more peculiarly of thoſe, whom
they had moſt occaſion to know,
the Deſcendants of <hi>Lot, Abraham,
Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> In it they ſaw
all their Religion, the <hi>Tenets,</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and Precepts of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
It contain'd alſo their Civil
Laws. Thus that Book alone,
which is the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> or the five
Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> included all they
were to know.</p>
               <p>Not but they had many other
Books. For, that I may not ſpeak
of the Books of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> of the
<hi>Judges,</hi> of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of other
Sacred Writings, which were made
afterwards. In the time of <hi>Moſes</hi>
mention is made of a <hi>Book of the
Warrs of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 21. 14.</note> as alſo of a <hi>Book
of Jaſher.</hi> The Books of <hi>Samuel</hi>
and <hi>Kings</hi> do often refer to the
<hi>Chronicles of the Kings of Judah</hi> and
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſh. 10. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Parables, and five thouſand Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34948:57"/>
He made Treatiſes of all
<hi>Animals</hi> and Plants: And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

of Books, that were compoſed.
All thoſe Books,<note place="margin">Ecc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>lſ 12. 12.</note> and perhaps many
others we know not of, are loſt,
as well as thoſe of the <hi>Egyptians,
Syrians</hi> and other Eaſtern people.
The only Books, which remain
of that antiquity, are thoſe which
God himſelf dictated to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and which he had preſerved
by a Particular Providence.</p>
               <p>The other part of Studies was
Muſick, I judge thereof by the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> who from the <hi>Orientals</hi> had
taken all their Studies and all their
Politeneſs. Now certain it is,
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had all their
Children taught to ſing and play
upon Inſtruments: This ſtudy is
the moſt ancient of all. Before
ever Letters were us'd, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of great things was preſerv'd
by Songs. The <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi>
had that Cuſtome in the time of the
<hi>Romans:</hi> And the ſame Cuſtome is
ſtill kept up by the wild Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>America.</hi> Altho the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
had Letters, they knew, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34948:57"/>
words in meaſure and put into a
Song are always eaſilier remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
and from thence the great
care aroſe, which they took to
compoſe Canticles upon any thing
conſiderable that happened to
them; ſuch are the two,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
made,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> the one at the paſſage of
the Red-ſea,<note place="margin">Jud. 5.</note> and the other, when
he lay adying,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note> to recommend the
obſervation of the Law. Such is
the Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s
Mother, and many others;
and eſpecially the Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi>
Theſe Poems are of a wondrous
Inſtruction, full of God's Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
of the Memory of his Benefits,
of Moral Precepts, and all the
Sentiments which a good man
ought to have in all the different
States of Life. So that the moſt
important Truths, and the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
thoughts agreeably enter'd into
the minds of Children with Tunes
and Words.</p>
               <p>If we may judge of the goodneſs
of their Tunes by that of their
Words, they muſt have been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
excellent, grave and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
but touching and various. If
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34948:58"/>
we judge of 'em by the effects
Scripture ſeems to attribute to 'em,
ſuch as were ſupernatural. We
ſee their Muſick charm'd evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
by the example of <hi>Saul,</hi> who
found himſelf better, when <hi>David</hi>
play'd upon the Harp. We ſee
that the ſound of Inſtruments did
help the Spirit of God, which
moved the Prophets, by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of thoſe,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 5.</note> whom <hi>Saul</hi> met with
according to the Prediction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
and with whom he himſelf
enterd into Heavenly tranſports of
Joy; and by the example of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings. 3. 15.</note>
who call'd for a Miniſtrel,
that he might Prophecy. This
ſhews, that Muſick appeas'd the
motions of the Spirits and humours,
which the Devil had raiſed in thoſe
Perſons, God had permitted him
to poſſeſs; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
meeting with calm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate
hearts, it raiſed them up to
God, and inflamed 'em with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
diſpoſing them thus for
the better receiving the powerful
impreſſions of his Spirit. In like
manner the <hi>Greeks</hi> relate to us the
prodigious effects of their Muſick
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34948:58"/>
for exciting or for calming Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And we muſt either give all
Hiſtories the Lye, or confeſs, the
Muſick of the Ancients was much
more charming than ours.</p>
               <p>Not that it was rare amongſt them;
they were all Muſicians: And to
confine my ſelf to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and
not to ſpeak of thoſe who were
Muſicians by profeſſion, there were
in <hi>David</hi>'s time Four thouſand <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
deſtin'd to that employ only,
under the conduct of 288 Maſters;
the chief of whom were <hi>Aſaph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chr. 23. 5. 25. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Jeditſhun,</hi> ſo often named in
the Inſcriptions of the Pſalms. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
himſelf was a great Poet and
a great Muſician: And 'tis well
known, how much the inclination
of Kings ſerves to the advancement
of Arts. A great Diverſity they
had of wind and other Inſtruments,
whereof ſome had eight or ten
Strings, and their Tunes were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
with dances: for this
is the meaning of the word <hi>Chorus,</hi>
which the <hi>Latins</hi> have taken from
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and which amongſt
them ſignifyed a company of Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
dreſs'd and cloathed in one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34948:59"/>
and the ſame manner. They
Sang together, and danc'd a kind
of <hi>Brawles.</hi> They were coupled
according to their age and ſex,
young men, Maids, Women, Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
without intermixture with
one another. Now 'tis improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the dances of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
offended the Rules of Modeſty.
There is mention made of <hi>Choirs</hi> at
the Proceſſion, which <hi>David</hi> made
to transfer the <hi>Ark</hi> into <hi>Sion,</hi> and
on ſeveral occaſions of victories,
when the Maids went out of the City
Dancing and Singing.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt part of their ſtudies
did not conſiſt in Reading &amp; Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Leſſons, but in the Diſcourſes of
their Fathers and of their old men.
Who were obliged to inform their
Children of the great things, God
had done for them and their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers:
And it is for this reaſon,
that the Law commanded them ſo
often to explain to their Children
the Reaſons of the Feaſts and the
other Ceremonies of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 7. 20.</note>
Wherefore thoſe Inſtructions
applyed to ſenſible Objects, being
ſo frequently repeated, could not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34948:59"/>
fail of being ſound and ſolid. They
likewiſe taught them all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Agriculture, joyning to
their Leſſons a perpetual Practice:
And we ſhall not doubt, but they
were very knowing therein, if
we conſider, that during ſo many
ages they made it their ſole occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.
Now altho this art be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſ'd
among us by people of
groſs and unthinking Souls, yet it
contains a vaſt extent of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
much more uſeful to mankind,
than theſe <hi>Notions</hi> of the greater
part of Speculative men, who are
eſteem'd Learned. And tho for
knowledge we ſhould reckon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is written in Books, the
Ancients and Moderns have written
enough of this to give us a good
opinion of it. Thus an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi>
who by the Tradition of his Fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by his own experience, and
ſome reading had inform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of his Religion, the Laws
which were to regulate his life, and
the Hiſtory of his Nation; who
knew, how to procure to himſelf
all things neceſſary; who perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood the ſeveral qualities
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34948:60"/>
of Earth, and of Plants proper to
each; what courſe was to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with 'em, and in what Seaſon;
what precautiong were to be uſed
againſt the diverſe Accidents
which cauſe the Fruits of the Earth
to periſh, how they were to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and preſerved; who knew
the nature of Cattle, their Food,
their Diſeaſes, their Remedies, and
ſo many other the like things,
which moſt of thoſe are ignorant
of, who among us go for well-bred
and learned men: This hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>Iſraelite,</hi> methinks, is as much
to be valued, as a man brought up
either in Law or the Diſputes of
our Schools.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs there were ſome
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who more particularly
ſet themſelves to Study, and who
may have the appellation of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even according to our <hi>Ideas.</hi>
'Tis ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 12. 32.</note> that in the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
there were in the Tribe of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachar</hi>
Learned men, <hi>who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the times, what Iſrael
was to do.</hi> And by theſe words
Interpreters underſtand men, that
obſerved the Stars, and regulated
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34948:60"/>
the Feaſts, and all the order of the
year. The Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſaies
of the Prieſts in general, That
<hi>their Lips ſhould keep Knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and
that they ſhould ſeek the Law at his
mouth.</hi> So that one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Functions of the Prieſts was
to teach the People: As alſo the
Prophets applyed themſelves that
way. It was they alone, who
took upon them to write and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
Hiſtories. For among the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> as well as other <hi>Orientals,</hi>
Private perſons were not ſuffered
to have that Liberty,<note place="margin">Joſeph. cont. App. 1. 2.</note> which the
<hi>Greeks</hi> allowed them. None but
the Doctors deputed by publick
order, or the Prophets inſpired by
God were permitted to write.
Thus the moſt ancient Hiſtories
of the <hi>Romans</hi> were the Annals of
the <hi>Pontifices.</hi> We ſee by the
works of thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Authors,
how much they excell'd in Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Poetry. For I here
term Eloquence the Art of Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well on all manner of Subjects,
Hiſtories, Laws, Precepts, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>In point of Hiſtory they do no
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34948:61"/>
more than relate matter of Fact,
as clearly as is poſſible, without
mixture of Reaſoning or Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But when we examine the
buſineſs well, we ſhall find, that
they have with a marvellous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
choſen the Deeds, which
ſerve for their Deſign: By which
means their Hiſtories are very
ſhort; tho in places of Importance
they come to the leaſt Particular,
ſetting the Action before the eye,
and making their Perſonages ſpeak
directly, which renders their Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
very lively. We ſee, that
they on purpoſe retrench all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
and aggravations, in that
they know very well how to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them in diſcourſes, where
they would raiſe emotions. Thus
in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> does <hi>Moſes</hi> with the
greateſt and ſtrongeſt figures riſe
and amplify, what he had related
very plainly in the fore-going
Books. Thus does the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi>
barely rehearſe the Defeat of
<hi>Sennacherib,</hi> after having exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
it by foretelling it in
a Style that amounts even to
Poetry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:34948:61"/>
The Laws are written with
clearneſs and brevity; the Maxims
of Morality are contain'd in ſhort
Sentences, adorn'd with fit Figures,
and expreſs'd with a meaſured
Style. All which does likewiſe ſerve
to make them be remembred. In
ſhort, their Poetry is ſublime, the
Deſcriptions lively, the Metaphors
bold, noble the Expreſſions, and
the figures miraculouſly diverſifyed.
But whole Volumes it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to ſpeak worthily of their
Eloquence and their Poetry. Tho
they wrote by divine Inſpiration,
I don't believe it neceſſary to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
all their Eloquence to that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Cauſe. The difference
of Styles, ſhews, that the Holy
Ghoſt did make uſe of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
expreſſion to explain the truths,
which to them he dictated. And
what moreover ſhews this ſtyle to
be natural is, that the moſt Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of Profane Authors come very
near it. <hi>Homer, Herodotus, Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi>
ſpeak after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
We ſee in <hi>Pindar</hi> and in the
<hi>Choruſſes</hi> of Tragedies the boldneſs
and variety of Songs. The more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34948:62"/>
Ancient the <hi>Grecian</hi> Authors are,
the more they reſemble the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
in the difference of Styles accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of Works, and
in the brevity and propriety of
Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>You may, if you pleaſe, believe,
that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> wrote after this
manner by the ſole force of their
<hi>Genius</hi> and their exact judgment,
which made them reject all that
was not for the deſign of each
work, and employ what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to inſtruct or to move. For
my part, ſeeing they ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved the Diſtinction of
Styles, and ſo much to the purpoſe
employed all the ornaments of
true eloquence, I chuſe rather to
believe, that they had then ſome
rules drawn from the experience
of their Fathers, whether they
were written, or delivered dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
only by Tradition among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Let us not fancy the <hi>Greeks</hi>
invented Eloquence, and Poety.
At moſt they did but invent the
names of Figures, and that Art of
the <hi>Grammarians</hi> and <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi>
which never made Oratour or Poet.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34948:62"/>
Long before them were found out
the grounds of that Art. And
indeed the World was then pretty
old. It had laſted three thouſand
years before <hi>Solomon;</hi> and
it has continued as long ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a little more than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years. Until that time the
Life of man was long; and there
had not yet been any Deluges of
Barbarous Nations in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where Arts and Sciences did
begin.</p>

general, being ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
and ſo <hi>well born, that is,</hi>
in a Country, where men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
endowed with Wit, they
could not want Politeneſs. For
you muſt not imagine, that it is
incompatible with a Country-life
and with the Labour of the Body:
The example of the <hi>Greeks</hi> does
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34948:63"/>
but too well evince the contrary.
But the <hi>Greeks,</hi> living for the moſt
part in <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> were ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of their Liberty, that they
all carried themſelves as equals;
and their Complements only tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the teſtifying Eſteem and
Friend-ſhip, wherein they were
imitated by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
of the <hi>Orientals</hi> ſuited more
with ours, and ſhewed more Reſpect.
Thoſe they treated as Lords
whom they had a mind to honour,
made them Proteſtations of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and bowed before 'em even
to the proſtrating themſelves on
the Earth, which the Scripture
calls <hi>Worſhiping.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi>
did the like, even before they had
Kings, and in the days of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs:

All theſe examples are of Women,<note place="margin">Judith 11. 5. 6.</note>
uſually more Flattering than men.
Willingly and with delight they
made uſe of Parables and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>aenigmas</hi> or riddles in their
diſcourſes. Their language was
very modeſt, and conformable to
baſhfulneſs, tho after a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
different from ours. For they
uſed Far fetcht Circumlocutions for
things, which we bluntly ſpeak of
and with leſs caution. As when
they ſaid, <hi>The water of the Feet,</hi>
meaning urine; <hi>To open one</hi>'s <hi>Feet,</hi>
meaning, to go to Stool; and
when they name the <hi>Thighs</hi>
for the neighbouring part, which
is not to be named. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
they have expreſſions, which
ſound to us very harſh. They
ſpeak often of certain ſecret Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
in Men and Women, that
we ſhould not dare to name;
and without ſcruple name ſome
things, the names of which we
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34948:64"/>
very carefully avoid. All theſe
differences do only proceed from
the diſtance of times and places.
The greateſt part of words, which
are uncivil according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
uſe of our Tongue, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
civil, having other ſorts of
<hi>Ideas</hi> annext to 'em: And at
this day the <hi>Levantines,</hi> eſpecially
the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have ridiculous
niceties for certain beaſtly things,
which do nought concern manners,
while they give themſelves all
manner of Liberty in the moſt
infamous Pleaſures. But to come
to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 'tis likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
that they ſpoke more
freely of what concerns the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
of Marriage, in regard none
among 'em renounced it, and thoſe
who wrote were very Serious men,
and generally advanced in years.</p>

               <head>CAP. XVI. Of their Pleaſures.</head>
               <p>THeir mild and quiet life joyn'd
to the beauty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
did incline them to Pleaſures.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34948:64"/>
But their Pleaſures were ſenſible
and eaſy; having few others, but
thoſe of good Chear and Muſick.
Their Feaſts, as I have ſaid, were
of plain Meats, which they took
at home, and their Muſick coſt
them leſs, moſt of 'em being Skill'd
in playing upon Inſtruments. The
good old <hi>Barzillai</hi> only reckon'd
theſe two Pleaſures,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 25.</note> when he ſaid,
he was too old to Reliſh Life; and
the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> compares that
entertainment to a Carbuncle ſet
in Gold.<note place="margin">Eccles. 32. 78:</note> Thus <hi>

vow amongſt the <hi>Phaeaces,</hi> that
he knew no other felicity than a
Feaſt accompanied with Muſick.
The ſame pleaſures we ſee in the
Rebukes which the Prophets gave
to thoſe Perſons,<note place="margin">Amos 6.</note> who miſuſed them.
But they added thereto the exceſs
of Wines,<note place="margin">Iſai. 5. 11. 12.</note> Crowns of Flowers, and
perfumes,<note place="margin">Iſa. 28.</note> as we ſee was practiſ'd
by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> We
ſee the particulars of their Perfumes
in the Canticles, and other parts
of Scripture: But chiefly in the
Law,<note place="margin">Exod. 30. 29.</note> where it preſcribes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of two ſorts, which were
to be offer'd to God, the one dry,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34948:65"/>
the other Liquid; and thoſe
druggs were the moſt Odoriferous
that were known, before the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that, when Scripture would ſhew a

               <p>Their application to Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
did not permit them to make
Feaſts every day, and every day to
take their pleaſures, as moſt part of
our wealthy People do now: But it
ſerved to make 'em reliſh them the
better. Thus they had times of
Rejoycing, their Sabbath-days; and
all the other Feaſts ſet down by
the Law, Marriage, ſharing of
booty after the Victory, Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhearing,
the Harveſt and the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
in each particular Territory,<note place="margin">Iſai. 9. 3. 16. 10.</note>
where the Neighbours aſſembled

it is, that the Feſtivals of <hi>Bacchus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and <hi>Ceres</hi> had their riſe among the
<hi>Grecians</hi> from ſuch occaſions of Joy
whereof there are Traces ſtill ſeen
in Countries where Vine-yards
are. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had no prophane
ſights. They contented themſelves
with the Ceremonies of Religion
and the preparation of <hi>Sacrifices;</hi>
which muſt needs have been very
magnificent; ſince the Temple was
the moſt ſtately building in all the
Country, and there were above
thirty two thouſand <hi>Levites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined

               <p>I do not ſee, they uſed either
Gaming or Hunting, which we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

As for Gaming, it ſeems, they were
abſolutely ignorant of it, the very
name being not ſo much as found
in all the Scripture. Not but
that the <hi>Indians</hi> had already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Games,<note place="margin">Herod. 1</note> if, what we are
told of them, be true: But ſtill at
this day the <hi>Arabians</hi> and other
<hi>Oriental</hi> Nations do not Play at

Hunting or Fowling, they were
not unknown to the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> But
they applyed themſelves that way
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34948:66"/>
leſs for pleaſure than for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of furniſhing their Tables,
and the ſaving and preſerving their
Corn and their Vineyards. For
of Traps and Snares they ſpeak
often; and we do not find, that
even their Kings were provided of
Dogs and other equipages for that
Sport. Undoubtedly they would
have rendred themſelves very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
ſhould they have rid or run
over their till'd Lands, or kept
any creature, that might have done
miſchief. The great chaces are

               <head>CAP. XVII. Their Mourning for the Dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </head>
               <p>AFter their Rejoycings, let us
ſpeak of Mourning, and the
marks of Affliction. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
went not into Mourning only
for the death of their Relations,
but as often as any misfortune
hap'ned to them: And their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34948:66"/>
Mourning did not ſolely conſiſt in
changing Cloaths. The cauſes
of Mourning were either publick
Calamities, as a Mortality, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Famine, or an invaſion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
or particular Misfortunes,
the death of a Relation or a Friend;
if he was dangerouſly ſick, or in
Captivity; or if one was accuſed
of an hanious crime. The ſigns of
Mourning among the <hi>Iraelites</hi> were
to rent their Garments, as ſoon as
they heard of Ill-news, or when
they hap'ned to be preſent at ſome
great evil, as a Blaſphemy or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other ſin againſt God; to beat
the Breaſt, to put their hands
upon their head, to uncover it,
and to caſt duſt and aſhes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
inſtead of Perfumes, which they
us'd on occaſions of Joy; and
laſtly to ſhave the Beard and Head.
On the other ſide, the <hi>Romans,</hi>
who were wont to ſhave, let their
hair grow in time of Mourning.
As long as that laſted, they were
neither to anoint or waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
but to wear ſordid and
torn apparel, or Sack-cloath, <hi>that
is to ſay,</hi> a ſtraight and narrow ſuit,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34948:67"/>
without foldings, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
diſagreeable. They call'd
them <hi>Cilices,</hi> becauſe they were
made of coarſe Camlet, or of
ſome ſuch like coarſe and heavy
Stuff. They had their feet bare
as well as their heads, but their
Faces covered. Their Mourning
was attended with faſting: That
is,<note place="margin">Ezech. 24. 17.</note> as long as it continued, they
either did eat nothing at all, or
they did not eat till after the Sun's
ſetting, and then very common
Meats and ſome Pulſe, and drank
nothing but Water. They remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhut up, ſitting on the Ground,
or lying on aſhes; kept a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilence; never opened their
mouths, unleſs to lament, or Sing
Doleful Songs. The Mourning
for the Deceaſed generally laſted
ſeven days, and ſeldom any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
But Widows there were,
who continued their Mourning all
their days, as <hi>Judith</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> the
Propheteſs.</p>
               <p>Thus their Mourning was not as
ours, a meer Ceremony, of which
only People of Qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty do regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
acquit themſelves. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34948:67"/>
all the natural Conſequences
of a real Grief; for men in great
afflictions take no care to deck or
keep themſelves neat; hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeak, without it be in Plaints;
do not ſhew themſelves openly, but
ſhun all Divertiſements. I believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there were amongſt them, who
only as it were mimicked Mourning
&amp; did all theſe things without being
much concern'd. But at leaſt thoſe
that were really ſo, might freely
ſatisfy themſelves. Now in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
both the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and all the
Ancients were more natural, than
we are in theſe matters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
themſelves much leſs as to
the exteriour Demonſtrations of
their paſſions. They Sang, they
Danc'd on occaſions of Joy: On
thoſe of grief they wept, they
groaned aloud. When they were
in fear, they ingenuouſly confeſt
they were ſo: When they were
in choler, they vented it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
<hi>Homer</hi> and the <hi>Tragick</hi>
Poets afford us examples hereof
on all occaſions. Philoſophy and
Chriſtianity have ſince very much
corrected that outſide in all thoſe,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34948:68"/>
who have had Education and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs:
They are exerciſed from
their Youths to ſpeak like <hi>Heroes</hi>
or like Saints: But the moſt part
are never the better at the Bottom
but only diſſemble their Paſſions
without ſtriving againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Funerals</hi> will ſuit well with
Mourning. All the Ancients took
a particular care of them; and
lookt upon it as a great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
when the Bodies of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who had been near and
dear to them, remain'd expos'd to
be torn and devour'd by Beaſts or
Birds, or to be corrupted openly,
and infect the Living. Whereas

the aſhes, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> interred
the common People, and embalmed
the moſt conſiderable Perſonages
to put them into Sepulchers. They
embalmed much after the ſame
faſhion as the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the corps with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of drying drugs: Then put
them into Tombs, which were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Caves or Cloſets cut out in
Rocks, whereof each had a Table
of the ſame Stone, on which they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34948:68"/>
laid the Body. Several of thoſe
Sepulchers ſtill remain, whereof
we may ſee deſcriptions in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of Travellers. Altho Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
were a pious Duty, yet they
were not attended with any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Religion: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it was a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which rendred all thoſe unclean,
who had any ſhare therein, untill
they were purify'd: Which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from that Dead Bodies are

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34948:70"/>
Scriptures of the Old Teſtament,
(and in the <hi>Apocrypha;)</hi> but not
ſo clearly, as that all the People
knew it. Nor indeed were men
yet capable of receiving ſuch ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
truths.</p>
               <p>But according to my Deſign, I
muſt only explain, what their
external practiſes of Religion had
moſt different from our Principles
and Manners. They had but one
Temple and one Altar, where it
was permitted them to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to God; which was a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mark of God's Unity: And
for the repreſenting likewiſe his
Sovereign Majeſty, that Building
was the moſt magnificent in all that
Country. The Temple <hi>within the
Veil</hi> was on the in-ſide adorned
with Sculptures, and all overlaid
with Plates of Gold. True, it
was not very large: But the
Courts, Galleries and diverſe Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which belong'd to it, for
the Lodging of Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi>
for the keeping Treaſures and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Veſſels; the Magazines of
Oblations, the Kitchins, the
Rooms to eat in, and the reſt; all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34948:71"/>
this together made a great maſs
of buildings, which being form'd
in ſymmetry and rare Architecture
gave a mighty <hi>Idea</hi> of that great
King, who was ſerved in that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Palace. And to render it's
Sanctity the more ſenſilbe, none
but thoſe who were pure, were
allowed to go upon the mount of
the Temple. The Women had
their place apart: The <hi>Gentiles</hi>
were only in the outward Court:
The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were plac'd in one
more advanced. That, where
the Altar was, was only for the
Prieſts: They did not go into the
Temple within the Veil, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to offer Incenſe and Loaves, and
to kindle the Lamps: But none,
ſave the High-Prieſt entred into
the moſt Holy Place, and that too
but once a year.</p>
               <p>We are offended at the Bloudy
Sacrifices, which made the Temple
a Slaugher-houſe and Kitchin: But
the ſame thing was done by all
Nations. Beſides, the proper
functions of the Prieſts were only
to ſprinkle the Blood, kindle the
Fire, and put thoſe portions upon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34948:71"/>
it, which were to be offered up.
It was the parties, that kill'd the
Sacrifices, who prepared them, cut
'em to pieces, and cauſed them
to be broil'd:<note place="margin">Levit. 15. 11. &amp;c.</note> Which we ſee in the
Law and in the Hiſtory of the
Sons of <hi>Heli.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 13.</note> However the Prieſts
did the ſame functions at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Sacrifices,<note place="margin">Jerem. 1. 13.</note> that were offer'd
for all the People. Hence come
thoſe Figures,<note place="margin">Ezech. 24. 3, 4. &amp;c.</note> which might ſeem
to us low and mean in <hi>Jeremy</hi> and
<hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to whom God repreſents
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Image of a <hi>Pot.</hi>
Thoſe two Prophets were Prieſts,
and accuſtomed to ſee the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
Meats made ready. Now
whatſoever ſerved to the worſhip
of God and the execution of his
Law, they eſteemed great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And beſides it was ordinary for
the beſt ſort of people to work with
their own hands, and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to do, as I have ſaid, the
things neceſſary for life. So in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
the great King <hi>Agamemnon</hi>
kill'd the Lambs himſelf,<note place="margin">Iliad. 3.</note> the
blood of which were the ſeal of
the Treaty, he made with the
<hi>Trojans.</hi> So King <hi>Neſtor</hi> Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34948:72"/>
to <hi>Minerva,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Odyſſ. 2. in fin.</note> his Sons killed
the Victime, cut it to pieces, and
broyl'd them, <hi>Homer</hi> is full of the
like examples.</p>
               <p>Moreover, all that is preſcrib'd
in the Law touching the quality;
and form of Sacrifices, did tend
more to hinder Superſtition and
reduce the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſo ſmall a
number of Ceremonies, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
new ones. The Idolaters
Sacrific'd many more ſorts of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures and in many more
places; ſince they had Temples
and Altars every where, and each
Family had it's Domeſtick Gods
and particular Superſtitions. Thus
God a long while before-hand
prepared his People to aboliſh thoſe
bloody Sacrifices, often telling
them at the ſame time by his
Prophets, that they were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
nor eſſential to Religion,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 22.</note>
and that the worſhip,<note place="margin">Pſ. 50. 8. &amp;c.</note> moſt pleaſing
to him, lay in praiſes and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the Hearts.</p>
               <p>It was neceſſary, that the Prieſts
ſhould be marryed, (if it were
only upon this account;) ſince
the Prieſt-hood was eſtabliſhed in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34948:72"/>
the Family of <hi>Aaron:</hi> But they
were parted from their Wives,
during the time of their Service.
We do not ſee, that any function
of civil life was interdicted them;
and they bore arms as well as
others.<note place="margin">Deut. 20.</note> They performed the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Office of Trumpeters both in
the Army and every where elſe.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 13. 12.</note>
For they made uſe of Silver Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
to give notice of the Feaſts,<note place="margin">Numb. 10.</note>
and to call the People to publick
prayers:<note place="margin">Joſ. Bel. 5. 9.</note> And the name of <hi>Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
comes from a <hi>Rams-horn</hi> which
was ſounded to make known the
opening of that Feaſt. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> kept up this
Cuſtome of Sounding the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
to ſhew the hours of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
For the uſe of Bells is of a
later Date.</p>
               <p>The Feaſts of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were
the Sabbath of each week,<note place="margin">Levit. 23.</note> the
firſt day of each month,<note place="margin">Numb. 28. 29.</note> call'd
with us the <hi>Calends</hi> or <hi>Nehomenis,</hi>
becauſe they reckoned their
moneths at leaſt in the later times
from the day the Moon began to
appear. They had likewiſe three
Solemn days, the Paſſeover, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34948:73"/>
and the Feaſt of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
eſtabliſhed in memory of three
great bleſſings, which they had
received from God, their going
forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law, and their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
in the Land of promiſe.
The Sacrifices were multiplyed on
Feaſt-days: But they offered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day two Lambs for an <hi>Holocauſt</hi>
both Morning and Evening:<note place="margin">Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Sacrifice. Their year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of twelve months, of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days each, much like to ours.
It was thus regulated ever ſince
<hi>Noah,</hi> as appears by the dates of
the Deluge; but 'tis credible,
that it then began at the Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Equinox. Moſes</hi> was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to begin it in the Spring in
the Month <hi>Abib,</hi> which was that
of the Paſſeover: And with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
it is to that Month, that the
others are computed, which are
only named by their number. They
correſpond much with our <hi>Roman</hi>
Months, the names whereof come
from the Ancient year, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in the Month of <hi>March.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:34948:73"/>
Thus the eight Month is <hi>October</hi>

were held there, and the moſt
venerable Elders exhorted the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to confeſs their Sins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
On thoſe days were kept
no Weddings, and even Husbands
abſtained from their Wives. The
Law had commanded but one
day alone for Faſting,<note place="margin">Levit. 16. and 27.</note> the Tenth
of the ſeventh Month,<note place="margin">Zach. 8. 19.</note> which was
the Feaſt of Expiation: But in
and from the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Zechariah</hi> they reckon'd two
others, one in the fifth Month and
the other in the Tenth. They
had ſeveral extraordinary ones,
ſome in the publick calamities, as
was the Famine <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeaks of;
others in particular afflictions, as
the Faſts of <hi>David</hi> for the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:34948:74"/>
They were very Religious in
obſerving their Vows and their
Oaths. As for their Vows,<note place="margin">Jud. 11. 35.</note> the
example of <hi>Jephta</hi> is but too
ſtrong;<note place="margin">Joſ. 9. 29.</note> and for their Oaths, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi>
kept the promiſe he had

founded upon a manifeſt deceit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had Sworn to 'em in the

                  <hi>Saul</hi> would
have put his Son <hi>Jonathan</hi> to
death for having violated the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
he had made with an
Oath; tho <hi>Jonathan</hi> only ſin'd out
of Ignorance. We find among
them ſeveral other the like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Very ſeriouſly they made
thoſe Solemn Promiſes, and gave
themſelves no Liberty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them. To ſwear by the
name of God was an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
ſince that Oath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13. 10. 20.</note>

Oaths.<note place="margin">Levit. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Their vows did ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in offering to God ſome part
of their eſtates, whether to ſerve
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34948:75"/>
for Sacrifices, or to be kept in
reſerve. Hence came thoſe vaſt
treaſures in the Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 26. 28.</note>
which beſides the offerings of
<hi>David</hi> contain'd thoſe of <hi>Solomon,
Saul, Abner,</hi> and <hi>Joab.</hi> For thoſe
oblations principally conſiſted of
Spoils, taken from their enemies.
The like did the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the
Temples of their Gods, whether
after Victories or on other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
Whereof I will give no
other example than the Temple
of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and the riches, which
<hi>Craeſus</hi> ſent thither to make the
Oracle favour him. The moſt
conſiderable Vow was that of the
<hi>Nazarites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herod. 1.</note> which for a time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
it's votaries neither to
drink Wine,<note place="margin">Numb. 6.</note> nor any thing that
inebriates, nor to cut their hair;
and to keep themſelves very
charily from all Legal Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
particularly from the approach
of Dead Bodies. The rule of
the <hi>Recabites</hi> ſeems to have had it's
foundation from ſuch kind of
Vows.<note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 15.</note> The Author of that Rule was
<hi>Jonadab</hi> the Son of <hi>Rachab,</hi> who
lived in the time of <hi>Jehu</hi> King of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34948:75"/>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> and of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet.<note place="margin">Jerem. 35. 6.</note>
He forbad his Children to drink
Wine, to build houſes, to ſow,
or have Lands or Vineyards. So
that they dwelt in Tents; in all
probability employing themſelves
as the <hi>Levites</hi> did in breeding
Cattle, and in perfectly imitating
the Paſtoral life of the Patriarchs.
They were marryed, and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
kept that Rule in their

years; for we do not find what
became of them after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>

which prophecy'd in the preſence
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and which ſeems to

ſo many as from the time of
<hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſhah</hi> until the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity

Miracles of that Prophet ſhew,
that his Diſciples lived in <hi>Society,</hi>
that of the Pottage of herbs,
when he took away it's bitterneſs,
and that of the Barly-loaves,
which he multiplyed; wherein we
may likewiſe ſee the Frugality of
their diet. There were even an
Hundred Prophets, who lived
in that Community and <hi>Fellow-ſhip.</hi>
They workt with their own
hands: For finding themſelves too
much crowded in their Lodgings,
they went themſelves and cut
wood to build withal, and they
were ſo poor, that one of them
was fain to Borrow an Ax.</p>
               <p>The apparel of the Prophets was
Sack-cloath, the habit of Mourning,
to notify, they did penance for
the ſins of all the People. So in
the Deſcription of <hi>Elijah</hi> 'tis ſaid,

ſome of them, were marryed;

for to ſhow, he did not Prophecy
by profeſſion, but by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

God made uſe of thoſe,
who led a Prophetical Life, to
make his will known; yet he did
not impoſe upon himſelf a Law of
not making Revelations to others.
In the mean while they only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
thoſe for Prophets, who
lead their kind of life: From
whence it comes, that the Books
of <hi>David, Solomon</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> are
not placed in the rank of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
by reaſon, the two former
were Kings living in great delights
and ſplendour, and the Latter
was a <hi>Potentate</hi> Living likewiſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34948:78"/>
at Court and amidſt great
People.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the men, who after
the Patriarchs preſerved the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
Tradition of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They ſpent their time in
meditating on the Law of God, in
praying to him ſeveral times day
and night for themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and exerciſed 'emſelves in
the Practice of all Virtues. They
inſtructed their Diſciples, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them the meaning of the
Law, and explained the divine
ſence, which concerned the State
of the Church after the coming
of the Meſſias either upon Earth
or in Heaven, couched under <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories</hi>
of ſenſible things, and low
in appearance. They alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
the people, who came to
them on Sabbath-days and other
Feaſts.<note place="margin">2 Kings 2. 23.</note> They chid them for their
Sins, and exhorted 'em to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and often in the name of
God foretold what ſhould befall
them. This Liberty of ſpeaking
the harſheſt truths, even to Kings,
made them odious, and coſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of them their Lives.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34948:79"/>
However there were many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors,
who counterfeited the
out-ſide of true Prophets, wore
Sack-cloth as well as they, and ſpoke
in the ſame Style, ſaying of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
likewiſe, that they were
inſpired by God:<note place="margin">Zech. 13. 4.</note> But they took
care not to make any Predictions,
but ſuch as were acceptable to the
Prince and his People. The falſe
Gods had alſo their Prophets, as
the 850,<note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 19.</note> whom <hi>Elijah</hi> cauſed to
be put to death. Of the ſame
Leven were thoſe Sooth-ſayers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whom they
call'd <hi>Manties,</hi> as <hi>Calchas</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſias</hi>
in the Heroical Times. Such
were thoſe, who uttered Oracles,
or who ſpread them abroad, and
the Poets, who pretended to be
<hi>in-blown</hi> by the Gods. For they
did not ſay it in a Poetical ſenſe,
but to have it really believ'd:
And indeed thoſe falſe Prophets,
whether by the Operation of the
Devil, or by artifice, entred into
a fury and ſpoke in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Style, to emulate the ſenſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
which the Spirit of God
made in the true Prophets. Now
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34948:79"/>
the temptation was great to the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo weak in virtue, to
conſult thoſe Sooth-ſayers and
falſe Oracles; and it was a
Branch of that Idolatry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they were very ſubject, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the time we ſpeak
of.</p>

               <p>THis Crooked inclination to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
appears to us very
ſtrange and very abſurd in the
Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> and it
is that, which does moſt of all
perſwade us, they were a groſs
and brutiſh People. We ſcarcely
ſee now any Idolaters: We only

Countries: But all the People,
who ſurround us, <hi>Jews, Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> profeſs
the Unity of an Almighty God:
The meaneſt ſort of Women, the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34948:80"/>
moſt ignorant and heavy Louts,
know diſtinctly this truth; ſo that
we conclude, thoſe, who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral Gods, and worſhipped
Stocks and Stones, ought to be
placed in the loweſt form of the
moſt ignorant, dunſical, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
men. Nevertheleſs Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
we cannot term the <hi>Romans,
Greeks, Egyptians, Syrians,</hi> and the
other people of Antiquity; all
whoſe Arts, Sciences and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſs
are derived down to us, and
for which we are much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to them: And we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that Idolatry domineer'd
among them with an abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
at a time, when as to other
things they were moſt ingenious
and polite. Wherefore we muſt
pawſe a little here, and dive into
the Source and Fond of this
Evil.</p>
               <p>The Wit of man is ſo much
darkned ſince the Fall, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the ſtate of corrupted
nature. He does not apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to any Spiritual <hi>Idea:</hi> He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thinks of Body and Matter,
and reckons all that does not fall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34948:80"/>
under his ſenſes, for nothing.
Nought appears ſolid to him, but
what ſtrikes his groſſeſt Senſes,
the Taſt and Feeling. We ſee it
but too plainly in Children and
men, who follow their Paſſions:
They have no value but for what
is Viſible and Senſible: All other
things ſeem to 'em meer Caſtles in
the Air. And yet theſe men are
brought up in the true Religion;
in the knowledge of one God, of
the Souls Immortality, and of a
Future life. What then could
thoſe Ancient <hi>Gentiles</hi> think, who
had never heard a Syllable of theſe
things, and to whom their great
Sages only preſented ſenſible and
material Objects? Read <hi>Homer,</hi>
as long as you pleaſe, that great
Divine and great Prophet of the
<hi>Grecians;</hi> and you will not find
the leaſt tittle therein to conjecture,
that he thought of any thing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
or Incorporeal.</p>
               <p>And truly all their Wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
it ſelf to what concerns the
body and the ſenſes. The <hi>Gym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick</hi>
exerciſes of the body,
which they made ſo much their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34948:81"/>
buſineſs did only aim at preſerving
and augmenting Health, Strength,
Dexterity, and Beauty, and they
brought that Art to the higheſt
pitch of Accompliſhment. Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
Painting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Architecture
regard the pleaſure of the Eye;
and ſuch great Maſters were they
in thoſe Arts, that their Houſes,
their Cities and all their Countries,
were full of agreeable Objects, as
we may ſee by the Deſcriptions
of <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> They alſo excelled
in Muſick; and tho Poetry ſeems
to reach further than the Sences,
it is ſtinted to the Imagination,
which has the ſame Objects and
produces the ſame Effects. Their
moſt Ancient Laws, and their Rules
of Morality do all likewiſe refer
to bodily things, that each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Perſon ſhould have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to live handſomely; that
men ſhould marry ſound and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Women; that the Children
ſhould be brought up to have ſtout
Bodies, and that chiefly for War;
that every one might be in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in reſpect of Strangers or Ill-Citizens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:34948:81"/>
They thought ſo little of the
Soul and 'its Spiritual Goods, that
they did it a great deal of harm
for the prefectionating of the
Body. It is evidently againſt
modeſty, that the Young-men
ſhould appear all naked in publick
to exerciſe themſelves in the Eyes
of all the World: This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
nothing; and the Women
too in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> exerciſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in that manner. Very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
alſo it was to expoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Pictures every where of
all kind of Nudities, even the
moſt infamous; and the danger
was very great, eſpecially for
Painters and Carvers, who work
to the Life: However they were
oblig'd to content the pleaſure
of the Sight. Thus we know,
to what point of Diſſoluteneſs and
Lubricity the <hi>Greeks</hi> attained by
thoſe means. Among them the
moſt abominable Wantonneſs was
not only in uſe but in Honour.
Muſick and Poetry, beſides their
fomenting of thoſe Vices, did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
excite and maintain Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
and mortal hatred among the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34948:82"/>
Poets, the Actors and the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
And particular perſons
were often branded, Lampoon'd,
and expoſed by Forgeries and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Raileries. But they were not
much netled or ſcandaliz'd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
they had fine Songs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Sights.</p>
               <p>It was the ſame, as to their
Religion: It only conſiſted in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Ceremonies, and was injurious
inſtead of being advantageous to
good manners. And the ſource
of all theſe miſchiefs was, that man
had forgot himſelf, and his imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
ſubſtance. There was kept
up among all people a conſtant
Tradition, that there was a more
excellent Being than man, capable
of doing him good or evil. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but Body, they would
needs have that Being, <hi>h. e.</hi> the
Deity, to be alſo Corporeal, and
by conſequence, that there were
ſeveral Gods; to the intent
there might be ſome of them in
each part of nature; that each
Nation, each Town, each Family
might have their peculiar Deities.
They imagin'd them like immortal
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34948:82"/>
men; and to make 'em happy, they
attributed to them all the pleaſures,
without which they fancy'd no
happineſs, and that even to the
moſt ſhameful Debaucheries:
Which afterwards ſerved to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
their Paſſions by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of their Gods. It was not
enough to imagine them either
in Heaven or upon Earth; they
would ſee and touch them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they honour'd their Idols as
the Gods themſelves, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
they were thereto fixed
and therein incorporated: And
they reverenc'd thoſe Statues ſo
much the more, as they were
more ſine or more Ancient, or
had ſome other Singularity, which
made them the more Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
               <p>Their Worſhip was conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their Belief. It wholly
turned upon two Paſſions, the Love
of Pleaſure, and the fear of ſenſible
Ill. Their Sacrifices were ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
followed by Feaſts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Muſick and Dances.

was to take care of ſacred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and Stage-plays; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in time of War they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
themſelves more, and were
in greater expence for thoſe things
than for the War it ſelf. Thus
their Religion was not a Doctrine
of Morality,<note place="margin">Demosth. Philip. Aug de verâ Rel.</note> as the true Religion
was. In caſe ſome Juſtice was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
Oaths, Hoſpitality and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyles</hi>
were not violated. In caſe
men acquitted themſelves faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their vows, and they were

they were then Religious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

was ſo far from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by their Religion, that it
was in ſome meaſure commanded.

'Twas neceſſary to be drunk for

               </p>
               <p>Thus it was that they honoured
the Gods, whom they eſteemed
favourers of Mankind and doers
of good. But as to the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Deities, <hi>Hecate,</hi> the <hi>Eumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
Deſtinies and others, of
whom their Fables made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
they were to be appeaſed
by Nocturnal Sacrifices and the
moſt horrible and inhumane Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.
Some there were,
who buried men alive: Others
offer'd up Children, and ſometimes
their own, as thoſe Adorers of
<hi>Moloch</hi> did, ſo much deteſted in
Scripture. 'Tis to that fear and
dread, we muſt refer all their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and troubleſome Superſtitions, as
to let out their own blood with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cets
or to cut themſelves with
Knives, as did the falſe Prophets of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34948:84"/>
and the Prieſts of <hi>Cybele,</hi> and to
faſt, to bath in cold water, and
the like. Thereby they thought to
divert the private miſchiefs or
publick calamities, with which
they were threatned by Oracles,
Dreams or Prodigies according to
the explication of their Divines.
They believed them to be Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
againſt Diſeaſes, the Peſtilence,
Hail, and Famine. Now in thoſe
matters they choſe rather to do uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
things, than to omit what
are uſeful. All their Luſtration
or Expiation of Sins lay in that
kind of painful Ceremonies: It
conſiſted in purifying the Body by
Water or by Fire, and in making
certain Sacrifices: But there was
no talk of Repentance or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it will ſeem ſtrange, that
a people ſo enlightned as the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
ſhould fall into ſuch groſs Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions,
and ſhould ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſo eaſily amuſed by
Aſtrologers, <hi>Augurs</hi> and ſo
many other ſorts of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-tellers.
But we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that until the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:34948:84"/>
and the reign of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
they had not made any
great progreſs in thoſe Sciences,
which might cure Superſtition.
They had improv'd the Arts very
much; they had very good Laws:
in a word, they had brought
to an high perfection, whatever
renders Life commodious and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.
But they had not ſo
much applyed themſelves to Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Sciences as <hi>Aſtronomy, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
and <hi>Phyſicks.</hi> The <hi>Anatomy</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
and Vegetables, the Search
of Minerals and Meteors, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Earth, the courſe of
the Stars, and the whole <hi>Syſteme</hi>
of the World were ſtill very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Myſteries. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who only now knew
ſomething of 'em, made them a
great Secret, and only ſpoke of
them in Riddles, and blended an
infinite number of Superſtitions and
Fables with them.</p>
               <p>As thoſe Sciences principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Experiments of the
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> the following Ages do
always add to them; and they are
at preſent in a greater Perfection,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34948:85"/>
than they have ever been. They
are taught publickly to all, that
will apply themſelves that way,
and they ſuit mighty well with
our holy Religion, which condemns
all Superſtition, Divination and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.
And yet we find too many
who liſten to Aſtrologers and
that kind of Impoſtors. I do
not only ſpeak of Peaſants and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deots,
the Dregs of the People,
but of Women, who pretend to a
large State of Wit, Politeneſs and
Knowledge, and of men brought
up in the light of the beſt Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who in other points ſhow
themſelves great &amp; daring wits, and
will not yield to the Authority of the
true Religion. What was it then,
when all theſe Fooleries compoſed
a great part of Religion? when
Sooth-ſayers really paſs'd for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
men? when <hi>Aſtrology, Pyroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Necromancy</hi> and the reſt were
Divine Sciences? How could peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
reſiſt the Authority of Prieſts
and Falſe Prophets, who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeriouſly related a great number
of former Tryals in confirmation
of their Doctrine, and whom
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34948:85"/>
whole Nations ſo blindly follow'd?
They muſt needs give credit to
them, ſeeing they knew not, how
things could naturally come ſo to
paſs, and tho any one ſhould have
had that knowledge, he muſt be
very bold, that durſt have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
them.</p>
               <p>Thus this Inclination to Idolatry
was not peculiar to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi>
it was an Univerſal evil: And
that hardneſs of heart, for which
the Scripture ſo often rebukes
them, does not conſiſt in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more addicted to ſenſible
things than other Nations, but in
their being as much as they were,
after having received particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
from God, and having
ſeen great Miracles. Moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was requiſite to have a
ſtrong force of mind to reſiſt the
ill example of all other Nations.
When an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was out of his
own Country among Infidels, they
ſeeing him neither offer Sacrifices
nor worſhip Idols, accuſed him of
having no Religion at all; and
when he ſpoke to them of his God,
the Creator of Heaven and Earth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34948:86"/>
they had him in deriſion and asked,
from whence he came. Theſe
reproaches were hard to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:
<hi>David</hi> himſelf does teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,<note place="margin">Pſ. 42<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3</note>
that during his Exile, his
<hi>Tears were his meat day and night,
while they continually ſaid unto him,
where is thy God?</hi> Weak Spirits
were ſtaggered by theſe Attacks,
and often could not cope with
them. The Propenſity we have
to pleaſure, augmented the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
For the Feaſts of the
<hi>Pagans</hi> were both magnificent and
frequent. Curioſity eaſily carries
away young People, eſpecially
Maidens, to go ſee Pomps and
Proceſſions, the order and tricking
of the Victims, the dances and
<hi>Choirs</hi> of Muſick, and the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Temples. There
ſtill was found ſome officious
Stranger or other, who engag'd
them to take place in the Feaſt,
and to eat of the meats offered to
Idols, or to come and Iodge in his
Houſe. This gave occaſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and Amours, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
either in a meer Debauch
or in a Marriage againſt the Law.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34948:86"/>
Thus did Idolatry inſinuate it ſelf;
the ordinary Charms whereof were
good Victuals and bad Women.
Thus in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Daug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the <hi>Medianites</hi> engaged the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> in thoſe deteſtabl Myſteries
of <hi>Belphegor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fumb. 29.</note> And thus Strange
Women perverted <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Law of God
might ſeem to them too Severe.
It did not Permit them to Sacrifice
but in one place by the hands of
the Prieſts, and according to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
very ſtrict rules: And there
were but three great Feaſts through
the whole Year, the Paſſeover,
the Pentecoſt, and the Feaſt of
Tabernacles. This was but a
ſmall thing for People, who lived
in Abundance, and in a Climate
that inſpires Pleaſures. However,
dwelling in the Country, and being
employed in Husbandry, they
could not aſſemble conveniently
but at Feaſts. Wherefore they
muſt either borrow from Strangers,
or invent new ones. We, who
believe our ſelves ſo Spiritually
given, and who without doubt
ought to be ſo, if we were really
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34948:87"/>
Chriſtians, do not we often prefer
the Poſſeſſion of ſenſible benefits
before the hopes of eternal good?
and do not we ſtrive to reconcile
with the Goſpel ſundry Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which all Antiquity has
judg'd incompatible therewith,
and againſt which our Inſtructors
never ceaſe to declaim? True,
we abhor Idolatry; but we do not
ſee it any where (without it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Papiſts,)</hi> it having been
entirely decryed for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years. We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
believe, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were
more ſtupid than other People,
becauſe the repeated favours,
which they received from God,
did not cure them of Idolatry:
But we muſt acknowledge, that
the wound of Original ſin was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deep, ſince ſuch holy Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſuch great wonders were
not ſufficient to elevate men above
ſenſible things. And Beſides, we
ſee, that other People the moſt
illuminated in other things, as the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> were alſo
without Compariſon more blinded

In their Country were neither
<hi>Homages,</hi> nor <hi>Cenſives,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints
for Hunting or Fiſhing,
nor any of thoſe different ſorts
of Subjection, which among us are
ſo uſual, that great men themſelves
are not exempt from them; ſince
we ſee Soveraigns, who are Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
and even Officers of other
Soveraigns, as in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Thus they enjoy'd that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
ſo much cheriſh'd by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> and it was
their own fault, that they did not
always preſerve, and enjoy it. It
was the intention of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the reproaches <hi>Samuel</hi>
made them on his behalf,<note place="margin">1 Sim. 10. 18.</note> when
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34948:88"/>
they demanded a King. <hi>Gideon</hi> was
well inform'd of this; for that
when they would have made him
King, and ſetled the Kingdom
on his Poſterity,<note place="margin">Jud. 8. 23.</note> he generouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
Anſwer: <hi>I will not rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you, neither ſhall my ſon rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you; the Lord ſhall rule over you.</hi>
So that their State was neither
<hi>Monarchical</hi> nor <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> nor
<hi>Demccratical;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Contr. App. 6.</note> but (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> calls
it) a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> that is to ſay,
God himſelf govern'd them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
by the Law he had given
them. So long as they were
faithful in obſerving it, they lived
in ſafety and in Liberty. As ſoon as
they broke it to follow their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inclinations, they fell into
Anarchy and Confuſion.<note place="margin">Jud. 17. 6. 21. 25.</note> This is,
what the Scripture ſhows, when
it ſets it down for the Cauſe of the
greateſt crimes: <hi>In thoſe days there
was no King in Iſrael, but every man
did that which was right in his own
eyes.</hi> This Anarchy divided and
weakned them, and gave them up a
Prey to their Enemies, until that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to themſelves, they had
recourſe to God, who ſent 'em
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34948:88"/>
deliverers.<note place="margin">Jud. 2. 11. 12. &amp;c.</note> Thus it was that
they lived under the Judges, falling
from time to time into Idolatry
and Diſobedience to the Law of
God, and by thoſe means into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and ſlavery, ſtill recovering
themſelves from time to time. In
ſhort, they choſe rather to have a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
than to remain in Liberty by
faithfully keeping the Law of
God.</p>
               <p>Their Liberty, being reduced
to it's juſt bounds, conſiſted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to do all that the Law of
God did not prohibit, and in not
being obliged to do but what it
commanded, without being ſubject
to the Will of any Particular man.
But the Domeſtical Power of the
Fathers of Families was very great
over their Slaves and their Children.
Some <hi>Hebrews</hi> were ſlaves to their
Brethren, and the Law ſet down
two cauſes, which might bring
'em into that condition, <hi>Poverty,</hi>
which conſtrained them to ſell
themſelves,<note place="margin">Levit. 25. 39.</note> or the <hi>Treſpaſs of a
Thief,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 3.</note> who had not wherewith to
make Reſtitution. It ſeems, this
latter cauſe does extend to other
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34948:89"/>
Debts by the example of that
Widow,<note place="margin">2 Kings 4. 1.</note> whoſe Oyl <hi>Eliſha</hi> Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
to the end ſhe might have
wherewith to pay her Creditors,
and keep her Children from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;
nevertheleſs thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi>
ſlaves might become free after ſix
years,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 2</note> to wit, in the <hi>Sabbatical</hi>
year:<note place="margin">Levit. 25. 40.</note> And if they would not
make uſe of that Priviledge, they
had that of the <hi>Jubile,</hi> to be free
after fifty years, and to preſerve
their Childrens freedom. It was
recommended to treat them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and rather to make uſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might kill their
ſlaves with impunity;<note place="margin">Inſtit. de Fur Perſ. 3. §. 3.</note> and that
right was then common to all
Nations. For Slavery proceeded
from the right of War, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of killing Enemies, they choſe
rather to ſpare their lives, that
they might have their Service. So
they ſuppoſed, that the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
had always a right of taking
away their lives, if they rendred
themſelves unworthy of them;
that he acquired the ſame right
over their Children in regard they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:34948:89"/>
could not have been born, if he
had not preſerved the Father;
and that he tranſmitted that right,
when he alienated his Slave. This
is the foundation of the Abſolute
Power of Maſters, and it was
ſeldom, that they miſuſed it: For
their own Intereſt obliged them
to preſerve their Slaves,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 20. 21.</note> who made
part of their eſtate. This is the
reaſon of that Law of God for
not punniſhing him, who had ſtruck
his Slave after ſuch a manner that
he dyed thereof ſome days after.
<hi>He is his money,</hi> ſaid the Law;
meaning his own Loſs did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
puniſh him. But if he kills
him down-right upon the Spot,
it declares him culpable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is more Humane than the
Laws of other People, who made
not that diſtinction.<note place="margin">Inſtit. de his qni ſui. v. al. 1.</note> The <hi>Romans</hi> had
during above five hundred years
the Right of putting their Slaves
to Death and their Debtors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Irons in default of Payment,<note place="margin">Inſtit. quib. mod. jus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pat. § 6.</note> and
of ſelling their own Children even
thrice, before they went out of
their Power, and all this by virtue
of thoſe wiſe Laws of the <hi>Twelve
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:34948:90"/>
Tables,</hi> which they brought from
<hi>Greece</hi> at the ſame time, when the

years after <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Paternal Power of the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 7.</note> the Law permitted 'em
to ſell their Daughters: But that
ſail was a kind of Marriage, and if
a Son was diſobedient and debaucht
the Elders of the City condemned
him to dy,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> and he was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtoned to death.<note place="margin">Heliod. 1.</note> That very
Law was practiſed at <hi>Athens,</hi> but
at <hi>Rome</hi> the Fathers had a long
time the Power of life and Death
over their Children as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Slaves. This ſo rigorous
right was grounded upon the
Children's holding their Lives from
their Parents, and they ſuppoſed
there would be none found ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
as to cauſe their Children
to periſh, if they did not commit
the moſt horrible Crimes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that fear was very uſeful to
keep Children in an intire ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The <hi>Romans</hi> Law was really
exceſſive in giving to the Fathers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34948:90"/>
of Families that power of life and
Death by their private Authority
without participation of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
or of the Publick. But
fallen we are to the oppoſite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
ſuffering that Paternal
Power to ſink to nothing. How
young ſoever a Son be, as ſoon
as he is Married, or has means
of ſubſiſtance without his Father
preſently he pretends he owes
him nothing more than a little Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.
From thence comes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Multiplication of Little Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
and of People, who live
alone, or in Places, where all are
equally Maſters. Thoſe young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
People, if they be poor,
become Vagabonds, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
perſons, capable of all
manner of Crimes; if they be rich,
they plunge themſelves into riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vices, and are ruin'd. Beſides
the corruption of Manners this
Independence may alſo cauſe great
Mischiefs in the State: It being
much more difficult to govern ſuch
a multitude of Seperate and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, than a ſmall number of
Heads of Families, each of whom
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34948:91"/>
did anſwer for a great Number of
men, and was uſually an old man
inſtructed in the Laws.</p>

               <p>NOt only the Fathers, but all
the old men had a great
Authority among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and
among all the People of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In every Country of the
World, they choſe at firſt Judges
for private Affairs, and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

It rarely happens, that

an old man, provided he has

                  <hi>Wo unto thee, O Land,

               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> began

want proof, when they had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certain ſolemn Words in the

People, and they had call'd ſome
Citizens to witneſs in particular,
who were of an <hi>Honeſt, i.e.</hi> hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable
Condition, and of an untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>We may ſay, that among the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> the Gate was the ſame
thing with the Exchange or the
<hi>Forum</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> The
Market for Commodities was held
at the City-Gate.<note place="margin">2 King. 7. 1.</note> Which we ſee
by the Prophecy of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who
ſoretold, that on the Morrow
Victuals ſhould be at a low rate at
the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Samaria.</hi> That Gate
had a place, which muſt have been

there four hundred falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.<note place="margin">2 King. 22. 10.</note>
I believe, it was the ſame
with orher Cities; and thoſe
Gates had ſome building where
were ſeats for the Judges and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
For it is ſaid, that <hi>Boaz</hi>
went up to the Gate, and ſat
down there;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 33.</note> and when <hi>David</hi> had
learnt the Death of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he
went up to the Chamber over
the Gate to weep. That Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
might be the place of Privy
Council, and ſecret Deliberations.
After all theſe examples we need
not wonder, that the Scripture
Idiome has <hi>the Gate</hi> ſo often for the
Judgement-ſeat or the Publick
Council of each City, or for the
City or State it ſelf; and that in
the Goſpel <hi>the Gates of Hell</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Kingdome or Power of the
Devil.</p>
               <p>As the Law of God regulated
both Temporal and Religious
Matters there was no diſtinction of
Tribunals: The ſame Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
caſes of Conſcience, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
Civil or Criminal Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
So that their Officers were
few in compariſon of thoſe at this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34948:96"/>
day in <hi>France,</hi> where 'tis a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing to be a meer private
Perſon, and to have no other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
than of improving one's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and governing one's Family.
Every body would be in a Publick
Capacity, would have honours,
prerogatives, and priviledges:
And Offices are conſidered either
as Trades, which maintain men,
or as Titles, that diſtinguiſh them.
But if we would only eye, what
is Eſſential in 'em, <hi>that is,</hi> the
Publick Functions real and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
we ſhould ſee, they, might
be officiated by a ſmall number of
Perſons, leaving them alſo time to
beſtow on their Private Affairs.
This was the Practice of all People of
Antiquity, and Principally of the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> among whom I find no
other publick Officers than the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Naſim Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim</note>

                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 9. 25.</note> they were ſmall with two

Example. By exact rules they

the ſame order; and they
had their Standerds in the ſame

for the neatneſs of their Tents,
which was ſo neceſſary in ſo hot

The <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſet a great value

               <p>From the time of <hi>Joſhua</hi> unto

God raiſed up in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

But they were only obeyed by that

This made them deſire a

to wage War for them. And truly

But moreover in granting to the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> the poſſeſſion of thoſe
ſenſible goods, and in profuſely
heaping upon them whatever
might compoſe the felicity of this
Life, God has given to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
the means of being diſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and of conceiving much more

pretend to be happy under the Sun

queſtion, but all that paſſes here,
is vanity after the Aſſertion he

make us ſufficiently ſee, that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
goods are not only vain but
dangerous, not only unfit to fill
the heart of man, but proper to
corrupt it? What reaſon have we
to flatter our ſelves, that we ſhall
make a better uſe of them, than
that People ſo cheriſhed by God,
and ſo well inſtructed, who ſeem
to have more right to thoſe kind of
Bleſſings, ſince they were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

of God's Law:<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 17.</note> And the
Complaiſance, he had for 'em,
carry'd him even to Idolatry.
His Subjects followed ſo great an
Example, and from this time
the Manners of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:34948:104"/>
fell more and more into Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Diviſion of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> did ſtill
Augment the Miſchief. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
was much greater in <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
where Idolatry reigned, the ſource
of all manner of Sins: Revolts
and Teaſons were frequent there.
In <hi>Judah</hi> the Scepter departed not
from the Family of <hi>David:</hi> There
were ſundry pious Kings, Prieſts, and
<hi>Levites,</hi> who retired thither, and kept
up there the Obſervation of the
Law much purer, with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the true Religion. In
thoſe Later times, when the Law
was contemned, Commerce and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
with Strangers became
very frequent, and chiefly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Succours in War; which is
the foundation of the manifold
Reproaches, that the Prophets
made 'em of the little Confidence,
they had in God. The Strangers,
they moſt ſought to, were the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi>
and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> two the
moſt powerful Nations at that time.
And to pleaſe them, they imitated

Manure and till the Lands; and
yet thoſe that were left,<note place="margin">Ibid. 4. 3</note> were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away into <hi>Egypt</hi> a little while

               <p>As to thoſe, who were carryed
to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they were Slaves to
the King and to his Sons,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 20.</note> as we
find in Scripture. For ſuch was
then the Law of War. All that
were taken in Arms, all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of a City forced or rendred
upon Diſcretion: and of the open
Country dependant thereon, were
Slaves to the Conquerour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain'd
to the Publick or the

them, according to the Laws ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in every Country for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
and the <hi>Dividend</hi> of the
Booty. So at the Sacking of <hi>Troy</hi>

Slaves, even Queen <hi>Hecuba</hi> and the

with the like examples. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
put Irons on the Kings, who

Slew them, after they had ſhown
'em in Triumph. They ſold the
People by Inch of Candle, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34948:106"/>
diſtributed the Lands among their
Citizens, whom they ſent thither
to ſettle Colonies; which was
undoubtedly a means to ſecure
their Conqueſts. Nor the <hi>Jews</hi>
nor the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſo hardly
treated by the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi>

kinſman <hi>Raguel,</hi> and his friend <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bael,</hi>
and at <hi>Babylon Joacim Suſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
Husband. It appears alſo by
the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> that the
<hi>Jews,</hi> tho Captives, had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their Law even to the
eſtabliſhing of Judges, who ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
life and Death.</p>
               <p>However it was impoſſible, but
that their being thus intermingled
with Strangers ſhould cauſe a great
change in their Manners, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
Whereof one of the moſt
fundamental was to be ſeperate
from Strangers. Several were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with to worſhip Idols, to
eat forbidden Meats, to Marry
ſtrange Women; and they all
conform'd themſelves to their
Maſters in Indifferent things, as is
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34948:106"/>
the Language. Thus during the
ſeventy years of the Captivity,
they forgot <hi>Hebrew;</hi> ſo that none
but the Learned underſtood it:
And their vulgar Tongue was <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack</hi>
or <hi>Chaldee,</hi> ſuch as we meet
withal in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes
on the Scripture, which
were afterwards made, that the
People might underſtand it. They
changed alſo their Letters: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of the Ancient ones, which
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> have preſerved, they
took thoſe of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which
we call <hi>Hebrew.</hi>

at one time. A great number of

other places, where they found

returned, were not all <hi>Jews:</hi>
Some few of the ten Tribes were
joyned to them; and yet taken all
together, they made up but a
ſmall company. The firſt, whom
<hi>Zorobabel</hi> conducted,<note place="margin">1 Eſdr. 2. 64.</note> did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

twelve hundred thouſand Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-men?
There likewiſe came
back about fifteen hundred,<note place="margin">Ibid. 8.</note> and
we may judge, there were ſeveral
other Troops.</p>
               <p>Under the firſt Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi>
they were very Feeble; hated by
Strangers their Neighbours, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> expoſed
to their affronts and Calumnies,
and ready to have their throats
cut by their Enemies upon the
leaſt order of the great King, as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34948:107"/>
we ſee by that cruel Edict, which
<hi>Haman</hi> obtained againſt them,<note place="margin">Eſth. 3. 12.</note> and
from the direful Effects whereof they
were preſerved by <hi>Eſther.</hi> Unable
were they to finiſh the building
of the Temple untill twenty years
after their firſt Return; and it
took 'em up above ſixty years
more to compleat the Walls of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was thus fourſcore
years in Re-eſtabliſhing. They did
what they could to find out their
ancient Inheritances, and to keep
up the old diviſions of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
For that purpoſe <hi>Eſdras</hi>
gathers all the <hi>Genealogies,</hi> that are
in the beginning of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi>
where he principally enlarges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the three Tribes of <hi>Judah, Levi</hi>
and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and very carefully

For the peopling <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
they received all ſuch as
were willing to dwell there;
which without doubt diſtracted
the order of the <hi>Partages:</hi> Yet it
was juſt, that thoſe preſent ſhould

would not return, or who were
no more to be found. So in the

were; they had preſerved their
<hi>Genealogies,</hi> as we may ſee by that
of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was but a poor
Artiſan. The Prieſts eſpecially
were very careful to ally them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
only to Women of their own
Tribe;<note place="margin">1 Contr. App. 2.</note> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſhows the
precautions, they uſed therein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in his time. To return to
their Reeſtabliſhment, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
muſt needs have been very
poor, ſince <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who lived
at the ſame time, comprizes <hi>Syria,
Phaenicia, Paleſtine,</hi> and the Iſle of
<hi>Cyprus</hi> under one Government,
which payed to <hi>Darius</hi> no more
than three hundred and fifty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
Tribute, as one of the leſſer

               <p>By little and little the <hi>Jews</hi>
Reeſtabliſhed themſelves, and in
the reſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy
they lived very peaceably in a kind of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34948:108"/>
Republick, govern'd by the High
Prieſt and the Council of Seventy
one Elders. They had never been
ſo faithful to the true God; and
ſince their Return from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
there was no more talk of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
amongſt them. So ſenſible had
they been made by that ſevere
puniſhment, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſo many Prophecies. 'Tis
true, the <hi>Apoſtates</hi> had the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to continue among the Infidels;
yet thus there appeared no <hi>Jews,</hi>
but ſuch as were really ſo.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> began then to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi>
and <hi>Syria,</hi> whither they often tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled,
and they gained much by
this commerce, if we may believe
the moſt ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors,
as <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus.</hi>
For they aſſure us, that
the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets, Legislators and
Philoſophers learnt their beſt
Doctrines of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Solon</hi> made a Voyage into

gave the <hi>Athenians,</hi> had a great
coherence with the Laws of <hi>Moſes.
Pythagoras</hi> was a long time in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Egypt,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:34948:109"/>
and went to <hi>Babylon</hi> in
<hi>Cambyſes</hi>'s time; ſo that he had
ſeen the <hi>Jews,</hi> and might have
converſed with them. <hi>Plato</hi> ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſeveral years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he
makes <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpeak ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things, founded upon the
Principles, which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught,
that we may conjecture, he had a
knowledge of them. The <hi>Jews</hi>
did really practiſe, what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
beſt in his <hi>Common-wealth</hi>
and in his Laws; every one to
live by his own Labour, without
Luxury and Ambition, without
being liable to be ruined, and
growing too Rich, Counting Juſtice
for the greateſt good, avoiding all
change and novelty. In the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>
we find examples of that <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi>
whom he wiſhed for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

The <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo much the leſs

               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> were ever
much addicted to Husbandry, to
the breeding of Cattle, and to the
Management of a Country-Farm.

               <p>THen it was, that the difference

A little after the Death of <hi>Judas
Macchabaeus</hi> and under his Brother
<hi>Jonathas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſ. 12. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. 9. 18.</note> they began to talk of
<hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees.</hi> To the
Text of the Law the <hi>Phariſees</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Traditions of their Fathers,<note place="margin">2 War. 12.</note>
which had been preſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
writing; and tho at the bottom
they maintained ſound Doctrine,
they huddled in it many Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The <hi>Sadducees</hi> took the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
literally, and pretended, it
did not oblige 'em to believe the
Reſurrection or the Immortality of
the Soul; or that there were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Spirits. So that they only
ſerved God for Temporal Rewards,
and gave ſcope to the Pleaſures of
ſence. Moſt part of the Grandees
and the Rich men were <hi>Sadducees,</hi>
and ſeveral among the Prieſts.
The Populace was more favourable
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34948:120"/>
to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for their external
ſhow of Piety; and Queen <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andra</hi>
gave them a great power
during the Minority of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>There was a third Sect that of

                  <note place="margin">See. Joſ. 2.</note> whoſe Doctrine we
don't ſee was different from the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. War. 12.</note> but their Manners were
more pure. In good earneſt they
applyed themſelves to the Study
and Practice of Virtue, they lived
very retir'd, far from Cities:
Their Eſtates were in common,
their Food very plain. They
ſpent much time in prayer, and
the Meditation of the Law. Their
way of Living did much reſemble
that of the Prophets and <hi>Rechabites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of greater Fruits but of Leſſer Herbs,
Cummin,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23</note> Mint, and Annis. They
took mighty Care to waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;<note place="margin">Mar. 7. 4.</note>
and to purify their Cups;
their Veſſels, and all their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables.
They kept the Sabbath
with ſo much Scruple, that they
took it ill, if People ſhould rub
Ears of Corn as they paſt by.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note>
They faſted often,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 12</note> and many of 'em
twice aweek, Monday and Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.
On their Forehead and their
left Arm they wore Writings,
wherein were ſome Paſſages of the
Law: For it was thus, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the letter they took
the Commandment of having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Law of God before their

wore thoſe Scroles much bigger

might be known to the People.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34948:121"/>
They gave Alms in publick,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2. 5. 16.</note> they
prayed in the Market Places and
they coloured their face with
yellow, that they might
ſeem to faſt the more. They
thought it a great Injury to be
toucht by an Impure Wretch, and
they held for ſuch not only the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> and the Notorious Sinners,
but all thoſe that exerciſed odious
Profeſſions. In ſhort, all their
Devotion was only Pride and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:
They ſeduced Ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by their fine Diſcourſes, and
bigotted Women, who threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Eſtates,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 14.</note> to enrich them:
and under the Pretence, they were
the People of God, and the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
of his Law, they deſpiſed
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and all the
Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Books we ſee ſtill
thoſe Traditions of the Phariſees
whereof they made then ſo horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Myſtery, and which were
written about an Hundred years
after the Reſurrection of JESUS
CHRIST. 'Tis impoſſible for
thoſe, that have been brought up
in other Maxims to imagine the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34948:122"/>
frivolous and impertinent Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherewith thoſe Books are
ſtuffed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the Sabbath day to mount
on an Aſs to carry him to Water,
or whether you muſt hold him by
the Neck; whether one might
walk the ſame day Lands newly
ſowed, ſince he runs a hazard of
carrying away ſome Grains with
his feet, and conſequently of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. Concerning the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of old Leven before the
Paſſeover; whether it be neceſſary
to renew the purifying of an
Houſe, when you have ſeen a
Mouſe paſs in it with a Crum of
Bread; whether it be Lawful to
keep paſted Paper, or a Plaiſter,
wherein there is any Flower; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after the old Leaven is burnt,
it be permitted to eat, what has
been baked with the coals, which
remains thereof. And a million of
other caſes of Conſcience of the
like force, which the <hi>Talmud</hi> is
full of with it's Commentaries.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> forgot the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Grandeur of the Law of God,
to apply themſelves to low and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34948:122"/>
pitiful things: And they were
found very groſs and very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in Compariſon of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
who in their Schools treated of
more uſeful and more elevated
Queſtions, or in Phyſicks or Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and who had at leaſt a ſweet
Politeneſs, if they had not Vertue.
Not but that there were alway
ſome <hi>Jews</hi> more curious than others
to ſpeak <hi>Greek</hi> well, who read the
Books of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and imbibed
their Learning in <hi>Grammer, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
and <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Such was <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtobulus</hi>
a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philoſopher
and Preceptor of <hi>Ptolomee Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metor.</hi>
Such were <hi>Eupolemus,
Demetrius,</hi> and the two <hi>Philo's.</hi>
There were <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> alſo, who
wrote in <hi>Greek,</hi> and after the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
manner, as <hi>Jaſon</hi> the <hi>Cyrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
and the Authour of the Second
Book of <hi>Maccabees,</hi>

at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where moſt of thoſe
<hi>Jews</hi> were, who Studied the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The other
<hi>Jews</hi> contented themſelves with
ſpeaking <hi>Greek,</hi> to be underſtood,
<hi>that is,</hi> groſly, and keeping the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34948:123"/>
turn of their own Tongue.
And 'tis in that Barbarous <hi>Greek</hi>
the New Teſtament is written.
The Apoſtles and Evangeliſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themſelves with a clearneſs
and brevity of Style, deſpiſing all
the Ornaments of Language, and
making uſe of what words were
the moſt proper to be underſtood
by the Common People of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Inſomuch as for the well
apprehending their <hi>Greek,</hi> 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to know <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Syriack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> of theſe latter times
were much exerciſ'd in reading of the
Law and the holy Scripture. They
thought it not enough to explain
it literally: They found out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſeveral figurative ſenſes by Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories
and divers Appropriations.
We ſee it not only in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
and the Writings of the
moſt Ancient Fathers, who have
diſputed againſt them,<note place="margin">V Juſtin. in Tryph. Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſith. rabba. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> but in the
<hi>Talmud,</hi> and the oldeſt <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Commentaries on the Law, which
they call <hi>the great Geneſis, the great
Exodus,</hi> and ſo of others. Thoſe
Figurative ſenſes they held by
Traditions from their Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:34948:123"/>
But in ſhort, the Manners of
thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> were very bad and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much corrupted. They were
ſillily proud of being of the Race of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; pufft up with the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Meſſias his Reign, which
they knew to be at hand, and
which they formed to themſelves
all full of Vanquiſhments and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Proſperity. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed,
avaricious and ſordid, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the greateſt
Hypocrites. They were unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and inconſtant, always ready for
Sedition and Revolt, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of caſting off the Yoak
of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In a word, they
were violent, Boyſterous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
as we ſee by what they made
JESUS CHRIST and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
ſuffer, and by the unheard
of Mischiefs they did to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
both during all the Civil Wars
and the laſt Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

All thoſe holy Perſonages, and

in <hi>Heart</hi> as well as Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
were Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
much rather by imitation of his
Faith than by their own Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
With a moſt ſteady Faith

impatienly for the Redemption of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the coming of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
after which they long'd and

belived the Reſurrection, and the
