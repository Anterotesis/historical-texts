            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And firſt, concerning the Coin of Silver, there are theſe things conſiderable therein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Authority or Power that gives it its Stamp, Weight, Denomination and Value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Matter of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Weight and Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As concerning the firſt of theſe, it is, without all queſtion, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Regality and Prerogative of the Crown, to give the Currant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

It is true, that by certain ancient privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, derived by Charter and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Crown, divers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the eminent Clergy, had their Mints or Coinages of Money.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55185:7"/>
and Barons to deliver a Stamp over to thoſe private Mints to be uſed. But this liberty of Coinage in private Lords hath been long ſince diſuſed, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if not altogether, reaſſumed by the Statute of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the Matter or Species<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof the currant Coin of this Kingdom hath been made, it is Gold or Silver, but not altogether pure, but with an Allay of Copper, at leaſt from the time of King <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1. and <hi>H.</hi> 2. though poſſibly in ancienter times the Species whereof the Coin was made might be pure Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and this Allay was that which gave the Denomination of Sterling to that Coin, <hi>viz.</hi> Sterling Gold, or Sterling Silver: Wherein there will be inquirable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whence that Denomination came.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ancient that Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was.</p>

            <p>The Sterling Allay of Gold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Red Book of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer is this. The Pound weight of Gold conſiſts of twenty four Charats, every Charat weighing half an Ounce of Silver; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Charat of Gold conſiſts of four Grains, and conſequently every

            <p>The Sterling Silver, as it ſeems to me, in former times had an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay differing from what it is at this day. At this day a Pound weight of Silver <hi>(viz.</hi> 12 Ounces to the Pound, or <hi>Troy</hi> weight) conſiſts of eleven Ounces two Peny-weight of fine. Silver, and eighteen Peny-weight of Allay or Copper: every Pound containing twelve Ounces, and every Ounce divided into 20 parts called twenty Peny-weight: For at that time 20 Peny-weight weighed one Ounce, which though the Peny-weight be altered, yet the Denomination continues. And this Allay was in uſe in the forty ſixth year of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and for ſome time before, and hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever ſince.</p>

            <p>And it ſhould ſeem by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Chapter, that in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 2. the Allay of Copper in Sterling Silver was leſs than that: For upon every Pound weight of Silver Money they uſed to allow 12 Peny-weight <hi>ad dealbandam fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam;</hi> which ſeems to be the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the reduction of the Money then currant into fine Silver, <hi>ſed de hoc poſtea.</hi>

            <p>THE Pound weight of Gold though it were the ſame with that of Silver, yet is made up of ſmaller parts of a different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, every Pound weight conſiſting of 24 Charats, and every Charat conſiſting of 4 Grains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Pound weight of Silver is ſubdivided into parts of another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; for every Pound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of 20 Peny-weights, and every Peny-weight of 24 Grains. This appears by the Books and Records above mentioned.</hi> Et touts ſuſdits moneys dargent iſſint faites ſerront dallay de Standard de veil Eſterling: Coſt aſcavoir que cheſcun leivre dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent de ceſtes moneys de poize tien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra

            <p>But theſe thirty two Grains in the middle of the ear of Corn, are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Grains, which were the weight of the then Engliſh Sterling Peny. But for the better accommodation of Accompts, theſe 32 natural Grains are reduced to 24 artificial Grains,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55185:13"/>
which, from very ancient time unt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this day are the common meaſure of the Peny-weight, as the 20 Peny-weight is the meaſure of an Ounce.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſtated the artificial weights of Gold, and Silver, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the latter, I ſhall proceed to the compariſon that now and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtands between theſe artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al weights and the Coin of Silver.</p>
            <p>It is very plain that in the latter end of <hi>H.</hi> 3. and the beginning of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and for a long time before, twenty Pence of Sterling Money did weigh an Ounce, and twelve times twenty Pence or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings did then weigh a Pound Troy weight: and accordingly as twenty Peny-weight was then an Ounce, and ſo called, ſo two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty Pence, or twenty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings was a Pound weight, and ſo called, <hi>viz. Libra Argenti.</hi> And although at this day the Peny and the 20 Shillings of Silver is much altered in their true weight, yet the Denomination is ſtill retained. The Ounce is commonly divided and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55185:13"/>
eſtimated by 20 Peny-weight, and 20 Shillings is called <hi>Libra Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. (as appears) an Ounce of Sterling Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made 20 Sterling Pence, and conſequently a Pound of Sterling Silver made 240 Pence Sterling. But proceſs of time hath made a great alteration between the Weight and extrinſique Denomination or Value of Money.</p>
            <p>In 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it appears by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture of the Mint that a Pound of Sterling Silver made then 300 Sterling Pence. <hi>Clauſ.</hi> 46. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>m.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>And afterwards in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 5. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Coin was ſuch that a Pound weight of Sterling Silver made 360 Pence Sterling. <hi>Clauſ.</hi> 1. <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>m.</hi> 35. <hi>dorſo.</hi> Which made the Pound weight of Silver to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 30 Shillings, and deducting 1 Shilling for Coinage, the Merchant had 29 Shillings for his Pound of Silver brought into the Mint.</p>
            <p>In the 4th year of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. the Pound of Sterling Silver yielded 33 Shillings
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55185:14"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> about 396 Pence in the Pound: and conſequently 33 Sterling Pence then made the Ounce of Silver. <hi>Clauſ.</hi> 4. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>m.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>At this day the Ounce of Silver coined contains 5 Shillings, or 60 Pence: and conſequently the Pound weight of coined Silver yields 60 Sterlings or 720 pence. So that at this day the extrinſecal Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or Value of Money in proportion to its Weight, is three times higher than it was in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 1. And thus much ſhall ſuffice touching the ſecond enquiry.</p>

            <p>BY what hath been before ſaid it appeareth, the two ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of the currant Coin of this Kingdom are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it be of the true Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard in relation to its weight.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The defect in the due weight of Money which hapned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by counterfeiting the Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Money, though with a weight below the Standard. Sometimes by clipping, or otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing

the weight of true Money.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>And by theſe practices the King's Exchequer (into or through which the moſt of the Money of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſucceſſively came) was many times ſurcharged with ſuch defective Money, and the King thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his Firmes.</p>
            <p>And therefore in ancient times there were ſucceſſive experiments made by the officers of the King's revenue for the diſcovery and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of theſe defective Monies and that his Rents might be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Money of a juſt weight and Allay; which, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ancient Records, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here to be explicated, <hi>viz. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio ad Scalam, Solutio ad Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> and Combuſtion, or tryal by

fire. The two former being ſuch Remedies as related to defective Weight, and the latter being the Remedy that relates to defect in the Standard of Allay. And, touching this buſineſs, although we have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent mention of them, in the Pipe-rolls eſpecially, yet the beſt, and contemporary expoſition of them is <hi>Gervaſius Tilburienſis,</hi> or the black Book of the Exchequer, written in the time of <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2. who gives us the accompt thereof in his firſt Book, <hi>Cap. A quibus, &amp; ad quid inventa fuit Argenti examinatio,</hi> who thus expounds it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Solutio ad Scalam,</hi> viz. <hi>proeter quamlibet Libram numeratam ſex Denarios,</hi> which it ſeems was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon a <hi>medium</hi> to be the common eſtimate or Remedy for the defective Weight of Money, thereby to avoid the trouble of weighing the Money which was brought into the Exchequer. And this is the meaning of that frequent expreſſion in the ancient Pipe-rolls <hi>In Theſauro</hi> 100<hi>l. ad Scalam,</hi> which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55185:16"/>
ſeems to be one hundred Pounds, and one hundred Sixpences, or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Solutio ad Penſum:</hi> which was the payment of Money into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer by full weight, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Pound, or 20<hi>s.</hi> in Silver, <hi>numero,</hi> or by tale, ſhould not be received for a Pound unleſs it did exactly weigh a Pound weight Troy, or twelve Ounces, and if it wanted any, that then the Payer ſhould make good the weight by adding other Money although it amounted to more or leſs than 6<hi>d.</hi> in the Pound (which was the <hi>Solutio ad Scalam,</hi> as before is mentioned.) And thus frequently occurs in the Pipe-rolls, <hi>In Theſauro</hi> 100<hi>l. and penſum,</hi> or full weight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Combuſtion or tryal by fire: which is by <hi>Gervaſe</hi> ſuppoſed to be ſet on foot by the Biſhop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> then Treaſurer, (though in truth it were much more ancient, as appears by frequent paſſages in the Book of Doomsday:) and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor gives the reaſon: <hi>Licet enim numero &amp; pondere videretur eſſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactum,</hi>

Whether this examination was to reduce an equation of Money onely to Sterling, <hi>viz.</hi> a due proportion of Allay with Copper; or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to fine and pure Silver, and to make the eſtimate of the Pound or <hi>Libra Argenti,</hi> reſerved of their Firmes to be in pure Silver, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Allay, doth not ſo clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Some think the former; and therefore that the old expreſſion of <hi>Firma alba,</hi> blank Firm, and <hi>deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Firmam,</hi> was nothing elſe but Coin melted down and reduced to the Allay of Sterling, and after blanched, or whited, as is done by the Moneyers with their Sterling Coin of Silver, which is to this day called blanching. <hi>Vid.</hi> Spelman <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This tryal of Silver by Combuſtion, in thoſe elder ages ſoon prevailed and obtained againſt the former reductions <hi>ad Scalam, &amp; ad Penſum,</hi> as being the onely infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible tryal of the truth of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, whereby the former reductions of <hi>Penſum</hi> and <hi>Scalam</hi> became in time antiquated.</p>
            <p>And this begat the diſtinction in the old Rolls of the eſtimate of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>Numero,</hi> and the eſtimate <hi>Blanc:</hi> and in purſuance thereto the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55185:17"/>
of Rents and Firmes by the King were ſometimes <hi>Numero,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Blanc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſervations of Rents <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> were no other but ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney reſerved <hi>in Pecuniis numeratis:</hi> as <hi>reddendo quinque Libras numero</hi> was fiveſcore Shillings, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in common eſtimation to five Pounds Troy weight: And this was the ancient and uſual reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, <hi>prima facie,</hi> unleſs the contrary were expreſſed, upon all Grants of Lands (reſerving ſo much Rent) it was intended <hi>numero;</hi> that is, ſo much in Money numbred, and the Firmor was not bound <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albare Firmam,</hi> or to make good ſo much in fine Silver, or, if you will, in ſuch ſilver as was of the firſt Allay.</p>
            <p>The reſervation of ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or ſo many Pounds <hi>blanc</hi> did enforce the Firmor to make good to the King ſo much in fine Silver, (or at leaſt in the pureſt Sterling) and therefore ſuch Firmor, when he paid in his Firme upon ſuch a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

            <p>And hereupon grew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon difference which is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned in the Pipe-rolls of Firmes <hi>numero,</hi> and Firmes <hi>blanc</hi> or <hi>alb.</hi> Firme.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. Concerning the manner of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the King's Firmes anciently.</head>
            <p>IN ancient times, <hi>viz.</hi> about the time of <hi>William</hi> the firſt and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, the reſervation of the King's Firmes and Rents were ſo many Pounds or Shillings, &amp;c. in Money, and they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>numero,</hi> or <hi>in Pecuniis nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratis,</hi> untill afterward for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of corrupt Money, they were reſerved in <hi>blanc</hi> or white Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which, as before is obſerved, was intended either of pure Silver, (or at leaſt Silver reduced to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of Sterling) and then whitened or blanched, as is uſed in the Mint to this day, for all Sterling Money: I ſhall not much contend whether it were the one or the other, but for the moſt part in this Diſcourſe I ſhall ſuppoſe it fine Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55185:20"/>
But although Firmes were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Money, as the beſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneſt meaſures of values, yet it appears by <hi>Tilburienſis, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap. A quibus &amp; ad quid inſtituta fuit Argenti examinatio;</hi> that it was in thoſe ancient times of King <hi>W.</hi> 2. and <hi>H.</hi>1. uſually practiſed that thoſe Firmes ſhould, according to their values be anſwered in Cattle, Corn and other proviſions; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in its firſt inſtitution might be a convenience to the King, to have his Family furniſhed with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and to the Country, among whom Money was not then very plentifull, and they could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer their Rents in Proviſions.</p>
            <p>And to the end that an equation might be made between the Rents reſerved in Money and the Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delivered by the Tenants in lieu thereof, the ſame <hi>Tilburienſis</hi> tells us, there were certain prices and rates ſet upon proviſions, that the Tenant might know what to pay, and the King's Officers might know what to receive. As for Wheat for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55185:21"/>
100 men 12<hi>d.</hi> for a fat Ox 12<hi>d.</hi> &amp;c. which it ſeems were dilivered to the hands of the Sheriff who, if he fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the County, might retain it to his own uſe; but if he firmed it not he accompted to the King, for theſe Proviſions or their values, as he did for other rates of the County col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by him.</p>
            <p>But as for Cities and Franchiſes that were granted out to Firme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not Proviſions of this nature to anſwer, they paid their Rents in Money.</p>
            <p>Thus, it ſeems, the King's Firmes of Rents of his Firmors and Tenants in the Country were anſwered in the time of King <hi>William</hi> the firſt and <hi>William</hi> his ſon. But in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 1. the Tenants were weary of anſwering their Rents in proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the King's foreign occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons called rather for a ſupply of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo the Rents were anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Tenants as formerly in Money according to the tenour of their reſervations, and the delivery of Victual and other Proviſions in lieu thereof ceaſed.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. Concerning the manner of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the King's Revenues of the County, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of them with their ſeveral Titles.</head>
            <p>THE Sheriff of the County had a double Office: 1. As a Miniſter of Juſtice under the King for the preſervation of Peace, and Writs iſſuing from the King's Courts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. As the King's Bayliff of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues ariſing in the County, which was of two kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The improving and letting, and ſometimes ſtocking of the King's Demeſnes, and ſuch Lands as were ſeized into the King's hands (other than ſuch as belonged to the Eſchea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as Wardſhips and Eſcheats.) And hence it is that there are upon the accompts, eſpecially of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55185:22"/>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond part of his Office was in collecting of the King's Rents of his County, which ſometimes he did as <hi>Cuſtos</hi> or Bayly; ſometimes <hi>ut Firmarius, viz.</hi> he took the Rents to his own uſe, and anſwered the King a certain Firme or Rent at his own peril, whereof more in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe. Now concerning the kinds of the King's Revenues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in the ſeveral Counties, we are to take notice that they were of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Annual or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual.</p>
            <p>The Annual Revenue was again of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Fixed and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or Caſual and Uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Annual, Fixed and Certain Revenue of the Counties were of theſe kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The King's Demeſnes that were in his own hands, or let at Rack rents to Tenants, whereof I have before ſpoken, and they make
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55185:22"/>
not much for that purpoſe I aim at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Firmes, which were of two kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> Groſs Firmes which were charged upon particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Cities, or Towns, and ſo charged in the great Roll; as thus, <hi>Philippus d'Aura debet</hi> 2 <hi>Marc. de reditu unius virgate terre.</hi> And theſe were thus charged upon theſe two reaſons: 1. Either becauſe they were never parcel of the Sheriffs Firme of this County, <hi>(de quo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra,)</hi> but great Firmes written out to the Sheriff to be anſwered by the perſons upon whom they were charged. 2. Or elſe they were ſuch as happened to be reſerved after the Firme of the County was reduced to certainty and anſwered by the Sheriffs. Or elſe, Secondly, they were ſmall rents commonly called Vicontiel Rents; the Particulars whereof we ſhall enumerate under their ſeveral heads in due time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Common Fines, at firſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon Townſhips, upon ſeveral occaſions, as for <hi>Bon pleder,</hi> for Suit and Ward, for excuſe of attending

the Sheriffs turn: and theſe grew in proceſs of time to be fixed and ſetled Revenues. And theſe again were of two Sorts; ſuch as came within the Title of <hi>Firma Comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and were written out under that general head, <hi>viz. ſub nomine Vicecomitis:</hi> And ſome again were written to the Sheriff in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular charge of ſuch and ſuch Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Lands, and ſo charged upon the Towns by the expreſs words of the proceſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Arrentations of Aſſarts and Purpreſtures in Waſts and Foreſts ſet by Juſtices in <hi>Eyre,</hi> which for the moſt part were written out in charge againſt the particular Lands upon which they were charged: and ſome perchance were deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a groſs Summ, among other ſmall Rents <hi>ſub nomine Vicecomitis.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Crementum Comitatus,</hi> or <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma de cremento Comitatus;</hi> which were ſome improvements of the King's Rents above the ancient Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiel Rents, for which the Sheriff anſwered under the title of <hi>Firma</hi>

2. The uncertain Annual Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue was the <hi>Proficuum Comitatus,</hi> which in ancient times when moſt of the Law-ſuits were tranſacted in the Counties and Hundred-Court, was a conſiderable Revenue. But ſince that time, <hi>viz.</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>E.</hi> 1. when much of that buſineſs was tranſacted at the great Courts, this profit of the County ſunk to very little. And in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry touching this part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, I ſhall Firſt ſet down what it was not: Secondly, I ſhall ſet down what it was, and how it did ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the former of theſe what it was not; I ſay, moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="1">1. Untill the Stat. of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. there were no Fees at all by Law due for any execution of Proceſs or

               </gap>. of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> the firſt, the Sheriff was bound to execute the King's Proceſs without any Fee, which is no other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a declaration of the Common Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In no Viſcontil Schedule or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the County that ever I could ſee or hear of, is there any Accompt for Fees for execution of Proceſs, or any mention thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the Sheriff did in thoſe el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times take any Fees for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Writs, there was no colour of reaſon that he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for that: and if he did take more than a reaſonable recompence for his pains, it was more than could be juſtified, and not at all due to the King.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But now, as to the Second enquiry, what this <hi>Proficuum Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus</hi> was: And it ſeems very plain that it was made up principally by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55185:26"/>
theſe particulars, as moſt evidently appears by divers accompts of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs in ancient times, when they accompted <hi>ut Cuſtodes</hi> or <hi>Ballivi,</hi> not <hi>ut Firmarii, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Fines, Iſſues and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cements, and other Profits of the County-Courts, which in thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times were very conſiderable, for it held Plea in all Writs that were Vicontiel, directed immediately to the Sheriff out of the Chancery, <hi>viz.</hi> by Juſtices; and many times not onely perſonal Suits were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thither out of inferiour Court-Barons and Hundred-Courts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Pleas Real, <hi>viz.</hi> Writs of Right; and in ancient time many real Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially Writs of Right were determined in the County.

But as the buſineſs and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Hundred-Courts ſunk gradually in their employment, (whereby the Perquiſites now do but little ſurmount the charge of keeping them) ſo now by the Stat. of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. the Sheriff is reſtrained from letting the Bayly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick to Firme; and moſt of the Hundreds, at leaſt in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are disjoined from the County

            <p>And they were written out thus generally, without expreſſing the ſeveral Vicontiel Rents, but onely the groſs Summs what they amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>blanc,</hi> and what they amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>numero,</hi> or <hi>de numero Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus.</hi> And the Sheriff upon his Accompt was uſed to bring in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiel Roll, containing theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vicontiel Rents, what they were and what he had levied.</p>
            <p>By this it appears that in the firſt conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But in proceſs of time (but that time very ancient) the Sheriff for the time being took the <hi>Corpus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus</hi> or Vicontiel Rents to Firme, which Firme for the moſt part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to very nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And by this means the Sheriff was to anſwer at his peril his Firme, for it became his own debt, and he was to gather up the Vicontiel Rents to his own uſe to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Saver.</p>

And yet in ſuch caſes it was become a ſetled Firme, by uſage and cuſtome; yet when the Sheriff found that his Firme was too great for theſe profits (which were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs) he was in thoſe elder times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to accompt <hi>ut Cuſtos,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being bound to anſwer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Firme, unleſs he ſaw fit.

And the truth is, I think, anciently there were ſome. Sheriffs that had Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55185:46"/>
of reward, <hi>viz. York, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton, Cumb'land, Hereford,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But ſince the making of this Act they have waved them, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more beneficial to take the benefit of thoſe Statutes upon their accompt, than to take their Tallies of reward. So that now all She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs have an equal benefit of the Statutes of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 2 and 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But thoſe Sheriffs that had no Tallies of reward might diſcharge themſelves of their Vicontiels and Firmes <hi>de remanente Comitatus,</hi> as well as other things that they could not levy.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That all Sheriffs, as well thoſe that had or had not Tallies of reward might diſcharge themſelves of the caſual charges, or their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual uncertain charges; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might, and moſt ordinarily after this Statute did diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the entire Firme <hi>de profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuis Comitatus,</hi> in caſe the profits of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55185:46"/>
their Counties did not ſurmount the charge that attended them. And by this means ſince the making of this Statute, thoſe Sheriffs that were charged with the <hi>Firma de proficuis</hi> rarely if at all anſwered any thing for it, becauſe they have always aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained the Court that there were no ſuch profits beyond the charge in collecting them: or that the charge of keeping the County-Court, the Turns, the Hundred-Courts, which were the things that made up the <hi>Firma de proficuis,</hi> ſurmounted the benefit.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And this making appear was no other than the oath of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, that he could not levy this or that Rent, parcell of his Vicontiels, or that there were no <hi>Proficua Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus,</hi> &amp;c. And this oath of the Sheriff hath always been the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to diſcharge him of all or any part of his Firmes. By which means it hath moſt ordinarily come to paſs that although the Sheriff hath paid
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55185:47"/>
in his profers at Eaſter and Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, yet when he comes upon his accompt he doth by his oath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelf of all his <hi>Firma de remanente Comitatus,</hi> and thereby moſt times the King becomes Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Sheriff for thoſe Moneys which he received as profers, or Moneys due by the Sheriff upon his Firme.</p>
            <p>And it is but reaſon; for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute gives him that juſt benefit to diſcharge himſelf by his oath of what he cannot levy or receive.</p>
            <p>And yet though the Sheriffs have conſtantly by their oath diſcharged themſelves of the entire Firme <hi>de Proficuis Comitatus,</hi> and of a great part of their other Firmes of the Vicontiels, or <hi>Remanent<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g>Firme,</hi> and other Rents charged upon them in groſs Summs, by ſwearing the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviableneſs of ſome of thoſe Vicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiels which make up thoſe <hi>Rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g> Firme Comitatus</hi> and groſs Summs, yet conſtantly after this Act and until the year of our Lord
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55185:47"/>
1650 the entire Firmes, <hi>viz.</hi> the entire Firme of the <hi>Remanent<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g> poſt terras datas,</hi> and the entire Firme <hi>de proficuis Comitatus,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly written out in charge to the Sheriff upon the Summons of the Pipe, and entirely charged upon the great Roll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they had ever been ſince the Statute of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and in the very ſame manner, though in truth it was for the moſt part but an idle piece of formality; for the Sheriffs conſtantly ſwear it off by virtue of the Statute. And thus by theſe Statutes the Sheriff had eaſe by his oath from that part and thoſe parts of his Firmes that he ſweared he could not levy.</p>
            <p>But the truth is the Sheriffs have taken that part of the Statute which was for their eaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſwear in diſcharge of their Firmes, but have two much omitted that other part of the Statute that was for the King's advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> the delivery in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their oaths the Schedules of their Vicontiels: by which omiſſion poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

Howbeit the Sheriffs have from time to time complained, and ſtill complain againſt the writing forth of more to be levied and anſwered by them upon their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, than ſuch Rents and Summs of Money onely as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears upon the oaths of their predeceſſors, Sheriffs, to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable; and that the reſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be illeviable, ought to be removed out of their ſaid annual Roll, and Commiſſions thereupon to be awarded out of the Exchequer, for reviving the ſame according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ſaid Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which the now Lord chief Baron, and the reſt of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55185:51"/>
Barons, taking into their ſerious conſideration, and being willing and deſirous, ſo far forth as may ſtand with the preſervation of the due rights of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to give all fitting eaſe and ſatisfaction to Sheriffs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, according to the meaning of the ſaid Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and according to the Statute of <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. whereby it is provided that nothing ſhall be written out to the Sheriffs but ſuch Firmes and Debts whereof there is ſome hope that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be levied. And that all dead Firmes and deſperate Debts are to be removed from the annual or great Roll into the exannual Roll, and not to be written forth in proceſs to the Sheriff, but to be inquired of to ſee if any thing may be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Whereupon the ſaid Lord chief Baron and the reſt of the Barons, calling before them the Clerk of the Pipe, with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condaries,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55185:52"/>
and the reſt of the ſworn Clerks of the ſaid Office, and upon debate of the buſineſs, finding it to be a work of great difficulty, labour and care, to examine and ſet forth in every County, from the Originals and Records of ſuch antiquity to be compared with later times, the particulars which are from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to be written to the Sheriffs to levy in certain. And ſuch as are for the reaſons aforeſaid to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the ſaid annual Roll have nevertheleſs in eaſe of all Sheriffs for time to come, with reſpect to the labour and care of the Officers and Clerks to be by them undergone therein. It is this day ordered that the Clerk of the Pipe, the Secondaries and other ſworn Clerks of the ſaid Office in their ſeveral aſſignments ſhall in purſuance of the ſaid Statute of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and the ſaid Statute of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. uſe their beſt endeavour, diligence and care,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55185:52"/>
with as much convenient ſpeed as a work of ſo great labour and conſequence may well be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, fully to explain and ſet forth, and ſhall from henceforth fully explain and ſet forth, in the ſubſequent annual Roll of this Court, ſo many of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rents as they find out and diſcover by any of the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, Books, Vicontiels of Sheriffs, or other Records of this Court, to have been, and which be appertaining to the making up of every of the ſaid Firmes ſo charged in groſs Summs as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and ſhall therein diſtinguiſh which and how much of thoſe particular Rents have been and are to be yearly anſwered.</p>
               <p>And ſo much of the ſaid Firmes as cannot be explained by ſetting forth the particulars, together with the particulars ſo ſet forth and explained, which have been in decay and unanſwered by the ſpace of forty years laſt paſt, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55185:53"/>
which are become illeviable, ſhall be thereupon removed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed out of the ſaid annual Roll and Sheriffs Accompts into the exannual Roll of this Court. And that Commiſſions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſhall be from time to time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to regain and recover the ſame, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ſaid Statutes.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Order produced theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Great care was taken to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and ſet forth the obſcure Rents, and upon what they were charged.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The particulars of thoſe Rents and Vicontiels that made up the Sheriffs Firmes formerly, of <hi>Rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<g ref="char:abbrapo">’</g> Firme poſt terras datas,</hi> and <hi>De Cremento Comitatus,</hi> as alſo thoſe Rents that were charged upon the Sheriffs in groſs Summs, as <hi>De diverſis Firmis, De minutis particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Serjantiarum,</hi> and ſuch other
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55185:53"/>
charges in groſs were wholly left out and omitted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Inſtead thereof ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rents and Vicontiels as made up formerly theſe Firmes and groſs charges, or Money of them as could be diſcovered were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly written out in the Summons of the Pipe, and in the great Roll firſt under the title of ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, wherein the Bills lay that were charged or had any Lands charged within them with theſe Vicontiels and the ſeveral Vills un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Titles of theſe Hundreds, and the ſeveral Lands that were charged within thoſe Vills, as far forth as could be diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Thoſe Vicontiels that were part of thoſe Firmes or groſs char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and likewiſe ſuch particular Rents charged formerly in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Roll in particular, which had not been anſwered in forty years before, were removed out of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55185:54"/>
Summons of the Pipe and great Roll into the exannual Roll to be put in proceſs as they could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. And thus the form of the charge which had continued ever ſince 10 <hi>E.</hi> 1. as to the Firmes and groſs Summs, was too lately chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the great eaſe of the Sheriffs, of the Court and of the People, who were often haraſſed by the Sheriffs to make themſelves ſavers, by levying theſe obſcure incertain and illeviable Summs. And all this without any detriment to the King who indeed before had an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of great Firmes and Summs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Summons of the Pipe and great Roll, which yet were ſworn off too little by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs in purſuance of the Statute of 23 <hi>E.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But beſides all this, the <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma de proficuo Comitatus</hi> was alſo wholly laid aſide and put out of the charge of the Summons of the Pipe and the great Roll. It is true
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55185:54"/>
there is no clear warrant for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Firme out of charge by that order, for that order ſeems to extend onely to Rents and Viconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which indeed made up the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Firmes and groſs Summs charged upon the Sheriffs. But this Firme was anſwered for the profits of Courts and other caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perquiſites, and not in reſpect of any Vicontiel or annual Rent. But yet for all that, the true extent of that order might extend to put that Firme wholly out of charge, ſince it is apparent that the profits of the Sheriffs Courts whether Hundred-Courts, County-Courts or <hi>time,</hi> do ſcarce quit the charges of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at this day, nor for a long time paſt. Neither is the King <hi>de facto</hi> at any loſs thereby, for though before this order this Firme was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in charge and carried the ſhew of ſome benefit to the King, yet it was wholly ſworn off by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs by virtue of the Statute of 2 and 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:55185:55"/>
Onely it ſeems reaſonable that though the <hi>Firma de proficuis</hi> be put out of charge ſo that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff ſhould not be compelled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Firme to that which yields little or no benefit, yet that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff ſhould be charged to accompt for the <hi>Proficua Comitatus</hi> as Bayly or <hi>Cuſtos</hi> though not as Firmor.</p>
            <p>And that therefore there ſhould ſtand in charge upon him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt <hi>de Proficuis,</hi> which is all that I can find conſiderable to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in that order, orvin the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent methodizing of the great Roll in relation hereunto. And although this order was made in the late time of trouble, yet it hath obtained and ſtood in force unto this day.</p>
            <p>The late Act of this Parliament intituled <hi>An Act for the preventing of the unneceſſary delays of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,</hi> &amp;c. hath this Clauſe ſutable to the ſaid order, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And to the end that Sheriffs may for the time future be eaſed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55185:55"/>
of the great charge and trouble which they heretofore have been put to in paſſing their Accompts in the Exchequer, occaſioned part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard that divers Summs of Money have ſtood charged upon them in groſs without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing from what perſons, or for what cauſe, or out of what Lands and Tenements, the ſame are particularly to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, or out of what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars the ſaid Summs in groſs do ariſe, whereby it cometh to paſs that the Sheriffs do ſtill ſtand charged in groſs with divers Summs of Money which were heretofore payable by Abbots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Priors, Perſons attainted, and ſuch other Perſons, whoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are ſince come to the Crown, or are otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged or illeviable. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Accompt of Seiſures, or foreign Accompts, and by exaction of undue Fees of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs upon their oppoſals. But it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55185:56"/>
is enacted, &amp;c. that no Sheriffs ſhall be charged in accompt to anſwer any illeviable Seiſure, Firme, Rent or Debt, or either Seiſure, Firme, Rent, Debt or other matter or thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which was not writ in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him or them to be levied wherein, the perſons of whom, or the Lands and Tenements out of which, together with the cauſe for which the ſame ſhall be ſo levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be plainly and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed, but ſhall be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wholly diſcharged without Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, Plea or other trouble or charge whatſoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Act had in effect diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the old charges in groſs, had not this buſineſs been before ſetled by the order of 1650. But by that order the ſame thing is done and much more, and put into a very good order.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntricate Argument touching the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55185:56"/>
Sheriffs Firmes. And the occaſion of my ſtrict enquiry into it was, a difference between the Auditors and the Clerk of the Pipe: upon the whole debate whereof, I found onely theſe matters.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That, in truth, the great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of complaint was, that the Clerks of the Pipe uſed different methods of accompting from the Auditors of the Revenue, the not obſervance whereof occaſioned a miſtaken repreſentation by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors that there was a deceit in their Accompts, whereas it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no ſuch thing: for when both accompted their ſeveral ways, the iſſue was that the Accompts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the concluſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Firme <hi>de proficuo Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatus</hi> was put out of charge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Warrant, and it was thought by the Auditors, a great and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs to the Crown, ſuppoſing that the Fees for execution of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55185:57"/>
and Writs were to make up that Firme: but this is ſufficiently unriddled before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there was an allowance to the Sheriff of <hi>Bucks</hi> of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable yearly Summ, <hi>ut Apparatori Comitatus:</hi> This indeed ought not to be allowed at this day, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof ceaſing as hath been ſhewed; and therefore from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth that charge is to be diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Clerk of the Pipe not greatly blamable herein, becauſe there was an order of the Court in the Queens time for making that allowance: But the reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that order was made was a miſtake and an errour in the Court not in the Clerk that followed the order.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there is no accompt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Firmes of Baylywicks as was anciently; which indeed, was parcel of the <hi>Proficuum Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus,</hi> as hath been ſhewed. But
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55185:57"/>
the truth is, there is no great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for any ſuch complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Firmes of Baylywicks being taken away by Act of Parliament, and levy diſuſed in moſt places.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That when a Sheriff is in Surpluſage they make it good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him out of any other debt by the Sheriff himſelf, or any other Sheriff of the ſame or any other County, without any Warrant from my Lord Treaſurer or the Court. And beſides that, the other Sheriff is diſcharged upon the Roll of his Debt, and it doth not appear upon what reaſon. And indeed, this is a thing fit to be reformed, and that ſuch allowances be not made without Warrant from the Lord Treaſurer, or Order of Court, and that an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Memorandum thereof be made upon the Roll of the Debts ſo diſcharged. But yet, the truth is, this manner of allowance hath been a long time uſed, and it is no novelty or late attempt, neither is there any great
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55185:58"/>
damage to the King by it, for it is but the payment of one real Debt with another. But howſoever, this is fit to be reformed by order of the Court that the Sheriffs deliver not in the Roll of the Vicontiel as is required by the Statute. And it is true, he ought to doe it or ſhould be ſworn thereunto. But the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is not now ſo great, becauſe the particular Rents are now char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the great Roll by virtue of the order of 1650, which doth in a great meaſure ſupply that defect, and yet the delivery in of the Vicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiel Roll may be fit to be revived.</p>
            <p>The moſt of the reſt of the complaints were touching particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars miſcharged, or not charged, but the Errours were rather in the Complainers than in the Pipe, and for want of a clear underſtanding of thoſe intricate and obſcure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Pipe. And upon a full ſearch of the particulars, I find the Clerks of the Pipe gave very clear ſatisfaction therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55185:58"/>
Upon the whole matter of theſe Accompts, I do obſerve theſe Two or Three Obſervables.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the inconvenience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the old formalities of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, the ſame terms and words, and very ſame mood of all things in Accompts, when the nature of things and times requires a change, and accommodation of new forms or expreſſions as a piece of hurtfull ſuperſtition; therefore, although the change of forms of this nature is not to be done raſhly and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitantly, yet when the exigence of things requires it, there muſt be an accommodation to the preſent uſe, underſtanding and exigence of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the Auditors of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue are more eaſily intelligible as being framed to the uſe and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the times; but the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the Pipe more myſterious
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55185:59"/>
and perplexed, to perſons unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, for till 10 <hi>E.</hi> 1. they kept in all things the preciſe form of writing their great Roll, as had been uſed in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s time. And the ſame form they kept untill 1650, abating the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made in 10 <hi>E.</hi> 1. not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great inconvenience to the King's people and Sheriffs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That theſe ſmall Rents and Vicontiels would be with much more advantage to the King, and be ſold off to the ſeveral Perſons and Townſhips chargable therewith, than be kept in method of collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as now they are, unleſs ſome more ready collecting of them by the Receivers could be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, provided the Money ariſing by ſale be laid out preſently in more certain Revenue: For, 1. They are in reſpect of their ſmallneſs, and diſperſedneſs, and uncertainty of charge and manner of collecting very ſubject to be loſt, as they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55185:59"/>
have been commonly from time to time. 2. The charge of collecting and accompting for them by the Sheriff is very great, and the trouble and charge to the people very much more. 3. The coſt and trouble to the King in reſpect of Officers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and other matters relating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, might be well retrenched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And yet when all is done, it brings a great trouble, and makes a great noiſe as if it were a Revenue of great moment, and yet by that time the Sheriffs have done ſwearing of particulars as illeviable, or that they know not where to charge it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a very pitifull inconſiderable buſineſs, and ſcarce anſwering the charge of the collecting, accompting and anſwering it. For it muſt be obſerved that although by the order of 1650, the charge is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than formerly, yet the Sheriff hath ſtill by the Law the benefit of the Statute of 2 and 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. even as to thoſe aſcertained Rents, and if he cannot find them he is, and ought
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55185:60"/>
to be diſcharged upon his oath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And accordingly is daily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of many of thoſe Rents though rendred much more certain by that order, and the pains and method of the Charge and Accompt, uſed in purſuance hereof. Whereby in proceſs of time, many, even of theſe Rents particularly charged by virtue of that order, will be ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively loſt.</p>
