            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ad it not pleaſed the Lord to bear up my fainting ſpirit, with more than an ordinary Confidence that the Deliverance of his People was nigh at hand, and that he would put a ſtop to the Violent Paſſions of Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Men, I had undoubtedly ſunck under thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Scandals and Aſperſions, which have been caſt, like dirt about the ſtreets, upon me, by my Wife and her Abettors.</p>
            <p>But certainly the Day of our Deliverance is already dawn'd; And we are in ſome meaſure aſſur'd, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broke ſorth, and that the Abominations of the Wicked ſhall be no more clothed with <hi>Authority;</hi> but whatſoever is a Lie ſhall be made maniſeſt, and confounded.</p>
            <p>As our Eyes are therefore on the Lord, as the ſupreme Fountain of all Goodneſs, ſo we truſt that the Declaration of his Will ſhall be made out by Your Highneſſe, being choſen by Himſelf in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, and by a wonderfull ſeries of Providences, to this very end, to execute Righteouſneſs and Judgement for his People that are oppreſſed amongſt us: and that your Highneſs will put on bowels of Compaſſion for the Afflictions of Men in Miſery, who pour out their Complaints and Grievances before you.</p>
            <p>With this Confidence I appeal from the Chancery unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (being unable to endure any longer, either the Expences or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays of that Court; or indeed the Juſtice, which is there diſtributed) For beſides the hazarding of that which is better than a precious Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much of my Eſtate hath been conſumed, and great Debts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by reaſon of my attendance upon theſe unnatural Differences, (which have been fomented between my ſelf and my ſeduced Wife) much of it torn away by Violence under a Pretence of <hi>Alimony</hi> for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125864:3"/>
her, to whom I never denyed or refuſed any thing whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And that which remaineth is daily ſo moleſted with Creditors, that I now may moſt truly take upon me the Expreſſion of <hi>Job, I once had Riches, but now have none:</hi> And unleſs it will pleaſe your Highneſs to afford a ſpeedy Redreſs, I ſhall hardly enjoy long my Liberty alſo.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay any thing of thoſe ſad and diſmall Thoughts which have been conninually in my Mind, thoſe hideous Temptations, which have been hourly grating and gnawing my very ſoul.</p>
            <p>During this ſad Condition, tis the Voice of the Lord only can ſpeak Peace unto my Spirit, (whoſe Name be bleſſed for thoſe ſweet and refreſhing Experiences, with which he hath ſupported me in this fiery tryal) but I ſhall open unto your Highneſs, as unto a good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the wounds of my Body and <hi>Fortune;</hi> (&amp; briefly preſent a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the whole Matter concerning my ſelf, and wife, and how it hath been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacted in the Chancery) That ſo I may with the more confidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Cure proportionable to my Diſeaſe; and that your Highneſs Judgement may be as well grounded upon Knowledge, as my Suffering upon Experience.</p>
            <p>Having faithfully diſcharged the Truſt that was repoſed in me by the honourable <hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> (as their chief Agent at <hi>Madraſſopotan,</hi> where I had not only the Command of the perſons of Thouſands of People, but alſo the Fort of St. <hi>George,</hi> and Town of <hi>Madraſſopotan;</hi>) And having made a thorough Reformation of the grand Abuſes which had crept into thoſe parts, to the great Injury of the Trade; and erected them a Town by my own pains and Induſtry, even out of the Sea it ſelf, for the better advantage and ſecurity of it; I reſolved with my ſelf, (though I was often perſwaded by the ſaid Company to continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger my Charge) to return into my Country, where I had left the near relation of a Wife behind me: And by how much the more that Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal happineſs (which we enjoyed together) did revive, the more enflam'd were my Deſires for a Return.</p>
            <p>But I had no ſooner arrived in <hi>England,</hi> but the firſt News almoſt that was brought me, was the Death of my Wife, in her very Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to meet me.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt Tryal which the Lord laid upon me: But as he corrected, ſo he gave me Patience and Submiſſion to his Will in it; neither were friends wanting to endeavour a Belief in me, that as the Lord had taken one Wife from my Boſom, ſo he could beſtow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>After many ſeveral Dayes and Months thus ſpent in Melancholy,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125864:3"/>
and willing to inure my ſelf to the Condition I enjoyed when I left <hi>England,</hi> I was perſwaded to addreſs my ſelf to one Mrs. <hi>Garret,</hi> a Widdow, and Daughter of Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> who was repreſented unto me to be as beautifull in mind as in perſon; And though her Husband had left her nothing, yet was I not deterr'd by this to forbear my ſute, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what was wanting in <hi>Fortune,</hi> would be made up in <hi>Affection</hi> and and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> towards me.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, in ſhort, about <hi>October.</hi> 1649. a Marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was had and concluded between us; and, that I might give the beſt demonſtration what a high value I put upon her, I ſetled for her Joynture 1000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> and Covenanted with her Truſtees to leave her at the time of my Death 1000l. alſo in ready money.</p>
            <p>Her Father (now taking notice of this cordial and affectionate dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of mine with his Daughter) made in ſhort this Propoſition unto me, That if I would give him the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> 1000l. more, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver forthwith unto his ſaid Daughter, as many Jewels as might be worth at leaſt 1200l. that then he would ſettle his Eſtate at <hi>Wapping</hi> (being 240l. <hi>per An.</hi>) upon me for my life, and after my deceaſe to my Wife; And in caſe we had Iſſue, then to them; and in caſe we had no iſſue, then to the Heirs general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the ſaid <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or ſuch as he the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> ſhould limit and appoint.</p>
            <p>To which I returned as ſhort an anſwer, and told him, I would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately perform his demand. Whereupon I did diſpoſite 1000 l. in mony, and 1200l in Jewels, and all the aforeſaid agreements and Settlements were Indented in Parchment, and legally executed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly (as may appear from the Deeds themſelves, proved by two Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies in Chancery, to which I refer my ſelf.)</p>
            <p>I make no mention what Preſents, nor of what value they were, (though conſiderable) I ſent her before Marriage, (becauſe they were purely Gifts) but the other upon the moſt real and higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Marriage.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe its already evident, that had I now found the affection which I promiſed my ſelf, it might be very well ſaid to be rather pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed than gained; for although there was 240l. <hi>per ann.</hi> ſetled upon the Conſiderations aforeſaid, yet was it a dear bargain unto me, only for my Life, to lay down for it 2200 l. Neither was I to enjoy this untill the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> ſhould deceaſe; which (if the contingencie of his Death, and the Intereſt of the Money had been conſidered) twas more than ten years purchaſe, for one life.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, had there been a Return but of common Gratitude,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125864:4"/>
(much leſs of a conjugal Affection) I ſhould ſcarcely have entertained a Thought of Penitency for ſo large a Joynter, which I had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>But certainly the Anger of the Lord began now to be kindled againſt us, and whether 'twas for her ſins as well as mine own, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for being inſtrumental to the Diſheriting of the eldeſt Son and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> (who never had demerited it in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the Father) I know not, the Lord diſcover it unto us both in his due time: But certain it is, that ſhe could not long continue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from diſcovering, that 'twas rather my <hi>Fortune</hi> than my <hi>Perſon,</hi> which ſhe had wedded; rather embracing Advantages of expreſſing Kindneſs to others, than her Husband.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding many of theſe inconveniences did I paſs over (though 'twas very grievous to be thus uſed ſo ſoon after our Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, within leſs than ſix months, and ſtill perſevere (if with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I may ſpeak it) with more than uſual fondneſs) ſhe could no ſooner propoſe any thing, which my Purſe or Induſtry could procure, but 'twas immediately provided; nothing which might be either for Neceſſity or Ornament (though never ſo coſtly) but ſhe had it, though I borrowed money to provide it.</p>
            <p>I could here tell your Highneſs in what Plenty I maintained her, with what ſums of Money in her Purſe, with her Coach and Horſes, Sadle-Horſes, and rich Furniture, rich Cloathes, Beds, Linnen, &amp;c. but that I ſhould diſcover too much of my Folly in it, as well as her Unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>But I am confident, (and tis proved by ſufficient Witneſſes in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery) that in eighteen months after our Marriage, ſhe had ſpent for her Accommodations above 3000 l. whereof 600 l. was in Apparel only, 500 l. in ready money.</p>
            <p>But all this could not prevail, the Multiplicity of Curteſies and Endearments towards her on my part, was but the encreaſing of her frowns and ſlightings towards me; and being unſatisfied with what I voluntarily beſtowed upon her, ſhe took all opportunity (in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from home) to imbezele what goods ſoever ſhe could come at; and at one time (when I was at the Court of Aldermen) ſhe took from my Houſe 300 pounds at leaſt of rich <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Stuffs, and Plate.</p>
            <p>The Company ſhe reſorted unto (were no leſs offenſive unto me than her actions) being either Perſons of very low Condition, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Fortune, whoſe Neceſſities and Debaucheries ſtill prompted her to further Inconveniences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:125864:4"/>It being now evident unto me, and all our Acquaintance beſides, That a ſudden Ruine could not but be near to our Eſtates, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to our Perſons, I entered upon a ſerious Reſolution to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for a while to my Country houſe at <hi>Malmsburby</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and perſwaded my Wife to a complyance herein; This I did, that I might pay thoſe Debts, which I had contracted by her means, and take her from the Occaſions and the Perſons which had enticed her to ſuch pernicious courſes.</p>
            <p>But they (finding if their <hi>Diana</hi> ſhould leave <hi>London,</hi> the ſilver ſhrine would be alſo removed) were too too prevalent with her to retard her Journey; Nay in concluſion ſhe abſolutely refuſed to goe with me.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I did not forbear all the Arguments, which either Prudence or Neceſſity could dictate: And that I might not neglect any Motive, which I thought might conduce to this end, I gave 100 l. to two of her Familiar acquaintance (whom I thought moſt prevalent with her) to perſwade her to accompany me into the Country.</p>
            <p>But no Charms of Perſwaſions had any Influence, nor Reaſon (though very urgent and manifeſt) but was ſlighted.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs before I went out of Town, I writ this Paper, and left it with her.</p>

Becauſe of theſe great Engagements, my Credit, which hath been of value, (but now through ſome Diſparagements and evil practices,) is loſt in <hi>London,</hi> that I cannot borrow any more money to ſupply yours and my preſent wants: And now, when I thought all things had been forgotten, I heard abroad by my Friends; that by certain Warrants iſſued out by the States for your ſelf, and others to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them, that I am aſhamed to walk <hi>London</hi> ſtreets; and I much fear, that if I continue in <hi>London,</hi> you will in ſhort time both ruine your ſelf and me.</p>
                  <p>4. You are ſo tranſported by the Perſwaſions, and practices of your Aunt and Others, that I, nor no Friend of yours, can intreat you to leave their Company and evil counſel, which daily breeds Debates and Strifes between us, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they have been by their ill Counſel and evil Actions, the chief Occaſion of all, which hath brought us to this ſad Condition and Shame that we are now in:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125864:5"/>
So that I may now ſay with <hi>Job, I had once Riches, but they are now wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,</hi> and <hi>once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had a Wife, but now ſhe will be no longer mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. I have no employment nor Calling in <hi>London;</hi> which diſgracefull and unquiet life, is hatefull unto me, and moſt diſadvantagious; for I find not this Town good for my health, (by reaſon of my continual trouble) my expences are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable: And I proteſt before the great God of Heaven, my only Joy and Comfort ſhould have been, and ſhall be (if I can any way find your Affections reciprocal, and your Compliance equal) to ſupport your Honour and Fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Own: But if we continue in <hi>London,</hi> I find all will be quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Dear Heart, take the premiſſes into good, religious, and ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and go with me unto our habitation in the Countrie, by which means, all things that are paſt, will be forgotten, whereby we ſhall be both happy; for my intents are onely and really to make you a happy Woman: For I proteſt before God, when you come into the Country, I ſhall render my ſelf and Estate to your Diſpoſure, to come and go when and where you pleaſe, which ſhall be faithfully and lovingly performed by me, but if not, be pleaſed to take this as a ſad Farewel, from thy</p>

            <p>To which (having ſought <hi>Patience</hi> from above) I returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>That 'tis true, he Married the Plaintiff, and hath ever ſince uſed her with the Reſpects of an affectionate Husband to a loving Wife, and neither hath, nor did intend to deſert her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Company, but much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it, if he may find reſpectfull carriage from her; and is ſo far from leaving her deſtitute of all means, that ſince his Marriage, which was not then above eighteen Moneths, he had furniſhed her with Jewels and Pearl, to the value of 1200 l. beſides Apparel, which coſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 200 l. All which Pearl and Jewels ſhe had in her Poſſeſſion in <hi>March</hi> then laſt paſt, when the Defendant went to his dwelling-houſe in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> at which time, he not only ſollicited her to go and dwell with him, but promiſed her (upon the Enjoyment of her in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) to reſign both himſelf and his Eſtate to her Commands and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſall.</p>
            <p>That he hath likewiſe paid her Father 1000 l. for which he ſhould have ſetled upon the Defendant ſome Eſtate of Inheritance for her Portion, which is all the <hi>Fortune</hi> he ever expected with her, whereof he hath not received the value of one penny.</p>
            <p>That he allowed her for Clothes money, and otherwife for her uſe, above 800 l. And during the time he hath lived with her, he hath ſpent in Houſholdſtuff, Houſe-rent, and Houſe-keeping, 2870 l. ſo that in eighteen Months, he hath ſpent with her 6000 l. And this he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not, as if he repented of his Kindneſs to her, but to evidence to their Lordſhips that there is no juſt cauſe of Complaint againſt him, for not allowing her Maintenance.</p>
            <p>That he never acted any thing of Danger or Cruelty, or that might occaſion any infirmity to her; nor was there ever any Diſagreement, or any Cauſe why ſhe ſhould ſeparate from him; But her deſire was to live in <hi>London,</hi> a place neither agreeable to the Defendants health, or Eſtate; He having already (by reaſon thereof) contracted many. Debts: And confeſſeth, that having (by conſent of her Father and her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125864:6"/>
ſelf) bought an Eſtate in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> ſituate in a healthfull air, and a place of much conveniency, delight and profit, He hath many times by Letters, in Perſon, and by Friends, earneſtly deſired her to live with him at his ſaid houſe in the Country, where ſhe ſhall want for nothing in his power, for her uſe and conveniency, and care ſhall be taken for her accommodation for her Journey, wherein he hopes yet to prevail, that they may mutually enjoy the Comfort of each other, which he much thirſteth after, and is not a little grieved there ſhould be any Queſtion of it.</p>
            <p>That he took ſuch Order (preſently after his going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) whereby the Plaintiff was ſupplyed with monies for her preſent occaſions, and preſumes the foul ſcandals ſuggeſted in the Petition, are well known to the Plaintiff to have ſo little colour of Truth in them, as he hopes the ſame were put into the Petition, as words of Courſe, rather than by her Direction: And he utterly denies the ſame; and therefore he hopes, he ſhall not be ordered to make Allowance to the Petitioner, (as in the Petition) ſhe demands.</p>
            <p>Could ever any Man ſuſpect to be thus dealt withall by a Woman, that had plighted her faith in Marriage to one, who had ſetled ſo great a Joynture, given her ſo many Gifts, ſo much Money, Jewels, and all other accommodations whatſoever in the greateſt Plenty, for the Conſideration of Nothing? Certainly amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelvs have I not ſeen ſo great perfidiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now had I juſt Reaſon to ſuſpect, 'twas not only the malicious Counſels of her wicked Abettors, was the cauſe of her inhumanity towards me; but that ſhe had in her own Breſt a Principle of Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſſatisfaction, even to the Relation of being my Wife.</p>
            <p>Nay ſeeing the <hi>Scene</hi> appears, tis too eaſie to underſtand what Plot is laid and concluded; If ſhe can ſurvive me (which ſhe thinks very probable) and hath no iſſue of our two bodies (which ſhe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to have) by keeping her ſelf from me, Then will ſhe be a <hi>Fortune</hi> indeed, and her Widdowhood be worth its weight in Gold. And if in the mean time (during my life) ſhe can have from the Lords Commiſſioners (by way of <hi>Alimony</hi>) 300 <hi>per annum,</hi> ſhe will think her ſelf in a better condition, than her father, who had but 240 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> both for himſelf and his whole Family: And to proſecute the Sute, ſhe hath 1200l. worth of Jewels already, and 500l. in ready Caſh advanced, and her Husband much in debt, ſo that peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhe may outſpend him alſo even at Law.</p>
            <p>But to obtain this glorious deſign, many difficulties are to be paſs'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125864:7"/>
through; And though ſhe herſelf hath reſolved to calumniate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently (preſuming that ſomewhat will gain a Belief amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) yet will not this be enough; and therefore, <hi>Witneſſes</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared of as large <hi>Conſciences</hi> as <hi>Foreheads:</hi> And for their better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, They ſhall participate in the Gain and Advantage: Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Expreſſions and Opportunities to ſuch Perſons, whoſe defamed Lives, and neceſſitous Fortunes, rendred them, neither in a Capacity to live, or converſe with People of any Honeſty or Reputation.</p>
            <p>As for her part, her ſuggeſtions and inſinuations were high indeed; much fear ſhe pretended (for had it been more than a Pretence, all had been accompliſhed, and my life loſt) leſt ſhe ſhould participate of the Sins and Puniſhments of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> And as for her body ſhe durſt not truſt that with me leſt (at any time being Moroſe and Cholerick) I ſhould injure her by Blows; or if kind, I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her with unclean diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>To enforce theſe Motives upon the Minds of all People, who now took notice of theſe diſtractions, Never was there a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Vizard of Modeſty put on by a Woman: Never were Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion more diſtorted to an ill end; no Projects and Practices of Obſcenity and Murder it ſelf, were wanting to colour theſe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious devices againſt me; Nay, ſo groſſely infatuated was ſhe in her ſcandall, that ſhe repreſented my perſon to be more like to a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> than a <hi>Mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Abettors are not wanting in acting their parts alſo; What ſhe inſinuated they converted into clamours; neither ſtuck to depoſe any thing, what poſſibly could be believ'd to be ſworn by them, without any apparent contradiction.</p>
            <p>Having thus prepoſſeſſed the Ears of as many Perſons of Quality as ſhe could, and framed a Harmony of Teſtimonies (as well as of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) with as much Art and Cunning, as her own Wit, or her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, (or the matter it ſelf could ſupply) ſhe took out with much eagerneſſe a Commiſſion out of the Court, to make what proof ſhe could of her Petition.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this further provocation alſo, my Lips were lock'd up with ſilence, as well as my Heart with ſorrow, not reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating Evil for Evil in the leaſt meaſure; or ſo much as intimating unto her, of her firſt Follies (which if they were publiſhed by me) might have raiſed a great Cloud upon her Reputation: Neither was I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be totally Paſſive of what injuries had paſſed, but was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to leave any means unattempted to reclaim her from theſe extravagancies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:125864:7"/>And thereupon went unto her in Perſon, with Mr. <hi>Eſcot,</hi> Serjeant <hi>Middleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Zancheys</hi> houſe (he himſelf being preſent) and with as much Rhetorick as my real affection to her could dictate did paſſionately move her to a Reconciliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhewing what Scandal and diſhonour would follow ſuch differences, and promiſing withal, a perfect Oblivion of whatſoever had been acted againſt me; And to fortifie my arguments the better, I deſired all thoſe Gentlemen there preſent, to do the office of Chriſtian Moderators, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſtop the Breaches between us, which were too wide already.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe, by how much the more weight ſhe perceived in our Reaſons, the more obſtinacy ſhe diſcovered in her returns, utterly rejecting any agreement, upon what terms ſoever.</p>
            <p>Hereupon ſuſpecting in her the apparent Symptoms of a ſear'd Conſcience; and how that by my ſilence, the World began to infer a main Guilt of thoſe Aſperſions which had been divulged againſt me, Upon the ſerious advice of my Counſel (though I cannot but acknowledge a very great Reluctancy thereunto) I was perſwaded to examine Witneſſes alſo, both to vindicate my own integrity, and to diſcover unto the world the Grand Cheat that was contrived to gain my Eſtate (which could no otherwiſe be accompliſhed) without defaming my Perſon (and if it were poſſible) to take away my life alſo: which ſhall evidently appear anon.</p>
            <p>But before I ſhall give an Account of the proofs which were made on my behalf, I ſhall according to her own forwardneſſe and Method give your Highneſs a ſhort view, what was atteſted for her.</p>
            <p>One ſwore, That he ſaw me ſquieze her (at eleven a clock) one night, as She was going down ſtairs.</p>
            <p>Another that ſhe heard my Wife complain of ill uſage (but though ſhe lived in houſe with us) never heard me give an ill word to her.</p>
            <p>Another heard her cry out, Help, Help, Murder, Murder; and ſaw me take her by the Throat: Though I refer my ſelf to my <hi>Affidavit</hi> on Oath, yet when I ſhall manifeſt it, (That this Woman who ſwore this, was brought in that very night, and next morning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away) I ſuppoſe 'twill be no difficult thing to perſwade any one to believe, that this Creature was brought in on purpoſe to be a Witneſſe againſt me.</p>
            <p>The Woman that ſwore this was brought in that very night, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be a Witneſſe, and the next morning went away again.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Meaſter</hi> (a pretended <hi>French Phyſician</hi>) ſwore that ſhe was ill; and that there was a ſuſpition of Poyſon: but this was five moneths
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125864:8"/>
after ſhe left me; and was commonly reported to have the Pox, (which being a Venemous Diſeaſe) the <hi>Frenchman</hi> might ſafely ſwear (with a mental Reſervation, the frequent Practice of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) there was a ſuſpition of Poyſon.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance of what was ſworn againſt Me, (and ſhould I name the Perſons of the Witneſſes) they were more mean than their Teſtimonies; The Chief of them was her <hi>Aunt</hi> Miſtreſs <hi>Williamſon;</hi> of whom I ſhall ſay no other, but that her <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> is after the rate of 300, or 400l. <hi>per annum,</hi> though it be well known, That neither her Husband, nor her ſelf, have any <hi>Profeſsion</hi> to live by, or any viſible Eſtate, nor worth a Penny; but are ſo nearly poor, That he or ſhe dares not appear in publique, leſt they be carried away by <hi>Bailiffs</hi> for the Multitude of Debts he owes.</p>
            <p>This is that ungodly Wretch, who too viſibly hath been the Ruine, both of my ſelf and Wife, as will appear from the Depoſitions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Perſon</hi> there was produced on her behalf (whoſe Name hath a Reputation in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>John Brampſton;</hi>) yet all that he can depoſe for Her, is nothing which is material, but that he never knew her defam'd, but in this Buſines, and that ſhe was bred up amongſt his Children; and that he often endeavour'd a Reconciliation between us: Whether he did it, or no, I cannot affirm, but when I was told by him lately, and never heretofore, That he had a <hi>Pre-Morgage</hi> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of 240 l. <hi>per annum</hi> (made unto him by <hi>Stepkins</hi>) which was ſetled on Me for the Conſideration aforeſaid, I hope, that I ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, as too jealous without a Ground, That he is fiſhing for his own Intereſt in our troubled waters.</p>
            <p>Were there ought elſe conſiderable depoſed againſt me, I ſhould deal ſo ingenuouſly as to relate it, being very confident, that at the hearing of my Cauſe before any in Authority, there will not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Agents</hi> enough for her, to lay open the worſt againſt me.</p>
            <p>One thing therefore more (and that which they think moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable againſt me, not in order to juſtifie her Complaint, but to take off a Belieſ, from what ſhe knew I could prove againſt her and her ſaid Aunt <hi>Williamſon</hi>) was briefly this, That I endeavour'd to ſuborn one <hi>Holdſworth</hi> (a poor fellow about the Town) to ſwear point blanck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That my Wife was a Whore, and her <hi>Aunt Williamſon</hi> a Bawd.</p>
            <p>That I may be impartial in this <hi>Narration,</hi> I ſhall cite the very words themſelves of this Depoſition, which are theſe.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> was: twelve-moneth, He (<hi>viz.</hi> this Deponent)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:125864:8"/>
came to the Defendant, (<hi>viz.</hi> to my ſelf) for Money for one <hi>Nicholas;</hi> and the Defendant ſaid, He could prove Miſtreſs <hi>Williamſon</hi> a Bawd, and would have had him ſworn it; and offered the Deponent money to ſwear the Plaintiff (meaning Mrs. <hi>Ivie</hi>) was a Whore.</p>
            <p>That he had made the Commiſſioners for him; and ſaid, That <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> and all his <hi>Family</hi> were <hi>Baſe People,</hi> and often offered him money to ſwear; and ſaid, he had two Witneſſes more, if he would make up the third.</p>
            <p>How much Indiſcretion, as well as Falſhood, was in this Deponent, and both in them, who imployed this inferiour Perſon, and who too probably practiz'd that infamous <hi>Act</hi> of Creating Knights of the Poſt (which ſeems to appear, even from the Oath it ſelf) For certainly, had I been provided with two Witneſſes (as he ſaid I told him) which Number the Law admits even in the higheſt Caſes) it had not only been an impertinent loſing of my Money, but my Honeſty alſo, to no purpoſe: Beſides there are ſcarſe any ſo ignorant, but underſtand how difficult a thing it is to prove even a Whore, a Whore.</p>
            <p>'Twas againſt the Advice of my Counſel, and my own Inclination alſo, to examine any VVitneſs of ſo mean a Quality in ſuch Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (as theſe are between my ſelf and my VVife) leſt the contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibleneſs of the Evidence, might derogate from the Truth of the thing: Moſt of thoſe (whom I produced to give Teſtimony on my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half) were perſons of fair Eſtates, many hundreds <hi>per annum,</hi> and ſuch, who for many years paſt, have been Juſtices of the Peace in their Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But more (of this <hi>Nature</hi>) I omit: For (without Doubt) <hi>Poverty</hi> &amp; <hi>Honeſty</hi> are not inconſiſtent: The moſt precious Saints of God, are more frequently found cloath'd with Raggs, than in a Kings houſe: <hi>Job</hi> himſelf was more acceptable to the Lord on the Dunghill, than in his coſtly Palaces: But withall there muſt be a Poverty in Spirit, as well as in Eſtate; otherwiſe, they will forfeit both their <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> &amp; their <hi>Credit</hi> amongſt <hi>Men:</hi> For certainly a poor Man (being notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vicious and ſcandalous) is to be reputed rather a <hi>Vermin</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> than a Member of <hi>Chriſtian Society,</hi> whoſe Teſtimonies ſtink in their own Noſtrils, and their Memory ſhall periſh with them.</p>
            <p>That your Highneſs may the more knowingly judge and determine, both of this and other Proofs againſt me, I humbly begg leave to lay before your Highneſs the Manifeſtation of my Anſwer which I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my Wifes Petition, and what Evidences I produced to the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it.</p>

            <p>To the third Charge, That I had given her foul Diſeaſes, (meaning the <hi>Pox</hi>) 'twas not only Depoſed, that I was then free, but upon the Search of my Body, (which I voluntarily did deſire might be done by able and honeſt Phyſicians) but there was not the leaſt Sign or Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome, that I ever had that fowl Diſeaſe. <hi>l.

                        <p>And I do firſt upon my Oath ſay and affirm, that I have been ſo far from Acting and Committing that foul Sin of Sodomy upon her Body, that I never had within my breſt the leaſt inclination or deſire to ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125864:10"/>
vile &amp; abominable a thing; neither did I ever attempt to perſwade her by fair Words and Inticements, or to move her by threats, or ever u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the leaſt force or ſtrugling with her to compaſs any ſuch Baſe or Heatheniſh Deſigne, as ſhe moſt falſly and opprobriouſly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with.</p>
                        <p>And moreover, whereas on a certain night ſhe was neceſſitated, in preſervation of her life, as ſhe had ſuggeſted to the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſeveral others, to leap out of the Bed from me, to cry out, <hi>Murther, Murther;</hi> alleging, that I offer'd violence unto her by pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beating, and ſtriking: Now I do proteſt and depoſe before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that this was done without any ſuch provocation, even in the leaſt meaſure; Nay at the ſame time, while ſhe was attempting to leave my houſe, and running to her Fathers, I us'd all the friendly and kind Perſwaſions which I could expreſſe to detain her, and onely holding her by the arm, without the leaſt hurt as I believe, I often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated my hearty Sollicitations unto her to remain with me: But I do really beleeve, upon the conſideration of ſeveral Circumſtances and Paſſages ſince that time, that both her Out-cry, and her Subſequent Behaviour was deſign'd before that night. If any thing at that time might be look'd on as a ſhadow to juſtifie her proceedings, it was this, That a little before ſhe leap'd out of the Bed (amongſt other Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) I intimated a Diſlike of her Carriage, which was obſerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, towards one who pretended to be her Phyſician; This, and this only, was all the Cauſe and Occaſion (if this be any) of her forſaking me at that time. And for all other times whatſoever, I do affirm upon Oath, that I never gave her the leaſt ſtroak in my life, or ever did ſo much as pinch her in Jeſt, to the beſt of my Remembrance, or did ever directly or indirectly, let fall from my mouth any kinds of Threats whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>And I do further ſwear, That untill ſuch time as ſhe exhibited that foul and ſcandalous Petition to the Lords Commiſſioners, that I lov'd her unfeignedly, reſpected and eſteemed her above all Creatures in the World; and as I layd down my <hi>Fortune</hi> at her feet when I firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her, ſo would I have layd down my <hi>Life</hi> too, for her good and preſervation. Nay, I do allege further upon my Oath, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſcandalous and falſe Petition exhibited againſt me in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of her malicious deſignes, ſhe had examined Witneſſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame me; yet out of Chriſtian and tender Conſideration of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein I ſtood towards her, as a Husband, I was willing from my heart, and did endeavour (by the ſeverall means of Perſons of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:125864:11"/>
Quality, allyed both to my Self and Her) to compoſe all differences, that We might for the future Cohabit together in Peace and Content; and not to regard any Aſperſions which ſhe and all her Witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there examined, had caſt upon me, not to retaliate in the leaſt meaſure, ſtill deferring the Examination of my Witneſſes againſt her, and attending whether it would pleaſe the Lord to give her a ſight of the Error of her way, and to return her home to her Husband, who was moſt willing to receive her.</p>
                        <p>As to that Aſperſion caſt upon me, That I committed folly with her Servant <hi>Jane Gilbert,</hi> though I need not ſay much to it, the Maid her ſelf, and other credible Witneſſes having clear'd me in that point, both in Court, and on her Death-bed; and convinced the World of the horrid and unheard-of Practices of her and her Abettors, in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and expoſing the body of the ſaid <hi>Jane</hi> to the View and Search of ſeverall men, and ſuborning her to give in Teſtimony againſt me; yet that the World may know the Integrity of my Soul in this alſo, I do further ſwear, That I never entertain'd within me the leaſt thought of corrupting her Chaſtity, or did ever commit any unlawfull or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt action with her, from the time I knew her to this day.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, whereas I am charged by my Wife to have ſuborn'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Witneſſes againſt her, and particularly one <hi>Holdſworth;</hi> I call the Lord to bear me Record in this alſo, and do upon my Oath affirm, That I did never directly or indirectly procure any Witneſſes againſt her to teſtifie farther than the truth of the thing, what he or ſhe would knowingly and ſafely, without breach of Faith or good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Depoſe.</p>
                        <p>True it is, that <hi>Holdſworth</hi> being imployed as a Bayliff to arreſt me at the Sute of my Wifes Taylor, for a conſiderable ſum of money, which ſhe her ſelf was indebted for, and behaving himſelf civilly towards me, I gave him five ſhillings, and for no other end or purpoſe; And upon my Oath, I proteſt, that I never had any ſuch Communication or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the ſaid <hi>Holdſworth,</hi> to any ſuch intent or purpoſe, as he hath moſt maliciouſly depoſed againſt me.</p>

            <p>Beſides theſe ſhort intimations, many foul and horrid ſtories (could I have produced) of Deſigns for my Deſtruction: but becauſe I was not able to make out clear and evident proofs of them, I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either to trouble the Court, or diſturb my own Thoughts, with any thing leſſe than Realities and Demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One History.</hi> or rather a Diſmal <hi>Tragedy,</hi> acted by my Wife; Mrs. <hi>Williamſon,</hi> and their conſpiracy, was with all its Circumſtarces, ſo clearly delineated in the Depoſitions, that I ſhould wrong my Cauſe, ſhould I not relate this alſo: and perhaps few <hi>Romance's</hi> or <hi>Guſman</hi> himſelf can parallel it.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:125864:14"/>
purpoſe) had ſo ſtreight a Conſcience, that ſhe would not ſwear, that my Wife had been injured in thoſe parts; Did therupon conclude, that ſome other way muſt be found out, which might admit of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies;</hi> otherwiſe, they ſuſpected, my Wife could hardly obtain <hi>Alimony,</hi> or procure a <hi>ſeparation</hi> from me.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it ſeems, This Plot was afterwards put in execution upon <hi>Jane Gilbert:</hi> Its proved, <hi>l. C. f.</hi> 115.</p>
            <p>This Wench they picht upon to be the Inſtrument of their Deſign, becauſe ſhe being actually a Servant in my Houſe, it might be thought very eaſie for me to find an opportunity to lie with her; and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of a ſickly diſpoſition, it would be no difficult thing to raiſe a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, that ſhe might poſſibly be with Child, eſpecially, being not well recovered of the Dreggs of the Small Pox, which ſhe had had a little before.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> (that ſhe might the better colour her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention privately) carried this Maids water unto one, whom they call <hi>Trigg,</hi> a Shoo-maker (as I have heard) by Trade, and enquired of him, whether the Party that made this water, were not with Child?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trigg</hi> (having good Inſtructions, and doubtleſs a large Fee) Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> to bring the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert</hi> unto him, and he would ſearch her.</p>
            <p>At her return home to my Wife, there was a new conſult, how they might carry the Maid to <hi>Trigg,</hi> and make her willing to be ſearch'd? leave that to me, (ſaid my Wife) and immediatly went unto <hi>Jane Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Jenny,</hi> my Father hath ſent for my Aunt <hi>Williamſon</hi> and me to Breakfaſt to morrow morning, and hath commanded me to bring thee with us, becauſe he hath provided a Diſh of <hi>Milk and Eggs,</hi> that which he knowes thou doeſt dearly love: The Maid (little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any miſchieſ, couch'd under this pretended Kindneſs) thank'd her Miſtreſs; but by reaſon of the many cloaths ſhe had to ſteel and ſtarch againſt the morrow, (being <hi>Sabbath-day</hi>) was willing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: Nay <hi>Jenny,</hi> replyed my Wife, you muſt and ſhall go; for I know my Father will be angry, if we bring you not.</p>
            <p>So a Coach being call'd, my Wife, Mrs. <hi>VVilliamſon,</hi> and the Maid went to Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> houſe, but neither found him, nor the <hi>Milk and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:125864:14"/>
               <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and perſwaded her to make <hi>Trigg</hi> believe, ſhe was a new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried VVoman, and ſo that would put a Trick upon the Doctor his skill.</p>
            <p>After they were all arrived in the Doctors preſence, Mrs. <hi>VVilliamſon</hi> made a private addreſs unto him, and pretended to have acquainted him with the pain in her Guts. But having ended her Tale in privat, What think you, ſaid ſhe, of yonder new married Wife? <hi>Trigg</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving felt her pulſe, and bid her ſpit once or twice) told her, ſhe was <hi>Splenetick;</hi> Like enough that, quoth Mrs. <hi>VVilliamſon;</hi> But is ſhe not breeding Doctor? Yes, I warrant you, ſaid he; ſo the wench turning about, and ſmiling, was bid go out by Mrs. <hi>VVillamſon,</hi> (that ſhe and her Miſtreſs might have ſome private Diſcourſe with <hi>Trigg,</hi> about the Drink which they had given her) which ſhe did accordingly, whilſt her Miſtreſs, Mrs. <hi>VVilliamſon</hi> and <hi>Trigg</hi> held a long Conference toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when this <hi>Scene</hi> was over, All returned home.</p>
            <p>About three or four dayes after the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert,</hi> having been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed leave by my Wife to go viſit her friends in the Country, for the Recovery of her health, my Wife took her into a Chamber, and ſaid, Ah <hi>Jenny,</hi> But I have ſomewhat more to tell you, (and thereupon ſhut the Chamber door, none being preſent but them two, and Mrs <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamſon,</hi>) 'Tis commonly reported, <hi>Jenny,</hi> quoth my Wife, that you are with child, and 'tis my deſire to have it cleer'd: Tuſh, ſaid Mrs. <hi>VVilliamſon,</hi> if it be ſo, I warrant you 'tis by the Beſt in the houſe; (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelf) Let us know it, for we can, and will conceal it, and ſo diſpoſe things, that it ſhall never be a diſcredit, or diſgrace unto her; Nay, if ſhe will confeſs that ſhe was with Child, they would provide for her; But, ſaid they, if you will refuſe to let us know it, and go into the Country, we will Report, that you are gone to take ſome Phyſick to deſtroy the Child.</p>
            <p>The Maid now conſidering what ſnare they had brought her into, by going to <hi>Trigg,</hi> (as aforeſaid) being perſwaded to act the part of a new married woman, was aſtoniſhed at this Surprizal, and cryed out, The Lord protect me, for I am very innocent from any ſuch thing; and withall my heart, ſaid ſhe, will I do any thing, that may give you ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or clear my ſelf from this Scandal.</p>
            <p>Look here, ſaid my Wife to her, my Father hath ſent me a Letter, where he ſays, That Doctor <hi>Trigg</hi> ſayes that you are certainly with Child; and if you will not confeſſe, you muſt be whipped in <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were thus Diſcourſing, (often intimating that 'twas their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:125864:15"/>
Deſigne to make this Maid confeſs her ſelf with Child by me) in came Mrs. <hi>Seſsions,</hi> my Wifes Midwife, whom ſhe perſwaded to ſearch <hi>Jane Gilbert,</hi> which ſhe willingly ſubmitted unto; and the midwife (in their preſence) acquitted her from being with Child.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, my Wife commanding ſome tears from her Eyes, wept paſſionately (as ſhe ſeemed) and breaking into great Paſſion, ſaid, Ah <hi>Jenny,</hi> have I loved and entertained thee thus long, been as kind to thee, and as tender of thy good, as if thou wert my own Child, and canſt thou conceal any thing from me? Doubtleſs thou art with Child: and therefore come, put on your mask, for you ſhall once more to Doctor <hi>Trigg,</hi> who underſtands theſe things better than any midwife; and he will prove you to be with Child: And that you may not think I have any Plot upon you, (that Objection was very ſtrong within her) put on your mask, (that the Doctor may not know your face again) and fetch your Water; and Mrs. <hi>Seſſions</hi> ſhall go with you.</p>
            <p>The Maid being perplexed in mind, and far from any of her Friends, knew not what to do in this condition: But being urged by her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe went again with the Midwife.</p>
            <p>After the Midwife had given <hi>Trigg</hi> her Water, and diſcourſt with him privately; He called to <hi>Jane Gilbert,</hi> and bid her go up ſtairs with him: But the poor Wench (not knowing which to prefer, her <hi>Modeſty</hi> or <hi>Innocency</hi>) refuſed to go with him; until at length (being clamour'd at, and abſolutely forced up to his Chamber) ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to follow him: VVhere <hi>Trigg</hi> began to acquaint her, that her miſtreſſe Mrs. <hi>Ivie,</hi> had told him, that ſhe had been too famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with her Maſter, and therefore he muſt ſearch her: And did thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (in a moſt rude and violent manner) force his hands under her Coats, to her naked Body; and did uſe her in a moſt abominable way, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And when he had effected his buſineſſe, he told the Midwife that ſhe was with Child; though the Maid abſolutely and earneſtly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Hereupon they left <hi>Trigg,</hi> and returned to my VVife, who having heard the Relation from Mrs. <hi>Seſſions,</hi> what had been done (being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unſatisfied) cauſed her to be carried to another Phyſician, Dr. <hi>Hinchley,</hi> and ſhewed him the VVater; and deſired him alſo to ſearch her in like manner: But his <hi>Verdict</hi> was unlike that of the (<hi>Mountebanck) Trigg;</hi> for he peremptorily avouch'd ſhe was not with Child.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this could not ſatisfie the aim of my VVife,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:125864:15"/>
and Mrs. <hi>Williamſon:</hi> But once more ſhe muſt expoſe her nakedneſſe to a ſearch of another Doctor, a Man-midwife, Dr. <hi>Hinton,</hi> who in like manner, as Dr. <hi>Hinchley</hi> (notwithſtanding Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> and my VVife did earneſtly ſollicite him to atteſt that ſhe was with Child) acquitted her from being with Child; and would juſtifie her to be a Virgin.</p>
            <p>Theſe two <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> did no way forward their Deſign, for by this means, all the pains in Threatnings and Perſwaſions, (to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her ſelf with Child by me) began to be undervalued, by how much the more the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert</hi> had been acquitted by the two Doctors and Midwife, and accuſed only by that <hi>Ignorant Quack Trigg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore ſeeing the VVench was ſo obſtinate that ſhe would not comply with them, (and leaſt at my return ſhe might diſcover this unto me) a new Project was ſet on foot, ſo to terrifie the Wench, that ſhe might leave <hi>London</hi> immediatly.</p>
            <p>And thereupon they came unto her, and told her, that Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> my Wifes Father, would doe her a notorious <hi>Miſchief</hi> if ſhe would not acknowledge her ſelf with Child: Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> adviſ'd the Maid to goe for a while into the Country, until Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was over.</p>
            <p>Upon this account ſhe was ſent away to her Fathers houſe in <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> where immediately after her arrival, ſhe received a Letter from my Wife; that her Father <hi>Stepkins</hi> was ſo incenſed againſt her, that he would not ſuffer her any longer to live with my Wife.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the great love ſhe bore, ſhe would not leave her deſtitute of a ſervice, but would provide a convenient Place for her,</p>
            <p>Scarce eight days had paſſed, but down comes Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> to her (pretending ſhe had been at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) and came out of her way on purpoſe to ſee her; Though 'twas evident ſhe came directly from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſomuch that the Maid ſuſpected ſome farther ill towards her; (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been formerly ſo abuſed) But parling together, about former Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, The Maid asked Mrs. <hi>Williamſon;</hi> what Ill ſhe had deſerved from her Miſtreſſe, that ſhe ſhould be ſo diſgraced, as ſhe had been; and though ſhe found her guiltleſſe, ſhe ſhould now be put away? Well, quoth the Maid, by Gods help, I will be to morrow in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and will endeavour to right my ſelf from theſe Aſperſions.</p>
            <p>Whereupon ſhe found the end of Mrs <hi>Williamſons</hi> Journey (was to hinder the Maid from comming to <hi>London</hi>) (becauſe I was the day
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:125864:16"/>
before arrived out of the Countrey) leſt ſhe ſhould ſee me, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what had been done unto her; in order to make her confeſſe that I lay with her, and that ſhe was with Child by me.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> now perceiving, that the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert</hi> was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make a ſtir in this ſoul buſineſſe, returned with all ſpeed to my Wife; and wiſhed her to think of a way, how to hinder her from ſpeaking with me.</p>
            <p>The next Day, as ſoon as the ſaid <hi>Jane Gilbert</hi> came to my houſe, my Wife met her at the Door, and giving her many good words, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to take a Lodging near that place, (and change her name) and that ſhe would pay for it.</p>
            <p>The Maid (very much troubled at this uſage) was very preſſing to know what offence ſhe had ever given her; Truly, quoth my Wife, Sweet <hi>Jenny,</hi> I love thee moſt dearly; But the Truth of all is, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and his friends give out, that 'tis unfit for me to keep a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman to wait upon me, beſides common Servants; and that 'twas their envy towards her, and therefore ſhe muſt be gone: but withall aſſur'd her, that ſhe would provide a convenient place for her.</p>
            <p>My Wife now thought, that ſhe had (by this Trick) made the Maid believe me to be the ſole cauſe of her turning away, and ſufficiently exaſperated her againſt me; yet did not deſpair of a complyance from her, and therefore ſaid, For my part, I am content you ſtay this night, (that ſhe might farther try her) and to morrow thou ſhalt have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lodging look'd out for thee.</p>
            <p>But my Wife underſtanding the next morning, that I began to parle with the Maid about the paſſages aforeſaid, (which indeed were communicated to me in the Country) knockt very furiouſly for her to come up into her Chamber; and commanded her immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leave the houſe, and would not ſuffer her to ſpeak any more to me.</p>
            <p>Whereupon ſhe went to one Mr. <hi>Prices</hi> houſe, a Brother of one of her fellow ſervants, and lay there privatly, (as ſhe thought) but 'twas made known to my Wife; who immediatly ſent a Maid to ſound of what temper ſhe was, and how ſhe ſtood affected towards her: and it being return'd, that ſhe was full of Diſdain and Paſſion, by reaſon of the aforeſaid practices againſt her; and that ſhe would forthwith ſend for her Trunks, they were immediatly ſeized upon by my Wife, and looked up in her Cloſet.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, upon this Report, the maid did not ſend, but came her ſelf to demand her Trunks; and I ſeeing of her in the houſe,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:125864:16"/>
began to ask again, why ſhe went away, and upon what occaſion that Searching of her (by men, and women) were? But her Miſtr eſs calling her Queane for acquainting me with it, and threatning to ſtrike her for it, denyed her the Trunks, and cauſed her forthwith to be ſent away: And the very next Day Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> and my Wife gave out in Speeches, (amongſt my Family, and Neighbours) that they had broke open the Trunks, and had found that ſhe had been a Baggage, and a notorious Thief, and ſtollen her Goods.</p>
            <p>And thereupon (the better to ſecure the Wench, either for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of theſe Abuſes, or telling me the Truth of her Uſage) they procured a Warrant from my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Roles</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Maid for her Life, (having charged her with Fellony.) But finding that the Maid kept in, and that by vertue of the ſaid War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they could not enter any houſe to take her forth, they entered into a new Project, how the Wench might be ſecured (both Tongue and Perſon) and alſo, that they might ſeize on her, whereſoever ſhe was.</p>
            <p>To this end, Mr. <hi>Paunceſoot</hi> was look'd on as a fit Inſtrument (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Relation to the <hi>Lord Preſident Bradſhaw</hi>) and was deſired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them a Warrant from the <hi>Council of State,</hi> upon Pretence, that this poor VVench held Correſpondency (with the Enemies of the Commonwealth) beyond Seas, and ſo apprehend her: By vertue of which VVarrant ſhe was ſeized on accordingly; and kept Cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner 18 days together with great hardſhips.</p>
            <p>During this Impriſonment, a Gentleman came to this VVench from my VVife, adviſing her to humble her ſelf to her Miſtreſs, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her ſelf Guilty, and much to that purpoſe, but ſhe (being innocent) utterly refuſed any ſuch Acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>During this Impriſonment, many Petitions (for to be heard at the Council) did ſhe attempt to preſent, but were ſtill kept off by the means of the ſaid <hi>Paunceſoot,</hi> neither could ſhe ever be heard.</p>
            <p>At length my Wife and Mrs. <hi>Williamſon</hi> finding nothing could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail (after ſorrow and grief (in this lamentable condition) had almoſt killed her, they had contrived a meeting for the Wench (by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of her Keeper) in <hi>Moor-fields;</hi> where, as ſoon as my Wife ſaw her, ſhe fell into a deep fit of weeping to the Wench, and told her how dearly ſhe loved her, and that ſhe was in perfect friendſhip with her, and earneſtly deſired that all things (which had paſſed) might be forgotten; promiſing withall, (that in a very ſhort time) ſhe would abundantly expreſſe, how ſenſible ſhe had been of her late Sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:125864:17"/>Hereupon my Wife, without ever acquainting or procuring their Order for her freedom, (only giving the Meſſenger of the Council of State 20 l.) cauſed the Maid by her own Power (by which it ſeems ſhe ſtood commited) to be ſet at liberty.</p>
            <p>But very ſuddenly after enlargement (her body being quite ſpent, and her mind almoſt diſtracted with grief and melancholy) She died; and in her Death bed profeſſed ſolemnly (that by reaſon of thoſe Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, which had been practiſed upon her, by Mrs. <hi>Williamſon,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Ivie;</hi> and eſpecially by the operation of a Potion given her by them, (which upon the words of a dying woman) ſhe believed to be poyſon) That they had been the cauſe of her death; and that ſhe doubted not but that the Almighty God would require her Blood at their hands.</p>
            <p>After theſe things were laid open to the Lords Commiſſioners for the great Seal; I little expected that Vices ſhould be received for Reaſons; that ſuch abominations ſhould have been thought worthy the protection, not to ſay the encouragement of ſuch eminent Judges; but with grief of heart, and empty Purſe, may I ſay, that I found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally there Chancery rather a Court of oppreſſion, than good Conſcience; nay, I have this peculiar in my Caſe (that after all VVitneſſes on both ſides were examined) they never afforded me that favour (which they omitted to none) as to command me and my VVife in Perſon to attend them, and to endeavour a Reconciliation between us.</p>
            <p>This I thought hard meaſure, becauſe I was informed all others had participated of that Civility from them; and the more hard, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard my VVife had frequent and private addreſſes unto them, and I was never admitted any.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this, not only aſtoniſhed me, but gave me a ſtrong Alarm alſo to be very Circumſpect, leſt I might have as little Juſtice in their Sentence, as I had favour in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>And that on the other ſide, when I remembred, they openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before my Council, that nothing ſhould be concluded without ſending for both parties, and alſo their parties; and alſo their Order of the 27 of <hi>October</hi> 1651. that they had denied her any expences of the Sute, in regard the merits of the Cauſe ſhould be ſpeedily heard; I could not conclude within my ſelf, but that I ſhould be dealt withal according to their own Rules, and practice of all the of <hi>England;</hi> and that a Summons (upon a day of hearing ſhould be firſt ſent)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:125864:17"/>
ere any Sentence pronounced, or Decree made in the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>But what I often ſuſpected, and was intimated unto me by others, I had now too much reaſon to believe.</p>
            <p>For after eight moneths (having all that while never received any command to wait upon their Lordſhips) when all my Counſel was out of Town, <hi>Iuly</hi> 24 1652: (Her Counſel Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> and Lieut. Col. <hi>Zanchey,</hi> her Sollicitor, with a Sword by his ſide) preſented unto the Lords Commiſſioners, a final Decree ready drawn; (it not being firſt peruſed by Counſel of my ſide, as by the Rules of the Court it ought to have been) for no leſs than 300l. <hi>per annum,</hi> (a fair ſum, and enough to tempt a good Woman to be bad:) The Draught of the Order is thus.</p>

            <p>Whereupon I renewed my humble and earneſt Requeſt unto them, with all the Vehemency I could expreſs, That they would make no Decree, before they had heard the merits of the Cauſe on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, I found 'twas their Reſolution to ſigne that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Paper, and to declare before-hand, that they had found juſt Cauſe for <hi>Alimony;</hi> The Preamble of the Decree being full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and conteining ſeveral Inſinuations againſt me: all that they thought fit to adde, was this Clauſe, [<hi>Vntill further Order.</hi>] A dear Expreſſion in Chancery, and as coſtly as the other, [<hi>Vnleſſe He ſhew Cauſe.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Now, and not before, was the Order, (which they commonly call the Decree, having put the Great Seal unto it) delivered unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter to enter, which firſt ought to have been drawn by him, and then peruſed by Counſel on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Had any one but heard, what ſmooth words the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners gave me at this time, telling me, That it ſhould not be prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unto me, and that they would hear my Counſel at any time, come when I would, and that 'twas but a Temporary thing, and that

they would deal tenderly with me, in ſo tender a Caſe, as between man and Wife, one would have almoſt been perſwaded, that it had been my duty to have given my conſent alſo: But though there was Honey in their Mouths, yet was there too too much Gall in their Inke, and Wormewood in their Decree.</p>
            <p>Had they but conſidered the Deed of Covenant which (they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) they had peruſed, 'twould have appear'd very evident, that there was no ſhadow for ſo great allowance, as 300 l. <hi>per annum:</hi> When her Father himſelf, and my Wife alſo made to me a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of giving her the liberty of living where ſhe would, and ſetting out for her fit allowance, they themſelves did deſire, no more but 120 l. <hi>per annum, Depoſ. l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides of the Articles (in my cuſtody) which they cauſed to be drawn to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe the Lords Commiſſioners were ſo far from conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they ſigned, that they never read the Deed, which they mention; nay, I think, I may ſafely ſay; They did not, or would not conſider the Act it ſelf, for <hi>Alimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that Act impowers them, to give only ſuch <hi>Alimony,</hi> as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Fortune which the Woman brought; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be raiſed out of the Husband Eſtate. Whereas the truth is, ſhe hath not (in all her Proofs) proved, that ſhe had been, or in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility could ever be worth a Penny to Me.</p>
            <p>And as for that Eſtate, which the Lords Commiſſioners did decree unto her, 'tis true, I had an equitable Title unto it; but it really did belong to the Heir, at Law, until ſuch time as I had performed ſome ſmall Covenant.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Stepkins,</hi> his Son and Heir, alſo was injured by theſe proceedings of the Lords Commiſſioners; for which he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made his Complaint, as well, as his juſt Title in Law, though to little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I know full well, what ſhadow the Commiſſioners put on this dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; but whether it be juſt and righteous, I ſubmit to your Breſt, and that is thus.</p>
            <p>That although it was Covenanted, between Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> and my <hi>Truſtees,</hi> that in caſe I did not perform all the Covenants (to which I had obliged my ſelf) then was the ſaid Eſtate of 240 l. to goe to the uſe of the right Heirs of the ſaid <hi>Stepkins,</hi> until ſuch time as I ſhould perform: By virtue of this Clauſe, did young <hi>Stepkins,</hi> lay claim to the ſaid Eſtate.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:125864:19"/>
Yet ſay the Commiſſioners, that Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> the Father (Who had reſerved unto himſelf the Remainder of the ſaid Limitation, to me and my Wife) made a VVill; and by that VVill had acquitted me from any further Performance; inſomuch that the Eſtate was now totally belonging unto me.</p>
            <p>This I believe my VVife told them; and peradventure ſhewed them ſuch a VVill; and this is their Ground: But by their leave, I cannot think, till ſuch a VVill be legally proved, That it can be any Ground for them, to give away the Eſtate in ſuch manner, as they have; upon a bare ſuggeſtion of one Party, for whoſe intereſt and profit it was.</p>
            <p>Certainly had they been as conſcientious Judges (as they are Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Conſcience) they would have firſt cauſed her to prove the ſaid VVill, (which then had clear'd the Eſtate from the claim of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and ſaved me the expences of ſome Sutes in Chancery, for no other end than to get the Will produced, which to this day, I am not able to doe; Notwithſtanding I have a Bill of Complaint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before them for that purpoſe)</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe all theſe diſcouragements, it pleaſed the Lord to give me a proportionable meaſure of Patience, to ſubmit unto his correcting hand; and in the moſt ſore Afflictions (which I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone) he hath not with-held his loving kindneſſes from me, nor the ſweetneſſes of his refreſhing Spirit; though many Oppreſſions and Grievances were daily multiplied, and many new Sutes at Law were ſet on foot againſt me by my Wifes means, who now ſeemed juſtified by them; and my ſelf vilified and undervalued.</p>
            <p>Yet was I not clamorous at their Bar, neither was I ever admitted to any private Speeches with them: or indeed did ever ſeek it (being confident) that my cauſe wanted the Protection of Juſtice only, and not favour; but waited, ſtill expecting when they would put their good Promiſe in Execution, and ſend for us, and endeavour a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reconciliation between us.</p>
            <p>But after two moneths were expired, and hearing nothing from them to that purpoſe (though many ſeveral Friends of Quality had moved them thereunto) I addreſſ'd my ſelf with an humble Petition for a hearing.</p>
            <p>After it was read, they appointed a day (though it was ſomewhat far of) yet it did abundantly revive me, hoping that that day would be the end of my trouble; and that then, my reputation and eſtate, might be repaired; my Perſon freed from the continual moleſtation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:125864:20"/>
of Catchpoles; And my Wife her ſelf (whom I had perfectly forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) reſtored unto my Boſom.</p>
            <p>The Order which the Lords made in Anſwer to my Petition, was this.</p>

            <p>Mrs. <hi>Ivie,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Thomas Ivie,</hi> ſuggeſteth by her Petition to the Lords Commiſſioners, That her Husband hath deſerted her, and left her no means to live; That during her Cohabitation with him, ſhe was in danger of her life, and became very weak, and for perill of receiving from him diſeaſes of dangerons conſeqnence, ſhe cannot Cohabite with him, and prayes Relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Queſtion is, Whether in this Caſe ſhe ought to have</hi> Alimony.</p>
            <p>In which it will be pertinent, to conſider the near conjunction that is between Man and Wife, and whether they be of equal Authority, or there be a Superior, and in whom that Superiority reſteth.</p>
            <p>1. The Original female Anceſtor was taken out of Man, and by the Marriage-bond were made one fleſh, though ſeveral Individuals, like the Celeſtial <hi>Gemini,</hi> that makes but one Conſtellation; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:125864:21"/>
was placed upon the Man by God himſelf, who gave the Law in Paradiſe, ſaying, Thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, and he ſhall rule over thee, <hi>Gen. 3. v. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 5: 34. and by the Apoſtle remembred, That Women are commanded to be under obedience; ſo ſaith the Law; and that they ſubmit themſelves unto their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as to the Lord that is ſupreme, 5 <hi>Eph. v.</hi> 22. Thus far for the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The common Law ſays, that a Woman that is married is not <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> but <hi>ſub poteſtate Viri,</hi> hath no Will but her Husbands, though ſhe may have a Stomach; therefore the Civil Acts ſhe does are void in common Law; ſhe can neither take nor give any thing without her Husbands conſent; She can have no reparation for any wrong done unto her Perſon by her ſelf, without her Husband, and the damages that ſhall be recovered, ſhall goe to the Husband and not to the Wife; And it is further to be conſidered the extenſion of that word <hi>Poteſtas;</hi> It is of a great latitude, for Soveraign Princes and Governours, though they have rule and power of the People; Yet they cannot beat, wound, or kill the People under them, nor doe any thing to their Perſons corporally; but according to their Laws, by Sentence or Judgement: But the Husband hath power of Correction upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Wife, and Servant, according to his own Judgement, ſo as he doth not wound nor kill, and is not prohibited by any Law.</p>
            <p>3. The Civill Law (as I take it) agrees with the Common Law; then it muſt follow by neceſſary conſequence, that a married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without leave cannot depart from her Husband, which ſhe muſt evidence by proof, no more than a Servant from his Maſter, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from his Soveraign into forreign parts, who by his Miſſives is to return upon forfeit of his Eſtate; which makes good what was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhe is not <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> and in ſome ſort expounds and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the <hi>poteſtatem Viri in Vxorem;</hi> for the maſter may ſeize and carry away his Servant, if he find him, or implead him that ſhall keep him, and recover damages for the time he keeps him; ſo may the Husband by his Wife; which ſhews the propriety and intereſt which the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baud hath in his Wife, and for loſſe of her ſociety and company (though no other harm be done) he ſhall recover damages againſt the detainer.</p>
            <p>Nay the Husband could not repudiate his Wife, but in caſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, for that the Bill of divorce ſpoken of in the old Law, was not given by God, but permitted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to prevent a greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; for the <hi>Jews</hi> are cruel men to their VVives, and to prevent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:125864:21"/>
               <hi>Vxoricidium,</hi> he gave way to it, <hi>Sed non fuit ſic ab initio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe thus ſtated upon the impotencies and non-ability of the will of the Wife, and the juſt Rule and Power of the Husband over her will and Perſon; tis conſiderable, whether by Law or Reaſon, a Wife departing without leave, ſhall have allowance to live ſeparate, which is called <hi>Alimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alimony</hi> is a Thing not known at the Common or Civil Law, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, and brought in by the Pope and his Canons, and very much put in Uſe by the late High Commiſſion and Prerogative Court of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wherein, upon Sentence of Separation from Bed and Board given by that Court, the Husband was enjoyned to make allowance to the VVife, and the Husband enforcd to give ſecurity for the payment, &amp; many times impriſoned upon failer of performance; yet in thoſe caſes, both of Bonds and Impriſonments, the Husband upon <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable in the uper Bench, where by Iudgment of that Court, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of both, if the Husband cohabit, becauſe the Law ſaies, <hi>Quos Deus conjunxit, nemo ſeparet.</hi> So as without the Husbands conſent no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration could be made, and if no ſeparation, no Alimony.</p>
            <p>Nor were perſonall Infirmities or diſeaſes contracted after Mariage ſufficient cauſe of ſuch ſeparation, becauſe ſhe may board though not bed with ſuch a Husband; but where the temper of the Husband was more ſevere and violent then diſcreet, That Court by the wiſdom of prevention, which is better then the wiſdom of remedies, did uſe by way of caution to take bond for the Husbands orderly uſage of his Wife, to prevent the crueltie whereof they had no Iuriſdiction, but only in cauſes and <hi>ſalute Animae,</hi> and not <hi>pro reformatione Morum,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Common Law, and where upon complaint by the Wife in that kind the Common Law will enforce the Husband to give bond to ſecure both life and member of his VVife from maim and death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And certainly</hi> Reaſon <hi>is againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Reaſon</hi> commands obedience to Superiors, generally the Apoſtle puts it further for conſcience ſake, and diſobedience is not cheriſhed by any Reaſon.</p>
            <p>2 One end of Marriage is Mutual ſocietie and comfort, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded by the Act of the VVife, which is not to be admitted upon the petulant Allegation of difference betwixt her and her Husband upon perſonall Infirmities.</p>
            <p>3 Mariage it ſelf, and all the Laws of the VVifes ſubjection and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:125864:22"/>
by ſo long time pronounced and received, by this meanes would be avoyded.</p>
            <p>4 If God himſelf was pleaſed to ſay, it was not good for a Man to be alone, then ſurely we may ſafely ſay, it is not good for a VVoman to be alone; for though they are the weaker Veſſel, and have the leſſer Reaſon, yet they have the ſtronger Paſsions, and more violent Deſires, and ſo more ſubject to Temptation and Sin.</p>
            <p>5 Laſtly, for the inevitable Danger of illegitimate Baſtards, and Clandeſtine Iſſues (where the VVife is ſeparate) who concealed til the Husbands death, are yet inheritable to his Land (though never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by him;) This Inconvenience ſadly weighed, and how Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically it may run to all Families of this Nation, is of it ſelf a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent convincing Reaſon, to bridle the raſh hot appetit of inconſiderable women, and avoid all <hi>Alimony.</hi> But on the other ſide, If any Husband ſhall be ſo unjuſt to his VVife, and unkind to his own fleſh, whom he is bound by Law to maintain, as to ſeparate from her, and will not cohabite with her, <hi>Niſi propter Adulterium,</hi> or will conſent to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, it is moſt reaſonable he ſhould allow her convenient mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; elſe he ſhould take advantage of his own wrong and humour, and VVomen ſhould be in worſe caſe and condition than Servants, who during their contract muſt have their wages, which between Husband and VVife ends not till death. And it is conceived the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which impowreth the Lords Commiſſioners of the Great Seal to allow <hi>Alimony,</hi> chiefly and naturally intends Relief, where the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doth repudiate, and not the VVife; the words being upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration aſwell of the Portion or Eſtate that hath been paid, or come to the Husband by ſuch VVife as ſhall pray Relief.</p>
            <p>And therefore in this particular Caſe, it may be very juſtly inſiſted, even from the ſence and letter of the Act; as alſo that 'twas Mrs. <hi>Ivie</hi> ſeparated her ſelf from her Husband, 'twas not her Husband left her; Nay, after ſhe was gone, he uſed all affectionated and prudential means to bring her home to Cohabit with him, neither doth he deſiſt in the proſecution of it, but hath ſeveral wayes attempted it, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this day, and doth ſtill declare and proteſt his willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, whenſoever ſhe will Return, and give ſecurity for his well Uſage of her.</p>
            <p>That ſhe wanted nothing before her departure, but was indeed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained far above her quality, is moſt cleer from the Depoſitions, and it is cleer alſo from the Depoſitions, that there was no deſerting of her by her Husband, but that her departure was abſolutely upon Advice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:125864:22"/>
and conſideration deſigned by her ſelf and her Abettots, eſpecially if your Lordſhips pleaſe to remember thoſe unhandſome correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies held by her with Gentlemen under feigned names; her frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and meeting them in ſcandalous houſes in <hi>Long-Acre</hi> and other places, at unſeaſonable times of the night, under the pretence of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from her Husbaud (being a Bed) to her Devotion; Thoſe horrrid and deteſtable plots upon <hi>Jane Gilbert,</hi> even to the loſing of her life; Her charging her Husband with foul diſeaſes, of which he was cleared upon Oath by the Preſident of the College and other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phyſicians, And alſo her Contrivancies and Sollicitations to her Brother <hi>Iohn Stepkins</hi> to murder her Husband, which appears by the Oath of the ſaid <hi>Stepkins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover ſeeing that there is a Caution in the Act, that the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the repudiated Wife ought to be proportionable to the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> ſhe brought her Husband: May it therefore pleaſe your Honours to underſtand,</p>
            <p>1. That he never received any penny portion as yet, and hath great reaſon to doubt whether ever he ſhall.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe the Eſtate of her Father is at preſent in the aforeſaid Truſtees, and not in the Defendant, nay it is ſo ſetled on them, that unleſſe I can raiſe and ſecure 4000 l. more, beſides 7000 l. already laid out, they are not oblighed, neither will they, nor can they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay it to the Defendant, as appears by the Indenture of ſettlement.</p>
            <p>3. In caſe they ſhould convay and ſetle on the Defendant the ſaid Eſtate, 'tis only for his life, and no longer; for which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, being only 240 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> He has disburſed and laid out far more money than it is worth; this appears from the Indenture (<hi>viz.</hi>) a 1000 l. to Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> in ready money, to free the Eſtate from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances three years ſince.</p>
            <p>The Intereſt whereof comes to 200 l. In Jewels, Pearls, Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeze, Bezoar, &amp;c. to the value of 1200 l. There was alſo ſpent in Law to enforce the Truſtees, who were kept back and hindred by Mr. <hi>Stepkins</hi> her father, to ſettle the Eſtate according to the Covenants, and for the fine and recovery 200 l. more at leaſt, which makes 2600 l.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding all the aforeſaid ſums of money have been laid out by the Defendant, the <hi>Truſtees</hi> do ſtill refuſe to convey the Eſtate to the Defendant, and the Plaintiffs brother (as Heir at Law) hath ſince the death of his Father got the poſſeſſion of the Eſtate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Rents, Iſſues and profits thereof: Inſomuch that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:125864:23"/>
hath been neceſſitated to expend great ſums of money to maintain ſeveral Sutes at Law, both againſt the Truſtees and Heir at Law, in preſervation of his Eſtate for life, which he has ſo dearly bought as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>That by the Plaintiffs means there has been conſumed and waſted of his Eſtate 4000 l. (<hi>viz</hi>) 3000 l. ſince marriage ſpent on her, 500 l. given in money, 100 l. given to Gentlemen of her familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to perſwade her to goe into the Country, 300 l. taken in Silks and Plate from the Defendant, whilſt that he was at the Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen: He has alſo contracted ſeveral great debts to the value of 3000 l. beſides 1000 l. ſpent in this unhappy Sute, and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarily (in caſe 3000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> be taken from him) be caſt into priſon the moſt part of his life (he having but 632 l. <hi>per annum</hi> of his own Eſtate) and that for his life only, both to pay all his debts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and to live on beſide.</p>
            <p>Excepting the 240 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which if it be recovered from the Heir of <hi>Stepkins,</hi> and recovered by the Truſtees, all which will yield but a ſcant and bare maintenance for himſelf, Wife and Family, to raiſe out of it 3000 l. for the Creditors, and 4000 l. more according to the Indenture of ſettlement, unleſſe the Defendant be acquitted and diſcharged of the ſaid 4000 l. by the laſt Will and Teſtament of the Plaintiffs Father, in whom the remainder of the Eſtate was, in caſe the Defendant ſhould have no Iſſue, or not perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants which he ſtands obliged to perform in the ſaid Deed: And though the Defendant is credibly informed, that the ſaid remainder is diſpoſed of to the ſaid Plaintiff, and the Defendant is alſo acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all performance of any Covenants expreſſed in the ſaid Deed of Settlement; Yet ſo it is, that the Plaintiff having got poſſeſſion of the ſaid Will, and by combination with Sir John <hi>Brampſton</hi> Knight, &amp;c. his Son, the ſole Executor of it, ſtill keeps and detaines the ſaid VVill from being legally proved: Inſomuch that the Defendant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any benefit of the ſaid Eſtare, nor by Law enforce the Plaintiff to produce the VVill (ſhe being his VVife.) That this is not a bare ſuggeſtion, I doubt not but is very evident to your Lordſhips, ſhe and her Sollicitor <hi>Zanchey</hi> having often avouch'd in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips preſence, that both there is ſuch a Will, and that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips have ſeen it: This is alſo very well known unto her Counſel Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who cauſed to be delivered unto Sir <hi>W. Row</hi> a true Copy of the ſaid VVill taken from the Original, which was long in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. But ſuch is the Plaintiffs malice to the Defendants Perſon and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:125864:23"/>
Eſtate, that ſhe ſtill ſuppreſſes and hinders the proving of it, which is the ſole cauſe of the continuance of many great Sutes and vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to the Defendant, both with the Heirs at Law, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the ſaid Will, and Truſtees of the ſaid Eſtate; That both the Defendant and Plaintiff muſt neceſſarily be defeated of all hopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoying the Fathers Eſtate for the future, unleſſe the 4000 l. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid be raiſed and diſpoſed of, according as is limited and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Deed of Settlement, or the ſaid VVill proved, for in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault thereof, the Truſtees are obliged by the ſaid Indenture to ſettle the ſaid Eſtate on the Plaintiffs Father, and his Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>And the Eſtate is not as yet recovered by the Defendant, but is ſtill inveſted in the Truſtees, (who are no parties to theſe proceedings) and in the poſſeſſion of the Heir at Law; Inſomuch that no <hi>Alimony,</hi> as the Defendant is adviſed by his Counſel, can be ordered from hence, becauſe the Ordinance of Parliament impowreth the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to allow the maintenence out of the Husbands Eſtate, not out of any others whatſoever. And the Plaintiff hath or ought to have in her cuſtody 1200 l. worth of Jewels, which were delivered her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Indenture of Settlement at the Inter-marriage: And in caſe the Defendant ſurvive her, ought to be reſtored to the Deſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, who hath too great reaſon to ſuſpect that they are waſted and embezelled; and therefore the Defendant humbly beſeecheth your Lordſhips, that inſtead of giving her <hi>Alimony,</hi> you will be pleaſed to enforce her to give good ſecurity unto the Defendant, or bring the Jewels into Court, that ſo he may not be cheated of 1200 l. by the Plaintiff and her Abettors; and unleſſe your Honours yield to ſecure the ſaid jewels whilſt this cauſe depends before you, he doth not conceive where or how he can be redreſſed from any Court of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That about the beginning of theſe unhappy differences, it was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both by the Plaintiff and her Father, that in caſe ſhe mighthave her liberty to live where ſhe would, that ſhe would accept of 120 l. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> for her maintenance, and look on it as a very good proviſion, which accordingly was agreed upon, and drawn into writing, and engroſſed, by and with the conſent of Sir <hi>John Brampſtone</hi> her Uncle, and <hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> Eſquire, two of her Truſtees; her Father alſo promiſing that his Eſtate ſhould be ſetled according to the Covenants on the Defendant, without further Sute of Law; but the ſaid Defendant was unwilling to ſeal it, being very tender to Act any thing that might ſeparate him from the continual enjoyment and ſociety of his VVife;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:125864:24"/>
ſo that 300 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> is more than her ſelf, Father, Truſtees and friends did think fitting by 180 l. <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Petition it ſelf is both falſe and ſcandalous, and hath been diſproved by ſeveral Witneſſes; nay the contrary alſo proved by Perſons of Quality, that ſhe lived very plentifully in great abundance, rather beyond, than under her Quality in every reſpect, as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hopeth is moſt viſible to your Honours.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding ſuch vaſt ſums have been expended on her by her means, and that the ſaid Defendant is to pay to Creditors 3000 l. and to raiſe 4000 l. more to be ſecured unto the Truſtees as aforeſaid; And that in caſe he recover the Plaintiffs Fathers Eſtate, 'twill not with his own, make above 872 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> out of which all theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys muſt be raiſed; and in caſe 300 l. <hi>per annum</hi> of this ſhall be taken away out of the Plaintiffs Fathers Eſtate, which he has dearly bought, and purchaſed; That 'twill be impoſſible for the Defendant to avoid perpetual Impriſonment, but muſt be kept in Gaole, and the Creditors defrauded, and muſt there periſh, and himſelf be cheated alſo of 1200 l. worth of Jewels; yet he is moſt willing to receive her, and take her again, and forget all former Paſſages whatſoever, that ſo they may for the future lead a peaceable and godly Life together.</p>
            <p>Counſel alſo I did retain, very many, and great ones; That in Caſe the Lords ſhould refuſe the Papers, and would not hear the Merits of the Cauſe in Publique, (in regard I might not be wanting, to loſe the opportunity of that Time which they had ordered for me) I drew up alſo to be tendred at the ſame time (that (if it had been poſſible) I might have prevented both Reading and Arguing too) this ſhort Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition following.</p>

            <p>When the Day came, and the Counſel began to ſpeak, my hopes were quickly commanded to vaniſh, and the Counſel to hold their Peace; for they ſuddenly declared, That they would not hear the Merits of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>With much preſſing, Mr. <hi>Liſle</hi> read the Petition; And though they took evident notice of it, yet would they not return any Anſwer to it; or ſo much as demand of my Wife, (who ſtood there laughing in their Preſence) whether ſhe would return to me, or no; Only they were pleaſed to find fault with that word [<hi>Separation;</hi>] And told my Counſel, That they neither had, or could ſeparate our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:125864:25"/>Theſe words they had no ſooner ſpoke, but (I confeſs) I laid hold on; though I had been moſt hardly and ſeverely dealt withall, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that were preſent.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch, That now I did deſpair, ever to find amongſt them, and indeed, did determine to commit my Cauſe unto God, untill (in his due time) he ſhould raiſe up Judges in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ſhould execute Righteons Judgement, even upon thoſe Judges themſelves.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, I was adviſed (which was very agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my own Diſpoſition, not to leave any thing unattempted, which might be thought advantagious to a Union of Us,) but to go perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to my Wife, and perſwade her my ſelf, to leave thoſe Perſons who aymed at both our Ruines, And to return to me, (paſſionately willing to receive her.</p>
            <p>And if ſhe ſhould, (notwithſtanding) refuſe to ſpeak, or go with me, then to demand her of thoſe Perſons who received her into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Accordinly, (taking two civil Gentlemen) I went to her Lodging, but received a Repulſe from her, inſtead of Complyance; and then, ſeeing Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi> (who kept the houſe) I required from him the perſon of my Wife, who refuſing her, was ſued by me.</p>
            <p>And upon the Tryal before my Lord Cheif Juſtice <hi>Roles</hi> (a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Perſon) had a Verdict, Judgement and Execution of 100 l. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid <hi>Williamſon,</hi> for detaining my Wife from me.</p>
            <p>Many Counſels there were to argue the Caſe; and the Decree itſelf (under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi>) was opened, read, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jury: But my Lord <hi>Roles</hi> quickly ſtated the reſolution of the Caſe in my behalf, and the Jury gave me 100 l. damages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Williamſon</hi> (now finding himſelf in a great <hi>Dilemma</hi>) either to deliver up my Wife, or himſelf, to ruine; and my Wife in ſo bad a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (notwithſtanding her glorious Decree) that although ſhe had 300 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> yet if ſhe could not take the liberty of her old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, or any new one (whereſoever ſhe ſhould be entertained) for fear of Judgement and Executions; began to take new Counſel, how to free Mr. <hi>Williamſon</hi> and her ſelf from this bondage of living under the Roof of a Husbands Houſe; and the truth is, ſollicited it to the purpoſe (amongſt her old <hi>Patrons</hi>) the Lords Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>For with all ſpeed, <hi>Williamſon</hi> prefers a Bill in Chancery to be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt my Execution. And after he had preferted his Bill (though my Anſwer was ſo clear, as it could not admit of one exception) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for an <hi>Injunction</hi> (after Judgement and Execution granted at

                        <p>THat Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> about <hi>October</hi> 1649. took to Wife <hi>Theodoſia Garret</hi> Widdow, Daughter of <hi>Iohn Stepkins</hi> 
                           <abbr>Eſq</abbr> on whom, by reaſon of the great affection, which he bore unto her, he ſetled 1000l. <hi>per an. oyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and gave alſo ſecurity to leave her 1000 l. in ready money at the time of his death, and this without any conſideration of a Portion from her Father, or any Eſtate left her by her former Husband, who not only left her without a Joynture, but in debt alſo.</p>
                        <p>That the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> perceiving how really Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> ſtood affected to his ſaid Danghter, and with what cheerfulneſs and willingneſs he was reſolved to ſettle all his Eſtate for the good and preferment of his ſaid Daughter; was content, that if Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> would free his the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> Eſtate, which was 240 l. <hi>per annum</hi> then encumbred with ſeveral debts, or pay a 1000 l. towards the ſame, and deliver into the hands of the ſaid Daughter 1200 l. in Jewels that then it ſhould be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> for his life, and afterwards to the uſe of his Daughter for her life; And in caſe, he had no Iſſue by her, then to the Heirs general of the ſaid <hi>Stepkins,</hi> or ſuch as the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> ſhould limit &amp; appoint.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> did deliver unto the ſaid <hi>Theodoſia</hi> rich Jewels to the value of 1200 l. in ready money to the ſaid <hi>Stepkins</hi> to free his Eſtate accordingly.</p>
                        <p>That Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> then expected a reciprocal return of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he had ſo cordially demonſtrated: But when the ſaid 1000 l. was paid, and a firm and legal ſettlement of the Joynture made, and the Jewels delivered to his ſaid Wife, He found great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to uſpect, that 'twas rather his Fortune than himſelf, which ſhe had wedded: For ſhe not only ſought all means to avoid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Notwithſtanding, ſeeing it was the pleaſure of the Lord to unite them in ſo near a union; Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> was reſolved not to leave any fair and honeſt motives (either of Purle or Perſwaſion) unattempted, which might encline her affection towards him; and in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (there was nothing which ſhe ever propoſed, which might be for her content) that he did deny unto her: And in leſſe than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Moneths, ſhe expended in apparel, 600 l. in ready money 500l.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:125864:27"/>
and for other Accommodations about 2800 l. beſides the 1200 l. in Jewels, and 1000 l. in mone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aforeſaid; which amounts to 6100 l. Nay, the Gifts were ſo great he beſtowed on her, That he ſuppoſeth, ſhe was even aſhamed to requeſt any more from him.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheles ſhe, by the evil counſel of her Confederates (while he was at the Court of Aldermen) did convey out of his houſe Plate, and rich Eaſt-India ſtuffs, to the value of 300 l. and divers other goods, which were by her and her Confederates carried away and imbezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                        <p>That Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> now finding his own Eſtate, as well as his Wifes Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, too too viſibly declining; and that nothing could attend ſuch an unhappy condition, but Ruine and Diſhonour, to prevent both, perſwaded his ſaid Wife to retire with him for a while to his Eſtate in the Country; thinking thereby to take her off from the Temptations of thoſe ſeducing Perſons, who engaged her in ſuch pernicious cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                        <p>But inſtead of a complyance, he found a greater Obſtinacy than ever; neither could her own friends, (who then perſwaded her to leave the City for a while) prevail with her. And that there might be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry wanting to perſwade her, he gave 100 l. to two Perſons of her familiar Acquaintance, to be urgent and ſollicitous to endeavour the Accompliſhment of his deſire.</p>
                        <p>But by the Practiſes of the ſaid Confederates, ſhe was ſeduced to the preferring of a vile, ſcandalous, and falſe Petition to the Lords Commiſſioners againſt Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> for obtaining <hi>Alimony;</hi> but not one ſyllable of her ſuggeſtions proved againſt him: Nay, the contrary proved by Mr. <hi>Ivie,</hi> by the ſeverall Teſtimonies of many Perſons of good Quality and Reputation, as appears by the Depoſitions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, beſides his own Oath which he made in anſwer to the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous aſperſions caſt upon him.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding this Vindication, after two years dependance in the Chancery, and the Expences of almoſt 3000 l. in this unnatural, and twelve other Sutes at Law, (which were commenc'd againſt him, by the means of this Sute) ſhe obtained from the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners an Order in private for 300 l. <hi>per ann. Alimony.</hi>
                        </p>

Cauſe; which (in reſpect of the proceedings) was contrary to the Rules of the Court; and in reſpect of the Allowance (in caſe Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> had been guilty of the Complaint) contrary to the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Having thus Affliction added to Affliction, and being in Debt by the means of his ſaid Wife above 3000 l. And having not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to ſell to pay his Creditors, (And in regard the Reverſion of his Eſtate is ſetled on his ſaid Wife) he attended almoſt a year up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords Commiſſioners for his Relief, that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but to grant him a fair hearing upon the Merits of the Cauſe, in preſence of both parties, with their Counſel; which was by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der accordingly granted, and a Day by them appointed.</p>
                        <p>But when the Day came, and Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> had retained to his great charge, many great Counſel, the Lords Commiſsioners abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hear the ſaid Cauſe; which hath expoſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> and his Wife to all manner of Temptations, and their Perſons and Eſtates to utter Ruine.</p>
                        <p>And although at the ſame time Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> did Requeſt the ſaid Lords Commiſsioners to recommend any godly Miniſter, whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould chuſe to live in houſe with him and his Wife (as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to a Peace and Reconciliation between them) for which he obliged himſelf to allow any ſuch Miniſter 50 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> beſides all other fitting Accommodations whatſoever; yet was this Propoſall flighted by them, and laugh'd at by his ſaid Wife, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Lordſhips.</p>
                        <p>And ſince that time Mr. <hi>Ivie</hi> having ſued thoſe (who received her, and denyed her unto him) and obtained by juſt proceedings in Law, a Judgement and Execution againſt ſuch Perſons, The Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners have notwithſtanding granted their <hi>Injunction</hi> for their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Inſomuch, that they have now effected an abſolute Separation; which is contrary to the Law of the Nation, and the Act of Parliament for <hi>Alimony</hi> it ſelf; which was declared by my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Roles</hi> upon Reading the Decree for <hi>Alimony.</hi>
