            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NEW POEMS Upon the DEATH of that Eminent Servant of God, and truly Pious and Learned Miniſter of the Goſpel Mr. Stephen Charnock; Who Departed this Life, <date>
                  <hi>July</hi> 27. 1680.</date>
            </head>
            <byline>By a Lover of all thoſe who are Lovers of the TRUTH.</byline>
            <l>SUrpriz'd was I as others, 'tis no doubt,</l>
            <l>That ſuch a Light as <hi>Charnock</hi> was blown out:</l>
            <l>Oh ſurely now great darkneſs doth draw on,</l>
            <l>When God ſuch ſhining Stars, as he, calls home:</l>
            <l>What, and in ſilence doth he now remain!</l>
            <l>Is <hi>Charnock</hi> dead! he'l never preach again,</l>
            <l>And is he ſnatcht away in's middle Age?</l>
            <l>We've cauſe to fear Gods judgments do preſage.</l>
            <l>It is a loſs, for which my heart doth ake,</l>
            <l>That bleſſed <hi>Charnock's</hi> gone; oh for his ſake</l>
            <l>Methinks I could have render'd up my breath,</l>
            <l>To have freed him from grim conquering Death:</l>
            <l>But God is the great Sovereign over all</l>
            <l>Who gives being to Creatures great and ſmall;</l>
            <l>And when he pleaſeth he takes it away,</l>
            <l>When 'tis God's time to call, there's none can ſtay.</l>
            <l>Therefore let all that in his Vineyard grow,</l>
            <l>Be rowſed up doth God go on to mow;</l>
            <l>Such uſeful plants, whoſe fruits we plainly ſee?</l>
            <l>What then can thoſe expect that with'ring be,</l>
            <l>But that his Sithe will alſo cut them down,</l>
            <l>And's wrath to feel, when ſuch ſhall wear the Crown?</l>
            <l>Stay a while my Pen, this is not thy Theam;</l>
            <l>If others ſlumber ſtill as in a dream,</l>
            <l>I deſire to take warning, and commend,</l>
            <l>Something of the worth of my deceaſed friend;</l>
            <l>Great God inſtruct me, and lend me thy light,</l>
            <l>That of thy ſervant ſomething I may write</l>
            <l>Not for vain glory, nor for flattery,</l>
            <l>Nor yet for to promote Idolatry;</l>
            <l>In ſpeaking any thing of the worth of man,</l>
            <l>And not to God give glory whence it came.</l>
            <l>His Birth and his Beginning ſcarcely known,</l>
            <l>And ſince his life much retir'd and alone,</l>
            <l>But yet his education was very good;</l>
            <l>Brought up at Cambridge, where he underſtood</l>
            <l>A Learned Scholar quickly for to be,</l>
            <l>Whoſe chief delight was in Divinity,</l>
            <l>Full of wiſdom, although he was but young;</l>
            <l>To all he gave the right, to none he offer'd wrong.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Ireland</hi> then his voyage he did take,</l>
            <l>Where God in mercy did not him forſake.</l>
            <l>For there he did to him much favour give,</l>
            <l>So that in ſplendor great he there did live;</l>
            <l>Yet ſtill he was both humble chaſte and meek,</l>
            <l>The poor did not deſpiſe, nor rich their favour ſeek.</l>
            <l>But God, who in his wiſdom beſt doth know</l>
            <l>What ſoil is beſt in which his Saints may grow,</l>
            <l>Did then reduce him not for any crimes,</l>
            <l>But by an alteration of the times.</l>
            <l>And after he wander'd from place to place,</l>
            <l>Though all was gone, ſtill he retain'd his grace.</l>
            <l>And laſt of all to <hi>London</hi> then he came,</l>
            <l>Whoſe real worth did quickly ſpread his fame.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Fowler's</hi> place God call'd him to ſucceed,</l>
            <l>Where to reveal his mind he did proceed.</l>
            <l>Much he had receiv'd, and ſo he did impart:</l>
            <l>He pray'd and ſtudied for to raiſe the heart,</l>
            <l>For to admire Gods goodneſs, grace and truth,</l>
            <l>In which he labour'd even from his youth.</l>
            <l>Upon his heart ſtill he kept a great ſenſe,</l>
            <l>Of the firſt tranſgreſſion and offence,</l>
            <l>By which we was exempted from all good,</l>
            <l>Had not our Lord Redeem'd us by his blood.</l>
            <l>And this he did in all his prayers proclaim,</l>
            <l>That we might be humbled for the ſame.</l>
            <l>Thus low the building being ſurely laid,</l>
            <l>God's grace and mercy was the more diſplay'd;</l>
            <l>To ſinful man, who had himſelf deſtroy'd,</l>
            <l>But that infinite wiſdom did provide,</l>
            <l>And lay help on one, mighty for to ſave,</l>
            <l>All ſuch that did in faith and love him crave:</l>
            <l>And caution us in walking to take heed,</l>
            <l>Becauſe from ſuch a ſpring we did proceed.</l>
            <l>His prayer was ſweet judgment clear, doctrine ſound,</l>
            <l>All his words ſavoury and yet profound.</l>
            <l>God's great Attributes, which ſo perfect are,</l>
            <l>For to make known his daily practice were;</l>
            <l>His Juſtice Truth and his purity.</l>
            <l>He'l not diminiſh, yea, his Majeſty,</l>
            <l>Doth loath and hate whatever is impure;</l>
            <l>All ſuch as are defil'd they muſt indure,</l>
            <l>His eternal wrath, nay, although his Son,</l>
            <l>He muſt ſuffer which never guile had done;</l>
            <l>That we might tremble, ſtand in aw, and fear,</l>
            <l>He fully prov'd God's preſence every where;</l>
            <l>Which as it was a help againſt temptation,</l>
            <l>So to the Saints it was a conſolation.</l>
            <l>Of th' greatneſs of his power he alſo ſpake;</l>
            <l>By which both Heaven and Earth he did make;</l>
            <l>Who governs there, and all things on the Earth,</l>
            <l>His power no bounds nor limitation hath;</l>
            <l>That ſo we his patience might proclaim,</l>
            <l>Who have ſo often ſpurn'd againſt the ſame:</l>
            <l>That this in God a great perfection were;</l>
            <l>From ſenſe whereof we ſhould his goodneſs fear.</l>
            <l>To anger he was ſlow for our ſins paſt.</l>
            <l>Upon which ſubject <hi>Charnock</hi> preacht the laſt,</l>
            <l>And if you pleaſe your mem'ry to revive,</l>
            <l>He ſhew'd from hence it was we did ſurvive;</l>
            <l>That his forbearance in his day of grace,</l>
            <l>Would make his wrath more fierce when't taketh place,</l>
            <l>Unleſs to Chriſt God's goodneſs did us lead,</l>
            <l>By faith and love that he our cauſe might plead.</l>
            <l>His chief deſign was to exalt Gods name,</l>
            <l>And melt our hearts that have abus'd the ſame.</l>
            <l>From hence he told us alſo we might learn,</l>
            <l>Patiently for to bear, when we did diſcern</l>
            <l>Offences given, and in our hearts to love</l>
            <l>Our Enemies, and imitate God above.</l>
            <l>Remembring our bleſſed Saviour's prayer,</l>
            <l>We muſt forgive, if we forgiven are.</l>
            <l>Thus, as far as my knowledge did extend,</l>
            <l>I have made known of my deſeaced friend</l>
            <l>To you his hearers; is your candle ſpent?</l>
            <l>Hath God two ſuch eminent ſervants lent?</l>
            <l>And in ſo ſmall a ſpace call'd both away?</l>
            <l>See how you have improv'd, and do not ſtray;</l>
            <l>Though he is gone that did your hearts perfume</l>
            <l>With ſuch ſweet doctrine, yet do not preſume</l>
            <l>To queſtion God, who well can qualify</l>
            <l>A ſecond <hi>Charnock,</hi> his place to ſupply.</l>
            <l>To all good Chriſtians, this I would adviſe,</l>
            <l>To ſtand in the gap, now you would ariſe,</l>
            <l>And break off ſin, leſt God doth ſtill increaſe</l>
            <l>To call home his Embaſſadors of Peace.</l>
            <l>Sure, when ſuch a <hi>Moſes</hi> doth fall aſleep,</l>
            <l>It's high time then for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to weep;</l>
            <l>And to leave off their ſinful frothy mirth,</l>
            <l>When good men ſo faſt periſh from the earth.</l>
