            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thirdly, the change and alteration of religion.

Thirdly, it is the Princes duty to prouide for the ſafety of the bodies, much more for the ſafety of the ſoules of his Subiects.

                     <p>But peraduenture ſome Papiſt may reply and ſay, that I doe not reckon aright, in making <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth, the firſt Pope that depoſed an Emperor, which yet is affirmed by their owne writers: for <hi>Leo</hi> the third Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was excommunicated by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all his Temporalities hee held in Italy; and the Greeke Emperors were remoued from the Empire by <hi>Leo</hi> the third, Biſhop of Rome, and ſo of ſome others. Which obiection is ſo frequently anſwered by our Diuines, who haue written about this point of the Popes power in this kinde, that for breuity I will paſſe it ouer in a worde, That <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſecond did not depriue <hi>Leo</hi> the third Emperor of his temporalities, but onely was an agent, or as the head of rebellion in the reuolt of the Italians from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, not by his vniuerſall authority now claimed, but by a popular ſedition then raiſed. And to the ſecond, That the Greeke Empire was tranſlated by <note n="*" place="margin">Or as ſome write, by <hi>Gregory</hi> the fift.</note> 
                        <hi>Leo</hi> the third to the Germanes, is much doubted: for <note n="m" place="margin">

                     <p>The Popes of Rome haue a long time laboured to riſe to this primacy of pride by degrees: firſt aboue Biſhops, as in <hi>Boniface</hi> the third: after aboue Kings and Emperors, ſpecially in <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeauenth and his ſucceſſors: yet thoſe aſpiring wings clipt by Councels, Wormes, Papia, Brixis, Mentz; till at laſt, two of the worſt Councels, the Laterane and Tridentine, did lift vp the Pope to the top of the pinnacle, not onely aboue Kings and Councels, but aboue Gods counſels the ſacred Scriptures:

Wherein obſerue how politicke theſe papall Paraſites be, diſputing about a power of Popes, in diſpoſing Temporals or Regals, one fort deriuing this power directly, and ordinarily from Chriſt, and Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> the other ſide indirectly, and onely in order to the Spirituals, when as their Pope neuer had any direct, or indirect power in that kind from God, and from Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>

                     <p>To leaue this point, as the Poet left Rome, with this verſe:
<q>

                     <p>The third marke may be this, That there is no point of our faith, but many learned in the Church of Rome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue <note place="margin">3 Marke.</note> the ſame; and no point of Papiſtry by vs confuted, but ſome of the chiefe of their Church haue diſliked, as well as we; that we may ſay to them as our Sauiour did to that bad ſeruant, <note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 19. 22.

                        <hi>Ex ore tuo te iudico,</hi> of thine owne mouth will I condemne thee. Thus the diuiſion of the tongues and people of Babilon are a meanes of the plantation and edification of Gods Ieruſalem. This point hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the chiefe queſtions betwixt them and vs, by many learned Diuines of our Church, and excellently verified and declared by Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> a ſingular orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Church, in many of his workes, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his firſt and ſecond part of his Catholicke Apology, wherein he hath ouerthrown the points of Popery of the chiefeſt difference by the affirmations and aſſertions of the beſt learned Papiſts, to whoſe labour in this point I refer the iudicious Reader.</p>
                     <p>The fourth marke is this: That many maine points in <note place="margin">4 Marke.</note> popery are abſurd, and euen againſt common ſenſe, and the light of nature.</p>

                     <p>And firſt you are not ignorant, that very lately, Anno 1606.
