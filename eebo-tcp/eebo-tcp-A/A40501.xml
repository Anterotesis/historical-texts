            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Preſented to both Houſes of</hi> Parliament, <hi>by Colonell Sir</hi> Hardreſſe Waller, 24. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1647.</p>
            <p>UPon the late Reſolutions in Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the taking away of Free-Quarter, and disbanding ſupernumeraries, we find divers things which require a further conſideration, in order to the more ſecure and effectuall diſpatch of that worke, wherein we ſhall ſhortly offer our humble Adviſe and deſires.</p>
            <p>But at preſent we find an immediate neceſſity, to take notice of what hath paſt on Tueſday laſt the 21. inſtant, in an Ordinance prepared for the bringing in of ſix moneths Arreares of Aſſeſſement by the 15. of January next; and for the taking away of Free Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereupon: wherein we obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is provided and ordained, <hi>That no Officer or Souldier, ſhall enter into the Houſe of any perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſhall duly pay their Aſſeſſement, without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, except Innes, Tavernes, Victualling-Houſes or Ale-Houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor ſhall take away Victualls, or other proviſions for</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:37033:3"/>
               <hi>Horſe or Man, without conſent of the owner, and due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given to him for the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, wee muſt deſire the Houſes to conſider, That if the Souldiery muſt not have ſo much as Lodging or Stable room, but at Innes and Ale-Houſes without the owners conſent: it will follow,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is like to fall out oft-times, and in many Townes, that there will be more Men or Horſe to Quarter, then the Innes, or Ale-Houſes have roome for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Souldiers muſt either pay for their victuall and horſe meat at ſuch rates as the Innes where they quarter will reckon, as to other gueſts, or elſe give large ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Inne-keeper for their lodging and ſtable roome, ſo as they may have liberty to take their victuall and horſemeat at other places where they can agree for it cheaper; otherwiſe an Inne-keeper where the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or ſtable-roome is taken up by Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, will loſe the whole benefit of his Inne, which is his livelihood: And if the ſouldier either muſt pay the Inne-keeper at the rates of other gueſts, or ſatisfie him for his lodging and ſtable-roome at ſuch rates as to countervaile his ordinarie gaine,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37033:4"/>
It is moſt evident, that the Souldiers whole pay, nor ſcarce the double of it, would not ſatisfie at ſuch rates, and unleſſe either the pay, or way of Quarter bee ſuch, as that the Souldier may above the charge of his victuall or Horſe-meat, ſave ſomething for other uſes, wee believe few Souldiers will bee found to ſerve, that intend to be honeſt.</p>
            <p>And we feare the Souldiery that ſhall conſider the conſequences of theſe limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Quarter, may be too apt to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand it, as if thoſe that ſhall not have the benefit of disbanding now as Supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries, ſhould be left to be worſe then disbanded, even to be neceſsitated to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſſolution, without any benefit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions at all.</p>
            <p>For our parts, if it be found that the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quiet of the Kingdome will admit it, we ſhall be as readie to disband all as any: but whileſt the Parliament finds cauſe to continue any Forces in the Kingdome, wee muſt earneſtly deſire, they may have that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37033:4"/>
of neceſſarie billet which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Nations where any Souldiers are kept, and particularly, that they may ſtill be allowed lodging and ſtable-roome at ſuch houſes where they ſhall by order be duly and equally billetted.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond particular in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance aforementioned, we are well ſatisfied and preſume all Souldiers will be content (when they ſhall be duly ſupplied with pay in hand wherewithall) to pay for their victualls and horſe-meat at ſuch rates as they can agree upon: only we muſt deſire, theſe caſes may be provided for;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That for the firſt fortnight after the Souldiery ſhall bee drawne into Townes and Garriſons, and untill the Parliament ſhall there ſupply them with pay, (as in our late Propoſitions to the Commiſsioners) they may have horſe meat and mans meat at the places where they ſhall be billetted, at the rates allowed for the Army, which the Officers are to undertake to ſee paid.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37033:5"/>
2. That upon all occaſions of Marching where any Souldiers ſhall by Order be billeted (not lying above two nights at a place) they may have their dyet at the ſame rates, and Horſe meat alſo, if the Land-Lord have it of his owne.</p>
