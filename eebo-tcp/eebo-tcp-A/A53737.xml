            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough our Lord Jesus Christ
hath laid blessed and stable
foundations of <hi>Unity, Peace</hi> and
<hi>Agreement</hi> in judgement and
affection amongst all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and given forth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for their attendance unto them, that
thereby they might glorifie him in the world,
and promote their own spiritual advantage:
yet also foreknowing what effect the crafts of
Satan in conjunction with the darkness and
lusts of men would produce; that no <hi>offence</hi>
might thence be taken against him, or any of
his wayes, he hath sorewarned all men by
his Spirit what <hi>Differences, Divisions, Schisms</hi>
and <hi>Heresies</hi> would ensue on the publication of


<pb facs="tcp:50044:4"/>
the Gospel; and arise even among them that
should profess subjection unto his Authority
and Law. And accordingly it speedily came
to pass; For what <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
concerning the <hi>first Creation,</hi> namely
that <hi>God made man upright, but he sought out
many inventions,</hi> or immixed himself in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
questions; the same fell out in the <hi>new
creation</hi> or erection of the Church of Christ.
The state of it was by him formed <hi>upright,</hi>
and all that belonged unto it, were of <hi>one
heart,</hi> and <hi>one soul.</hi> But this harmony and
perfection of beauty, in answer to his Will
and Institution lasted not long among them;
many who <hi>mixed</hi> themselves with those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
converts, or <hi>succeeded</hi> them in their
profession quickly <hi>seeking out perverse inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Hence in the dayes of the Apostles
themselves there were not only <hi>schisms and
divisions</hi> made in sundry Churches of their
own planting, with disputes about Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and needless impositions by <hi>those of the
Circumcision</hi> who believed; but also opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was made unto the very <hi>fundamental</hi>
Doctrines of the Deity and Incarnation of
the Son of God, by the <hi>Spirit of Antichrist</hi>
then entring into the world, as is evident
from their Writings and <hi>Epistles.</hi> But yet
as all this while our Lord Jesus Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his promise preserved the root of


<pb facs="tcp:50044:4"/>
               <hi>Love and Vnity</hi> amongst them who sincerely
believed in him entire (as he doth still, and
will do to the end) by giving the <hi>one and
selfsame spirit</hi> to guide, sanctifie and unite
them all unto himself; so the care and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of the Apostles during their abode in
the flesh, so far prevailed, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some <hi>temporary impeachments</hi> of Love
and Union in or amongst the Churches; yet
no signal prejudice of any long continuance
befell them. For either the miscarriages
which they fell into, were quickly retrieved
by them, the truth infallibly cleared, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
made for <hi>Peace, Vnity and Moderation</hi>
in and about things of less concernment; or
else the evil, guilt and danger of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
only with and upon some <hi>particular
persons,</hi> the notoriety of whose wickedness
and folly cast them out by common consent
from the communion of all the Disciples of
Christ. But no sooner was that <hi>sacred Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
successors, as <hi>Egesippus</hi> speaks in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
departed unto their rest with God, but that
the Church it self, which untill then was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
a pure and <hi>incorruppted Virgin,</hi> began
to be vexed with abiding contention, and
otherwise to degenerate from its primitive
<hi>original</hi> purity. From thence forward, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
after the heat of bloody and fiery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions


<pb facs="tcp:50044:5"/>
began to abate, far the greatest
part of <hi>Ecclesiastical Records</hi> consists in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Divisions, Differences, Schisms and
Heresies</hi> that fell out amongst them who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
themselves the Disciples of Christ.
For those failings errors and mistakes which
were found in men of peaceable minds, the
Church indeed of those dayes extended her
<hi>Peace and Vnity,</hi> if <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> and others
may be believed, to such as the <hi>seeming</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>zeal,</hi> and really colder <hi>charity</hi> of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages could not bear withal. But yet
divisions and disputes were multiplyed into
such an excess, as that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> fetcht ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from them not only to reproach all
Christians withall, but to deterr others from
the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ession of Christianity. So <hi>Celsus</hi> in
his third Book deals with them; for saith he,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>At first when they were but a few,
they were of one mind, or agreed well enough:
But being increased, and the multitude of them
scattered abroad, they were presently divided
again and again; and every one would have his
own party or division, and as in a divided
multitude opposed and reproved one another; so


<pb facs="tcp:50044:5"/>
that they had no communion among themselves,
but only in name, which for shame they retain.</hi>
So doth he for his purpose, as is the manner
of men, <hi>invidiously</hi> exaggerate the differences
that were in those early times amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
for he wrote about the dayes of
<hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour: That others of them
took the same course, is testified by <hi>Clemens,
Stromat. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Augustin. lib. de Ovib. c.</hi> 15.
and sundry others of the antient Writers of
the Church. But that no just offence as
to the truth, or any of the wayes of Christ
might hence be taken, we are as I said before,
<hi>forewarned</hi> of all these things by the Lord
himself, and his Apostles; as also of the use
and necessity of such events and issues:
Whence <hi>Origen</hi> cryes out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Most admirable unto me seems
the saying of Paul,</hi> There must be Heresies
amongst you, that those who are approved
may be manifest. Nor can any just <hi>exccepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
be hence taken against the Gospel it self.
For it doth not belong unto the excellency
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ignity of any thing to <hi>free it self</hi> from
all opposition, but only to preserve it self
from being prevailed against, and to remain
victorious, as the sacred truths of Christ have
done, and will do unto the end. Not a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in these evil dayes wherein we live, the
<hi>ends of the world,</hi> and the difficulties with


<pb facs="tcp:50044:6"/>
which they are attended being come upon us,
persons ignorant of <hi>things past,</hi> and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of <hi>things to come,</hi> in bondage to their
<hi>present lusts</hi> and pleasures, are ready to make
use of the pretence of <hi>divisions and differences</hi>
among Christians, to give up themselves unto
Atheism, and indulge to their pleasures like
the beasts that perish <hi>Let us eat and drink for
too morrow we shall dye: Quid aliud inscribi
poterat sepulchro bovis!</hi> But whatever they
pretend to the contrary, it may be easily
evinced, that it is their <hi>personal dislike</hi> of
that holy obedience which the Gospel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
not the differences that are about the
Doctrines of it, which <hi>alienates</hi> their minds
from the truth. They will not some of them
foregoe all <hi>Philosophical</hi> inquiries after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and causes of things here below, though
they know well enough that there was never
any <hi>agreement</hi> amongst the wisest and severest
that at any time have been engaged in that
disquisition, nor is it likely that ever there
will be so. And herein they can countenance
themselves with the <hi>difficulty, obscurity</hi> and
<hi>importance</hi> of the things inquired after. But
as for the high and <hi>heavenly mysteries</hi> of the
Gospel, the least whereof is infinitely of more
importance, then any thing that the utmost
reach and comprehension of humane wisdom
can attain unto, they may be neglected and


<pb facs="tcp:50044:6"/>
despised because there are <hi>contentions</hi> about
them.
<q>Hic nigrae succus loliginis, haec est
Erugo mera.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, this is so far from any <hi>real
ground</hi> for any such conclusion, that it were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
impossible that any man should believe
the truth of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> if he had not
seen or might not be informed that such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and differences</hi> had ensued in and about
it; for that they should do so, is plainly and
frequently foretold in those <hi>sacred oracles</hi> of
it, whereof if any one be found to fail, the
veracity and authority of the whole may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be called into question; If therefore men
will have a religion so <hi>absolutely facile</hi> aud ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that without diligence, endeavour, pains
or enquiry, without laying out of their <hi>rational
abilities,</hi> or exercising the faculties of their souls
about it, without foregoing of their lusts and
pleasures, without care of mistakes and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
they may be securely wrapt up in it,
as it were <hi>whither they will or no:</hi> I confess they
must seek for some other where they can find
it, <hi>Christianity</hi> will yield them no relief. God
hath not proposed an acquaintance with the
<hi>blessed concernments</hi> of his Glory, and of their
own eternal condition, unto the sons of men


<pb facs="tcp:50044:7"/>
on any such terms, as that they should not
need with all diligence to employ and exercise
their <hi>faculties of their souls</hi> in the investigation
of them, in the use of the means by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for that purpose, seeing this is the
<hi>chiefest end</hi> for which he hath made us those
souls: And as for them, who in <hi>sincerity</hi>
give up their minds and consciences unto his
Authority and guidance, he hath not left them
without an <hi>infallible d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any in their enquiring after truth, by the <hi>errour</hi>
and <hi>deviation</hi> of other men from it, are all
sufficiently recompenced unto them, by the
<hi>excellency</hi> and sweetness which they find in
the truth it self, when sought out with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
according to the mind of Christ. And
one said not amiss of old, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>I dare say he is the wisest Christian, who hath

                  </gap>idered the various differences
that are in and about Christianity,</hi> as being built
in the knowledge of the truth upon the best
and most stable foundations. To this end hath
the Lord Jesus given us his <hi>holy word,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and sure Revelation of all that he would
have us to <hi>believe or do</hi> in the worship of God.


<pb facs="tcp:50044:7"/>
This he commands us diligently to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to study, seach, and enquire after, that we
may <hi>know his mind</hi> and do it. It is true in their
enquiry into it, <hi>various apprehensions</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sense and meaning of sundry things
revealed therein have befallen some men in
all ages; and <hi>Origen</hi> gives this as one occasion
of the differences that were in those dayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. 1. <hi>When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were converted unto Christianity, some of them
variously understanding the holy Scripture which
they joyntly believed, it came to pass that heresie
ensued.</hi> For this was the <hi>whole rule</hi> of faith &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in those dayes; the means for securing of
us in them imposed on us of late by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
was then not heard of, not thought of in
the world. But moreover to obviate all <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
that might in this matter ensue from the
manifold <hi>weakness</hi> of our minds in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
spiritual things, the Lord Jesus
hath promised his <hi>holy spirit</hi> unto all them
that believe in him, and ask it of him, to
prevent their mistakes and miscarriages in the
study of his word, and to <hi>lead them into all that
truth,</hi> the knowledge whereof is necessary,
that they may believe in him unto the end,
and live unto him. And if they who dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
and conscientiously without <hi>prejudices,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:50044:8"/>
corrupt ends or designs in obedience to the
command of Christ, shall enquire into the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> to receive from thence the <hi>whole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
of their faith and rule of their obedience,
and who believing his promise shall <hi>pray for
his Spirit,</hi> and wait to receive him in and by
the means appointed for that end, may not
be, and are not thereby secured from all such
mistakes and errours as may disinterest them
in the promises of the Gospel, I know not how
we may be brought unto any <hi>certainty</hi> or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Truths of God, or the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consolation of our own souls. Neither
indeed is the nature of man <hi>capable</hi> of any
further satisfaction in or about these things,
unless God should work <hi>continual miracles,</hi>
or give continually <hi>special revelations</hi> unto all
individuals, whch would utterly overthrow the
whole nature of that faith and obedience
which he requires at our hands. But once to
suppose that <hi>such persons</hi> through a defect of
the means appointed by Christ for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and direction before mentioned may
everlastingly miscarry, is to cast an unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>reproach</hi> on the goodness, grace and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of God, and enough to discourage all
men from enquiring after the truth. And
these things the <hi>Reader</hi> will find further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ensuing discourse, with a discovery
of the <hi>weakness,</hi> falseness and insufficiency


<pb facs="tcp:50044:8"/>
of those rules and reliefs which are tendred
unto us by the <hi>Romanists</hi> in the lieu of them
that are given us by God himself. Now if this
be the condition of things in <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
as to any one that hath with sincerity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
the Scripture, or considered the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Grace and Wisdom of God, it must
needs appear to be, it is manifest that mens
startling at it, or being offended upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>divisions and differences</hi> among them
that make profession thereof, is nothing but
a <hi>pretence</hi> to cloke and hide their <hi>sloth</hi> and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi>
negligence, with their unwillingness to
come up unto the <hi>indispensable condition</hi> of
learning the truth as it is in Jesus, namely obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<hi>unto his whole will,</hi> and all his commands
so far as he is pleased to reveal them unto us.
With others they are but <hi>incentives</hi> unto that
diligence, and watchfulness, which the <hi>things
themselves</hi> in their <hi>nature</hi> high and arduous, and
in their <hi>importance</hi> of everlasting moment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at your hands? Further on those who by
the means formentioned come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, it is incumbent according
as they are by Gods providence called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and as they receive ability from him for
that purpose, to <hi>contend earnestly for it.</hi> Nor
is their so doing any part of the <hi>evil</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<hi>differences and divisions,</hi> but a means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God himself for their <hi>cure</hi> and


<pb facs="tcp:50044:9"/>
removal, provided as the Apostle speaks that
they <hi>strive or contend lawfully.</hi> The will of
God must be done in the wayes of his own
appointment. Outward <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi>
corporal punishments, <hi>swords and faggots,</hi> as
to any use in things purely spiritual and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to impose them on the <hi>consciences</hi> of men,
are condemned in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by all the
<hi>antient</hi> or first writers of the Church, by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<hi>Edicts</hi> and Laws of the Empire, and are
contrary to the very <hi>light of Reason</hi> whereby
we are men, and all the <hi>principles</hi> of it from
whence mankind consenteth and coalesceth
into civil society. Explaining, declaring,
proving and confirming the truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
of <hi>gainsayers</hi> by the evidence of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principles</hi> on all hands assented unto, and
right reason, with <hi>prayer</hi> and supplications
for success, attended with a <hi>conversation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Gospel we profess, is the way
sanctified by God unto the <hi>promotion</hi> of the
truth, and the <hi>recovery</hi> of them that are
gone astray from it. Into this work according
as God hath imparted of his gifts and spirit
unto them, some in <hi>most ages of the Church</hi>
have been engaged; and therein have not
contracted any guilt of the evils of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and divisions</hi> in their dayes, but cleared
themselves of them, and faithfully served the
interest of those in their generation. And this


<pb facs="tcp:50044:9"/>
justifies and warrants us in the pursuit of the
<hi>same work,</hi> by the same means, in the same days
wherein we live. And when at any time <hi>men
sleep</hi> in the neglect of their duty, the envious
one will not be wanting to <hi>sow his Tares</hi> in the
field of the Lord; which as in the times and
places wherein we live it should quicken the
<hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> of those upon whom the
care of the preservation of the truth is by the
providence of God in an especial manner <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,</hi>
and who have manifold advantages for
their encouragement in their undertaking; so
also it <hi>gives countenance</hi> even to the meanest
endeavours that in sincerity are employed in
the same work by others in their more private
capacity, amongst which I hope the ensuing
brief discourse may with <hi>impartial Readers</hi>
find admittance. It is designed in general for
the <hi>defence and vindication of the truth,</hi> and that
truth which is publickly professed in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
against the <hi>solicitation</hi> of it, and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made unto it with more then ordinary
vigilancy, and seeming hopes of prevalency,
on what grounds I know not. This is done by
those of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> who have given in
themselves as <hi>sad an instance</hi> of a degeneracy
from the truth, as ever the Christian world had
experience of, from insensible and almost
<hi>imperceptible</hi> entrances into deviations from
the holy rule of the Gospel, countenanced by


<pb facs="tcp:50044:10"/>
               <hi>pecious pretences</hi> of piety and devotion, but
really influenced by the <hi>corrupt lusts</hi> of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

remedies:</hi> All which may be as truly and justly
spoken of the <hi>present Roman</hi> Ecclesiastical
estate. The first <hi>Rulers</hi> and members of that
Church by their exemplary <hi>sanctity and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
for the truth, deservedly obtained great
renown &amp; reputation amongst the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the world; but after a while the <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Christ</hi> decaying amongst them, and the
purity of his doctrine beginning to be corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
they insensibly fell from their pristine
glory, untill at length they <hi>precipitantly</hi> tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
into that condition; wherein because

<hi>temporal ruine,</hi> they are resolved to abide, be
it never so desperate or deplorable. And

ever the disciples of Christ had to <hi>contend</hi>
withall, to <hi>suffer</hi> under, or to <hi>witness</hi> against,
that made unto the truth by the <hi>Roman

For mine own part, there are no sort of men
from whose frame of spirit and waies I shall
labour a <hi>greater distance</hi> then theirs, who
set themselves against that <hi>moderation</hi> towards
persons differing from them and others in the
result of their thoughts upon an humble sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
investigation of the truth and wayes of
Christ, which himself and his Apostles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unto us, or that refuse to consent unto
<hi>any way of Reconciliation</hi> of dissenters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
violence is not offered unto the <hi>commands</hi>
of God, as stated in their consciences. Let
the <hi>Romanists</hi> renounce their principles about
the <hi>absolute necessity</hi> of the subjection of all
persons unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> in answer unto that
groundless and boundless Authority which in
things <hi>sacred and civil</hi> they assign unto him,
with their resolution of imposing the <hi>dictates</hi>
of their Church <hi>per fas &amp; nefas</hi> upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and we shall endeavour with all qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness
and <hi>moderation</hi> to <hi>plead</hi> with them about
our remaining differences, and to <hi>joyn</hi> with
them in the profession of those important
truths wherein we are agreed. But whilest
they propose no other forms of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi>
but our <hi>absolute submission</hi> unto their Papal
Authority, with our assent unto, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those doctrines which we are perswaded


<pb facs="tcp:50044:12"/>
are <hi>contrary</hi> to the Scripture, with the sense of
<hi>Catholick Antiquity,</hi> derogatory to the Glory
of God, and prejudicial to the salvation of those
by whom they are received, and our concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with them in those <hi>wayes of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
which themselves are fallen into by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
they know not how, &amp; which we believe
dishonourable unto God, and <hi>pernitious</hi> to the
souls of men, I see no ground of any other peace
with them, but that only which we are <hi>bound to
follow with all men,</hi> in abstaining from mutual
violences, performing all offices of Christian
love, and in a special praying for their <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and coming to the acknowledgment of the
Truth.</hi> On this account was it, that some
while since upon the desire of some friends,
I undertook the <hi>examination</hi> of a discourse
entituled <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> whose Author under a
pretence of that <hi>moderation,</hi> which is indeed
altogether inconsistent with other principles
of his profession, endeavoured to insinuate
a necessity of the <hi>reception of Popery</hi> for the
bringing of us to peace or agreement here,
and the <hi>interesting</hi> of us in any hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
rest and peace hereafter. Whether that
<hi>small labour</hi> were seasonable or no, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any service were done therein to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Truth, is left to the judgement of men
unprejudiced. Not long after there was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
an <hi>Epistle,</hi> pretending a Reply unto that


<pb facs="tcp:50044:13"/>
discourse, being indeed a meer flourish of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
words, and a giving up of the cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Author of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> was engaged, as
<hi>desperate</hi> and indefensible. However I thought
it not meet to let it pass without some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
partly that the <hi>design</hi> of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
with others of the like nature of late
published amongst us, might be further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,
and partly that the ends of <hi>moderation</hi>
and peace being fixed between us, I might
farther try and examine, <hi>whose,</hi> and what <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
are best suited unto their pursuit and
accomplishment. I have not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
my self unto an Answer unto the <hi>Epistle</hi>
of the Author of <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> which indeed it
doth not deserve, as I suppose, himself being
judge; but have only from it taken <hi>occasion</hi>
to discuss those principles and usages in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
wherein the most important differences
between <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>lie. For
whereas the <hi>whole difference</hi> between them and
us, is branched into <hi>two general heads;</hi> the
first concerning those principles which they
and we severally <hi>build</hi> our profession upon,
and <hi>resolve</hi> our faith into; and the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
<hi>particular instances</hi> in doctrines of
faith, and practice in Religious worship, I
have laid hold of occasion to treat of them
both; of the former <hi>absolutely,</hi> and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in things of most <hi>weight</hi> and concernment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


               <pb facs="tcp:50044:13"/>
And because the <hi>Judgement of Antiquity</hi> is
deservedly of moment in these things, I have
not only manifested it to lie plain and clear
against the <hi>Romanist</hi> in instances sufficient to
impeach their <hi>pretended infallibility;</hi> which is
enough to dissolve that whole <hi>imaginary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi>
that is built upon it, and centers in it;
but also in most of the <hi>material controversies</hi>
that are between them and us. These things
Christian Reader, I thought meet to premise
towards the <hi>prevention</hi> of that <hi>offence</hi> which
any may really take, or for corrupt ends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
so to do, at the <hi>differences</hi> in <hi>general</hi> that
are amongst Christians, or those in <hi>especial</hi>
which are between us and the <hi>Roman Church;</hi>
as also to give an account of the occasion,
design and end of the ensuing consideration of
them.</p>

and could have been contented it

you have now done: <hi>Sat citò si sat benè:</hi> Things of

saith the great Apostle; <hi>We can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against the Truth, but for the Truth:</hi> which
Rule had you observed, you might have spared
your whole time and labour in this business. However
I shall be glad to find that you have given me just
cause to believe what you say, of your <hi>not seeing the
Animadversions on your Bock before February.</hi> As I


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50044:18"/>
find you observant of Truth in your Progress, or
failing therein, so shall I judg of your veracity in
this unlikely story; for every man gives the best
measure of himself. And though I cannot see how
possibly a man could spend much time in trussing up
such a <hi>fardle</hi> of <hi>trifles</hi> and <hi>quibbles</hi> as your <hi>Epistle</hi> is,
yet it is somewhat strange on the other side, that you
should not in eight moneths space, for so long were
the <hi>Animadversions</hi> made publick before <hi>February,</hi>
set eye on that, which being your own especiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
was to my knowledg in the hands of many
of your party. To dial friendly with you, <hi>nolim
caeterarum rerum te socordem codem modo.</hi> Yea I
doubt not but you use more diligence in your other
affairs; though in generall the matter in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us seems to be your Principall concernment.
But now you have seen that <hi>Discourse,</hi> and as you
inform me <hi>have read it over;</hi> which I believe, and
take not only upon the same score of present Trust,
but upon the <hi>Evidence</hi> also which you give unto your
Assertion, by your carefull avoiding to take any
further notice of the things that you found too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
for you to reply unto: For any impartiall <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that shall seriously consider the <hi>Animadversions</hi>
with your <hi>Epistle,</hi> will quickly find, that the main
<hi>Artifice</hi> wherein you conside, is a pretence of saying
somewhat in general, whilst you pass over the things
of most importance, and which most press the cause
you defend, with a perpetuall silence: These you
turn from, and fall upon the Person of the Author
of the <hi>Animadversions.</hi> If ever you debated this
procedure with your self, had I been present with
you when you said with him in the Poet, <hi>Dubius
sum quid faciam.—Tene relinquam an rem,</hi> I should
have replied with him, <hi>me sodes;</hi> but you were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50044:18"/>
minded, and are gone before <hi>Ego, ut

               <p>
                  <hi>Cum victore, sequar.</hi> I will follow you with what
patience I can, and make the best use I am able of
what offers its self in your Discourse.</p>
               <p>Two Reasons I confess you adde why you chose
<hi>vadimonium deserere,</hi> and not reply to the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions;</hi>
which to deal plainly with you, give me
very little satisfaction: The first of them you say, is
<hi>because to do so, would be contrary to the very end and
design of Fiat Lux,</hi> which shall immediately be
considered. The other is, <hi>the threats which I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you, that if you dare to write again, I will make
you know, what manner of man I am.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Though it
seems you <hi>dare not reply</hi> to my Book, yet you dare
do that which is much worse; you dare write <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
untruths,</hi> and such as your self know to be so,
as others also who have read those Papers. By such
things as these, with sober and ingenious Persons,
you cannot but much prejudice the <hi>interest</hi> you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to promote, as well as in your self you wrong
your <hi>conscience,</hi> and ruine your <hi>reputation.</hi> Besides
all advantage springing from untruth is fading: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will it admit of any covering, but of its own
kind, which can never be so encreased, but that it
will rain through. Only I confess thus far you have
promoted your design, that you have given a new
and cogent instance of <hi>the Evils attending Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
in Religion.</hi> which you declame about in your
<hi>Fiat;</hi> which yet is such, as it had been your duty
to avoid. What it is that you make use of to give
conntenance unto this fiction (for <hi>malum semper
habitat in alieno fundo</hi>) I shall have occasion after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to consider. For the present I leave you to
the discipline of your own thoughts;

And I the rather mind you of your <hi>failure</hi> at this
entrance of our discourse, that I may only remit
your thoughts unto this stricture, when the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
offers it self, which I fear it will do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequently:
But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, it will be no advantage unto mee,
or you, to contend for the Truth which we profess,
if in the mean time, we are regardless of the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of truth, in our own hearts and spirits.</p>
               <p>Two Principall Heads, the Discourse which you
premise unto the Particular consideration of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions,
is reducible unto: The first whereof is,
your endeavour to manifest, <hi>that I understood not the
design and end of</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>a Discourse</hi> (as you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
testifie) <hi>hard to deal with, and impossible to
confute.</hi> The other, your Enquiry after the Author
of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> with your attempt to prove
him one in <hi>such a condition,</hi> as you may possible hope
to obtain more advantage from, than you can do by
endeavouring the refutation of his Book. Some
other occasionall passages there are in it also, which
as they deserve, shall be considered. Unto these two
Generall Heads I shall give you at present a Candid
Return, and leave you when you are <hi>free from Flies</hi>
to make what use of it you please.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Disign</hi> or <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> I took to be the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Papall Interest;</hi> and the whole of it, in
the relation of its parts unto one another, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
End aimed at in it, to be a perswasive indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto the embracement of the present <hi>Romane</hi>
Faith and Religion. The means insisted on for this
end, I conceived principally to be these; 1. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the evils that attend differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and disputes about it: 2. Of the good of Union,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50044:19"/>
Peace, Love, and Concord among Christians: 3. Of
the impossibility of obtaining this good by any other
wayes or means, but only by an embracement of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith and Profession, with a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the deciding Power and Authority of the
Pope, or your Church: 4. A defence and illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some especiall parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion,
most commonly by Protestants excepted against.
This was my <hi>mistake;</hi> unto this <hi>mistake</hi> I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my whole discourse was suited. In the same
<hi>mistake</hi> are all the persons in <hi>England,</hi> that ever I
heard speak any thing of that discourse, of what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in Religion soever they were. And <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
thought it worch while to remember our of <hi>Hesiod.

                  </gap>,
of as much esteem it may be as all the rest, and
that is <hi>your self;</hi> you are your self in the same <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake:</hi>
you know well enough that this was your End,
this your Designe, these the means of your persuing
it; and you acknowledge them immediately so to
have been, as we shall see in the consideration of the
evidence you tender to evince that <hi>mistake</hi> in me
which you surmize.</p>
               <p>First you tell me, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>That I mistake the drist
and design of</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>whilest I take that as absolutely
spoken, which is only said upon an Hypothesis of our
present condition here in</hi> England. This were a grand
mistake indeed, that I should look on any thing
proposed as an Expedient for the erding of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
about Religion, without a supposition of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50044:20"/>
about Religion. But how do you prove that
I fell into such <hi>a mistake?</hi> I plainly and openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that such differences there are; all my
discourse proceeds on that supposition. I bewaile the
<hi>evil</hi> of them, and labour for <hi>moderation</hi> about
them; and have long since ventured to propose my
thoughts unto the world, to that purpose. All that
you <hi>suppose</hi> in your Discourse on this account I <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
also; yea and grant it, unless it be some such
thing as is in <hi>controversie</hi> between you and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
which you are somewhat frequent in the
<hi>supposall</hi> of unto your Advantage; and thereon would
perswade them unto a relinquishment of <hi>Protistancy,</hi>
and embracement of <hi>Popery,</hi> which is the end of your
Book, and will be thought so, if you should deny
it a thousand times: For <hi>quid ego verba audiam facta
cum video?</hi> your <hi>Protcstation</hi> comes too late, when
the <hi>fact</hi> hath declared your mind: neither are you
now at liberty to coyn new designes for your <hi>Fiat.</hi>
But this must be my <hi>mistake,</hi> which no man in his wits
could possibly fall into; neither is it an evidence of
any great sobriety to impure it to any man, whom we
know not certainly to be distracted. But this mistake
you tell me, caused me <hi>to judge and censure what you
wrote, as impertinent, impious, frivolous, &amp;c.</hi> No such
matter; my right apprehension of your <hi>hypothesis,</hi>
End, or Designe, occasioned me to shew, that your
discourses were incompetent to prevail with ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and sober Persons, to comply with your desires.</p>
               <p>You proceed to the same purpose <hi>pag.</hi> 15. and to
manifest my mistake of your designe, give an account
of it, and tell us, that <hi>one thing you suppose, namely,
that we are at difference.</hi> So did I also, and am not
therefore yet fallen upon the discovery of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.

do, and joyn with you therein, neither is he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the name of a Christian, who is otherwise mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that is one great Legacy that Christ bequeathed
unto his Disciples; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, saith he <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.
<hi>Peace I leave with you, my
peace I give unto you.</hi> And he is no Disciple of Christ
who doth not long for it, among all his Disciples.
<hi>This</hi> you tell us is the <hi>whole summe of</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>in
few words.</hi> You will tell us otherwise immediately;
and if you should not, yet we should find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
You adde therefore, <hi>that to introduce a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
unto peace, you made it your work to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the useleslness, endlesness, and unprofitableness
of Quarrels:</hi> yet my <hi>mistake</hi> appears not; I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you did speak to this purpose; and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
with you, that <hi>Quarrels</hi> about Religion are
useless and unprofitable, any otherwise than as we are
bound to <hi>contend earnestly for the faith once delivered
unto the Saints,</hi> and to <hi>stand fast in our Liberty, not
giving place to seducers,</hi> with labouring by <hi>sound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to convince and stop the mouthes of gainsayers;</hi>
all which are made necessary unto us by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Christ, and are not to be called quarreling.
And I know that our <hi>Quarrels</hi> are not yet <hi>actually
ended;</hi> that they are <hi>endless,</hi> I believe not, but hope
the contrary. You proceed and grant, that <hi>you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to perswade your Countreymen of an Impossibility
of ever bringing our debates unto a conclusion, either
by Light, or Spirit, or Reason, or Scripture, so long as
we stand separated from any superiour Judicative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
unto which all Parties will submit, and therefore
that it is rationall and Christian like, to leave these
endless contentions, and resigne our selves to humility
and peace.</hi> This matter will now quickly be ended, and
that <hi>ex ore tuo;</hi> give me leave I pray to ask you one


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50044:21"/>
or two plain Questions: 1. Whom do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by that <hi>Superiour Judicative Power,</hi> unto
whom you perswade all Parties to submit? Have you
not told us in your <hi>Fiat</hi> that it is the Church or Pope
of <hi>Rome?</hi> or will you deny that to be your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
2. What do you intend by <hi>resigning our selves
to humility and Peace?</hi> Do you not ayme at our qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
submission to the determinations of the Church
or Pope in all matters of Religion? Have you not
declared your self unto this purpose in your <hi>Fiat?</hi>
And I desire a little further to know of you, whither
this be not that which <hi>formally</hi> constitutes a man a
member of your Church, that he own the Judicative
Power of the Pope or your Church in all matters of
Religion, and submit himself thereunto? If these
things be so, as you cannot deny them, I hope I shall
easily obtain your pardon, for Affirming that you
your self believed the same to be the design of your
Book, which I and other men apprehended to be so;
for here you directly avow it. If you complain any
more about this matter, pray let it be in the words of
him in the Comoedian, <hi>Egomet meo judicio miser quasi
sorex hodie perii,</hi> This inconvenience you have
brought upon your own self: Neither can any man
long avoid such misadventures, who designs to cloud
his aymes, which yet cannot take effect, if not in
some measure understood. Naked Truth mannaged
in sincerity, whatever perplexities it may meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

Promoters. I doubt not, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you hope well, that

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope be very groundless
as I have elswhere demonsirated. You have at best


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50044:21"/>
but the shadow or shell of peace, and for the most
part, not that neither. Yea it may be easily shewed,
that the peace you boast of, is inconsistent with, and
destructive of that peace, which is left by Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Disciples.</p>
               <p>But the way you propose to bring us to Peace, is
the embracement of <hi>Popery,</hi> which is that, that was
fixed on by me, as the design of your Book, which
now acknowledging, you have disarmed your self of
that imaginary advantage, which you flourish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
from a <hi>Capitall Mistake,</hi> as you call it in me,
in misapprehending your design. You were told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that if by <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> you intended
a mutuall for bearance of one another, in our severall
perswasions, waiting patiently untill God shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
unto us the precise Truth, in the things about
which we differ, you shall have all the furtherance
that I can contribute unto you; but you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aim, another work in hand, and will not allow
that any Peace is attainable amongst us, but by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of all our Apprehensions in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to the guidance, determination, and decision
of the Pope, or your Church, a way no where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto us in holy Writ, nor in the <hi>Councels of
the Primitive Church,</hi> and besides against all Reason,
Law, and Equity, your Pope and Church in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
being one Party litigant; yet <hi>in this perswasion,</hi>
you say, <hi>you should abide, were there no other persons
in the world but your self that did embrace it.</hi> And to
let you see how unlikely that Principle is to produce
Peace and Agreement, amongst those multitudes
that are at variance about these things, I can assure
you, that if there were none lest alive in the Earth
but you and I, we should not agree in this thing one
jot better, than did <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> about the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50044:22"/>
though I should desire you, that we might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
our differences with more moderation, than he
did, who by vertue of his <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> seemed to
lay a speciall claim to the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> And indeed
for your part, if your present perswasion be, as you
sometimes pretend it to be, that your <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> is
not a perswasive unto Popery, you have given a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
testimony, that you can be of an opinion,
that no man else in the world is of, nor will be, do
what you can. But the insufficiency of your Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Arguments, to accomplish your design,
hath been in part already evinced, and shall, God
willing, in our progress, be further made manifest.
This is the summe of what appears in the first part of
your prefatory discourse, concerning my mistake of
your design, which how little it hath tended unto
your advantage, I hope you being to understand.</p>
               <p>Your next labour consists in a pacifick, charitable
Enquiry, after the <hi>Author of the Animadversions,</hi>
with an endeavour by I know not how many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to confirm your surmize, that he is a Person,
that had an interest in the late troubles in the Nation,
or as you phrase it, was a <hi>part of that dismall tempest,
which overbore all before it, not only Church and
State, but Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>son, Right, Honesty, all true Religion,
and even good Nature too.</hi> See what despair of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
an undertaking which cannot well be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
will drive men unto. Are you not sensible
that you cry,
<q>
                     <l>—Vos ô miht manes.</l>
                     <l>Este boni, quoniam Superis aversa voluntas.</l>

Or like the Jews, who when they were convinced of
their errours, and wickedness, by our Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to call him <hi>Samaritane,</hi> and <hi>Devil,</hi> and to take


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50044:22"/>
up stones to cast at him: Or as <hi>Crescens</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi>
dealt with <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> whom because he could not
answer, after he had engaged in a dispute with him,
he laboured to bring him into suspition with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a person dangerous
to the Commonwealth: And so also the <hi>Arians</hi>
dealt with <hi>Athanasius.</hi> It were easie to manifest,
that the spring of all this discourse of yours, is <hi>smart,</hi>
and not <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and that it proceeds from a sense of
your own disappointment, and not zeal for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of others; but how little it is to your purpose,
I shall shew you anon, and could quickly render it as
little to your advantage: For what if I should fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize,
that you were one of the <hi>Friers,</hi> that stirred
up the <hi>Irish</hi> to their rebellion, and unparralleld mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Assure your self, I can quickly give as many,
and as probable Reasons for my so doing, as you
have given, or can give for your conjecture, about
the <hi>Author of the Animadversions,</hi> on your <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi>
You little think how much it concerns him to look to
himself, who undertakes to accuse another; and
how easie it were to make you repent your accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as much as ever <hi>Crassus</hi> did his accusing of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo.</hi>
But I was in good hope, you would have left
such reflections, as are capable of so easie a retortion
upon your self, especially being irregular, and no
way subservient unto your design, and being warned
beforehand so to do. Who could imagine, that a
man of so much <hi>piety,</hi> and <hi>mortification,</hi> as in your
<hi>Fiat</hi> you profess your self to be, should have so little
regard unto common honesty, and civillity, which
are shrewdly entrenched upon by such uncharitable
<hi>surmizes?</hi> I suppose you know that the Apostle rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereof you have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the management of one, amongst the things


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50044:23"/>
that are contrary to the Doctrine, that is according
unto godliness; otherwise suspicion is in your own
power; nor can any man hinder you from surmizing
what you please. This he knew in <hi>Plautus,</hi> who
cryed,
<q>
                     <l>Ne admittam culpam ego meo sum promus pectori,</l>

And I know that concerning all your dispute and
arguings in these Pages, you may say what <hi>Lucian</hi>
doth about his true Story, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>You write</hi>
about the things, which <hi>have neither been seen,</hi> nor
<hi>suffered, heard,</hi> nor <hi>much enquired after;</hi> such is
the force of faction, and sweetness of revenge in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
minds. To deliver you if it may be from the
like miscarriages for the future, let me inform you,
that the Author of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> is a Person,
who never had a hand in, nor gave consent unto the
raising of any War in these Nations, nor unto any
politicall alteration in them, no nor to any one that
was amongst us during our Revolutions; but he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
that he lived and acted under then, the
things wherein he thought his duty consisted, and
challengeth all men to charge him with doing the
least personall injury unto any, professing himself
ready to give satisfaction to any one, that can justly
claim it. Therefore as unto the publick affairs in
this Nation, he is amongst them who bless God and
the King for the Act of Oblivion, and that because


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50044:23"/>
he supposeth, that all the Inhabitants of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which lived in it, when his Majesty was driven
out of it, have cause so to do, which some Priests
and Friers have, and that in reference unto such act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as he would scorn for the saving of his life, to
give the least countenance unto, among whom it is
not unlikely that you might be one, which yet he
will not averre, nor give Reasons to prove it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he doth not know it so to be. But you have
sundry Reasons to justifie your self in your Charge,
and they are as well worthy our consideration, as
any thing else you have written in your <hi>Epistle,</hi> and
shall therefore not be neglected. The first of them
you thus express, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>You cannot abide to hear of
Moderation, it is with you most wicked, hypocriticall,
and divelish, especially as it comes from me; for this one
thing</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>suffers more from you, than for all the
Contents of the Book put together. My reason is your
passion, my moderation enftames your wrath, and you
are therefore stark wilde, because I utter so much of
sobriety.</hi> This is your first Reason, which you have
exactly squared to the old Rule, <hi>Calumniare fortiter,
aliquid adhaerebit:</hi> Calumny will leave a scar; would
you were your self only concerned in these things.
But among the many wofull miscarriages, of men
prosessing the Religion of Jesus Christ, whereby the
beauty and glory of it have been stained in the world,
and it self in a great measure rendred ineffectuall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
its blessed ends, there is not any thing of more sad
consideration, than the endeavours of men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and propagate the things, which they suppose
belong unto it, by wayes and means directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto, and destructive of its most known and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Principles. For when it is once observed
and manifest, that the actings of men in the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50044:24"/>
of any Religion, are forbidden and condemned in
that Religion which they seek to promote, what can
rationally be concluded, but that they not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
themselves what they outwardly profess, but
also esteem it a fit mask and cover to carry on other
interests of their own, which they prefer before it?
and what can more evidently tend unto its disreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and disadvantage, is not easie to conceive.
Such is the course here fixed on by you: It is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of Christ you pretend to plead for, and to
promote, but if there be a word true in it, the way
you take for that end, namely by openly false accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is to be abhorred, which manifests what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto it you inwardly cherish. And I wish this
were only your <hi>personall miscarriage,</hi> that you were
not encouraged unto it, by the Principles and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of your chiefest Masters and Leaders: The
learned Person who wrote the Letters, discovering
the <hi>Mystery of Jesuitisme,</hi> gives us just cause so to
conceive; for he doth not only prove, that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi>
have publickly maintained, that <hi>Calumny is but
a veniall sin,</hi> nay none at all, if used against such as
you call Calumniators, though grounded on <hi>absolute

In their steps you set out in this your first Reason,
wherein there is not one word of truth. I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
told you, that I did not think you could your
self believe some of the things that you affirmed, at
which you take great offence; but I must now tell
you, that if you proceed in venting such notorious
untruths, as here you have heaped together, I shall
greatly question whether seriously you believe, that
Jesus Christ will one day judge the world in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:

For I do not think you can produce a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
dispensation, to say what you please, be it,
nere so false, of a supposed Heretick; for though it
may be you will not keep faith with him, surely you
ought to observe truth in speaking of him. You tell

               <p>Your next Reason is, <hi>Because he talks of Swords
and Blood, Fire and Fagot, Guns and Duggers,
which doth more than show, that he hath not let go those
hot and furious imaginations.</hi> But of what sort, by
whom used, to what end? Doth he mention any of
these, but such as your Church hath made use of,
for the destruction of Protestants? If you have not
done so, why do you not disprove his Assertions?
If you have, why have you practised that in the face
of the Sun, which you cannot endure to be told of?
Is it equall think you, that you should kill, burn,
and destroy men, for the profession of their faith in
Christ Jesus, and that it should not be lawfull for
others to say you do so? Did not your self make the
calling over of these things necessary, by crying out
against Protestants, for <hi>want of moderation?</hi> It is one
of the priviledges of the Pope, some say, to <hi>judge all
men, and himself to be judged by none;</hi> but is it so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that no man may say he hath done, what all the
world knows he hath done, and which we have just
cause to fear he would do again, had he power to
his will? For my part I can assure you, so that you
will cease from charging others, with that whose


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50044:25"/>
guilt lyes heavier upon your selves, than on all the
professors of Christianity in the world besides, and
give any tolerable security against the like practices
for the future, I shall be well content that all which
is past, may be put by us poor worms into perpetuall
oblivion, though I know it will be called over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

make your advantages of other mens miscarriages,
pray arm your selves with patience, to hear some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a little of your own.

It were well if your wayes did no more please you,
in the previous prospect you take of them, than they
seem to do in a subsequent reflection upon them:
But this is the nature of evil, it never comes and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50044:25"/>
goes with the same appearing countenance; not that
it self changeth at any time, for that which is moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evil is alwayes so, but mens apprehensions vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
influenced by their affections, lusts, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
do frequently change and alter. Now what
Conclusion can be made from the premises rightly
stated, I leave to your own judgement, at your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
leasure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You adde, <hi>Your prophetick assurance so
often inculcated, that if you could but once come to
whisper me in the ear, I would plainly acknowledge,
either that I understand not my self what I say, or if I
do, believe it not, gives a fair character of these fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
times, wherein ignorance and hypocrisie prevail'd
over worth and truth, whereof if your self were any
part, it is no wonder you should think, that I or any
man else should either speak he knows not what, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not what himself speaks.</hi> That is, a man must
needs be as bad as you can imagine him, if he have
not such an high opinion of your ability and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as to believe that you have written about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what you perfectly understand, nor assert
anything in the persuit of your design and interest,
but what you really and in cold blood believe to be
true. All men it seems that were no part of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dismall tempest,</hi> have this opinion of you; <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
Apella:</hi> If it be so, I confess for my part, I have
no relief against being concluded to be whatever you
please; <hi>Sosia</hi> or not <hi>Sosia,</hi> the Law is in your own
hands, and you may condemn all that adore you not
into <hi>Fanaticisme</hi> at your pleasure; but as he said,
<hi>Obsecro per pacem liceat te alloqui, ut ne vapulem;</hi>
if you will but grant a little <hi>truce</hi> from this severity,
I doubt not but in a short time to take off from your
keenness, in the management of this Charge: For


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50044:26"/>
I hope you will allow that a man may speak the truth,
without being a <hi>Fanatick;</hi> truth may get hatred, I
see it hath done so, but it will make no man hatefull.
Without looking back then to your <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> I
shall out of this very <hi>Epistle,</hi> give you to see, that
you have certainly failed on the one hand, in writing
about things which you do not at all understand,
and therefore discourse concerning them, like a
blind man about colours; and as I fear greatly also
on the other; for I cannot suppose you so ignorant,
as not to know that some things in your discourse,
are otherwise than by you represented: Nay and we
shall find you at express contradictions, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
what you please, I know you cannot at the same
time believe. Instances of these things you will be
minded of in our progress: Now I must needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unhappy in discoursing of them, if this be <hi>Logick</hi>
and <hi>Law,</hi> that for so doing, I must be concluded a
<hi>Fanatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, You adde, <hi>Your pert Assertion so oft
occurring in your Book, that there is neither reason,
truth, nor honesty in my words, is but the overflowings
of that former intemperate zeal;</hi> whereunto may be
added, what in the last place you insist on to the
same purpose, <hi>namely,</hi> that I <hi>charge you with fraud,
ignorance, and wickedness, when in my own heart I
find you most clear from any such blemish.</hi> I do not
remember where any of those expressions are used by
me; that they are no where used thus altogether,
I know well enough, neither shall I make any enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
after them. I shall therefore desire you only to
produce the instances, whereunto any of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
intimated are annexed, and if I do not prove
evidently and plainly, that to be wanting in your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which is charged so to be, I will make you a


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50044:26"/>
publick acknowledgement of the wrong I have done
you. But if no more was by me expressed, than
your words as used to your purpose did justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
pray be pleased to take notice that it is lawfull
for any man to speak the truth: And for my part,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as he said in <hi>Lucian,</hi> I live in the Countrey, where
they call a <hi>Spade</hi> a <hi>Spade.</hi> And if you can give any
one instance, where I have charged you with any
<hi>failure,</hi> where there is the least probability that I had
in my heart other thoughts, concerning what you
said, I will give up my whole interest in this cause
unto you; <hi>Mala mens, malus animus.</hi> You have
manifested your conscience to be no just measure of
other mens, who reckon upon their giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what they do or say: So that you have but
little advanced your Charge, by these undue insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Neither have you any better success, in that which
in the next place you insist upon, which yet were it
not like the most of the rest, destitute of truth,
would give more countenance unto your reflection,
than them all. It is, that <hi>I give you sharp and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
menaces, that if you write or speak again, you
shall hear more, find more, feel more, more to your
smart, more than you imagine, more than you would,
which relish much of that insulting humour which the
Land groaned under.</hi> I suppose no man reads this
representation of my words, with the addition of
your own, which makes up the greatest part of them,
but must needs thinks, that you have been sorely
threatned with some personall inconveniencies,
which I would cause to befall you, did you not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease
from writing; or that I would obtain some
course to be taken with you to your prejudice. Now


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50044:27"/>
this must needs savour of the spirit of our late dayes
of trouble and mischief, or at least of the former
dayes of the prevalency of <hi>Popery</hi> amongst us, when
men were not wont in such cases, to take up at bare
threats and menaces. If this be so, all men that
know the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and his
condition, must needs conclude him to be very <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
and <hi>wicked; foolish,</hi> for threatning any with
that, which is as far from his power to execute, as
the person threatned can possibly desire it to be;
<hi>wicked,</hi> for designing that evil unto any individuall
person, which he abhorres <hi>in hypothesi</hi> to be inflicted
on any upon the like account. But what if there be
nothing of all this in the pretended menaces? What
if the worst that is in them, be only part of a desire,
that you would abstain from insisting on the personall
miscarriages, of some that profess the Protestant
Religion, lest he should be necessitated to make a
diversion of your Charge, or to shew the insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of it to your purpose, by recounting the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
failings of the Guides, Heads, and Leaders of
your Church? If this be so, as it is in truth the
whole intendment of any of those expressions that
are used by me, (for the most part of them are your
own figments) whereever they occurre, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
can any rationall man make from them? Do
they not rather intimate a desire of the use of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in these our contests, and an abstinence from
things personall, (for which cause also (fruitlesly
as I now perceive, by this your new kind of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and moderation) I prefixed not my Name to the
<hi>Animadversions,</hi> which you also take notice of)
than any evil intention or design. This was my
threatning you; to which now I shall adde, that
though I may not say of these Papers, what <hi>Catullus</hi>


                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50044:27"/>
did of his Verses on <hi>Rufus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Verum id non impunè feceres, nam te omnia secla</l>
                     <l>Noscent, &amp; qui sis fama loquitur anus.</l>
                  </q>
Yet I shall say, that as many as take notice of this
discourse, will do no less of your disingenuity and
manifold falshood, in your vain attempt to relieve
your dying Cause, by casting <hi>odium</hi> upon him with
whom you have to do; like the <hi>Bonassus</hi> that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
informs us of <hi>Hist. Animal lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. which
being as big as a <hi>Bull,</hi> but having horns turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and unusefull for fight, when he is persued,
casts out his excrements to defile his persuers, and to
stay them in their passage.</p>
               <p>But what now is the End in all this heap of things
which you would have mistaken for Reasons, that
you aym at? it is all to shew how unfit I am to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Protestant Religion, and that <hi>I am not such
a Protestant as I would be thought to be.</hi> But why so?
I embrace the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
as declared in the 29 <hi>Articles,</hi> and other approved
publick writings, of the most famous Bishops and
other Divines thereof. I avow her rejection of the
<hi>pretended</hi> Authority, and <hi>reall</hi> Errours of the Church,
to be her duty and justifiable. The same is my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in reference unto all other Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the world, in all things wherein they agree
among themselves, which is in all things necessary
that God may be acceptably worshipped, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
saved. And why may I not plead the Cause of
Protestancy, against that imputation of demeric
which you heap upon it? Neither would I <hi>be thought</hi>
to be any thing in Religion but what I am: Neither
have I any sentiments therein, but what I profess.
But it may be you will say in some things I differ


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50044:28"/>
from other Protestants: wisely observed; and if
from thence you can conclude a man unqualified for
the defency of Protestancy, you have secured your
self from opposition; seeing every Protestant doth
so, and must do so whilest there are differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Protestants: But they are in things wherein
their Protestancy is not concerned. And may I be so
bold as to ask you, how the case in this instance
stands with your self, who certainly would have your
competency for the defence of your Church unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable?
Differences there are amongst you; and
that as in and about other things, so also about the
Pope himself, the head and spring of the Religion
you profess. Some of you maintain his <hi>Personall
Infallibility,</hi> and that not only in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi>
but in <hi>matters of Fact</hi> also. Others disclaim the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
as highly erroneous, and the latter as grosly
blasphemous. Pray what is your judgment in this
matter, for I suppose you are not of both these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
at once, and I am sure they are irreconcileable.
Some of you mount his <hi>Supremacy</hi> above a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councill, some would bring him into a Coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with it, and some subject him unto it; though
he hath almost carried the Cause, by having store of
<hi>Bishopricks</hi> to bestow, whereas a Councill has none,
which was the Reason given of old for his prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in this Contest. May we know what you think
in this Case? Some of you assert him to be <hi>de jure</hi>
Lord of the whole world in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi>
absolutely; some in <hi>Spirituals</hi> directly, and in
<hi>Temporals</hi> only in <hi>ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> an Abyss
from whence you may draw out what you please,
and some of you in <hi>Temporals</hi> not at all; and you
have not as yet given us your thoughts as to this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
amongst you? Some of you assert in him a


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50044:28"/>
Power of <hi>deposing</hi> Kings, disposing of Kingdoms,
transferring Titles unto Dominion, and Rule, for and
upon such miscarriages as he shall judg to contein
disobedience unto the <hi>Sea Apostolick.</hi> Others love
not to talk at this haughty rate, neither do I know
what is your judgment in this matter. This, as I said
before I am sure of, you cannot be of all these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
contradictory judgments at once. Not to
trouble you with Instances that might be multiplied
of the like differences amongst you; if notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your adherence unto one part of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in them, you judg your self a Competent
Advocate for your Church in generall, and do busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employ your self to win over Proselytes unto her
communion, have the patience to think, that one
who in some few things differs from some other
Protestants, is not wholly incapacitated thereby,
to repell an unjust charge against Protestancy in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
               <p>I have done with the two generall heads of your
prefatory Discourse, and shall now only mark one or
two incident particulars, that belong not unto them,
and then proceed to see if we can meet with any
thing of more importance, than what you have been
pleased as yet to communicate unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. Upon occasion of a passage in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
wherein upon misinformation, I expressed
some trouble, that any young men should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
with the Rhetorick and Sophistry of your
<hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> you fall into an harangue, not inferiour
unto some others in your Epistle, for that candour
and ingenuity you give your self unto.</p>
               <p>First, You make a Plea for <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> (not once
named in my Discourse) <hi>That they must be allowed a
sense of Religion, as well as Ministers; that they


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50044:29"/>
have the body, though not the cloak of Religion, and
are masters of your own reason.</hi> But do you consider
with your self, who it is that speaks these words,
and to whom you speak them. Do you indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that <hi>Gentlemen</hi> should have such a sense of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and make use of their reason in the choice of
that, which therein they adhere unto, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?
Is this pretence consistent with your Plea in
your <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> wherein you labour to reduce them
to a naked <hi>fanaticall Credo?</hi> Or is it your interest
to court them with fine words, though your intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be far otherwise? But we in <hi>England</hi> like not
such proceedings.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</l>
                     <l>

                        </gap>.</l>
                  </q>
Nothing dislikes us more than dissimulation. And
to whom do you speak? Did I, doth any Protestant
deny, that Gentlemen may have? Do we not say,
they ought to have their sense in Religion, and their
senses exercised therein? Do we deny they ought to
improve their reason, in being conversant about it?
Are these the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
of that of <hi>England?</hi> Do we not press them unto
these things, as their principall duty in this world?
Do we disallow or forbid them any means, that may
tend to their furtherance in the knowledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion? Where is it, that if they do but
look upon a Bible,
<q>
                     <l>—Furiarummaxima juxta</l>
                     <l>Accubat, &amp; manibus prohibet contingere mentes.</l>
                  </q>
The Inquisitor lays hold upon them, and bids them
be contented with a <hi>Rosary,</hi> or our Ladies Psalter?
Do we hinder or disswade them from any Studies,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50044:29"/>
or the use of Books, that may encrease their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and improve their reason? And hath not
the Papacy felt the fruits and effects of these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
in the writings of Kings, Princes, Noblemen,
and Gentlemen, of all sorts? And do not you your
self know all this to be true? And is it ingenuous to
insist on contrary insinuations? Or do you think that
truly generous Spirits will stoop to so poor a lure?
But you proceed: <hi>This is one difference between Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Countreys and ours, that there the Clergy man
is only regarded for his vertue, and the power he hath
received, or is at least believed to have received from
God, in the great Ministery of our Reconciliation;
and if he have any addition of learning besides, it is
looked upon as a good accidentall ornament, but not as
any essentiall complement of his profession; so that it
often happens without any wonderment at all, that the
Gentleman-Patron is the learned man, and the Priest
his Chaplain, of little or no science in comparison.
But here in</hi> England <hi>our Gentlemen are disparaged by
their own black Coats, and not suffered to use their
judgement in any kind of learning, without a gibe from
them. The Gentleman is reasonless, and the scribling
Cassock is the only Scholar; he alone must speak all,
know all, and only understand.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if your Clergy
were respected only for their vertue, they would not
be over burthened with their honour, unless they
have much mended their manners, since all the world
publickly complained of their lewdness, and which
in many places the most would do so still, did they
not judge the evil remediless. And if the state of
things be in your <hi>Catholick Countreys,</hi> between the
<hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> as you inform us, I fear it is not
from the learning of the one, but the ignorance of
the other. And this you seem to intimate, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50044:30"/>
                  <hi>learning</hi> from being any <hi>essentiall</hi> comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their profession, wherein you do wisely,
and what you are necessitated to do; for those who
are acquainted with them, tell us, that if it were,
you would have a very thin Clergy left you, very
many of them not understanding the very Mass Book,
which they daily chaunt, and therefore almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
word in your <hi>Missalc Romanum</hi> is <hi>accented,</hi> that
they may know how aright to pronounce them,
which yet will not deliver them from that mistake of
him, who instead of <hi>Introibo ad altare Dei,</hi> read con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
<hi>Introibo ad tartara Dei.</hi> Herein we envy
not the condition of your <hi>Catholick Countreys;</hi> and
though we desire our Gentry were more learned than
they are, yet neither we, nor they, could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to have our Ministers ignorant, so that they
might be in veneration for that Office sake, which
they are no way able to discharge. As to what you
affirm concerning <hi>England,</hi> and our usage here, in
the close of your Discourse, it is so utterly devoid of
truth and honesty, that I cannot but wonder at your
open regardlesness of them. Should you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
these things in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> (where you have
made pictures of Catholicks put in Bears skins, and
torn with Dogs in <hi>England,</hi> (<hi>Eccles. Ang. Troph.</hi>)
concerning <hi>England,</hi> and the manners of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof, you might have hoped to have met
with some, so partially addicted unto your faction
and interest, as to suppose there were some colour of
truth in what you averre. But to write these things
here amongst us, in the face of the Sun, where every
one that casts an eye upon them, will detest your
confidence, and laugh at your folly, is a course of
proceeding not easie to be paraleled.</p>
               <p>I shall not insist on the particulars, there being


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50044:30"/>
not one word of truth in the whole, but leave you to
the discipline of your own thoughts,
<q>Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum.</q>
And so I have done with your Prefatory Discourse,
wherein you have made it appear, with what reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of God, and love to the Truth, you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the great concernments of the souls of men.
What in particular you except against in the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi>
I shall now proceed to the consideration of.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Vindication of the first Chapter of the Animadversions.

agreeable unto Truth, according unto your own
Principles. It was ever granted, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>;
but alwayes to fail, and faigne at pleasure,
was never allowed so much as to <hi>Poets.</hi> Men may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
utter many things untrue, wherein yet some
principles which they are perswaded to be agreeable
unto Truth, or some more generall mistakes from
whence their particular assertions proceed, may
countenance their consciences from a sense of guilt,
and some way shield their reputation from the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of censure: But willingly and often for a man
practically to offend in this kind, when his mind and
understanding is not imposed upon by any previous
mistakes, is a miscarriage, which I do not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the subtilest of your <hi>Casuists</hi> have found


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50044:31"/>
out an excuse for. Two Exceptions you lay against
this Chapter, in the first whereof, by not speaking
the whole Truth, you render the whole untruth;
and in the latter you plainly affirm that which your
eyes told you to be otherwise, First you say, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a dilemma unto you <hi>for saying you had concealed
your method;</hi> when what I spake unto you was upon
your saying, first that you had <hi>used no method,</hi> and
afterwards that you had <hi>concealed your method;</hi> as
you also in your next words here confess. Now
both these being impossible, and severally spoken by
you, only to serve a present turn, your sorry mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
about the <hi>Scholler and his eggs,</hi> will not free
your self from being very ridiculous. Certainly this
using <hi>no method,</hi> and yet at the same time <hi>concealing
your method,</hi> is part of that <hi>civil Logick</hi> you have
learned no man knows where: You had farre better
hide your weaknesses under an universall silence, as
you do to the most of them, than expose them afresh
unto publick contempt, trimmed up with froth and
trifles. But this is but one of the least of your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapes;
you proceed to downright work in your
following words; <hi>Going on you deny</hi> (say you) <hi>that
Protestants ever opposed the merit of Good works;
which at first I wondred at, seeing the sound of it hath
rung so often in my own ears, and so many hundred
Books written in this last Age so apparently witness it
in all places, till I found afterwards in my thorow per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall
of your Book, that you neither heed what you say,
nor how much you deny; at last giving a distinction of
the intrinsick acceptability of our works, the easier to
silence me, you say as I say.</hi> Could any man, not
acquainted with you, ever imagin, but that had
denied that <hi>ever Protestants opposed the merit of Good
works;</hi> you positively affirm I did so; you pretend


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50044:31"/>
to transcribe my own words; you wonder why I
should say so; you produce testimony to disprove
what I say, and yet all this while you know well
enough that I never <hi>said</hi> so: have a little more care,
if not of your <hi>Conscience,</hi> yet of your <hi>Reputation;</hi> for
seriously if you proceed in this manner, you will lose
the common Priviledge of being <hi>believed</hi> when you
speak truth. Your words in your <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> p. 15.
ed. 2. are, that <hi>our Ministers cull out various Texts</hi>
(<hi>out of the Epistle of</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Romans) <hi>against
the Christian doctrine of Good works, and their merit;</hi>
wherein you plainly distinguish between the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine of Good works, and their merit, as
well you may; I tell you <hi>pag.</hi> 25, 26 that <hi>no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
ever opposed the Christian Doctrine of Good
Works.</hi> Here you <hi>repeat</hi> my words as you pretend,
and say, that I deny <hi>that any Protestant ever opposed
the Merit of Good works;</hi> and fall into a <hi>fained won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment</hi>
at mee, for saying that which you knew
well enough I <hi>never</hi> said: For <hi>Merit</hi> is not the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
but rather as by you explained, the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Doctrine</hi> of Good works, as being perfectly
<hi>Anti-Evangelicall.</hi> What <hi>Merit</hi> you will esteem
this <hi>Good work</hi> of yours to have, I know not, and
have in part intimated what truely it doth deserve.
But you adde, that <hi>making a distinction of the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
acceptability of works, you say as I say:</hi> What is
that I pray? do I say, that <hi>Protestants oppose the
Christian Doctrine of Good Works,</hi> as you say, in your
<hi>Fiat;</hi> or do I say, that they <hi>never opposed the Merit</hi>
of <hi>Good works,</hi> as you fain me to say in your <hi>Epistle?</hi>
neither the one nor the other: but I say that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
teach the <hi>Christian Doctrine of Good works,</hi> as
revealed in the Gospell, and oppose the <hi>Merit of
Good works,</hi> by you invented, and as by you explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50044:32"/>
and now avowed. And whilest you talk at this
rate, as if you were perfectly <hi>innocent,</hi> you begin
your <hi>story</hi> as if you had nothing to do but to accuse
another of fraud, like him that cried,
<q>
                     <l>—Nec si me miserum fortuna Sinonem</l>

                  </q>
when you know what his business was. But the truth
is, when you talk of the <hi>merit of Good works,</hi> you stand
in a slippery place, and know not well what you
would have, nor what it is that you would have me
believe. Your <hi>Tridentine Convention</hi> hath indeed
provided a limber <hi>Cothurnus</hi> to fit if it were possible
your severall statures and postures. But generall
words are nothing but the proportion of a <hi>Cirque</hi> or
<hi>Arena</hi> for <hi>Dogmatists</hi> to contend within the limits of.
The Antient <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> importance of the word
<hi>Merit,</hi> wherein as it may be proved by numberless
instances, it denoted no more than <hi>to obtain,</hi> you
have the most of you, rejected, and do urge it in a
strict <hi>Legall</hi> sense, denoting working <hi>for a reward,</hi>
and performing that which is proportionable unto it,
as the labour of the Hireling is to his wages, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto the strict Rules of Justice. See your <hi>Rhem.
An.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. So is the judgment I think
of your Church explained by <hi>Suarez,</hi> Tom. 1. in
Thom. 3. d. 41. <hi>A Supernaturall work,</hi> saith he, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from Grace in its self, and in its own nature,
hath a proportion unto, and condignity of the reward,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of sufficient value, to be worth the same.</hi> And you
seem to be of the same opinion in owning that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Merit,</hi> which Protestants reject, which I
gave in my <hi>Animadversions;</hi> namely <hi>an intrinsecall
worth and value in works arising from the exact an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerableness
unto the Law, and proportion unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50044:32"/>
so as on the Rules of Justice to deserve it.</hi> Of
the same mind are most of you; See <hi>Andrad. Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.
Explic.</hi> lib. 6. <hi>Bagus de Merit. Op. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.
Though I can assure you, <hi>Paul</hi> was not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.
<hi>Ch.</hi> 8. 18. so that you must not take it ill, If <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
oppose this Doctrine, with Testimonies out of
his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as well as out of many
other portions of the holy Writ; for they look upon
it as an opinion perfectly <hi>destructive</hi> of the Covenant
of Grace. Nay I must tell you, that some of your
own Church and way, love not to talk at this high
and lofty rate. <hi>Ferus</hi> speaks plain unto you on <hi>Mat.</hi>
20. <hi>If you desire to hold the Grace and favour of God,
make no mention of your own merits. Durand</hi> slicks
not to call the opinion which you seem to espouse,
<hi>temerarious,</hi> yea <hi>blasphemous,</hi> Quest. 2. d. 27. In the
<hi>explication</hi> of your distinction of <hi>congruity</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity,</hi>
how wofully are you divided? as also in the
<hi>application</hi> of it? there is no end of your altercations
about it; the termes of it being <hi>horrid, uncouth,</hi>
strangers to Scripture and the antient Church, of an
<hi>arbitrary</hi> signification, about which men may with
probabilities contend to the worlds end, and yet
the very soul and life of your Doctrine of <hi>Merit</hi> lies
in it. Some ascribe Merit of <hi>Congruity</hi> to works <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Condignity</hi> to them done in a state
of Grace; some, <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Congruity</hi> to them, done
by Grace, and Merit of <hi>Condignity</hi> they utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:
Some give <hi>Grace</hi> and the <hi>Promise</hi> a place in
<hi>Merit;</hi> some so explain it, that they can have no
place at all therein. Generally in your Books of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi>
when you have to do with <hi>God,</hi> you begin
to bethink your selves, and speak much more humbly
and modestly, than you do when you endeavour to
<hi>dispute subtilly</hi> and quell your Adversaries, And I am


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50044:33"/>
not without hope, that many of you do <hi>personally</hi>
believe as to your own particular <hi>concernments,</hi> far
better than when you <hi>doctrinally</hi> express your selves,
when you contend with us: As when that famous
Emperour <hi>Charles the fist,</hi> after all his bustles in and
about Religion, came to <hi>die</hi> in his retirement, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
renounced all <hi>merit of works,</hi> as a proud sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and gave up himself to the <hi>sole Grace</hi> and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God in Jesus Christ, on whose purchase of
Heaven for him, he alone relied. <hi>Toto pectori in Deum

Words worthy of a lasting memory, which they will
not fail of where they are recorded. <hi>Casting himself,</hi>
saith that excellent <hi>Historian, with his whole soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, he thus reasoned; That for his part he was
on the account of any merits of his own, unworthy to
obtain the Kingdom nf Heaven; but his Lord and
God, who hath a double right unto it, one by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of his Father, the other by the merit of his own
passion, contented himself with the one, granted the
other unto him; by whose grant, he rightly (or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly)
laid claim thereunto; and resting in this


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50044:33"/>
faith or confidence, he was not confounded; for the oyl
of mercy is not powred but into the vessel of faith: this
is the faith or confidence of a man fainting or despairing
in himself, and resting on his Lord; and otherwise to
trust to our own merits, is not an act of faith but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
or perfidiousness; that sins are forgiven by the
mercy of God, and that therefore we ought to believe
that sins cannot be blotted out or forgiven, but by him
against whom we have sinned, who sinneth not, and by
whom alone our sins are pardoned.</hi> This S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is the faith
of <hi>Protestants</hi> in reference unto the <hi>merit of
works,</hi> which that Wise and Mighty <hi>Emperour,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all his <hi>Military</hi> actings against them, found the
only safe Anchor for his soul in <hi>extremis,</hi> his only
relief against crying out with <hi>Hadrian</hi>

The only <hi>Antidote</hi> against <hi>despair,</hi> the only stay of a
soul when once entring the <hi>lists</hi> of Eternity. And I
am perswaded, that many of <hi>you</hi> fix on the same
<hi>Principles,</hi> as to your hope and expectation of Life
and Immortality. And to what purpose, I pray you,
do you trouble the world with an <hi>opinion,</hi> wherein
you can find no <hi>benefit,</hi> when, if <hi>true</hi> you should
principally expect to be relieved and supported by
it. But he that looks to find <hi>solid peace</hi> and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this world, or a blessed entrance into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
on any other grounds than those expressed by
that dying <hi>Emperour,</hi> will find himself deceived.
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you will one day find, that our <hi>own works</hi> or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
Purgatory, the sufferage of your Church, or


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50044:34"/>
any parts of it, when we are dead, the <hi>surplussage</hi>
of the works or merits of other sinners, are <hi>pitifull
things</hi> to come into competition with the blood of
Christ, and pardoning-Mercy in him. I confess, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>
made a shift to destroy <hi>Constantine</hi> who was
confessor to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and assisted him unto his
departure. And King <hi>Philip</hi> took care that his Son
<hi>Charles</hi> should not live in the faith wherein his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Charles</hi> died; whereby <hi>Merit,</hi> or our own
Righteousness, prevailed at <hi>Court:</hi> but, as I said, I
am perswaded that when many of you are in cold
blood, and think more of <hi>God</hi> than of <hi>Protestants,</hi>
and of your <hi>last</hi> account than of your <hi>present</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
you begin to believe that Mercy and the
Righteousness of Christ will be a <hi>better plea,</hi> as to
your own particular concernments at the last day.
Seeing therefore that <hi>Protestants</hi> teach the <hi>necessity</hi>
of Good works upon the cogent Principles I minded
you of in my <hi>Animadversions,</hi> I suppose it might not
be amiss in you to surcease from troubling them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their <hi>Merit,</hi> which few of you are <hi>agreed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and which, as I would willingly hope, none of
you dare <hi>trust</hi> unto. You have, I suppose, been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before now of the conclusion made in this matter
by your great Champion <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> lib. 5. <hi>de Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat.</hi>
cap. 7. <hi>Propter</hi> (saith he) <hi>incertitudinem propriae

                     </gap>igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
reponere: Because of the uncertainty of our own
righteousness, and the danger of vain-glory, it is the</hi>
Safest course <hi>to place all our confidence in the alone
mercy and benignity of God:</hi> Wherein, if I mistake not,
he disclaimeth all that he had subtilly disputed before
about the merit of Works; and he appears to have
been in good earnest in this conclusion; seeing he


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50044:34"/>
made such use of it himself in particular, at the close
of all his Disputes and Dayes; praying in his last
Will and Testament, That God would deal with him,
not as <hi>aestimator meriti,</hi> a Judg of his merit, but
<hi>largitor veniae</hi> a mercifull Pardoner; <hi>Vit. Bell. per
Sylvestr, à Pet. San. Impress. Antuerpiae</hi> 1631. And
why is this the <hi>safest</hi> course? certainly it must be,
because God hath appointed it and revealed it so to
be; for on no other ground can any course towards
Heaven be accounted safe. And if this be the way
of his appointment, that we should trust to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
alone in Christ Jesus; let them that will be so
minded, notwithstanding all perswasions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
as to trust to their own merit, take heed lest
they find when it is too late, that they have steered a
course not so safe as they expected. And so I desire
your excuse for this Diversion, the design of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only to discover one reason of your <hi>failing</hi>
in morality, in affirming mee to have said that
which you knew well enough I did not; which is
this, that you stood in a slippery place as to
the <hi>point of faith</hi> which you were asserting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not instructed how to speak constantly and
evenly unto it. And to take you off from that <hi>vain
confidence,</hi> which this proud opinion of the <hi>Merit
of works,</hi> is apt to ingenerate in you; whose first
Inventours, I fear, did nor sufficiently consider with
whom they had to doe, before whom sinners
appearing in their own strength and Righteousness
will one day cry, <hi>Who amongst us shall dwell with
devouring fire, who amongst us shall inhabit with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
burnings?</hi> not the purity, perfection and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his <hi>fiery Law,</hi> judging, condemning, cursing
<hi>every</hi> sinner for every sinne, without the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of mercy or compassion; if you would but


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50044:35"/>
seriously consider, how impossible it is for any man
to know all his <hi>secret sinnes,</hi> or to make compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God for the <hi>least of them</hi> that he doth know,
and that the very <hi>best of his works</hi> come short of that
<hi>universal perfection</hi> which is required in them, so
that he dares not put the issue of his <hi>eternal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
upon any one of them <hi>singly,</hi> though all the rest
of his life should be put into everlasting <hi>oblivion;</hi>
and withall would diligently enquire into the <hi>end</hi> of
God in giving his Son to die for sinners, with the
<hi>mystery</hi> of his Love and Grace therein, the nature of
the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the Importance of the Promises
thereof, the weight that is layed in Scripture on the
<hi>Righteousness and blood of Christ</hi> with the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

               <p>IN the same <hi>page,</hi> you proceed to the consideration
of my <hi>second Chapter;</hi> and therein of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which I gathered out of your <hi>Fiat Lux;</hi> and
which I affirmed, to <hi>run through</hi> and to animate
your whole Discourse, and to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
on which your Superstructure is built. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them all, you say, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. <hi>that in the sense
the words do either naturally make out, or in which I
understand them, of all the whole you can hardly own
any one.</hi> Pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, remember that I never pretended
to set down <hi>your words,</hi> but to express <hi>your sense</hi> in
my own. And if I do not make it appear, that there
is no <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> mentioned, which you have
not (in the sense by me declared) affirmed, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted;
I will be contented to be thought to have
done you <hi>some</hi> wrong, and my self <hi>much more,</hi> for
want of attending unto that <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> which I
am compelled so often to desire you to give up your
self unto the conduct of.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Principle</hi> imputed unto your <hi>Fiat Lux</hi>
is, <hi>That we received the Gospell first from</hi> Rome. To
which you say, <hi>Wee, that is we English men, received
it first from thence.</hi> Well then, this is one Principle
of the <hi>Ten;</hi> this you own and seek to defend, If you
do so in reference unto any other, what will become
of your <hi>hardly one that you can own?</hi> You have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<hi>one foot</hi> over the limits which you have newly


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50044:36"/>
prescribed your self; and we shall find you utterly <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking</hi>
of them by and by. For the present you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto the defence of this <hi>Principle</hi> and say, <hi>But
against this you reply, that we received it not first from</hi>
Rome, <hi>but by</hi> Joseph <hi>of</hi> Arimathea <hi>from</hi> Palestine, <hi>as</hi>
Fiat Lux <hi>himself acknowledgeth: S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>say
both these things, he cannot mean them in your false
contradictory sense, but in his own true one, Wee, that
is, wee Englishmen, the now actuall inhabitants of this
Land and progeny of the Saxons, received first our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
and Christendome from</hi> Rome, <hi>though the Brittans
that inhabited the Land before, differing as much from
us as Antipodes, had some of them been Christened long
before us, and yet the Christendome that prevailed and
lasted among the Brittans, even they also as well as we,
had it from</hi> Rome <hi>too; mark this likewise.</hi> This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
must be called <hi>over again</hi> afterwards, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall here be the more brief upon it. In my
first <hi>Answer,</hi> I shewed you not only that your posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not <hi>true;</hi> but also, that on supposition it
were <hi>so,</hi> it would not in the least advance your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Here you acknowledg that the <hi>Brittans</hi> at first
received not the Gospell from <hi>Rome;</hi> but reply two
things, first, <hi>that belongs not unto us Englishmen or
Saxons.</hi> To which I shall now only say, that if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Brittans</hi> have been <hi>conquered,</hi> we who are
now the inhabitants of <hi>Brittain,</hi> may not be thought
to have received the Gospell from them, from whom
the <hi>Brittans</hi> at first received it, seeing it was never
utterly extinct in <hi>Brittany</hi> from its first plantation,
then much less can the present inhabitants of the City
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath been conquered oftener than
<hi>Brittain,</hi> be thought to have received the Gospell
from them by whom it was first delivered unto the
old <hi>Romans.</hi> For though I confess that the <hi>Saxons,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50044:36"/>
Jutes,</hi> and <hi>Angles</hi> made great havock of the <hi>Antient
Brittans</hi> in some parts of this <hi>Island,</hi> yet was it not
comparable unto that which was made at <hi>Rome;</hi>
which at length <hi>Totilas,</hi> after it had been taken and
sacked more than once before, marching out of it
against <hi>Belisarius,</hi> left as desolate as a wilderness
without one living soul to inhabit it. <hi>Ipse</hi> (Totilas)

of</hi> Rome, <hi>all its Inhabitants being removed, was wholly
desolate, an unparallel'd reproach of humane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a spectacle of pity to the very enemies, though
most remote from all humanity!</hi> Tbe next inhabitants

Nations brought in by <hi>Belisarius:</hi> You may go

their being conquered by the <hi>Saxons;</hi> in the mean

of <hi>England,</hi> may not date their reception of
Christianity from the <hi>first</hi> planting of it in this <hi>Island,</hi>
as well as you suppose the present <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> may do theirs, from the time wherein it was
<hi>first</hi> preached unto the old <hi>Romans?</hi> But you except
again; <hi>that the Christendom that prevailed and lasted
among the</hi> Brittans <hi>before the coming of the</hi> Saxons,
<hi>came from</hi> Rome <hi>too; you bid me, mark that likewise.</hi>


                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50044:37"/>
I do consider what you <hi>say,</hi> and desire you to <hi>prove</hi>
it: wherein yet I will not be very urgent, because I
will not put you upon impossibilities; and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency
to give the least colour unto this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Assertion,</hi> shall be discovered in our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
progress. For the present, I shall only mind
you, that the Christianity which prevailed in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi>
was that which continued among the <hi>Brittans</hi>
in <hi>Wales,</hi> after the conquest of these parts of the
<hi>Island</hi> by the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and that, <hi>that</hi> came not from
<hi>Rome,</hi> is manifest from the <hi>customes</hi> which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and insisted on, differing from those of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and your refusall to <hi>admit</hi> those of that Church, the
story whereof you have in <hi>Beda lib. 2. cap.</hi> 2. I know,
it may be rationally replied, that <hi>Rome</hi> might, after
the time of the first preaching of the Gospell in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
have <hi>invented</hi> many new customs, which might
be strange unto the <hi>Brittans</hi> at the coming of <hi>Austin;</hi>
for indeed so they had done: but this exception will
here take no place; for the customes the <hi>Brittish</hi>
Church adhered unto, were such as having their
Rise and occasion in the <hi>East,</hi> were never <hi>admitted</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so from thence could not be <hi>transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
hither.</p>
               <p>But there were also other <hi>Exceptions</hi> put in, unto
your Application of this Principle unto your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
upon supposition that there were any Truth
in the <hi>matter of Fact</hi> asserted by you. For, suppose
that those who from beyond Sea first preached the
Gospell to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> came from <hi>Rome,</hi> yea were
sent by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> or if you please the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi>
I ask, whether it was <hi>his Religion,</hi> or the Religion of
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> that they brought with them? Did the
<hi>Pope</hi> first find it out? or did they publish it in the
name of the Pope? You say, <hi>It was the Popes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50044:37"/>
not invented but professed by him, and from him
derived unto us by his Missioners.</hi> Well, and what
more; for all this was before <hi>supposed</hi> in my enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and made the foundation of that which we sought
<hi>further</hi> after. I supposed the <hi>Pope</hi> professed the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which he sent; and your Courtly expression
<hi>derived unto us by his Missioners,</hi> is but the same in
sense and meaning with my homely phrase, <hi>they that
preached it were sent by him.</hi> On this I enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were to be esteemed <hi>his</hi> Religion or no; that
is, any more <hi>his,</hi> than it is the Religion of every <hi>one</hi>
that professeth it; Or did those that were sent <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize</hi>
in his name, or teach us that the <hi>Pope</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for us? You answer, <hi>that he sent them to preach:</hi>
I see
<q>
                     <l>—Nil opus est te</l>
                     <l>Circumagi, quendam volo visere non tibi notum.</l>
                  </q>
you understand not what I enquire after; but if that
be all you have to say, as it was <hi>before</hi> supposed, so
what matter is it, I pray, who <hi>planted,</hi> and who <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;</hi>
it was the Religion of <hi>Christ</hi> that was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and God that <hi>gave the encrease:</hi> Christ liveth
still, his Word abideth still, but the <hi>planters</hi> and
<hi>waterers</hi> are dead long ago. Again, What though
we received the Gospell from <hi>Rome?</hi> doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
follow, that we received all the Doctrines of
the <hi>present Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at the same time? Pope
<hi>Gregory</hi> knew little of the present <hi>Romane</hi> Doctrine
about the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> What was broached of it, he
condemned in another, (even <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
who fasted for a kind of <hi>Popedome,</hi>) and professed
himself an obedient servant to his <hi>good Lord</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
Many a good Doctrine hath been lost at
<hi>Rome</hi> since those old dayes, and many a <hi>new fancy</hi>
broached, and many a <hi>tradition</hi> of men taught


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50044:38"/>
for a doctrine of truth.

is that to the present <hi>Roman</hi> carnall confederacy?
If then any in this Nation did receive their Religion
from <hi>Rome,</hi> as many of the <hi>Saxons</hi> had Christianity
declared unto them, by some sent from <hi>Rome</hi> for
that purpose; yet it doth not at all follow, that they

And this sad alteration, <hi>declension,</hi> and change, we
may bewail in her, as the Prophet did the like apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
in the Church of the Jews of old, <hi>How is the
faithfull City become an harlot? it was full of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixt with water.</hi>
He admires that it <hi>should</hi> be so; was not ignorant
<hi>how</hi> it became so; no more are others in reference
unto your Apostacy.</p>
               <p>And what if we had received from <hi>you,</hi> or by your
means, the Religion that is now professed at <hi>Rome,</hi>
I mean the whole of it; yet we might have received
that with it, namely the <hi>Bible,</hi> which would have
made it our duty, to <hi>examine, try,</hi> and reject any
thing in it, for which we saw from thence just cause


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50044:38"/>
so to do; unless we should be <hi>condemned</hi> for that,
for which the <hi>Bereans</hi> are so highly <hi>commended.</hi> So
that neither is your Position <hi>true,</hi> nor if it
were so would it at all <hi>advantage</hi> your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>I
adde also, <hi>Did not the Gospel come from another
place to</hi> Rome, <hi>as well as to us, or, was it first preached
there?</hi> This you have culled out, as supposing your
self able to say something unto it; and what is it?
<hi>Properly speaking, it came not so to</hi> Rome, <hi>as it came
to us: for one of the twelve fountains, nay two of the
thirteen, and those the largest and greatest, were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to</hi> Rome, <hi>which they watered with their blood.
We had never any such standing fountain of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion here, but only a stream derived unto us
from thence.</hi> It is the hard hap it seems of <hi>England,</hi>
to claim any priviledge or reputation, that may stand
in the way of some mens designs. No <hi>Apostle,</hi> nor
<hi>Apostolicall</hi> Person, must be allowed to preach the
Gospel unto us, lest we should <hi>peirk</hi> up into compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with <hi>Rome.</hi> But though <hi>Rome</hi> it seems must
alwayes be excepted, yet I hope you do not in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conclude our condition <hi>beneath</hi> that of any place,
where the Gospel at first was preached, by <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two
Apostles,</hi> so as to cry, <hi>Properly speaking, it came not
to us at all.</hi> What think you of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where
Christ himself and his twelve Apostles all of them
preached the Gospel? Or what think you of <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi>
that was <hi>lifted up to Heaven,</hi> in the priviledge
of the means of light granted for a while unto them?
Do you think our condition worse than theirs? The
<hi>two fountains</hi> you mention, were opened at <hi>Antioch</hi>
in <hi>Syria,</hi> as well as at other places, before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
one <hi>drop</hi> of their treasures to <hi>Rome;</hi> which
whether one of them ever did by his <hi>personall</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50044:39"/>
is very questionable. And by this Rule of
yours, though <hi>England</hi> may not, yet every place
where S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and St <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Gospel, may
contend with <hi>Rome</hi> as to this priviledge. And what
will you then get by your trumphing over us? <hi>Non
vides id manticae quòd à tergo est:</hi> When men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon a <hi>supposed advantage,</hi> they oftentimes
overlook <hi>reall inconveniencies</hi> that lye ready to seize
upon them, as it befalls you more than once. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
there is nothing in the world more obscure,
than by <hi>whom,</hi> or by <hi>what</hi> means the Gospel was first
preached at <hi>Rome:</hi> By S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> it is certain it was <hi>not:</hi>
for before ever he came thither, there was a great
number converted to the faith, as appears from his
<hi>Epistle,</hi> written about the <hi>fourteenth</hi> year of <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and the <hi>fifty third</hi> of Christ. Nor yet by <hi>Peter;</hi>
for not at present to insist on the great incertainty
whether <hi>ever</hi> he was there or no, which shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
be spoken unto, there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
than that about the sixth year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and
fourty fifth of Christ, he was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Gal. 2.
(<hi>Baronius</hi> makes the third of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the
fourty fifth of Christ to <hi>contemporize,</hi> but upon a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake)
and some say he abode there a good while,
<hi>sundry years,</hi> and that upon as good authority, as
any is produced for his coming to <hi>Rome.</hi> But it is
generally granted, that there was a Church founded
at <hi>Rome</hi> that year, but by whom, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
(as <hi>Socrates</hi> said of the preference of the
condition of the living or dead) <hi>is known to God
alone, of mortall men not to any: Jam sumus ergo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
For, to confess the truth unto you, I know not
certainly who first preached the Gospel in <hi>Brittain;</hi>
some say <hi>Peter,</hi> some <hi>Paul,</hi> some <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi>
most <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as I have elsewhere shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50044:39"/>
by whom certainly I know not: but some <hi>one</hi> it
was or more, whom God sent upon his <hi>arrand,</hi> and
with his message. No more do you know who
preached it first at <hi>Rome,</hi> though in generall it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that some of them at least were of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
whence the very first <hi>Converts</hi> of that Church,
were variously minded about the observation of
<hi>Mosaicall</hi> Rites and Ceremonies. And I doubt not
but God in his infinitely holy <hi>wisdome</hi> and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
left the <hi>springs</hi> of Christian Religion, as to
matter of fact, in the first introductions of it into the
Nations of the world, in so much <hi>darkness,</hi> as to the
knowledge of after-times, to obviate those towring
<hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>preheminency,</hi> which he foresaw that
some men from externall <hi>advantages</hi> would entertain,
to the no small prejudice of the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and ruine of Christian humility. As far as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from Story; the Gospel was preached in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
before any Church was founded at <hi>Rome:</hi> It
was so, saith <hi>Gildas, Summo tempore Tiberii Caesaris,</hi>
that is, <hi>extremo;</hi> about the end of the raigh of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Caesar,</hi> who died in the thirty ninth year of
Christ, five or six years at least before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church were layed; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
These things we must speak unto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you suppose them of importance unto your
Cause.</p>
               <p>The second Assertion ascribed unto your <hi>Fiat</hi> in
the <hi>Animadversions</hi> is, <hi>That whence and from whom
we first received our Religion, there and with them we
must abide therein, to them we must repair for guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and return to their rule and conduct, if we have
departed from them.</hi> To which you now say, <hi>This
Principle as it is never delivered by</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>though
you put it upon me, so is it in the latitude it carries,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50044:40"/>
and wherein you understand it, absolutely false, never
thought of by me, and indeed impossible: For how can
we abide with them in any truth, who may not perhaps
abide in it themselves? Great part of</hi> Flanders <hi>was
first converted by English men, and yet are they not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to accompany the English in our now present wayes.</hi>
I am glad you confess this Principle now to be <hi>false;</hi>
it was sufficiently proved so to be in the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
and your whole <hi>Discourse</hi> rendred thereby use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
For to what purpose will the preceding Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so often incuicated by you serve, if this be <hi>false?</hi>
For what matter is it from <hi>whence</hi> or <hi>whom</hi> were<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the profession of Religion, if there be no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon us to <hi>continue</hi> in their communion, any
further than as we judge them to <hi>continue</hi> in the
truth? And to what purpose do you avoid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Causes</hi> of our not abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with you, and manage all your Charge upon
the generall head of our <hi>departure,</hi> if we may have
just cause by your own concession so to do? It is <hi>false</hi>
then by your own acknowledgement, and I am as

<hi>yours.</hi> And you labour with all your art to prove
and confirm it, both in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> pag. 44, 45, 46,

On the account that the Gospel came unto us from
<hi>Rome,</hi> you expresly adjudge the <hi>preheminence</hi> over us
unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and determine that her we must all hear,
and obey, and <hi>abide</hi> with. But if you may <hi>say</hi> and
<hi>unsay,</hi> assert and deny, avow and disclaim at your
pleasure, as things make for your advantage, and
think to evade the owning of the whole <hi>drift</hi> and
scope of your Discourse, by having expressed your
self in a <hi>loose</hi> flourish of words; it will be to no great
purpose further to talk with you:

               <p>THe third Assertion which you review is, <hi>That
the Roman profession of Religion, and practice in
the worship of God, are every way the same as when first
we received the Gospel from</hi> Rome, <hi>nor can they ever
otherwise be;</hi> whereunto you say, <hi>This indeed though
I do no where formally express it, yet I suppose it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I know it hath been demonstratively proved a
hundred times over. You deny it hath been proved,
why do you not then disprove it? because you decline,
say you, all common places.</hi> All that I affirmed was,
that you did suppose this <hi>Principle,</hi> and built many
of your <hi>Inferences</hi> on the supposition thereof, which
you here acknowledge. And so you have already
owned <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Principles,</hi> whereof in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Page you affirmed, that <hi>you could hardly own any
one,</hi> and that in the sense wherein by me they are
proposed and understood. But what do you mean
that you no <hi>where formally express it?</hi> If you mean,
that you have not set it down in those <hi>syllables,</hi>
wherein you find it expressed in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi>
no man ever said you did; you do not use to speak so


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50044:41"/>
openly and plainly: To do so would bring you out
of the <hi>corners,</hi> which somewhat that you pretend
unto never lead you into. But if you deny, that
you asserted and laboured to prove the <hi>whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
matter</hi> of it, your following Discourse wherein
you endeavour a vindication of the <hi>Sophisme,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you pleaded for it in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> will sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confute you. And so you have avowed already
<hi>two,</hi> of the <hi>hardly any one,</hi> Principles ascribed unto
you: And this you say hath been <hi>demonstratively
proved an hundred times over,</hi> and ask me why I do not
disprove it, giving a ridiculous Answer, as from
me, unto your Enquiry. But pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> talk not of
<hi>Demonstrations</hi> in this matter; palpable <hi>Sophismes,</hi>
such as your Masters use in this Cause, are far enough
from <hi>Demonstrations.</hi> And if you think it enough
for you to say, that <hi>it hath been proved,</hi> why is it not
a sufficient. Answer in me to remind you that it hath
<hi>been disproved,</hi> and your pretended proofs all refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And according to what Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> do
you expect <hi>Arguments</hi> from me to disprove your,
Assertion, whilest I was only answering yours that
you produced in its confirmation? But that you may
not <hi>complain</hi> any more, I shall make some addition
of the <hi>proofs</hi> you require by way of supererrogation,
when we have considered your vindication of your
former <hi>Arguments,</hi> for the confirmation of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
wherewith you closed your Discourse in
your <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> This you thus propose again, <hi>The
Roman was once a true flourishing Church, and if she
ever fell, she must fall either by Apostasie, Heresie, or
Schisme.</hi> So you now mince the matter; in your
<hi>Fiat</hi> it was <hi>a most pure flourishing and Mother Church;</hi>
and you know there are many that yet acknowledge
her a <hi>true Church,</hi> as a <hi>theif</hi> is a <hi>true man;</hi> who will


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50044:42"/>
not acknowledge her to be a <hi>pure</hi> Church, much less
<hi>most pure.</hi> God be mercifull to poor worms, this
boasting doth not become us; it is not unlike hers
who cryed, <hi>Is it as a Queen and shall see no sorrow;</hi>
I wish you begin to be sensible and ashamed of it:
But yet I fear it is otherwise; for whereas in your
<hi>Fiat</hi> you had proclaimed your <hi>Roman Church</hi> and
Party, to be <hi>absolutely innocent and unblameable,</hi>
you tell us <hi>pag.</hi> 10. of your Epistle, that you can make
it appear that it is <hi>far more innocent and amiable than
you have made it;</hi> more than <hi>absolutely innocent</hi> it
seems, a note so <hi>high</hi> that it sounds harshly. And
whereas we shall manifest your Church to have lost
her <hi>native beauty,</hi> we know that no <hi>painting</hi> of her,
which is all you can do, will render her truly <hi>amiable</hi>
unto a spirituall eye: She hath too often defiled her
self, to pretend now to be lovely. But to this you
say I reply, <hi>The Church that then was in the Apostles
time was indeed true, not the Roman Church that now
is;</hi> and adde, <hi>So, so, then I say that former true
Church must fall sometime or other, when did she fall,
and how did the sall by Apostasie, Heresie, or Schisme.</hi>
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you very lamely represent my <hi>Answer,</hi> that you
might seem to say something unto it, when indeed
you say nothing at all. I discover unto you the
<hi>equivocation</hi> you use in that expression, the <hi>Church
of Rome,</hi> and shew you that the <hi>thing</hi> now so called
by you, had neither <hi>being</hi> nor name, neither <hi>essence</hi>
nor affection in the dayes of old; its very being is but
the <hi>terminus as quem,</hi> of a Churches fall. I shewed
you also, that the Church of old that was <hi>pure,</hi> fell,
not whilest it was so, but that the men who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the place, where they lived in the profession of
Religion, <hi>gradually</hi> fell from the purity of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which the Church at its first planting did


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50044:42"/>
enjoy. But all that discourse you <hi>pass</hi> by, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
again your <hi>former</hi> Question, to which you sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
my first Answer, which was, it was possible
she might <hi>fall by an Earthquake,</hi> as did those of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse
and Laodicea;</hi> to which you, <hi>We speak not here
of any casuall or naturall downfall, or death of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
by Plague, Famine, or Earthquake, but a morall
and voluntary lapse in faith. What do you speak to
me of Earthquakes?</hi> It is well you do <hi>so</hi> now explain
your self; your former enquiry was only in generall,
<hi>how</hi> or by <hi>what means</hi> she ceased to be what she had
been before, as though it were impossible to assign
any such; neither did I exclude the <hi>sense</hi> whereunto
you now restrain your words. And had I only
shewed you, that it was <hi>possible</hi> she might fall, and
come to nothing, and yet not by any of the wayes or
means by you mentioned, without proceeding unto
the consideration of them also, yet your <hi>especiall</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
being resolved into this <hi>generall</hi> one, from
whence it is taken, how a <hi>pure flourishing Church may
cease to be so,</hi> I had rendred your enquiry <hi>useless</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your present purpose, though I had not answered
your intention: For certainly that which ceaseth to
<hi>be,</hi> ceaseth to <hi>be pure,</hi> seeing <hi>non entis nullae sunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiones.</hi>

And to tell you the truth, I do not think the
old Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unconcerned in this instance,
then especially when <hi>Rome</hi> was left desolate by <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
and without inhabitant; for the Church of

Again, I told you she might fall by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
so neither by <hi>Apostasie Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schisme.</hi> To
which you reply, <hi>Good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Idolatry is a mixt misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
both in faith and manners; I speak of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
one of faith; and he that falls by Idolatry, if he
keep still some parts of Christianity entire, he falls by
Heresie, by Apostasie if he keep none.</hi> I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you are the first that ever gave this description of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the last that will do so; <hi>it is a mixt
misdemeanour in faith and manners. Manners</hi> you
speak of in contradistinction to <hi>Faith,</hi> and you so
explain your self, in which sense they relate only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>morall conversation,</hi> regulated by the <hi>second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
That <hi>Idolatry</hi> hath been and is constantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with <hi>corruption in manners,</hi> the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and I willingly grant; but how in
its self, or its own nature, it should come to be a
<hi>mixt misdemeanour in faith and in manners,</hi> I know
not; neither can you tell me which is the <hi>fleshy,</hi>
which is the <hi>fishy</hi> part of this <hi>Dagon;</hi> what it is in it
that is a misdemeanour in <hi>faith,</hi> and what in <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
According to this description of yours, an
<hi>Idolater</hi> should be an ill mannered, or an <hi>unmannerly
Heretick.</hi> But you speak of the <hi>single misdemeanour
in faith;</hi> but who gave you leave so to restrain your
enquiry? I allowed you before to except against <hi>one
instance,</hi> whereby many a Church hath fallen; but
if you will except <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> also, your
endeavour to provide a shelter for your guilt, is
<hi>shamefull</hi> and vain. For what you except out of
your enquiry, if you confess not to <hi>have</hi> been, yet
you do that it <hi>may</hi> be, or <hi>might</hi> have been: And you
do wisely to let your Adversary know, that he is to
strike you only where you suppose your self <hi>armed,</hi>
but by all means must let your <hi>naked</hi> parts alone; and


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50044:43"/>
doubtless he must needs be very wise who will take
your advice. The Church of <hi>Judah</hi> was once a <hi>pure</hi>
Church in the dayes of <hi>David;</hi> how came she then
to fall? by <hi>Apostasie Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schisme?</hi> I answer
if you will give me leave, she fell by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and
corruption of manners, against both which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were <hi>protestants,</hi> 2 King. 17. 13.—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>God protested</hi> against them by <hi>his Prophets.</hi> Again
the same Church reformed in the dayes of <hi>Ezra,
Nehemiah, Zerubbabel,</hi>—<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>the men of the Great Congregation,</hi> was a <hi>pure</hi>
Church; how did it <hi>fall?</hi> not by <hi>Idolatry</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but by <hi>corruption of life,</hi> unbelief, and rejecting
the Word of God for superstitious <hi>traditions,</hi> untill
it became a den of Thieves. You see then there are
other wayes of a Churches <hi>falling</hi> from its pristine
purity, than those by you insisted on. And if you
shall enquire how it <hi>may</hi> fall, you must exclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of your enquiry, whereby it <hi>may</hi> do so,
and whereby some Churches <hi>have done</hi> so. And if
you will have my thoughts in this matter, they are,
that the beginning of the <hi>fall</hi> of your Church and
many others, lay in <hi>unbelief,</hi> corruption of life,
conformity to the world, and other sins that were
found in the most of its members. And it is a fancy
to dream of the <hi>purity</hi> of a Church, in respect of its
outward order, when the <hi>power</hi> and life of godliness
is lost in its members; and a wicked device to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Church may not be separated from Christ by
<hi>unbelief,</hi> whilest it abides in an externall profession
of the doctrine of faith. Such a Church though it
may <hi>have a name to live,</hi> yet indeed is <hi>dead,</hi> and
dead things are <hi>unclean.</hi> We speak of its <hi>purity</hi>
and <hi>acceptation</hi> thereon in the sight of God; neither
will men <hi>dead</hi> in trespasses and sins, be <hi>terrible unto


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50044:44"/>

those in <hi>Lucilius,</hi> who,

                     <l>Vt pueri infantes credunt signa omnia ahena</l>

                  </q>
as <hi>Lactantius</hi> reports him. But you say. <hi>If they fall
by Idolatry and yet keep any parts of Christianity, they
fall by Heresie.</hi> But why so? would you had thought
it incumbent on you to give a <hi>reason</hi> of what you say.
Are <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Heresie</hi> the same? <hi>Tertullian</hi> who
of all the old <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Writers most enlargeth
the bounds of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> defines it to be <hi>omnis circa
omne Idolum famulatus &amp; servitus; Any worship
or service performed in reference to, or about any Idoll.</hi>
I do not remember that ever I met with your defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in any Author whatever. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
seems to place it in <hi>Creaturum aeque colere ac
Deum to worship the creature as much or equally
with the Creator:</hi> which description of it, though it
be vain and groundless, for his <hi>aeque</hi> is neither in the
Scripture nor any approved Author of old required
to the constituting of the worship of any creature
<hi>Idolatrous,</hi> yet is not this <hi>Heresie</hi> neither, but that
which differs from it <hi>toto genere.</hi> We know it to be
<hi>cultus religiosus creaturae exhibitus, any religious
worship of that whish by nature is not God:</hi> and so doth
your <hi>Thomas</hi> grant it to be. <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your great <hi>Champions</hi> contends, that <hi>tanqnam
Deo, as unto God,</hi> is to be added unto the definition:
As though <hi>religious worship</hi> could be given unto <hi>any
thing,</hi> and not as <hi>unto God</hi> really and indeed, though
not intentionally as to the worshipper. Where a
man gives <hi>religious worship,</hi> there he doth <hi>ipso facto</hi>
assign a divine eminencie, say he what he will to the


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50044:44"/>
contrary: Neither will his intention of not doing it
<hi>as unto God,</hi> any more free him from Idolatry, than

wish you would advise with your <hi>Angelicall Doctor,</hi>

And you are in the same path still in the religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration

the greatest solemnities of Christianity amongst you,

Many Christians worship hee and shee Saints, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than they do God; neither do I see in many things
what difference there is between their opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Saints, and that which the Heathen thought of
their Gods.</hi> And it is known what <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi>
before him affirmed to the same purpose: Your Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
in the worship of <hi>Images</hi> of all sorts shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
declared. Be then this a <hi>single</hi> or <hi>mixt</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour
it matters not, a misdemeanour it is,
whereby we affirm that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is <hi>fallen</hi>
from its pristine purity. And this we think is a full
answer unto your enquiry. We <hi>need</hi> not, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
compell us to go one step farther. But our way


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50044:47"/>
is plain and invites us. I shall therefore proceed to
let you see once again that she is <hi>fallen</hi> by all the wayes
you thought meet to confine your enquiry unto.</p>
               <p>You proceed, <hi>finding your self puzled, in the third
place you lay on load, she fell say you, by Apostasie, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Heresie, Schisme, Licentiousness and prophaneness of
Life. And in this you do not much unlike the drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
youth, who being bid to hit his Masters finger with
his, when he perceived he could not do it, he ran his
whole fist against it.</hi> Seriously S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you have the worst
<hi>success</hi> in your Attempts for a little <hi>wit and merriment</hi>
that ever I met with. If you would take my advice,
you should not strain your <hi>Genius</hi> for that which it
will not affoard you: you forget the old rule,
<q>Tu nihil invita dies faciesve Minerva.</q>
Any other <hi>diversion</hi> were better than this which
proves so succesless: Yet I must confess you deserve
well of <hi>pastime,</hi> seeing to serve its <hi>interests</hi> you so
often make your self <hi>ridiculous,</hi> as you now do in
this pittifull story. And I cannot tell you whether
my Answer have <hi>touched your finger</hi> or no, but I am
sure, if it be true, it <hi>strikes</hi> your Cause to the <hi>heart;</hi>
and I am as sure of the Truth of it, as I am that I am
alive. And you see how I am <hi>pusled,</hi> even as he was
who cryed <hi>inopem me copia fecit.</hi> Your Church hath
<hi>fallen</hi> so many wayes, all so foully and evidently,
that it is hard for any man to <hi>chuse</hi> what instance to
insist upon, who is called on to <hi>charge</hi> her, as you
by your enquiry of them, do on your <hi>Protestant</hi>
Readers. And for my part, I had rather you should
take your <hi>choyce,</hi> against which of the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
you think your self best able to <hi>defend</hi> her.
And may it please you to chuse your <hi>Instance,</hi> if I
prove not your Church to have <hi>fallen</hi> by it, I will


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50044:47"/>
promise you to become a <hi>Papist.</hi> You proceed to
your own particulars, and ask, <hi>Did shee fall by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie:</hi>
to which you subjoyn my words, <hi>by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

in opposition to Heresie which is the partiall.</hi> I see you
have as little mind to be drawn to the consideration
of your <hi>Apostasie,</hi> as of your <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and would
fain post off all to <hi>Heresie,</hi> under a corrupt notion of
which <hi>terme,</hi> you hope to find some shelter for your

You must bear the charge of <hi>Apostasie</hi> also. For why
must that needs be the <hi>notion</hi> of these termes in the

or from the <hi>Scripturall</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> use
of them, or whence is it, that it <hi>must be</hi> so, and that it
<hi>is</hi> so? None of these will give you any <hi>relief,</hi> or the

                  </gap>, in themselves of an
<hi>indifferent</hi> signification, denoting things or acts, <hi>good</hi>
or <hi>evill,</hi> according to their accidentall limitations
and applications. It is said of some <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
<hi>they will depart from the faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. And
the same Apostle speaking of them that name the

                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. so that the

from anything, way, rule, or practice be it
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> wherein a man hath been ingaged, or
which he ought to avoid and fly from. And this is
the use of it in the best <hi>Greek</hi> Authors: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

are such in <hi>Homer</hi> who are <hi>farre distant</hi> or remote
on any account from any thing or place. And

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Aristotle</hi> things very remote.
To leave any place, company, thing, <hi>Society,</hi> or Rule,
on any cause, is the common use of the word in <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,
Plutarch, Lucian,</hi> and the rest of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
in the propriety of that language. <hi>Apostasia</hi>
by <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> writers, is restrained unto either
a back sliding in <hi>Faith subjective</hi> and manners, or a
<hi>causeless</hi> relinquishment of any Truth before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.
So the Jews charge <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 21. 21.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, a speciall
<hi>option, choyce,</hi> or way in profession of any Truth or
Error. So <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Pharisaisme</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
Act. 26. 5. the <hi>most exact heresie</hi> or way of
Religion <hi>among the Jews.</hi> And <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,

                  </gap>,
the <hi>best Heresie.</hi> And the great <hi>Constantine</hi> in one of
his <hi>Edicts</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Catholick or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

                  </gap>, the <hi>most holy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</hi>
The <hi>Latines</hi> also constantly used that word in
a sense indifferent. <hi>Cato,</hi> faith <hi>Cicero, est in ea he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resi
quae nullum orationis florem sequitur.</hi> The words
therefore themselves you see are of an <hi>indifferent</hi>
signification, having this difference between them,
that the one for the most part is used to signifie the
<hi>Relinquishment</hi> of that which a man had <hi>before</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and the other <hi>a choice</hi> or embracing of that
which a man had not before received or admitted.
And this difference is constantly observed by all <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi>
writers, who afterwards used these
words in the worst or an evill sense; so that <hi>Apostasie</hi>
in this appropriation of it, denotes the <hi>relinquishment</hi>
of any Important Truth or way in Religion; and


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50044:48"/>
                  <hi>Heresie</hi> the <hi>choice</hi> or embracement of any new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Opinion or Principle or way in the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereof. A man then may be an <hi>Apostate</hi> by
<hi>partiall Apostasie,</hi> that is depart from the Profession
of <hi>some Truth</hi> he had formerly embraced, or the
performance of <hi>some duty</hi> which he was engaged in,
without being an <hi>Heretick,</hi> or choosing any <hi>new</hi>
opinion which he did not before embrace. Thus you
signally call a <hi>Monke</hi> that deserts his <hi>Monasticall</hi>
Profession an <hi>Apostate,</hi> though he embrace no opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which is condemned by your Church, or which
you think <hi>hereticall.</hi> And a man may be an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
that is <hi>choose</hi> and embrace some new false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
which he may coyn out of his own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without a direct <hi>renunciation</hi> of any Truth
which before he was instructed in. And this is that
which I intended, when I told you that your Church
is fallen by <hi>partiall Apostasie and by Heresie.</hi> Shee hath
<hi>renounced</hi> many of the important <hi>Truths</hi> which the
old <hi>Roman</hi> Church once believed and professed, and
so is fallen by <hi>Apostasie.</hi> And she hath invented or
coyned many <hi>Articles</hi> pretended to be of faith,
which the old <hi>Roman</hi> Church never believed, and so
is fallen by <hi>Heresie</hi> also. Now what say you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
<hi>Why, good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, in this division Apostasie is set
to express a totall relapse in opposition to Heresie,
which is the partiall.</hi> But who gave you warrant or
leave so to <hi>set</hi> them? It would it may be somewhat
serve your turn, in evading the Charge of <hi>Apostasie,</hi>
that lyes against your Church; but, <hi>Good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,</hi> will
not prove that you may thus confound things for
your advantage. <hi>Idolatry</hi> is <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Apostasie</hi>
is <hi>Heresie,</hi> and what not, because you suppose you
have found a way to escape the imputation of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi>

embraced and performed. That these may be the

would grant me, that the <hi>primitive Church of Rome</hi>
believed and faithfully retained the doctrine of truth,

               <p>That Church believed expresly, that all they <hi>who
die in the Lord do rest from all their labours,</hi> Rev. 14.

of them into the flames of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It believed, that the <hi>sufferings of this life are not
worthy of the glory that shall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom.
8. 18. Your Church is otherwise minded, asserting
in our works and sufferings a <hi>merit</hi> of, and condigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto the glory that shall be received.</p>
               <p>It believed, that <hi>we were saved freely, by grace, by
faith, which is not of our selves, but the gift of God,
not by works, left any one should boast,</hi> Eph 2. 8. Tit.
3. 5. and therefore <hi>besought the Lord not to enter into
judgement with them, because in his sight no flesh could
be justified,</hi> Psal. 130. 4. 143. 2. And you are <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized</hi>
from this part of their faith.</p>
               <p>It believed, that Christ <hi>was once only offered,</hi> Heb.
10 12. and that it could not be that <hi>he should often
offer himself, because then he must have often</hi> suffered

departed from.</p>
               <p>It believed, that <hi>we have one only Mediatour and
Intercessour with God,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. 1 Joh. 2. 2.
Wherein also you have renounced their perswasion;
as likewise you have done in what it professed, that
we may <hi>invocate only him, in whom we do believe,</hi>
Rom. 10. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50044:50"/>
It believed, that the <hi>Command to abstain from
Meats and Marriage, was the doctrine of Devils,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 1, 2. Do you abide in the same faith?</p>
               <p>It believed, that <hi>Every soul</hi> without exception,
<hi>was to be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> Rom. 13. 1.
You will not walk in the steps of their faith herein.</p>
               <p>It believed, that all <hi>Image-worship was forbidden,</hi>
Exod. 20. And whether you abide in the same <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,</hi>
we shall afterwards examine. And many
more instances of the like kind, you may at any time
be minded of.</p>
               <p>You hast to that you would fain be at, which will
be found as little to your purpose, as those whose
consideration you so carefully avoid. You say,
<hi>Did she fall by Heresie in adhering to any errour in Faith,
contrary to the approved doctrine of the Church? Here
you smile seriously, and tell me, that, since I take the
Roman and Catholick Church to be one, she could not
indeed adhere to any thing, but what she did adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I take them indeed to be one: but here I speak</hi>
ad hominem, to one that doth not take them so. <hi>And
then, if indeed the Roman Church had ever swerved in
faith, as you say she has, and be her self as another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
particular Church, as you say she is, them might
you find some one or other more generall Church, if
any there were, to judge her; some Oecumenicall
Councell to condemn her; some Fathers, either Greek
and Latin, expresly to writs against her, as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
now do; some or other grave Authority to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
her; or at least some company of Believers, out
of whose body she went, and from whose faith she fell.
None of which, since you are not able to a assign,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you have spoken more rightly, than you were
aware of; for, not to be able to assign none of them,
infers at least an ability to assign some, if not all of


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50044:51"/>
them) <hi>my Query remains unanswered, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
still as flourishing a Church as ever she was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You represent my Answer lamely. I desire
the Reader to consult it in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> pag.
66, 67, 68. What you have taken notice of, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
only your <hi>fineness,</hi> in making <hi>Heresie</hi> an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to an errour in faith, contrary to the <hi>doctrine
of the Church;</hi> and your selves <hi>the Church,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you must needs be secured from <hi>Heresie,</hi> though
you should adhere to the most <hi>hereticall</hi> Principles
that ever were broached in the world. But nothing
of all this, as I have shewed, will be allowed you.
2. As we have seen some of the Reasons, why you
were so unwilling to try the <hi>Cause</hi> of your Church,
on the heads of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Apostasie;</hi> so here
you discover a sufficient Reason, why you have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over your other head of <hi>Schism,</hi> in silence. You
avow your self one of the most <hi>schismaticall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
that were ever adhered unto by any professing
the name of Christ. <hi>The Roman Church and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
are with you one and the same.</hi> Is not this
<hi>Petilianus</hi> his, in <hi>parte Donati;</hi> nay <hi>Basilides</hi> his,
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.
<hi>Epiphan. Heres.</hi> 4. <hi>We only are men, all others are
Dogs and Swine. Macte virtute!</hi> If this be not to
<hi>shew modcration,</hi> and to persue <hi>reconciliation,</hi> at
once to shut out all men but your selves from the
<hi>Church</hi> here, and consequently <hi>Heaven</hi> hereafter,
what can be thought so to be? In earnest S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you
may talk what you please of <hi>moderation,</hi> but whilest
you avow this one wretched <hi>schismaticall</hi> Principle,
you do your endeavour to exclude all true <hi>Christian
moderation</hi> out of the world. 3. Why do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that your <hi>Query</hi> is not answered? Suppose
<hi>one</hi> Question could not be answered, doth it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50044:51"/>
follow that <hi>another</hi> cannot? I suppose, you take
notice that this is <hi>another</hi> Question, and not that at
first proposed, as I told you before. Your first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
was about your <hi>Churches crime,</hi> this is about
her <hi>conviction</hi> and condemnation; and your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi>
hath no strength in it, but what is built on
this unquestionable Maxim, that, <hi>None ever offended,
who was not publickly judged;</hi> as though there were
no <hi>Harlot</hi> in the world but those that have been <hi>cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
It is enough S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, that her condition is <hi>sub judice,</hi>
as it will be, whether you or I will or no; and that
there is not evidence wanting for her <hi>conviction,</hi> nor
ever was since her fall, though it may be it hath not
at all times been so publickly managed. And yet so
vain is your <hi>triumphant</hi> Conclusion, that we rest not
here, but prove also that she hath been of old judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and condemned, as you will hear anon.</p>
               <p>And thus I have once more given you an <hi>Answer</hi>
to your <hi>enquiry,</hi> how your Church <hi>fell;</hi> namely,
that she hath done so by all the wayes and means, by
which it is <hi>possible</hi> for a Church to fall. She failed
under the just hand of God, when the persons of that
<hi>Vrbick Church</hi> were extirpated, partly by others,
but totally by <hi>Totilas;</hi> as the <hi>Brittish</hi> Church in
<hi>England fell</hi> by the sword of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> She hath
fallen by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>corruption of life,</hi> as did the
Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> before the Captivity. She hath
fallen by her <hi>relinquishment</hi> of the written Word, as
the only rule of faith and worship, and by adhering
to the <hi>uncertain traditions</hi> of men, as did the Church
of the Jews after their return from captivity. She
hath fallen by <hi>Apostasie,</hi> in forsaking the profession
of many <hi>important truths</hi> of the Gospel, as the
Church of the <hi>Galatians</hi> did for a season, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquishment
of the doctrine of Justification by


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50044:52"/>
grace alone. She hath fallen by <hi>Heresie,</hi> in coyning
new Articles of faith, and imposing them on the
<hi>consciences</hi> of the Disciples of Christ, as the <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
did with their new <hi>Paraclete,</hi> and rigid obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.
She hath fallen by <hi>Schisme</hi> in her self, as
the <hi>Judaical</hi> Church did when divided into <hi>Essenes,
Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees:</hi> setting up <hi>Pope</hi> against
<hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Councell</hi> against <hi>Councell,</hi> continuing in
her intestine broils for some ages together; and
<hi>from all</hi> others, by the wretched Principle, but-now
avowed by you, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> did of old. She
hath fallen by Ambition, in the <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
asserting a <hi>Soveraignty in the Pope</hi> over the
Kings and Potentates of the earth, whereof I can
give you no precedent instance, unless it be of him,
who claimed the <hi>Kingdomes of the world</hi> to be his
own, and boasted that he disposed of them at his
pleasure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. And now I hope you will not
take it in <hi>ill part,</hi> that I have given you a plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
unto your Question, which, as I suppose, was
proposed unto us for that end and purpose.</p>
               <p>But although these things are evident and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<hi>proved,</hi> yet I see nothing will satisfie you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we produce <hi>testimonies</hi> of <hi>former times,</hi> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that your Church hath been <hi>arraigned, judged,</hi>
condemned, written against, by <hi>Fathers, Councils,</hi>
or other Churches. Now though this be somewhat
an unreasonable expectation in you, and that which
I am no way bound unto by the <hi>Law</hi> of our Discourse
to satisfie you in; yet to prevent for the future such
Ivasions, as you have made <hi>use</hi> of on all occasions in
your <hi>Epistle,</hi> I shall in a few pregnant and unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<hi>Instances,</hi> give you an account both <hi>when,
how,</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi> the falls of your Church have
been observed, reproved, <hi>condemned,</hi> and written


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50044:52"/>
against. Only unto what shall be discoursed unto
this pnrpose, I desire liberty to premise these <hi>three</hi>
things, which I suppose will be granted.
<q>Dabitur ignis tamen, et si ab inimicis petam.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The first is, that, <hi>What is by any previously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
before the embracing and practice of it, is no
less condemned by them, than if the practice had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
their condemnation.</hi> Though you should say
that your avowing of a <hi>condemned</hi> errour, would
make it <hi>no</hi> errour; yet you cannot say that it will
render it <hi>not</hi> condemned: for that which is done,
cannot be undone, say you what you will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that, <hi>Where any opinion or practice in
Religion, which is embraced and used by your Church,
is condemned and written against, that then your
Church which so embraceth and useth it, is condemned
and written against.</hi> For neither do Protestants
write against your Church, or <hi>condemn</hi> it, on any
other account, but of your <hi>opinions</hi> and practices;
and you require but such a writing and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as you complain of amongst them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I desire you to take notice, that I do not
this, as though it were <hi>necessary to the security and
defence of the Cause which we maintain against you.</hi>
It is abundantly sufficient and satisfactory unto our
<hi>consciences,</hi> in your casting us out from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
that all the <hi>wayes</hi> whereby we say your
Church is <hi>fallen</hi> from her pristine purity, are judged
and condemned in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the Word of truth;
whither we <hi>appeal</hi> for the last determination of the
differences between us. These things being premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to prevent such <hi>evasions</hi> as you have accustomed
your self unto, I shall, as briefly as I can, give you
somewhat of that, which you have now <hi>twice</hi> called
for.</p>

1. Your Principle and Practise <hi>in imposing upon all
Persons and Churches a necessity of the observation of
your Rites and Ceremonies, Customes and Traditions,
casting them out of Communion who refuse to submit
unto this your great Principle of all the Schisms in
Europe,</hi> was contradicted, written against, <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by Councels and Fathers, in the very first instance
that ever you gave of it. Be pleased to consider that
this concerns the very <hi>Life</hi> and Being of your Church:
For if you may not impose your <hi>Constitutions,</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
and customes upon all others, <hi>actum est,</hi> there
is an end of your <hi>present</hi> Church State. Let us see
then how this was thought of in the dayes of old:
<hi>Victor</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome, An<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dom.</hi> 96. condemns
and excommunicates the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> because
they would not joyn with him in the Celebration of
<hi>Easter</hi> precisely on the Lords day. Did this practise
escape <hi>uncontrolled?</hi> He was written against, by the
great <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and reproved that he had cast out of
Communion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>whole Churches
of God,</hi> for a triviall cause. His fact also was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in the justification of those Churches, by a
<hi>Councell</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> where <hi>Theophilus</hi> presided;
and another in <hi>Asia,</hi> called together for the same
purpose by <hi>Polycrates; Euseb. Eccles. Hist. lib.</hi> 5.
<hi>cap.</hi> 22, 23, 24, 25. This is an early instance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<hi>Fall</hi> in your Church, and an open oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
by <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> made unto it. And do
not you, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, deceive your self, as though the fact of
<hi>Victor</hi> were alone concerned in this censure of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
and others. The Principle before mentioned,
which is the very <hi>life</hi> and soul of your Church, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in it. It was done also in a repetition of the
same Instance attempted here in <hi>England</hi> by you,
when <hi>Austine</hi> that came from <hi>Rome</hi> would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50044:53"/>
on the <hi>Brittish</hi> Churches the observation of
<hi>Easter</hi> according to the custome of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church; the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> of these Churches,
not only rejected your <hi>Custome,</hi> but the Principle
also from whence the attempt to impose it on them
did proceed; protesting, that they owned no subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the <hi>Bishop of Rome, nor other regard, than
what they did to every good Christian.</hi> Concil. Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.

by <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> as well as by the
Scriptures, and the light of Nature its self. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

discord was kindled, which, after it hath now for fifteen
years been carried on with shamefull contentions, can by
no means be allayed. And now especially when all things
appear to be troubled and perverted by the discord of the
Bishops, and that all things are depraved by them
through hatred, favour, fear, inconstancy, envy, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
covetousuess, pride, sleepiness and sloth; the
most with mad counsels and pertinacious endeavours
opposing themselves to the sew that are better advised.
Amongst all these things, the people of God and every
honest man, is become a reproach and scorn.</hi> Thus that
<hi>Historian</hi> complaining of the consequents of this
proceeding. But good men lest not the matter so:
<hi>Martinus Turonensis</hi> presently refuseth all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

the rest of the sober godly. Bishops of those dayes.
At length both <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius,</hi> the promoters
of this work, were solemnly <hi>excommunicated,</hi> though
one of them had before for very shame foregone his

practice of your Church which she is fallen into, is
publickly eondemned and written against, 1300 years
ago. Should I insist on all the Testimonies that of
this kind might be produced,
<q>Antè diem clauso componet vesper olympo</q>
than I could make an end of them. I have added this


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50044:55"/>
Instance to the former, as knowing them to be the
two great <hi>pillars</hi> on which the <hi>tottering fabrick</hi> of
your Church is raised; and which if they were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the whole of it would quickly fall to the ground:
and you see how long ago, they were both publickly
condemned.</p>
               <p>3. Your Papall Oecumenicall Supremacy hath
two main Branches, 1. <hi>Your Popes spirituall Power
over all Persons and Churches, in the things of Religion.</hi>
2. <hi>His Power over Emperors, Kings, and Potentates,</hi>
in reference unto Religion; or, as you speak, <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
ad spiritualia.</hi> The first your Church <hi>stumbled</hi>
into by many degrees, from the dayes of <hi>Victor,</hi>
who made the first notable <hi>halt</hi> to this purpose.
The latter you <hi>stumbled</hi> into in the dayes of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the seventh, or <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> It were endless to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
how this <hi>fall</hi> of your Church hath been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
written against, opposed, condemned by <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Councels, Fathers,</hi> Princes, and learned men in all
Ages. Some few evidences to this purpose, to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your request, I shall direct you unto: It was
<hi>written</hi> against and condemned by <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and that in a Councell at <hi>Carthage, an.</hi>
258. upon an attempt made by <hi>Stephen</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> looking in some small degree towards that
<hi>usurped Supremacy,</hi> which afterwards was attained
unto. You may, if you please, there see <hi>him</hi> rebuked,
and the practice of your Church condemned. The
same <hi>Cyprian</hi> had done no less before, in reference
unto some actings of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the predecessor of
<hi>Stephen, Epist. ad Cornel.</hi> Though the pretensions
of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> were modest in comparison
of your present vast Claim; yet the Churches of God
in those dayes could not <hi>bear</hi> them. It is prejudged
in the most famous <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> which assigned

severall of them equall Authority, <hi>Can.</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Let the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
be observed, that, as to</hi> Egypt, Lybia, <hi>and</hi> Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,
<hi>the Bishop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>have power over them,
(or the Churches in them) for so is the custome of
the Bishop of</hi> Rome, (that is, to have power over
the adjoyning Churches;) <hi>likewise about</hi> Antioch,
<hi>and in other Provinces, that the ancient Rights of the
Churches be preserved.</hi> Your <hi>Great Pope</hi> whom you
so frequently call the <hi>Pastor of Christendome,</hi> was

which he claimed by custome, as to his of <hi>Alexandria</hi>

it, above other Churches of <hi>Egypt, Lyb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for a warranty whereof, the usage of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church in reference unto her neighbour
Churches, is made use of: which to deal freely with
you, and to tell you my private thoughts, was a
confirmation of a <hi>disorder</hi> by your example, which
you were from that day forward seldome wanting to

condemneth and is perfectly destructive of your
at present claimed Supremacy. Three Councels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in <hi>Africk,</hi> within the space of <hi>twenty years,</hi>
warned your Church of <hi>her fall</hi> into this <hi>Heresie,</hi> and


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50044:56"/>
opposed her attempts for the promotion of it. The
first at <hi>Carthage, an.</hi> 407. which forbids all <hi>appeals.
unto any beyond the Sea;</hi> which <hi>Rome</hi> was to them in
<hi>Africk,</hi> no less than it is unto us in <hi>England.</hi> The
next was the second <hi>Milevitan, an.</hi> 416. where the
same <hi>prohibition is</hi> revived with express respect unto
the <hi>See of</hi> Rome, as <hi>Binius</hi> acknowledgeth. The
same order is again asserted by another Councell in
<hi>Africk,</hi> wherein the pretensions of <hi>Boniface</hi> unto
some kind of <hi>superintendency</hi> over other Churches,
are sorely reproved, and his way of prosecuting his
attempt by pretended <hi>Canons</hi> of the Councell of
<hi>Nice,</hi> after great pains taken and charge disbursed
in the discovery of the <hi>forgery,</hi> censured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
All these testimonies of the condemnation
of this <hi>fall</hi> of yours by Fathers and Councels you have
gathered unto your hand in the <hi>Cod. Can. Conc. Afric.</hi>
and by <hi>Binius,</hi> with others. Also the substance of
all these Canons of <hi>Provinciall Synods</hi> is confirmed
in the fourth Chapter of the Decree of the third <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenicall</hi>
Councell at <hi>Ephesus, an.</hi> 431. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.
<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>It seemeth
good to the holy and generall Councell, that every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
retain its Rights, pure and inviolate, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto ancient custome, it had from the beginning.</hi>
The Decree, I confess, was purposely framed against
the Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who had taken on him to
ordain Bishops in <hi>Cyprus</hi> out of his Province; but it
is built on that generall Reason, which expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
the <hi>Roman</hi> pretensions to an unlimited Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.
The great and famous Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

though some of them, with intolerable <hi>partiality,</hi>
would separate this and some others, from the Body
of the <hi>Canons</hi> of that Councell, giving them a place
by themselves. The Decree contains the <hi>Reasons</hi> of
the Councel's assigning priviledges next unto, and
equall with, the <hi>Roman,</hi> unto the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi>
Church; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>.
<hi>The Fathers</hi> (our Predecessors)
<hi>granted priviledges to the See of ancient</hi> Rome, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that was the Imperiall</hi> City. Do you see from
<hi>whence</hi> proceeded all the priviledges of the <hi>Roman
throne?</hi> meerly from the <hi>grants</hi> and <hi>concessions</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Bishops; and I wish they had been liberall only
of what was their own. And what was the reason of
their so doing? <hi>Because the City was Imperiall;</hi> in
which one sentence, both their <hi>Supremacy</hi> and the
grounds of it are discarded and virtually condemned;
for their pretensions are utterly inconsistent with this
<hi>Synodicall</hi> determination. They proceed: for the
same reason, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>They</hi> (the hundred and fifty Bishops) <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the same or equal Priviledges unto the holy See of
new</hi> Rome, <hi>rightly determining that the City which is
honoured with the Empire and Senate, should enjoy equal
Priviledges in things Ecclesiasticall with the ancient
Queen</hi>-Rome, or <hi>Rome</hi> regent of old, Is not your
present <hi>Supremacy</hi> here sufficiently condemned, and
that by as famous a <hi>Councell</hi> as ever the Christian
world enjoyed? And it will not avail you, that you


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50044:57"/>
fell into this <hi>Heresie</hi> fully afterwards, and not <hi>before</hi>
the determination of this Councell; for he that falls
into an <hi>Heresie</hi> after the determination of a Councell,
is no less condemned therein, than he that <hi>fell</hi> into
it before, and gave occasion to the Sentence; yea his
guilt is the greater of the two, because he despised
the Sentence which he knew, which the other it may
be neither did, nor could foresee. I gave you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
before, how it was condemned and written
against by the <hi>Brittish</hi> Church here in this Island,
and many more Instances of the same nature might be
added.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hildebrandine</hi> branch of your Supremacy,
I mean the power that you challenge over <hi>Kings</hi> and
Potentates, <hi>in ordine ad spiritualia,</hi> which having
made some progress by insensible degrees, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned
by Pope <hi>Gergory</hi> the seventh, hath as little
escaped opposition, censure, and <hi>condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as any
<hi>Heresie</hi> whereinto your Church is fallen. This <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
may be accounted the chief Father of this <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
for he sicked the unshapen Monster into that <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi>
form, wherein it hath since ranged about in
the earth. What this mans Principles and Practices
were, I shall not desire you to learn of Cardinall
<hi>Benno,</hi> whom yet I have reason to judge the more
impartiall Writer of the two, but of Cardinall <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who makes it his business to extoll him to the

he makes <hi>almost a god of him,</hi> or at least <gap reason="foreign">

to record them, that they might be preserved <hi>In per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuam
rei memoriam,</hi> that we might learn what your
great Father exercised himself about,
<q>Dum succus pecori &amp; lac subducitur agnis,</q>
whilest the poor <hi>sheep</hi> famished for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and instruction. They are called <hi>Dictata Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae,</hi>
and <hi>ex tripode</hi> we may not doubt, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
twenty seven, whereof I shall mind you of a few.
The first is, <hi>Quod Romana Ecclesia à solo Domino sit
fundata; That the Roman Church was founded by the
Lord alone. 2. Quod solus Romanus Pontifex jure
vocatiur Vniversalis; That the Roman Bishop is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called Vniversall.</hi> So some think indeed, ever
since Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the first taught them, that he
who assumed that Title, was a forerunner of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.
3. <hi>Quod ille solus possit deponere Episcopos,
vel reconciliare; That he alone can depose Bishops, or
restore them;</hi> which agrees well with the practice of
all the Councels from that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Paulus Samosatenus.</hi> 7. <hi>Quod illi soli licet, pro
temporis necessitate, novas leges condere; That he alone
as necessity requires can make new Laws.</hi> Let him
proceed; 8. <hi>Quod solus possit uti Imperialehus insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis;
He alone can use Imperiall ensigns.</hi> It is a great
kindness in him doubtless to lend them to any of his
neighbours, or rather subject, Kings. 9. <hi>Quod s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Papo pedes omnes Principes deosculaetur; That
it is the Pope alone whose feet all Princes may or ought
to kiss.</hi> Yea and it is a kindness if he <hi>kick</hi> not their
Crowns from their heads with his foot, as one did
our King <hi>John's;</hi> or tread upon their necks, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50044:58"/>
did on the Emperor <hi>Frederick's.</hi> 11. <hi>Quod
unicum sit nomen in mundo, Papa scilicet; That there
is only one name in the world, to wit, that of the Pope;</hi>
no other name it seems given under heaven. Once
more; 12. <hi>Quod illi liceat, Imperatores deponere;
That it is lawfull for him to depose Emperours.</hi> I hope
you will not be offended at the calling over these <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,</hi>
because the so doing is not suited to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
design. I took them out of your <hi>Cardinal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi>
in the place above quoted, who hath placed
them as on a pillar, V. D. P. L. P. <hi>where they may be
easily read by all men.</hi> And that you may not think
that these were the <hi>Heresies</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> alone, the
same <hi>Baronius</hi> affirms that these <hi>Dictates</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in a <hi>Synod at</hi> Rome, whereby they became
the Heresies of your whole Church. Did <hi>Peter</hi> thus
feed the sheep of Christ? seeing <hi>Pasce oves meas,</hi> is
the great pretence for all these exorbitances. Alas

                  </q>
all this is but the <hi>shearing, milking,</hi> and <hi>slaying</hi> of a
stranger; the shepherds being driven into corners.
But have these noisome <hi>Heresies</hi> of your Church,
think you, passed without controll? Was she not
judged, <hi>censured, written</hi> against, and condemned in
the person of her chief Pastor? You must be a very
stranger unto all History, if you can imagine any such
thing. A Councell assembled by the Emperor at
<hi>Worms</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> reckons up the miscarriages of
this <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and pronounceth him <hi>deposed,</hi> with
all those that adhered unto him. Another Synod,
<hi>an.</hi> 1080. at <hi>Brixia</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> condemns him also
for the same causes. All the <hi>Heroick</hi> Potentates of
<hi>Europe,</hi> especially the <hi>Emperors</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> the
Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with whole Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50044:59"/>
of their Clergy, have alwayes opposed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
this branch of your Supremacy. And to
this purpose, hundreds of their <hi>Laws,</hi> Decrees, Edicts,
and Declarations, are at this day extant.</p>
               <p>4. Your <hi>Pope's Personall Infallibility</hi> with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Qualifications, is another <hi>Hereticall</hi> Opinion
that your Church hath fallen by. And herein you
are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>condemned of your selves,</hi> and we
need no further witness against you; you have been
often taken <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in the very fact.</hi> I know
there is an Opinion, secretly <hi>advancing</hi> amongst some
of you, whereby you would cast out of the bounds
of your defence this <hi>Personall Infallibility</hi> of your
<hi>Pope;</hi> but we have no more reason to esteem that
opinion the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of your Church, than we have
to conclude that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> new Position, asserting
him <hi>Infallible in matter of fact,</hi> is so. And though I
know not perfectly, what your opinion is in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
yet I may take a time to shew how utterly <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable</hi>
unto your purpose the new way of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of <hi>Infallibility</hi> is. For it hath but these two
generall inconveniences attending it. First, that it is
<hi>not</hi> the opinion of your Church; Secondly, if that be
the <hi>only</hi> Infalliblity we are to rest on, the whole
<hi>claim</hi> of your Church, and its interest therein, falls to
the ground; both which I hope to have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to manifest. In the mean time, we take that for
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of your Church which is declared by its
self so to be, which is explained and defended by her
most famous Champions. And indeed, you in your
<hi>Fiat,</hi> assert, as I have shewed, the Pope (Personally) to be
an <hi>unerring</hi> guide, which is that we enquire after. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
tells us, that all Catholicks agree in these two
things: 1. <hi>Pontificem, cum Generali, Concilio, non posse
errare in condendis decretis fidoi, vel generalibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptis


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50044:59"/>
morum; That the Pope with a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
cannot erre in making decrees of faith, or generall
precepts concerning manners.</hi> 2. <hi>Pontificem solum,
vel cum suo particulari Concilio, aliquid in re dubia
statuentem, sive errare possit sive non, esse ab omnibus
fidelibus obedienter audiendum; All believers must
willingly obey the Pope, either alone, or with his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Councell, determining in doubtfull matters,
whether he may erre or no.</hi> I confess, if this be so, and
he must be obeyed, whether he do <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi>
whether he teacheth <hi>truly</hi> or <hi>falsly,</hi> it is to no great
purpose to talk of his <hi>Infallibility;</hi> for, follow him we
<hi>must</hi> whither ever he leads us, though it should be to
Hell. And the Catholick Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osition that he asserts
himself, is, that, <hi>Summus Pontifex, cum totam Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam
docet in his quae ad fidem pertinent, nullo casu er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
potest. The Pope when he teacheth the whole
Church, can in no Caseerre in those things which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto faith. De Rom. Pontif. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3.
What a Blind that is, <hi>of teaching the whole Church,</hi>
children can see. The <hi>Pope</hi> can no way <hi>teach the
whole Church,</hi> but as he declares his opinion, or
judgement, which may be <hi>divulged</hi> unto many, as
those of another man. Let us see then, how well they
have made good this their <hi>Infallibility;</hi> and how
well their judgement hath been approved of by the
Church of old. I will not here mind you of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
fathered on <hi>Clemens,</hi> wherein he determines
that <hi>all things among Christians ought to be common;
and, among them, wives;</hi> because I know, it is <hi>falsly</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on him, though you may be <hi>justly</hi> charged
with it, who are the Authors of those forgeries
whereof that is a part. Nor shall I rake the <hi>Epistles</hi>
which you ascribe unto divers of the Ancient <hi>Bishops</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that are full of ignorance, errors, and pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50044:60"/>
non-sence; because they are, questionless, <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigraphcall,</hi>
though you who <hi>own</hi> them, may be
justly charged with their follies. Nor will I much
insist on the Testimony of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book
against <hi>Praxeas,</hi> that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> owned the
Prophesies of <hi>Montanus,</hi> untill <hi>Praxeas</hi> perswaded
him to the Contrary; because, it may be, you will say,
that perhaps <hi>Tertullian</hi> spake partially in favour of a
<hi>Sect</hi> whereunto he was himself addicted; though, for
ought I know, he is as sufficient a Witness in <hi>matter
of fact,</hi> as any one man upon the Roll of Antiquity.
But what say you to <hi>Marcellinus?</hi> Did he not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to Idols, which, according unto you, is <hi>a mixt

Chron. Pope Honorius</hi> was solemnly condemned for
a <hi>Monothelite</hi>-Heretick in the sixth generall Councell,

by your own <hi>darling,</hi> the second of <hi>Nice Act.</hi> 3 and

<hi>dead;</hi> whilest he lived he taught <hi>Heresie,</hi> and when
he was dead, he was <hi>condemned</hi> for an Heretick, and
with him the Principle which is the hindg of your
present faith. Neither did <hi>Vigilius</hi> behave himself
one jot better in his Chair. The Councell of <hi>Pisa</hi>

Your Church is fallen by <hi>Idolatry;</hi> as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
so in that Religious <hi>Veneration of Images</hi> which
she useth, whereunto you have added <hi>Heresie</hi> in
teaching it for a Doctrine of Truth, and <hi>imposing</hi> the
belief of it by your <hi>Tridentine</hi> Determination, on the
Consciences of the Disciples of Christ. I know you
would fain mince the matter, and spread over the
corrupt Doctrine of your Church about it, with

But the Instances Insisted on, may, I hope,
prove sufficient for your satisfaction. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proceed to consider what you offer unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
Principles, which I conceived to animate
the whole Discourse of your <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi>

               <p>YOu proceed unto the fourth Assertion gathered
out of your <hi>Fiat,</hi> which you thus lay down.
<hi>It is, say you, frequently pleaded by our Author that
all things, as to Religion, were ever quiet and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

before the Protestants Relinquishment of the Roman
Sea.</hi> That <hi>ever</hi> is your own addition, but let it pass;
what say you hereunto? <hi>This Principle you pretind
is drawn out of</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>not because it is there, but
only to open a door to your self to exspatiate into some
wide generall discourse, about the many wars, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
alterations, that have been aforetime up and
down in the world in some severall Ages of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And you thereforê say, it is frequently pleaded by
me, because indeed, I never spake one word of it, and
it is in truth a false and fond Assertion. Though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you nor I can deny that such as keep unity of faith
with the Church, can never, so long as they hold it,
fall out upon that account.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I take you to be the
Author of <hi>Fiat Lux;</hi> and if you are so, I cannot but
think you were <hi>a sleep</hi> when you talk'd at this rate.
The Assertion is <hi>false</hi> and <hi>fond, you speak not one word
of it.</hi> Pray S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, take a little advice of your <hi>Son, Fiat,</hi>
not to talk on this manner; and you will wonder
your self, how you came to <hi>swallow</hi> so much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as in the face of the world to vent such things


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50044:63"/>
as these. He tells us from you, <hi>p. 234, 235, 236.
Chap 4. Ed. 2. that, After the conversion of this Land by
the Children of blessed</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Benet, <hi>notwithstanding the
interposition of the Norman Conquest, that all men
lived peaceably together without any the least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
upon the account of Religion, untill the end of
King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth's raign, about five hundred
years after the Conquest.</hi> See also what in generall
you discourse of all places to this purpose, <hi>p.</hi> 221,
222, And <hi>p.</hi> 227. you do in express terms lay
down the position which here you so <hi>exclaim</hi> against
as <hi>false and fond;</hi> but you may make as bold with it
as you please, for it is your own. <hi>Never had this
Land,</hi> say you, <hi>for so many hundred years as it was
Catholick upon the account of Religion any disturbance
at all; whereas after the exile of the Catholick belief
in our Land from the period of King</hi> Henry <hi>the seventh's
Raign to these dayes, we have been in actuall disquiet
or at least in fears. Estne haec tunica filii tui?</hi> Are
not these your words? Doth not your <hi>Son Fiat</hi> wear
this livery? And do you not speak to this purpose in
twenty other places? Is it not one of the main <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
you proceed upon in your whole discourse?
You do well now indeed to acknowledg that what
you spake was <hi>fond and false,</hi> and you might do as
much for the <hi>most</hi> that you have written in that
whole discourse; but now openly to <hi>deny</hi> what you
have asserted, and that in so many places, that is
not so well done of you. There are S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, many wayes
to free your self from that <hi>dammage</hi> you feel or fear
from the <hi>Animadversions.</hi> When any thing is <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
on you, or <hi>proved</hi> against you which you are not
able to defend; you may ingenuously acknowledg
your <hi>mistake,</hi> and that without any dishonour to you
at all: Good men have done so; so may you, or I,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50044:63"/>
when we have just occasion. It is none of your <hi>Tenents,</hi>
that you are all of you Infallible, or that your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall</hi>
mistakes or miscarriages will prejudice your
Cause. Or you might pass it by, in <hi>silence,</hi> as you
have done with the things of the most importance in
the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and so keep up your reputation
that you could <hi>Reply</hi> to them if you would, or were
<hi>free from flyes.</hi> And we know <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as <hi>Menander</hi> speaks. Silence is with many
the best Answer. Or, you might attempt to <hi>disprove</hi>
or <hi>answer,</hi> as the case requires. But this, that you
have fixed upon, of <hi>denying your own words,</hi> is the
very worst course that you could have chosen, upon
the account either of Conscience or Reputation.
However thus much we have obtained; One of the
<hi>chief pretences</hi> of your <hi>Fiat</hi> is by your own confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>false and fond.</hi> It is indeed no wonder that it
<hi>should</hi> be so, it was fully proved to <hi>be</hi> so, in the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions;</hi>
but that you should <hi>acknowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dge</hi> it to
be so, is somewhat strange; and it would have been
very welcome news, had you plainly owned your <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>
of it, and not renounced your own off-spring.
But I see you have a mind to the <hi>benefit</hi> you aymed at
by it, though you are ashamed of the way you used
for the obtaining of it; and therefore adde; <hi>That
neither you, nor I, can deny that such as keep the unity
of faith with that Church, can never, so long as they
hold it, fall out on that account.</hi> But this, on the first
consideration, seems to mee no very <hi>singular</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
me-thinks a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>few,</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi> may say
the same of their Societies: It being no more but this.
<hi>So long as you agree with us, you shall be sure to agree
with us.</hi> They must be very unfriendly minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, that will call these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
Yet there remains still one <hi>Scruple</hi> on my


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50044:64"/>
mind, in reference unto what you assert. I am not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that there is in your Church, any such <hi>unity of
faith,</hi> as can keep men from falling out, or <hi>differing</hi> in
and about the Doctrines and Opinions they profess.
If there be, the children of your Church are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
<hi>morose,</hi> that they have not all this while learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be quiet; but are at this very day writing <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi>
against one another, and procuring the Books
of one another to be <hi>prohibited</hi> and condemned,
which the writings of one of the <hi>learnedest</hi> of you in
this Nation, have fately not escaped. I know you
will say sometimes, that though you <hi>differ,</hi> yet you
differ not in things belonging unto the <hi>unity of faith.</hi>
But I fear, this is but a Blind, an <hi>Apron of Fig-leaves.</hi>
What you <hi>cannot</hi> agree in, be it of never so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
you will agree to say, that it belongs not
unto the <hi>unity of faith;</hi> when things no way to be
compared in <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>use</hi> with them, so you agree
about them, shall be asserted so to do. And in what
you <hi>differ,</hi> whilest the scales of Interest on the part
of the <hi>combatanfs</hi> hang eeven, all your differences are
but in <hi>School</hi> and disputable points. But if one party
prevail in <hi>Interest</hi> and Reputation, and render their
<hi>Antagonists</hi> inconsiderable as to any outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
those very Points that before were <hi>disputable,</hi>
shall be made <hi>necessary,</hi> and to belong to the Vnity of
Faith; as it lately happened in the Case of the <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senists.</hi>
And here you are safe again; The <hi>Unity of
the Faith</hi> is that which you agree in; and that which
you <hi>cannot</hi> agree about belongs not unto it, as you tell
us, though you talk at another rate among your
selves. But <hi>wee</hi> must think, that the <hi>Unity of Faith</hi> is
bounded by the confines of your wranglements; and
your agreement is the Rule of it. This, it may be, you
think suits your <hi>turn:</hi> but whether it be so well <hi>suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>


                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:50044:64"/>
unto the Interest of the Gospell and of Truth, you
must give men leave to enquire, or they will do it
<hi>ingrati,</hi> whether you will or no. But if by the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith</hi> you intend the <hi>substantiall Doctrines of the
Gospell,</hi> proposed in the Scripture to be believed on
necessity unto Salvation; it is unquestionably among
all the Churches in the world, and might possibly be
brought forth into some tolerable <hi>communion</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Practice, did not your <hi>Schismaticall</hi>
Interest and Principles interpose themselves to the
contrary.</p>
               <p>The fifth <hi>Supposition</hi> in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> observed in the
<hi>Animadversions, is, That the first Reformers were most
of them contemptible Persons, their Means indirect,
and their Ends sinister:</hi> To which you reply, <hi>Where
is it S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, where is it, that I meddle with any mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or say they are contemptible? what and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are those Persons, and where did they live? But
this you adde of your own is in a vast universall notion,
to the end you may bring in the Apostles and Prophets,
and some Kings into the list of Persons by mesur named
contemptible; and liken my speech who never spake any
such thing, to the Sarcasms of</hi> Celsus, Lucian, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,
Julian, <hi>and other Pagans.</hi> So you begin; but
<hi>ne savi, magne Sacerdos!</hi> Have a little patience and I
will direct you to the <hi>places</hi> where you display in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words that which in a few I represented. They
are in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> Chap. 4. §. 18. 2. <hi>edit.</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 239,
unto §. 20. p. 251. Had you lost your <hi>Fiat,</hi> that you
make such an <hi>outcry</hi> after that which in a moment
he could have supplyed you withall? <hi>Calvin,
and a Taylors Widdow, Luther and Catherine Bore,
pleased with a naked Vnicorn, swarms of Reformers as
thick as Grashoppers, fallen Priests and Votaries, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
heads, emulating one another, if not the worst,


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50044:65"/>
yet none of the best that ever were, so eagerly quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
among themselves, that a sober man would not have
patience to hear their Sermons,</hi> or read their Books;
with much more to the same purpose you will find in
the places, which I have now directed you unto.
But I see you love to say <hi>what you please,</hi> but not to
hear of it again. But he that can in no more words
more truely express the full and <hi>genuine</hi> sense of your
eighteenth and nineteenth Chapter than I have done,
in the Assertion you so cry out against, shall have
my thanks for his pains; Only I must mind you that
you have perverted it, in placing the last words, as
if they referred unto the Reformers you talk of, that
they did their work <hi>for sinister Ends,</hi> when I only
said, that <hi>their Doctrine according to their Insinuations
was received for sinister Ends,</hi> wherein I comprized
your foul reflections upon <hi>King Henry the Eighth</hi>
and <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter, not placing them
as you now faign among the number of them, whom
I affirmed to be reported by you as a company of
<hi>Contemptible Persons.</hi> But now upon a confidence
that you have shifted your hands of a necessity to
<hi>re-inforce</hi> this Assertion, which you find, it may be, in
your self an incompetency for, you reflect back upon
some former passages in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the generall Objections that you lay against <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,</hi>
are observed to be the same for substance
that long ago were by <hi>Celsus</hi> objected unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:
And say; <hi>So likewise in the very beginning of
this your second Chapter you spend four leaves, in a
parallel betwixt mee and the Pagan Celsus, where of
there is not any member of it true. Doth</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>say,
you lay the cause of all the troubles, disorders, tumults,
warres within the Nations of</hi> Europe upon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants?
doth he charge the Protestants that by their


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50044:65"/>
schisms and seditions, they make a way for other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts?
doth he gather a Rhapsody of insignificant
words? doth he insist upon their divisions? doth he
mannage the Arguments of the jews against Christ, &amp;c?
so doth Celsus <hi>who is confuted by</hi> Origen. <hi>Where does</hi>
Fiat Lux, <hi>where does, does he, does he, any such thing?
Are you not ashamed to talk at this rate. I give a hint
indeed of the Divisions that be amongst us, and the
frequent argumentations that are made to embroyl and
pusle one another; with our much evil and little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of any good in order unto unity and peace,
which is the end of my discourse. But must I therefore
be</hi> Celsus? <hi>Did</hi> Celsus <hi>any such thing to such an end?
It is the end that moralizeth and specifies the action.
To diminish Christianity by upbraiding our frailties is
paganish: to exhort to unity, by representing the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of faction, is a Christian and pious work
When honest Protestants in the Pulpit speak ten times
more full and vehemently against the divisions, warres,
and contentions that be amongst us, than ever came into
my thoughts, must they therefore every one of them be
a</hi> Celsus, <hi>a Pagan</hi> Celsus? <hi>What stuff is this? But it is
not only my defamation you aym at; your own glory
comes in the reer. If I be</hi> Celsus, <hi>the Pagan</hi> Celsus; <hi>you
then, forsooth, must be</hi> Origen <hi>that wrote against him,
honest</hi> Origen; <hi>that is the thing. Pray S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, it is but a
word, let me advise you by the way, that you do not
forget your self in your heat, and give your Wife occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to fall out with you. However you may, yet will not
your Wife like it perhaps so well, that her Husband
should be</hi> Origen. Such <hi>trash</hi> as this, must he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who is forced to have to do with you. These, it
seems, are the <hi>meditations</hi> you are conversant with in
your retirements. What little regard you have in
them unto <hi>Truth</hi> or honesty, shall quickly be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50044:66"/>
unto you. 1. Do I compare you with <hi>Celsus,</hi>
or do I make you to be <hi>Celsus?</hi> I had certainly been
very much mistaken, if I had done so, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
to compare a Person of so small abilities in <hi>literature,</hi>
as you discover your self so to be, with so <hi>learned</hi> a
<hi>Philosopher,</hi> had been a great Mistake. And I wish
you give me not occasion to think you as much Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
unto him in <hi>morals,</hi> as I know you are in your
<hi>intellectuals.</hi> But, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I no where compare <hi>you</hi> unto
<hi>him;</hi> but only shew a <hi>co-incidence</hi> of your objections
against Protestancy, with some of his against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
which the likeness of your Cause and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
cast you upon. 2. I did not say, <hi>You had the same
end with him:</hi> I expressed my thoughts to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;</hi>
nor did compare your act and his, in point of
<hi>Morality;</hi> but only shewed, as I said before, a Co-incidence
in your Reasonings. This you saw and read,
and now in an open <hi>defiance</hi> of Truth and Ingenuity
express the contrary. <hi>Celsus</hi> would not have done so.
But I must tell you S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you are <hi>mistaken,</hi> if you suppose
that the <hi>end</hi> doth so absolutely <hi>moralize</hi> an action,
that it of its self, should render it <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi> Evil it
may, but good of its self it cannot. For, <hi>Bonum ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ex integris causis, malum ex quolibet defectu. Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the intention</hi> will not secure your morality. And
yet also, on second thoughts, that I see not much
difference between the <hi>ends</hi> that <hi>Celsus</hi> proposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself upon his generall Principle, and those that
you propose to your self upon your <hi>own;</hi> as well as
the <hi>way</hi> whereby you proceed is the same. But yet
upon the accounts before mentioned, I shall free you
from your fears of being thought <hi>like</hi> him. 3. When
Protestants <hi>preach against our Divisions,</hi> they charge
them upon the <hi>Persons</hi> of them that are guilty;
whereas you do it, on the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Religion


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50044:66"/>
that they profess; so that although <hi>you</hi> may deal like
<hi>Celsus,</hi> they do not. 4. The scurrilous <hi>Sarcasm</hi>
wherewith you close your Discourse, is not meet for
any thing but the entertainment of a <hi>Friar</hi> and his
<hi>Concubine,</hi> such as in some places formerly men have
by <hi>publick Edicts</hi> forced you to maintain, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Expedient to preserve their families from being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed</hi>
by you. 5. Let us now pass through the <hi>Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
that you have culled out of many, charged upon
you, to be the same with those of <hi>Celsus,</hi> concerning
which you make such a trebled Outcry, <hi>does he, does
he, does he.</hi> The first is, <hi>Doth</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>lay the cause
of all Tumults and Disorders on Protestants: clames
licet &amp; mare coelo confundas, Fiat Lux</hi> doth so, <hi>chap.</hi>
4. §. 17. <hi>p.</hi> 237. §. 18. <hi>p.</hi> 242, 243. §. 20. <hi>p.</hi> 255. and in
sundry other places. You adde; <hi>Doth he charge Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
that by their schisms and seditions they make
way for other revolts?</hi> He doth so, and that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>chap.</hi> 3. §. 14. <hi>p.</hi> 187, &amp;c. <hi>Doth he,</hi> you adde, <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Rhapsody of insignificant words, as did</hi> Celsus. I
say he doth, in the pretended plea that he insists on for
<hi>Quakers</hi> and for <hi>Presbyterians</hi> also, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. §. 13.
<hi>p.</hi> 172, 173, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again; <hi>Doth he manage the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Jews against Christianity as was done by
Celsus?</hi> He doth, directly, <hi>expresly,</hi> and at large, <hi>chap.</hi>
3. §. 12. <hi>p. 158. &amp;c.</hi> I confess, because it may be you
know it not, you might have questioned the truth of
my <hi>parallel</hi> on the side that concerned <hi>Celsus,</hi> which
yet I am ready at any time if you shall so do, to give
you satisfaction in; but, that you would question it on
<hi>your own part,</hi> when your whole discourse and the
most of the passages in it, make it so evident, I could
not foresee. But your whole <hi>Defence</hi> is nothing but
a noise or an outery, to deter men from coming nigh
you to see how the Case stands with you. It will not


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50044:67"/>
serve your turn, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, you must <hi>abide</hi> by
what you have done, or fairly retract it. In the
mean time, I am glad to find you ashamed of that
which elswhere you so much boast and glory in.</p>
               <p>With the <hi>sixth</hi> and <hi>seventh</hi> Principles mentioned
by me, you deal in like manner. You deny them to
be yours; which is plainly to deny your self to be
the Author of <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> And surely every man
that hath once looked seriously into that <hi>Discourse</hi> of
yours, will be amazed to hear you saying that you
never asserted, <hi>Our Departure from</hi> Rome <hi>to be the
Cause of the Evils among Protestants;</hi> or that, <hi>There is
no Remedy for them, but by a Returnal thither again,</hi>
which are the things that now you <hi>deny</hi> to be spoken
or intended by you. For my part, I am now so used
unto this kind of <hi>Confidence,</hi> that nothing you say,
or deny, seems strange unto me. And whereas unto
your <hi>Denial</hi> you adde not any thing that may give
occasion unto any <hi>usefull</hi> Discourse. I shall pass
it by, and proceed unto that which will afford us
some better advantage unto that purpose.</p>

in sufficient to settle us in the Truth of Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, or to
bring us to an agreement amongst our selves.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I subjoyned the four heads of <hi>Reasons,</hi> which,
in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> you insisted on to make good your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
These you thought meet to pass by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>reviving</hi> them again to your further disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
You are acquainted, it seems, with the old
Rule,
<q>
                     <l>—Et quà</l>
                     <l>Desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit.</l>
                  </q>
The Position its self you dare not directly <hi>deny,</hi> but
yet seek what you can to wave the <hi>owning</hi> of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your express Discourse, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. §. 15. <hi>p.</hi> 199,
200, &amp;c. as also in sundry other places, interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with expressions exceedingly <hi>derogatory</hi> to the
Authority, Excellency, Efficacy, and fullness of the


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50044:68"/>
Scripture, as hath been shewed in the <hi>Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
But let us now consider what you plead for
your self. Thus then you proceed: <hi>You speak not
one word to the purpose, or against me at all, if I had
delivered any such Principle. Gods Word is both the
sufficient and only necessary means of both our Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Settlement, as well in Truth as Vertue. But
the thing you heed not, and unto which I only speak, is
this, that the Scripture be in two hands, for example,
of the Protestant Church in</hi> England, <hi>and of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan
who with the Scripture rose up and rebelled
against her, Can the Scripture alone of its self decide
the business. How shall it do it? has it ever done it?
Or can that written Word now solitary, and in private
hands, so settle any in a way that neither himself nor
present adherents, nor future generations shall question
it, or with as much probability dissent from it either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
or in part, as himself first set it. This is the
Case unto which you do neither here, nor in your whole
Book, speak one word; and what you speak otherwise of
the Scriptures excellency I allow it for Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because you are not the <hi>only</hi> Judge of what I
have written, nor indeed any <hi>competent</hi> Judge of it
at all, I shall not concern my self in the <hi>Censure</hi>
which your Interest compells you to pass upon it. It
is left unto the thoughts of those who are more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial.</hi>
2. Setting aside your <hi>Instance</hi> pitched on
<hi>ad invidiam</hi> only, with some <hi>aequivocall</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as must needs be thought, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>very
artificially</hi> to be put into the state of a Question, and
that which you deny is this, that <hi>where any persons or
Churches are at variance or difference about any thing
concerning Religion or the worship of God, the Scripture
is not sufficient for the Vmpirage of that Difference, so
that they may be reconciled and center in the Profession


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50044:68"/>
of the same Truth.</hi> I wish you would now tell me,
what <hi>discrepancy</hi> there is between the Assertion
which I ascribed unto you, and that which <hi>your self</hi>
here avow. I suppose they are in substance the <hi>same,</hi>
and as such will be owned by every one that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<hi>any thing</hi> of the matters about which we treat.
And this is so spoken unto in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi>
that you have no mind to undertake the examination
of it; but labour to <hi>divert</hi> the discourse, unto that
which may appear <hi>something else,</hi> but indeed is not
so. 3. For your Distinction between <hi>Protestants</hi>
and <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> I know not well what to
make of it. I know no <hi>Puritans</hi> in <hi>England</hi> that
are not <hi>Protestants,</hi> though all the <hi>Protestants</hi> in
<hi>England</hi> do not absolutely agree in every <hi>punctilio</hi>
relating to Religion, nor in all things relating unto
the <hi>outward worship</hi> of God, no more than did the
Churches in the Apostles dayes, or than your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
do. You give us then a Distinction like
that which a man may give between the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> or <hi>Dominicans;</hi> or the Sons of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Benet,</hi> or of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Francis</hi> of Assize. A Distinction
or Distribution of the <hi>Genus</hi> into the <hi>Genus</hi> and one
<hi>Species</hi> comprehended under it; as if you should
have said that <hi>Animal</hi> is either <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Homo.</hi>
4. Though I had rather therefore that you had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
your <hi>Instance</hi> between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>Protestants,</hi> yet because any instance of Persons that
have <hi>different Apprehensions</hi> about things belonging
to the worship of God, will suffice us as to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose,</hi> I shall let it pass. Only I desire you
once more that when you would endeavour to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any <hi>thing, way,</hi> or <hi>acting</hi> of men odious; that you
would forbear to cast the <hi>Scripture</hi> into a Copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
therein, which here you seem to do. <hi>The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi>


                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:50044:69"/>
you say, <hi>with the Scripture rose up and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Rebellion</hi> is the name of an outragious Evil, such
as the Scripture giveth not the least Countenance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And therefore when you think meet to charge
it upon any, you may do well not to say, that <hi>they
do it with the Scripture.</hi> It will not be to your <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
or advantage so to do. This is but my <hi>advice,</hi>
you may do as you see cause.
<q>—Tales Casus Cassandra canebat.</q>
5. The <hi>Differences</hi> you suppose and look upon as
<hi>undeterminable</hi> by the Scripture, are about things
that in themselves <hi>really</hi> and in truth belong unto
Christian Religion, or such as do not <hi>so</hi> indeed, but
are only <hi>fancied</hi> by some men so to do. If they are of
this <hi>latter sort,</hi> as the most of the Controversies
which we have with you are, as about your <hi>Mass,
Purgatory,</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> we account that all Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
about them are sufficiently <hi>determined</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
because they are no where mentioned in
them. And this must needs be so, if the Word of
God be, as you here grant, <hi>the sufficient and only
means both of our Conversion and Settlement as well in
Truth as in Vertue.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I had no sooner written these
words, in that <hi>haste,</hi> wherein I treat with you, but
I suspected a necessity of craving <hi>your pardon,</hi> for
supposing <hi>my Inference</hi> confirmed by <hi>your Concession.</hi>
For whereas you had immediately before, set down
the Assertion supposed to be <hi>yours</hi> about the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
you adde the words now mentioned, <hi>Gods,
Word is the sufficient and only means of our Conversion
and Settlement in the Truth.</hi> I did not in the least
suspect that you intended any <hi>Legerdemain</hi> in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
but that the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Gods Word</hi> had
been only various <hi>denominations</hi> with you of the


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50044:69"/>
same precise Thing, as they are with us. Only I
confess at the first <hi>view,</hi> I wondred how you could
reconcile this <hi>Assertion</hi> with the known Principles of
your Church; and besides, I knew it to be <hi>perfectly
destructive</hi> of your design in your following Enquiry.
But now I fear you play <hi>hide and seek</hi> in the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
your Church hath put upon that Title <hi>Gods Word,</hi>
which it hath applyed unto your <hi>unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as well as unto the <hi>written Word;</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi>
apply the same term unto their <hi>Orall Law.</hi> And
therefore, as I said before, I <hi>crave your pardon,</hi> for
supposing my <hi>Inference</hi> confirmed by your Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein I fear I was mistaken, and only desire
you that for the future, you would speak your mind
<hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>candidly,</hi> as it becomes a Christian and
Lover of Truth to do. But my Assertion I esteem
<hi>never the worse,</hi> though it have not the happiness to
enjoy your approbation; especially considering that
in the particular <hi>Instances</hi> mentioned, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things delivered in Scripture, <hi>inconsistent</hi> with,
and <hi>destructive</hi> of your notions about them, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to exterminate them from the <hi>Confines</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God. 6. Suppose the matters in difference
do <hi>really</hi> belong unto Religion and the worship of
God, and that the Difference lyes only in mens <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Conceptions</hi> of them, you ask, <hi>Can the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
alone of its self decide the business?</hi> What do
you mean by <hi>alone of its self?</hi> If you mean, without
<hi>mens application</hi> of themselves unto it, and <hi>subjecting</hi>
of their Consciences unto its Authoritative decisions;
neither it, nor any thing else, can do it. The <hi>matter</hi>
its self is perfectly stated in the Scripture, whether
any men take notice of it or no: but their <hi>various
apprehensions</hi> about it, must be regulated by their
applications unto it, in the way mentioned. On


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50044:70"/>
this <hi>only</hi> Supposition, that those who are at <hi>variance</hi>
about things which <hi>really</hi> appertain unto the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jesus Christ, will refer the <hi>determination</hi> of
them unto the Scripture, and bring the <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eptions
of their minds</hi> to be regulated thereby; standing unto
its Arbitriment, it is able <hi>alone</hi> and of <hi>its self</hi> to end
all their differences, and settle them all iu the Truth.
This hath been proved unto you <hi>a thousand times,</hi>
and confirmed by most clear <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
its self, with <hi>Arguments</hi> taken from its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Perfection, and the End of its giving forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men; as also from the <hi>practise</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi>
and his Apostles, with their directions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
given unto us for the same Purpose; from the
<hi>Practise</hi> of the First Churches, with innumerable
Testimonies of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> and Doctors.
Neither can this be denied without that <hi>horrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi>
from its Perfection and <hi>Plenitude,</hi> so reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
by them of old, which is <hi>objected</hi> unto you,
for your so doing. <hi>Protestants</hi> suppose the <hi>Scripture</hi>
to be given forth by God, to be unto the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a
<hi>perfect Rule</hi> of that Faith and Obedience, which he
requires at the hands of the sons of men. They sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that it is <hi>such a Revelation</hi> of his Mind or Will,
as is <hi>intelligible</hi> unto all them that are concerned to
know it, if thy use the <hi>means</hi> by him appointed to
come unto a right understanding of it. They sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that what is not <hi>taught</hi> therein, or not taught
so <hi>clearly,</hi> as that men who humbly and heartily
seek unto him, may know his mind therein, as to
what he requireth of them, cannot possibly be the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and indispensable Duty</hi> of any one to perform.
They suppose that it is the Duty of every man <hi>to
search the Scriptures</hi> with all diligence, by the help
and assistance of the <hi>means</hi> that God hath appointed


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50044:70"/>
in his Church to come to the <hi>knowledg</hi> of his mind
and will in all things concerning their Faith and
Obedience, and firmly to <hi>believe</hi> and adhere unto
what they find revealed by him. And they moreover
suppose that those who <hi>deny</hi> any of these Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are <hi>therein,</hi> and so farre as they do so, <hi>injurious</hi>
to the Grace, Wisedem, Love, and Care of God
towards his Church, to the Honour and perfection
of the Scripture, the <hi>Comfort</hi> and establishment of
the Souls of men, leaving them <hi>no assured Principles</hi>
to build their Faith and Salvation upon. Now from
these Suppositions I hope you see that it will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
<hi>follow,</hi> that the Scripture is able every way
to effect that, which you deny unto it a <hi>sufficiency</hi>
for. For where, I pray you, lyes its defect? I am
afraid, from the next part of your <hi>Question, Has it
ever done it,</hi> that you run upon a great mistake. The
defect that follows the <hi>failings</hi> and miscarriages of
men, you would have imputed unto the <hi>want of
sufficiency</hi> in the Scripture. But wee cannot allow
you herein. The Scripture in its place, and in that
kind of Cause which it is, is <hi>as sufficient</hi> to settle men,
<hi>all men,</hi> in the Truth, as the Sunne is to give <hi>light</hi> to
all men to see by: But the Sunne that giveth <hi>light</hi>
doth not give <hi>eyes</hi> also. The Scripture doth its work,
as a <hi>Morall Rule,</hi> which men are not necessitated or
compelled to attend unto or follow. And if through
their <hi>neglect</hi> of it, or not attendance unto it, or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability</hi>
to discern the mind and will of God in it,
whether proceeding <hi>from</hi> their <hi>naturall impotency</hi> and
blindness in their laps'd condition, or some <hi>evil habit</hi>
of mind contracted by their giving <hi>admission</hi> unto
corrupt prejudices and Traditionall Principles, the
work be not effected; this is no impeachment of the
Scriptures <hi>sufficiency,</hi> but a manifestation of their


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50044:71"/>
weakness and folly. Besides, all that <hi>unity in faith</hi>
that hath been at any time or is in the world accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the mind of God, every <hi>Decision</hi> that hath
been made at any time of any <hi>difference</hi> in or about
Religion in a right way and order, hath been by
the Scripture, which God hath <hi>sanctified</hi> unto those
ends and purposes. And it is impossible that the
<hi>miscarriages</hi> or defects of men can reflect the least
<hi>blame</hi> upon it, or make it esteemed <hi>insufficient</hi> for
the end now enquired after. The pursuit then of
your Enquiry which now you insist upon, is in part
<hi>vain,</hi> in part already <hi>answered.</hi> In <hi>vain</hi> it is that you
enquire <hi>whether the written</hi> Word <hi>can settle any man
in a way that neither himself, nor present adherents,
nor future Generations shall question:</hi> For our enquiry
is not after what <hi>may</hi> be, or what <hi>shall</hi> be, but what
<hi>ought</hi> to be. It is <hi>able</hi> to settle a man in a way, that
none <hi>ought</hi> to question unto the worlds end: So it
<hi>setled</hi> the first Christians. But to secure us that none
<hi>shall</hi> ever question the way whereinto it leads us;
that it is not <hi>designed</hi> for, nor is it either needfull
or possible that it should be so: The <hi>Orall preaching</hi>
of the Sonne of God, and of his Apostles, did not so
secure them whom they taught. The way that
<hi>professed,</hi> was <hi>every where questioned,</hi> contradicted,
spoken against, and many, after the profession of it,
again renounced it: And I wonder what <hi>feat</hi> you
have to settle any one in a way that shall never be
questioned. The <hi>Authority</hi> of your <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>
will not do it: Themselves are things as <hi>highly que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned</hi>
and disputed about, as any thing that was
ever <hi>named</hi> with reference unto Religion. If you
shall say, But yet they <hi>ought</hi> not to be so questioned,
and it is the <hi>fault</hi> of men that they are so: You may well
spare me the labour of answering your Question,


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50044:71"/>
seeing you have done it your self. And whereas
you adde, <hi>or with as much probability dissent from it
either totally or in part, as himself first set it,</hi> when
the very preceding words do not speak of a mans <hi>own
setting,</hi> but of the <hi>Scriptures setling,</hi> the man only
embracing what that setleth and determineth: It is
answered already; that what is so <hi>setled</hi> by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and received as <hi>setled,</hi> cannot <hi>justly</hi> be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
by any. And you insinuate a most irrationall
<hi>Supposition</hi> on which your Assertion is built, namely
that <hi>Errour</hi> may have as much probability as <hi>Truth.</hi>
For I suppose you will grant, that what is <hi>setled</hi> by
the Scripture is <hi>true,</hi> and therefore that which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
from it must needs be an <hi>errour;</hi> which that it
may be as <hi>probable</hi> indeed as Truth (for we speak
not of appearances, which have all their strength
from our weaknesses) is <hi>a new notion</hi> which may well
be added to your <hi>many other</hi> of the like rarity and
evidence. But, why is not the Scripture <hi>able to settle</hi>
men in unquestionable Truth? When the people of
old <hi>doubted</hi> about the wayes of God wherein they
ought to walk, himself sends them <hi>to the Law and to
the Testimony</hi> for their instruction and settlement,
<hi>Isa</hi> 8. 20. And we think the counsell of him, who <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceive</hi> nor be deceived, is to be hearkned unto,
as well as his command to be obeyed. Our Saviour
assures us, that if men <hi>will not hear Moses and the
Prophets,</hi> and take direction from them for those
wayes wherein they may please God, they will not
do it, whatsoever they pretend from any <hi>other means,</hi>
which they rather approve of, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29, 31. Yea
and when the great <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
concerning the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> was in
question, he sends men for their settlement <hi>unto the
Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. And we suppose that that


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50044:72"/>
which is <hi>sufficient</hi> to settle us in the <hi>foundation,</hi> is so,
to confirm us also in the whole <hi>superstructure.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering that it is able <hi>to make the man of
God perfect, and to be thoroughly furnished unto all
good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. What more is required
unto the <hi>settlement</hi> of any one in Religion wee know
not; nor what can <hi>rationally</hi> stand in competition
with the Scripture to this purpose; seeing that is
<hi>expresly</hi> commended unto us for it by the Holy
Ghost, other wayes are built on the <hi>conjectures</hi> of
men. Yea the Assurance which we may have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is preferred by <hi>Peter,</hi> before that which any may
have by an <hi>immediate voyce from Heaven,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.
19. And is it not an <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing, now for you
to come and tell us, that the Scripture is not <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
to give us an unquestionable <hi>settlement</hi> in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
Whether it be meet to <hi>hearken unto God or
men,</hi> judge you. For our parts, wee seek not for the
<hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>settlement,</hi> in long uncertain <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
doubious <hi>conclusions</hi> and inferences, fallible
<hi>conjectures,</hi> sophisticall <hi>reasonings,</hi> such as you
would call us unto; but in the express direction and
command of God. Him we can follow, and trust
unto without the least fear of miscarriage; Whither
you would <hi>lead</hi> us wee know not, and are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to make <hi>desperate experiments</hi> in things of so high
concernment. But since you have been pleased to
overlook what hath been discoursed unto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and with your usuall
confidence to affirm, <hi>that I no where at all speak one
word to the Case that you proposed,</hi> I shall for your
further <hi>satisfaction</hi> give you a little enlargement of
my thoughts, as to the Principles on which <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
and <hi>Romanists</hi> proceed in these matters, and
compare them together, that it may be seen whether


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50044:72"/>
of us build on the <hi>most stable and adequate</hi> foundation
as to the superstruction aymed at, by us both.</p>
               <p>Two things you profess, if I mistake not, to ayme
at in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> at least you pretend so to do; 1. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
in and about our differences whilest they
continue: 2. The <hi>reduction</hi> of all dissenters unto an
<hi>unity in faith</hi> and Profession: Things no doubt
<hi>great</hi> and excellent: He can be no Christian that
<hi>aymes</hi> not at them, that doth not earnestly desire
them. You profess to make them <hi>your</hi> Design: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
do so also. Now let us consider whether of
the <hi>two, you</hi> or <hi>they,</hi> are fitted with Principles accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto the <hi>diversity</hi> of Professions wherein you
are engaged, for the <hi>regular</hi> accomplishment and
effecting of these ends: And in the consideration of
the latter of them, you will find your present Case
fully and clearly resolved.</p>
               <p>For the first, of <hi>Moderation,</hi> I intend by it, and I
think so do you also, the mutuall <hi>forbearance</hi> of one
another, as to any <hi>effects of hatred,</hi> enmity, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities
of any kind, attended with <hi>offices</hi> of Love,
Charity, Kindness, and Compassion, proceeding
from a <hi>frame of heart</hi> or gracious <hi>habit</hi> of mind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
producing such effects, with a <hi>quiet,</hi> peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
deportment towards one another, during our
present <hi>differences</hi> in, or about any thing in Religion.
Certainly, this <hi>Moderation</hi> is a blessed thing; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<hi>commended</hi> unto us by our Lord Jesus Christ
and his Apostles, and as necessary to preserve <hi>peace</hi>
among Christians, as the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the firmament is
to give light unto the world. The very Heathen could
say <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Moderation</hi> is the life of all
things, and nothingis durable but from the <hi>Influence</hi>
which it receives from it. Now in pressing after <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
Protestants proceed chiefly on <hi>two</hi> Principles,


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50044:73"/>
which being <hi>once</hi> admitted make it a <hi>Duty</hi> indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable:
And I can assure you that no man will long
follow after <hi>moderation,</hi> but only he that looks upon
it as <hi>his Duty</hi> so to do: Incident provocations will
quickly <hi>divert</hi> them in their course, who pursue it for
any other <hi>ends,</hi> or on any other accounts.</p>
               <p>The first Principle of the <hi>Protestants</hi> disposing them
to <hi>moderation</hi> and indispensably exacting it of them
as their <hi>Duty,</hi> is, that amongst all the <hi>Professours</hi>
of the Name of Christ who are known by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto <hi>any Church</hi> or <hi>Way</hi> of Note or Mark in
the world, not actually condemned in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
or <hi>Apostolicall</hi> times, there is so much <hi>saving
Truth</hi> owned and taught, as being received with
faith, and submitted unto with sincere obedience, is
<hi>sufficient</hi> to give them that profess it an <hi>Interest</hi> in
Christ, and in the Covenant of Grace, and Love of
God, and to secure their salvation, This Principle
hath been <hi>openly</hi> defended by them, and I profess it
to be <hi>mine.</hi> It is true, there are wayes whereby the
<hi>Truth</hi> mentioned may be rendred <hi>ineffectuall;</hi> but
that hinders not, but that the <hi>Principle</hi> is true, and
that the Truth so received is <hi>sufficient</hi> for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of those effects in its kind and place. And let
men ptetend what they please, the <hi>last</hi> day will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
that that Faith which <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi> and
renders the person in whom it is, <hi>accepted</hi> to God by
Jesus Christ, may have its <hi>objective Truths</hi> confined
in a very narrow compass; yet it must embrace all
that is indispensably <hi>necessary</hi> to salvation. And it is
an unsufferable <hi>Tyranny</hi> over the Souls and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, to introduce and assert a <hi>necessity</hi> of
believing, whatever this or that Church, any or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all Churches shall please to propose. For, the
<hi>proposall</hi> of all the Churches in the world cannot


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50044:73"/>
make any thing to be <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed, that
was not so <hi>antecedently</hi> unto that proposall. Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
may <hi>help</hi> the faith of Believers, they cannot <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
it, or exercise any dominion over it. He that
believeth that <hi>whatever</hi> God <hi>reveales</hi> is true, and that
the holy Scripture is a <hi>perfect Revelation</hi> of his mind
and will, (wherein almost all Christians agree,)
need not fear that he shall be burdened with <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
of particular Articles of Faith? provided he do
his <hi>Duty</hi> in sincerity, to come to an <hi>acquaintance</hi> with
what God hath so revealed. Now if mens <hi>common
Interest</hi> in Christ their head, and thereby their <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation</hi>
of the same Spirit from him, with their
<hi>union</hi> in the bond of the Covenant of Grace, and an
<hi>equall sharing</hi> in the Love of God the Father, be the
<hi>Principles,</hi> and, upon the matter, the only grounds and
reasons of that <hi>speciall Love</hi> without dissimulation
which Christians ought to bear one towards another,
from whence the <hi>moderation</hi> pleaded for must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
or it is a thing of no use, in our present case,
at least no way generally <hi>belonging</hi> to the Gospel of
Jesus Christ; and if all these things may be obtained
by vertue of <hi>that Truth</hi> which is professed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among all <hi>known Societies of Christians,</hi> doth it
not unavoidably follow, that we ought to exercise
<hi>moderation</hi> towards one another, however <hi>differing</hi>
in or about things which destroy not the <hi>Principles</hi> of
Love and Union: Certainly we <hi>ought,</hi> unless we
will resolvedly <hi>stifle</hi> the actings of that Love, which
is implanted in all the Disciples of Christ, and besides
<hi>live</hi> in an open disobedience unto his commands.
This then indispensably exacts <hi>moderation</hi> in <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
towards them that differ from them, and that
not only within the lines of <hi>Protestancy;</hi> because
they believe, that, notwithstanding that <hi>dissent,</hi> they


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50044:74"/>
                  <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> have for ought they know, an <hi>interest</hi>
in those things; which are the only reasons of that
<hi>Love</hi> which is required in them towards the Disciples
of Christ. There is a <hi>moderation</hi> proceeding from
the Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> in generall, and requisite
unto our common <hi>interest</hi> in humanity; which is
good, and an especiall <hi>ornament</hi> unto them in whom
it is; especially if they are Persons <hi>exalted</hi> above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in place of Rule and Goveanment. Men <hi>fierce,</hi>
implacable, revengefull, impatient, treading down
all that they <hi>dislike</hi> under their feet, are the greatest
defacers of the <hi>Image</hi> of God in the world, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter the only troublers of humane Society.
But the <hi>moderation</hi> which the <hi>Gospel</hi> requireth, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and proceedeth from the Principles of <hi>Vnion</hi>
with Christ before mentioned; which is that, that
proves us Disciples of Christ indeed, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the mind in suitable actings, against all the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi>
to the Contrary, which from the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and miscarriages of men we are sure to meet
withall. Neither doth this at all hinder but that we
<hi>may contend earnestly for the Truth delivered unto</hi> us,
and labour, by the wayes of Christ's appointment, to
<hi>reclaim</hi> others from such <hi>opinions,</hi> wayes, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
in and about the things of Religion and worship
of God, as are <hi>injurious</hi> unto his Glory, and may be
<hi>destructive</hi> and pernicious to their own souls. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it in the least put any <hi>discouragement</hi> upon
endeavours, to oppose the <hi>impiety</hi> and Prophaneness
of men in their corruption in <hi>life</hi> and Conversation,
which certainly and unquestionably are <hi>inconsistent</hi>
with, and destructive of the Profession of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
let them on whom they are found, be of what
party, Church, or way of Religion they please. And
if those in whose <hi>hearts are the wayes of God,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50044:74"/>
                  <hi>diversifyed</hi> among themselves by various appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of some <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practises,</hi> would sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
according to their <hi>Duty</hi> set themselves to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that <hi>prophaneness,</hi> wickedness of Life, or open
<hi>vitiousness</hi> of Conversation, which is breaking in
like a <hi>flood</hi> upon the world, and which as it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
almost <hi>drowned</hi> the whole glory of Christian
Religion, so it will undoubtedly, if not prevented
end in the woful calamity and <hi>finall ruine</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
they would have <hi>less mind</hi> and leasure to
wrangle fiercely among themselves, and breathe out
destruction against one another, for their <hi>mistakes,</hi>
and differences about things, which by their own
<hi>experience</hi> they find not to take off from <hi>their Love</hi> to
Christ, nor <hi>weaken</hi> the obedience he requires at their
hands. But whilest the whole power of Christianity
is <hi>despised,</hi> Conversion to God, and separation from
the wayes of the perishing World are <hi>set at nought,</hi>
and men think, they have <hi>nothing</hi> to do in Religion,
but to be zealously addicted to this or that <hi>party</hi>
amongst them that profess it, it is no wonder if they
think their <hi>chiefest Duty</hi> to consist in destroying one
another. But for men that profess to be <hi>leaders</hi> and
guides of others in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> openly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
<hi>carnall</hi> and worldly interests, <hi>greatness,</hi> wealth,
outward Splendour, and Pomp, to live in <hi>Luxury</hi>
and pride, to labour to <hi>strengthen</hi> and support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the adherence of <hi>Persons</hi> of prophane and
wicked lives, that so they may destroy all that in any
opinion <hi>differ</hi> from themselves, is, vigorously to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to <hi>drive</hi> out of the world that Religion which
they profess; and in the mean time to render it so <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omely</hi>
and undesirable, that others must needs be <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged</hi>
from its embracement. But these things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
spring from the Principles of <hi>Protestants,</hi> which as I


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50044:75"/>
have manifested <hi>lead</hi> them unto other manner of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
And it is to no purpose to ask, why then they
are not all <hi>affected</hi> accordingly. For they that are
not so, do live in an <hi>open contradiction</hi> to their own
avowed Principles; which that it is no news in the
world, the <hi>vicious lives</hi> of many in all places profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Christianity, will not suffer us to doubt. For
though that Religion which they profess, reacheth
them to <hi>deny all ungodliness and wordly lusts, to live
soberly, and righteously, and godlily in this present
world,</hi> if they intend the least benefit by it, yet they
will <hi>hold the profession</hi> of it in a contrary practise.
And for this <hi>self-deceiving</hi> attended with <hi>eternall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,</hi>
many men are beholding unto such <hi>notions</hi> as
yours about your <hi>Church,</hi> securing Salvation within
the <hi>pale</hi> of its externall Communion, laying little
weight on the things which at the <hi>last day</hi> will only
stand them in stead. But for <hi>Protestants,</hi> setting aside
their <hi>occasionall exasperations,</hi> when they begin to
bethink themselves, they cannot satisfie their own
Consciences in a <hi>resolution,</hi> not to love them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of some differences, whom they believe that
<hi>God loves,</hi> or <hi>may love,</hi> notwithstanding those Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
from them: or to renounce <hi>all Vnion</hi> with
them, who they are perswaded are united unto
Christ; or not to be <hi>moderate</hi> towards them in this
world, with whom they expect to live for <hi>ever</hi> in
another. I speak only of them on all sides, who
have received into their <hi>hearts,</hi> and do express in
their <hi>lives</hi> the Spirituall Power and <hi>energy</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
who are <hi>begotten unto Christ by the Word of
Truth,</hi> and have received of his <hi>Spirit</hi> promised in
the Covenant of Grace unto all them that believe on
him. For, not to dissemble with you, I believe all
others as to their <hi>present state</hi> to be in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50044:75"/>
before God; be they of what Church or way
they will, though they are not all in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in respect of the <hi>means</hi> for their Spirituall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which they enjoy or may do so, they being
much more <hi>excellent</hi> in some Societies of Christians
than others. This then, to return, is the <hi>Principle</hi>
of Protestants, <hi>derived</hi> down unto them from Christ
and his Apostles, and hereby are they eminently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for the exercise of that <hi>moderation,</hi> which you
so much, and so <hi>deservedly</hi> commend. And, more
fully to tell you my <hi>private judgement,</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be my <hi>own</hi> only I do not much concern my
self to enquire, but this it is; Any man in the world
who <hi>receiveth</hi> the Scripture of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
as the Word of God, and on that account
<hi>assents</hi> in generall to the whole Truth revealed in
them, <hi>worshipping God</hi> in Christ, and yeelding <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
unto him answerable unto his <hi>light</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
not contradicting his profession by any <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
inconsistent with true piety, nor the owning of
any <hi>opinion</hi> or perswasion destructive to the known
<hi>fundamentals</hi> of Christianity; though he should have
the <hi>unhappiness</hi> to dissent in some things from all the
Churches that are at this day in the world, may yet
have an <hi>internall supernaturall</hi> saving Principle of his
faith and obedience, and be undoubtedly saved.
And I am sure, it is my Duty to exercise <hi>Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
towards every man, concerning whom I have,
or ought to have, that Perswasion.</p>
               <p>2. Some <hi>Protestants</hi> are of <hi>that judgement</hi> that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
force</hi> ought to have <hi>no place</hi> at all in matters of
faith; however <hi>Laws</hi> may be constituted with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi>
for the preservation of publick outward order
in a Nation, most of them, that <hi>Hareticidium</hi> or
putting men to death for their <hi>misapprehensions</hi> in the


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50044:76"/>
things of God is absolutely unlawfull; and <hi>all of them,</hi>
that Faith is the Gift of God, for the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof unto men, he hath appointed <hi>certain
means,</hi> whereof <hi>externall force</hi> is none. Unto which
Two last <hi>Positions,</hi> not only the greatest <hi>Protestant,</hi>
but the greatest <hi>Potentate</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> hath <hi>lately</hi> in his
own words, expressive of an <hi>heavenly benignity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mankind in their infirmities, declared his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
Assent. And I shall somewhat question the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testancy</hi>
of them, whom his <hi>Authority,</hi> Example, and
Reason, doth not conclude, in these things. For my
part I desire no <hi>better,</hi> I can give no <hi>greater</hi> warrant
to assert them as the Principles of <hi>Protestants,</hi> than
what I have now acquainted you with. And it is no
small <hi>satisfaction</hi> unto me to contemplate on the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Principle</hi> of Gospel peace, planted in the noble
soyl of <hi>Royall Ingenuity and Goodness,</hi> whence fruit
may be expected to the great profit and <hi>advantage</hi> of
the whole world. Now it is easie to discover the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
and genuine tendency of these Principles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Moderation.</hi> Indeed in acting according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and in a <hi>regular consistency</hi> with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the <hi>Moderation</hi> which we treat about. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
then <hi>Protestants</hi> use not that <hi>Moderation</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those that <hi>dissent</hi> from them if otherwise <hi>pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable,</hi>
which the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> requires his Disciples to
exercise towards all them that <hi>profess</hi> the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
hope with them, the fault is solely in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
so offending; and is not countenanced from any
<hi>Principles</hi> which they avow. Whether it be so with
those of your <hi>Church,</hi> shall now be considered.</p>
               <p>1. You have no one <hi>Principle</hi> that you more <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciously</hi>
adhere unto, nor which yeelds you great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
advantage with weak <hi>unstable souls,</hi> than that
whereby you <hi>confine all Christianity within the bounds


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50044:76"/>
of your own Communion,</hi> The Roman Church and
the <hi>Catholick</hi> are with you, one and the same. No
<hi>Priviledge</hi> of the Gospell you suppose, belongs unto
any <hi>soul</hi> in the world, who lives not in your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
and in professed subjection unto the <hi>Pope.
Vnion</hi> with Christ, saving <hi>Faith</hi> here, with <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
hereafter, belongs to no other, no not one.
This is the moderation of your Church, whereunto
your outward <hi>actings</hi> have for the most part been
suited. Indeed, by this one Principle, you are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<hi>incapacitated</hi> to exercise any of that <hi>moderation</hi>
towards those that dissent from you which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
requires. You cannot <hi>love</hi> them as the Disciples
of Christ, nor <hi>act</hi> towards them from any such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
It is possible for you to shew <hi>moderation</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them as <hi>men;</hi> but to shew any <hi>moderateon</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, as those partakers of the same <hi>precious
faith</hi> with you, that is impossible for you to do. Yet
this is <hi>that</hi> which we are enquiring after: not the
<hi>moderation</hi> that <hi>may</hi> be amongst men as men, but that
which <hi>ought</hi> to be amongst Christians as Christians:
This is Gospell moderation, the other is common
unto us with <hi>Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and not at
all of our present disquisition. And I wish that <hi>this</hi>
were found amongst you as proceeding from the
Principles of <hi>Reason,</hi> with ingenuity and goodness of
nature, more than it is. For that which proceedeth
from, and is regulated by <hi>Interest,</hi> is <hi>Hypocriticall,</hi>
and not thank-worthy: As <hi>occasion</hi> offers it self, it
will turn and change, as we have found it to do in
most Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> Apparent then it is, that
this fundamentall Principle of your Profession, <hi>Subesse
Romano Pontifici,</hi> &amp;c. that it is of <hi>indispensible neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
unto Salvation unto every Soul to be subject unto
the Pope of Rome,</hi> doth utterly incapacitate you for


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50044:77"/>
that <hi>moderation</hi> towards any that are not of you,
which Christ requires in his <hi>Disciples</hi> towards one
another; seeing you judg none to be <hi>so,</hi> but your selves.
Yet I assure you withall, that I <hi>hope,</hi> yea I am verily
<hi>perswaded,</hi> that there are <hi>many,</hi> very many, amongst
you, whose minds and affections are so influenced
by common <hi>ingrafted</hi> notions of God and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with a <hi>sense</hi> of the frailties of mankind, and
weakness of the <hi>evidence</hi> that is tendred unto them,
for the eviction of that indispensible necessity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which their Masters urge, as also
with the <hi>beams</hi> of Truth shining forth in generall in
the Scriptures, and what they <hi>know</hi> or have heard of
the <hi>practises</hi> of <hi>primitive</hi> times, as that, being <hi>seasoned</hi>
with Christian charity and candour, they are not so
<hi>leavened</hi> with the sowr prejudice of this Principle, as
to be rendred unmeet for the due exercise of <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
but for this, they are not beholding to your
Church, not this great Principle of your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>2. It is <hi>the Principle</hi> of your Church, whereunto
your Practise hath been suited, that those who <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from you</hi> in things determined by your Church,
being <hi>Hereticks,</hi> if they <hi>continue so to do,</hi> after the
application of the <hi>means</hi> for their reclaiming which
you <hi>think meet to use, ought to be imprisoned, burned,
or one way or other put to death.</hi> This you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to be your Principle, it being the very foundation
of your <hi>Inquisition,</hi> the chief <hi>corner-stone</hi> in your
present Ecclesiasticall fabrick, that couples and holds
up the whole building together: And it hath been
asserted in your <hi>practice</hi> for sundry Ages in most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Europe:</hi> Your Councels, as that of <hi>Constance,</hi>
have determined it, and practised accordingly, with
<hi>John Huss,</hi> and <hi>Hierome:</hi> Your Doctors <hi>dispute</hi> for


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50044:77"/>
it, your Church <hi>lives</hi> upon it. That you are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of any <hi>colour</hi> from Antiquity in this your way, I
have shewed before: <hi>Bellarmine de Laic. cap.</hi> 22.
could find no other Instances of it, but that of <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillianus,</hi>
which what entertainment it found in the
Church of God, I have declared; with that of one
<hi>Basilius</hi> out of <hi>Gregories Dialogues, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap</hi> 4.
whom he confesseth to have been a <hi>Magitian;</hi> and
of <hi>Bogomilus</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Alexius Comnenus</hi> 1100
years after Christ, whose putting to death notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
was afterward censured and <hi>condemned</hi> in
a <hi>Synod</hi> of more sober Persons than those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it. Instance of your avowing this Principle in
your dealing with the <hi>Albigenses</hi> of old, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Merindol</hi> and <hi>Chrabiers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> with
the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in the valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> formerly and
of late; of your <hi>judiciary</hi> proceedings against multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Persons of all sorts, conditions, ages, and
sexes in this and most other Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> you
are not pleased with the mention of, I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pass them by. Only I desire you would not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether this be the <hi>Principle</hi> of your Church or
no, seeing you have given the world too great assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that so it is: And your self in your <hi>Fiat</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the wisdome of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in the pursuit of it, <hi>p.</hi> 243. These things being
so, I desire to know, what <hi>foundation</hi> you have to
stand upon in pressing for <hi>moderation</hi> amongst dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in <hi>Religion:</hi> I confess, it is a huge argument of
your <hi>good nature,</hi> that you are so inclinable unto it:
but when you should come to the reall <hi>exercise</hi> of it,
I am afraid you would find your hands tied up by
these Principles of your Church, and your <hi>endeavours</hi>
thereupon become very faint and evanid. Men in
such cases may make great pretences,

being destitute of any <hi>reall foundation,</hi> your attempts

produce no effects. I confess notwithstanding all this,
<hi>others</hi> may be <hi>moderate</hi> towards you: I judg it their
<hi>duty</hi> so to be, I desire they may be so; but how you
should exercise <hi>moderation</hi> towards others, I cannot
so well discern. Only as unto the <hi>former,</hi> so much
more am I relieved as unto <hi>this</hi> Principle, from the
perswasion I have of the candour and ingenuity of
many <hi>individuall Persons</hi> of your Profession; which
will not suffer them to be captivated under the Power
of such <hi>corrupt prejudices</hi> as these. And for my part
if I could approve of <hi>externall force</hi> in any Case in

               <p>That which gave occasion unto this Discourse, was

your insinuation of the Scriptures <hi>Insufficiency</hi> for

I was willing a little to enlarge my self unto the
consideration of <hi>your</hi> Principles and <hi>ours:</hi> not only
with reference unto the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> but also as
unto that <hi>moderation</hi> which you pretend to <hi>plead</hi> for,

               <p>THe next thing <hi>proposed</hi> as a Good to be aymed
at, is <hi>Vnity in Faith</hi> and <hi>settlement,</hi> or infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
assurance therein. This is a <hi>Good</hi> desireable for
its self; whereas the <hi>moderation</hi> treated of, is only a
<hi>medium</hi> of relief against other evils, untill this may
be attained. And therefore though it be, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of our <hi>Differences,</hi> earnestly to be <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured</hi>
after, yet it is not to be <hi>rested</hi> in, as though
the utmost of our Duty consisted in it, and we had
no prospect beyond it. It is a <hi>Catholick Vnity</hi> in
Faith, which all Christians are to aym at, and so both
you and wee profess to doe; only wee differ both
about the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, and the proper <hi>means</hi> of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it. For the Nature of it, you conceive it to
consist in the <hi>explicit</hi> or <hi>implicit</hi> belief of <hi>all things
and Doctrines determined on, taught, and proposed by


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50044:79"/>
your Church be believed, and nothing else, (with faith
supernaturall) but what is so taught and proposed.</hi>
But this description of the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> wee can by
no means admit of. 1. Because it is <hi>Novel;</hi> it hath
no footstep in any <hi>writings</hi> of the Apostles, nor of the
first <hi>Fathers</hi> or Writers of the Church, nor in the
practice of the Disciples of Christ for many Ages.
That the Determination of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and
its <hi>proposall</hi> of things or <hi>Articles</hi> to be believed
should be the adequate Rule of Faith unto all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
is a matter as forreign unto all Antiquity, as
that the Prophesies of <hi>Montanus</hi> should be so. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it makes the <hi>Unity of Faith</hi> after the full and
last Revelation of the Will of God, <hi>flux, alterable,</hi>
and <hi>unstable,</hi> lyable to increase and decrease; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is <hi>uniform,</hi> constant, alwayes the same in all
Ages, times, and places, since the finishing of the
<hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures. For we know, and all the
world knows, that your Church hath determined
many things lately, some <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it were
but <hi>yesterday,</hi> to be believed, which <hi>its self</hi> had never
before determined, and so hath <hi>increased</hi> the Rule of
Faith, moved its <hi>Center,</hi> and extended its <hi>Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi>
and what she may further determine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to <hi>morrow,</hi> no man knows; and your duty it is
to be ready to believe whatever she shall so <hi>propose;</hi>
whereby you cannot certainly know unto your dying
day whether you do believe all that may belong to
the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> or no. Nay 3. your Church
hath determined and <hi>proposed</hi> to be believed express
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> which Determinations abiding on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
you are not agreed <hi>which</hi> of them to adhere
unto, as is manifest in your <hi>Conciliary Decrees</hi> about
the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Councill,</hi> unto which
of them the preheminence is due. Now this is a


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50044:79"/>
                  <hi>strange Rule</hi> of the Unity of Faith, that is not only
capable of <hi>encrease, changes,</hi> and <hi>alterations,</hi> so that,
that may belong unto it one day, which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto it another, as is evident from your <hi>Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Decrees, wherein you made many things <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to be believed which before were esteemed but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
and were the subjects of <hi>Sophisticall</hi> altercati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in your <hi>Schools;</hi> but also comprizeth in its self
express <hi>Contradictions,</hi> which cannot at all belong
unto <hi>faith</hi> because both of them may be <hi>false,</hi> one
of them must be so; nor to <hi>Vnity,</hi> because Contrary
and adverse. 4. Whereas <hi>holding the Unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> or the Unity of faith is so
great and important a <hi>Duty</hi> unto all Christians, that
they can no way discharge their Consciences unto
God, without a well grounded satisfaction that they
live in the <hi>performance</hi> of it, this description of its
Nature, renders it <hi>morally impossible</hi> for any man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
to know, (and that only a man knows which
he knows explicitly) that he doth answer his <hi>Duty</hi>
herein. For 1. the Determinations of your Church
of things to be believed are so <hi>many</hi> and <hi>various,</hi> that
it is not within the Compass of an ordinary Diligence
and ability to search and find them out. Nor when
a man hath done his <hi>utmost,</hi> can he obtain any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
security, that there have not <hi>other Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
been made, that he is not as yet come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with all, or that he <hi>ever</hi> shall so do; and
how in this Case he can have any satisfactory perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that he keeps the <hi>Unity of Faith,</hi> is not as yet
made evident. 2. In the <hi>Determinations</hi> he may
meet withall, or by any means come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of, he is to receive and believe the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
and <hi>proposed</hi> unto him, in <hi>the sense intended
by the Church,</hi> or else he is never the nearer to his


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50044:80"/>
end. But what that <hi>sense</hi> is in the most of your
Churches <hi>proposals,</hi> your <hi>Doctors</hi> do so endlesly quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
among themselves, that it is impossible a man
should come unto any great <hi>Certainty</hi> in his enquiry
after it; yet a precise meaning in all her <hi>proposals</hi>
your Church must have, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> she hath none at all.
What shall a man do when he comes unto one of
your <hi>great Masters</hi> to be acquainted with the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<hi>sense</hi> of one of your Churches Proposals, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the way that he takes for his satisfaction. First
he speaks unto the <hi>Article</hi> or Question to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in <hi>Generall;</hi> then gives the <hi>different senses</hi> of it
according to these and those <hi>famous Masters,</hi> the
most of which he <hi>confutes;</hi> who yet all of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
themselves to explain, and to speak according
to the <hi>sense</hi> of your Church; and lastly gives his own
<hi>interpretation</hi> of it, which it may be within a few
moneths, is confuted by another. 3. Suppose a
man have attained a <hi>knowledge</hi> of all that your
Church hath determined and <hi>proposed</hi> to be believed,
and to a right understanding of her <hi>precise sense</hi> and
meaning in all her determinations and <hi>proposals,</hi>
which I believe never yet man attained unto, yet
what assurance can he have if he live in any place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from <hi>Rome,</hi> but that your Church may have
made some <hi>new Determinations</hi> in matters of faith,
whose embracement in the <hi>sense</hi> which she intends
belongs unto his keeping the Unity of Faith, which
yet he is not acquainted withall. Is it not simply
impossible for him to be satisfied at any time that he
believes <hi>all</hi> that is to be believed, or that he holds
the <hi>Vnity of Faith?</hi> Your late <hi>Pontific all Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
in the Case of the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Molinists,</hi> is
sufficient to illustrate this instance. For I suppose
you are equally bound, <hi>not to believe</hi> what your


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50044:80"/>
Church condemneth as <hi>Hereticall,</hi> as you are bound
<hi>to believe</hi> what it proposeth for <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine.</p>
               <p>4. I desire to know when a man who lives here in
<hi>England, begins</hi> to be obliged to believe the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of your Church that are made at <hi>Rome.</hi>
It may be he first hears of them in a <hi>Mercury</hi> or week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
News book; or it may be he hath notice of them
by some <hi>private Letters</hi> from some who live near the
place; or it may be he hath a knowledge of them by
<hi>common report;</hi> or it may be they are printed in <hi>some
Books,</hi> or that there is a <hi>brief</hi> of them published
somewhere under the name of the <hi>Pope;</hi> or they are
put into some <hi>Volume</hi> written about the <hi>Councels;</hi>
or some <hi>Religious Persons</hi> on whom he much relyes,
assures him of them. I know you believe that your
Churches <hi>Proposition</hi> is a sufficient means of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
of any Article, to make it necessary to be
believed; but I desire to know what is <hi>necessary</hi> to
Cause a man to receive any Dictate or Doctrine <hi>as</hi>
your Churches <hi>proposition;</hi> not only upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that you are not very well agreed upon the
<hi>Requisita,</hi> unto the making of such a <hi>Proposition,</hi> but
also because, be you as <hi>infallible</hi> as you please in your
<hi>Proposals,</hi> the means and wayes you use to <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi>
those Proposals you make, unto Individuals
in whom alone the faith whereof we treat exists, are
all of them <hi>fallible.</hi> Now that which I desire to
know is, <hi>What is,</hi> or what are those certain <hi>means</hi>
and wayes of communicating the <hi>Propositions</hi> of your
Church unto any <hi>Person,</hi> wherein he is bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce,
and upon the application of them unto him
to believe them, <hi>fide divina cui non potest subesse fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum.</hi>
Is it any <hi>one thing,</hi> or way, or means, that the
hinge upon which his assent turns? Or is it a <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of many things concurring to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50044:81"/>
If it be any <hi>one</hi> thing, way, or <hi>medium,</hi> that
you fix upon, pray let us know it, and we shall <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
its fitness, and sufficiency for the use you put it
unto. I am sure we shall find it to be either <hi>infallible</hi>
or <hi>fallible.</hi> If you say the <hi>former,</hi> and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
upon which the Assent of a mans mind unto
any thing to be the proposall of your Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends,
must in the <hi>testimony</hi> it gives, and evidence
that it affords be esteemed <hi>infallible,</hi> then you have
as many infallible Persons, things, or writings, as
you make use of to acquaint one another with the
determinations of your Church; that is, upon the
matter <hi>you are all so;</hi> though I know in particular
that <hi>you</hi> are not. If the <hi>latter;</hi> notwithstanding the
first pretended <hi>infallible Proposition,</hi> your faith will
be found to be resolved immediately into a <hi>fallible</hi>
information. For, what will it advantage me, that
the <hi>proposall</hi> of your Church cannot <hi>deceive</hi> me, if I
may be <hi>deceived</hi> in the Communicating of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall
unto me? And I can with no more <hi>firmness,</hi>
certainty, or assurance, believe the thing proposed
unto me, than I do believe that it is the <hi>Proposall</hi> of
the Church wherein it is made. For you pretend not
unto any <hi>self-evidencing</hi> efficacy in your Churches
Propositions, or things proposed by it; but all their
Authority, <hi>as to me,</hi> turns upon the Assurance that I
have of their relation unto your Church, or that
they are the <hi>Proposals</hi> of your Church; concerning
which I have nothing but very <hi>fallible</hi> evidence, and
so cannot possibly believe them with Faith Divine
and Supernaturall. If you shall say that there are
<hi>many things</hi> concurring unto this Communication of
your Churches Proposals unto a man, as the <hi>notorit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Fact, suitable proceedings</hi> upon it, <hi>books
written</hi> to prove it, <hi>Testimonies of good men,</hi> and the


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50044:81"/>
like; I cannot but mind you, that all these being <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillatim,</hi>
every one apart <hi>fallible,</hi> they cannot in
their Conspiracy improve themselves into an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
Strengthen a <hi>Probability</hi> they may, testifie
<hi>infallibly</hi> they neither do nor can. So that on
this account it is <hi>not</hi> only impossible for a man to
know whether he holds the <hi>Vnity of Faith</hi> or no;
but indeed whether he believe <hi>any thing at all</hi> with
Faith Supernaturall and Divine; seeing he hath no
infallible evidence for what is proposed unto him to
believe, to build his faith upon.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Protestants</hi> are not satisfied with your generall
<hi>implicit assent</hi> unto what your Church teacheth and
determineth, which you have invented to solve the
difficulties that attend your Description of the <hi>Vnity
of Faith.</hi> Of what use it may be unto, <hi>other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
I do not now dispute, but as to this, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> it is certainly of none
at all: The Vnity of Faith consists in <hi>all mens</hi> express
believing all, that <hi>all men</hi> are bound expresly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
be it what it will: Now you would have this
preserved by mens <hi>not believing</hi> what they are bound
to believe: For what belongs to this keeping the
<hi>Vnity of Faith</hi> they are bound to believe expresly,
and what they believe <hi>implicitly,</hi> they do indeed
no more but not expresly disbelieve; for if they do
any more than not <hi>disbelieve,</hi> they put forth some act
of their understanding about it, and so farre <hi>expresly</hi>
believe it: So that, upon the matter, you would have
ment to keep the <hi>Unity of Faith,</hi> by <hi>a not believing</hi> of
that, which that they may keep the Unity of Faith
they are bound expresly to believe: Nor can you do
otherwise whilest you make all the <hi>Propositions</hi> of
your Church of things to be believed, to belong to
the Unity of Faith. Lastly, The <hi>Determinations</hi> of


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50044:82"/>
your Church you make to be the next <hi>efficient Cause</hi>
of your Unity; now these not being absolutely <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>
leave it, like <hi>Delos,</hi> flitting up and down in
the <hi>Sea of Probabilities</hi> only: This we shall manifest
unto you immediately; at least we shall evidence
that you have no <hi>cogent reasons,</hi> nor slable grounds
to prove your Church <hi>infallible</hi> in her Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
At present, it shall suffice to mind you, that
she hath Determined <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and that in as
eminent a manner as it is possible for her to declare
her sense by; namely by <hi>Councils</hi> confirmed by
<hi>Popes;</hi> and an <hi>infallible determination of Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
is not a Notion of any easie digestion in the
thoughts of a man in his right wits. We confess then,
that we cannot <hi>agree</hi> with you in your <hi>Rule</hi> of the
Unity of Faith, though the thing its self we press af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as our <hi>Duty.</hi> For, (2.) Protestants do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this <hi>Vnity</hi> to consist in a precise Determination
of <hi>all Questions</hi> that are or may be raised in or about
things belonging unto the Faith, whether it be made
by <hi>your Church</hi> or any other way. Your <hi>Thomas</hi> of
<hi>Aquine,</hi> who without question is the best and most
<hi>sober</hi> of all your <hi>School Doctors,</hi> hath in one Book
given us 522 <hi>Articles</hi> of Religion, which you esteem
mraculously stated; <hi>Quot Articuli, tot Miracula.</hi>
All these have at least <hi>five Questions</hi> one with another
stated and determined in explication of them; which
amount unto 2610 <hi>Conclusions</hi> in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Now we are farre from thinking that <hi>all these
Determinations,</hi> or the like, belong unto the Unity
of Faith, though much of the Religion amongst some
of you, lyes in not dissenting from them? The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
that your <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath determined and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
the Positions in them <hi>as of faith,</hi> and necessary
to be believed, are I think neer 40 <hi>times</hi> as many as


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50044:82"/>
the Articles of the <hi>antient Creed</hi> of the Church; and
such as it is most evident that, if they be of the nature
and importance pretended, it is impossible that any
<hi>considerable</hi> number of men should ever be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their duty in this business of holding the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Faith.</hi> That a man believe in generall that the
<hi>holy Scripture</hi> is given by inspiration from God, and
that all things <hi>proposed</hi> therein for him to believe, are
therefore <hi>infallibly</hi> true, and to be as such believed,
and that, in particular, he believe <hi>every Article</hi> or
point of Truth, that he hath <hi>sufficient means</hi> for his
instruction in, and conviction that it is so revealed,
they judg to be <hi>necessary</hi> unto the holding of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith. And this also they know, that this <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
nf means</hi> unto every one that enjoys the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Scriptures, extends its self unto <hi>all those
Articles</hi> of Truth, which are necessary for him to
believe, so as that he may yield unto God the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
that he requireth, receive the <hi>holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
and be accepted with God. Herein doth that
<hi>Vnity of Faith</hi> which is amongst the Disciples of
Christ in the world consist; and ever did, nor can do
so in any thing else. Nor doth that <hi>variety</hi> of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
that in many things is found among the
Disciples of Christ, and <hi>ever</hi> was, render this <hi>Vnity,</hi>
like that you plead for, various and incertain. For
the Rule and formall Reason of it, namely <hi>Gods Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the Scripture,</hi> is still <hi>one</hi> and the same, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
unalterable. And the severall <hi>degrees</hi> that men
attain uuto in their Apprehensions of it, doth no
more reflect a charge of variety upon it, than the
difference of <hi>Seeing</hi> as to the severall degrees of the
sharpness or obtuseness of our bodily eyes, doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Light given by the Sunne. The Truth is; if
there was any <hi>common measure</hi> of the Assents of men,


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50044:83"/>
either as to the <hi>intension</hi> of it, as it is subjectively in
their minds; or <hi>extension</hi> of it, as it respecteth Truths
revealed that belonged unto the <hi>Vnity</hi> of Faith, it
were impossible there should be any such thing in
the world, at least that any such thing should be
<hi>known</hi> to be. Only this I acknowledg, that it is the
<hi>Duty</hi> of all men to come up to the full and <hi>explicit
acknowledgment</hi> of all the Truths revealed in the word
of God, wherein the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<hi>Duty</hi> are concerned: as also to a joynt <hi>consent in</hi>
Faith <hi>objective,</hi> or propositions of Truth revealed;
at least in things of most importance, though their
faith <hi>subjective,</hi> or the internal assent of their minds
have, as it will have, in severall Persons, <hi>various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi>
yea in the <hi>same</hi> Persons it may be, at different
seasons. And in our labouring to come up unto this
<hi>joynt-acknowledgment</hi> of the same <hi>sense</hi> and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God in all revealed Truths, consists our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after that <hi>perfection</hi> in the Vnity of Faith
which in this life is attainable; as our <hi>moderation</hi>
doth in our walking in peace and love with and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, according to what we have <hi>already</hi>
attained. We may distinguish then between that
<hi>Unity of Faith</hi> which an interest in, gives <hi>Vnion</hi> with
Christ unto them that hold it, and <hi>Communion</hi> in Love
with all equally interested therein; and that <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment</hi>
of it, which gives <hi>a sameness</hi> of Profession,
and consent in all acts of <hi>outward Communion</hi> in the
worship of God. The <hi>first</hi> is found in, and amongst,
all the Disciples of Christ in the world where-ever
they are; the <hi>latter</hi> is that which moreover it is your
<hi>Duty</hi> to press after. The <hi>former</hi> consists in an <hi>Assent</hi>
in <hi>generall</hi> unto all the Truths of God revealed in the
Scripture, and in <hi>particular</hi> unto them that we have
<hi>sufficient means</hi> to evidence them unto us to be so


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50044:83"/>
revealed: The <hi>latter</hi> may come under a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
for either there may be required unto it
in them who hold it, the <hi>joynt perception</hi> of, and assent
unto every Truth revealed in the Scripture, with an
<hi>equall degree</hi> of certainty in adherence and evidence
in perception, and it is not in this life, wherein the
best of us <hi>know but in part,</hi> attainable; or only such
a concurrence in an assent unto the <hi>necessary Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of Truth, as may enable them to hold together
that outward Communion in the worship of God
which we before mentioned. And this is certainly
<hi>attainable,</hi> by the wayes and means that shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be layed down: And where this is, there is
the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> in that compleatness which we
are bound to <hi>labour</hi> for the attainment of. This the
<hi>Apostolicall</hi> Churches enjoyed of old; and unto the
recovery whereof, there is nothing more prejudiciall
than your <hi>new</hi> stating of it upon the account of your
Churches Proposals.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Unity of Faith</hi> we judg good, and necessary,
and that it is our Duty to press after it: So also in
generall do you. It remains then, that we consider
what is the <hi>way,</hi> what are the means and Principles,
that <hi>Protestants</hi> propose and insist upon for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of it; that is, in <hi>answer to your Question,
What it is that can</hi> settle any man in the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and unite all men therein. <hi>And then because
you object this unto us, as if we were at some loss
and</hi> incertainty <hi>therein, and your selves very</hi> secure,
I shall consider what are the grounds and principles
that <hi>you</hi> proceed upon for the same ends and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
namely to settle any man in the Truth of Religion,
and to bring all men to an harmony and consent therein.</p>
               <p>Now I shall herein manifest unto you these two
things; I. That the Principles which the <hi>Protestants</hi>


                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:50044:84"/>
proceed upon, in the improvement whereof they
obtain themselves assured and infallible <hi>settlement</hi> in
the Truth, and labour to reduce others unto the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith,</hi> are such as are both <hi>suited</hi> unto, and
<hi>sufficient</hi> for, the end and work which they design to
effect by them, and also in themselves of such <hi>unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
Truth,</hi> Certainty, and Evidence, that either
they are all <hi>granted</hi> by your selves, or cannot be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</hi>
without shaking the very Foundations of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
2. That those which you proceed upon, are
some of them <hi>untrue,</hi> and most of them <hi>dubious</hi> and
<hi>questionable,</hi> none of them <hi>able</hi> to bear the weight
that you lay upon them; and some of them such as
the admission of, would give <hi>just cause</hi> to question the
whole Truth of Christian Religion. And both these
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, I crave leave to manifest unto you, whereby you
may the better judg whether the <hi>Scripture</hi> or your
Church be the best way to bring men unto <hi>settlement</hi>
in Religion, which is the thing enquired after.</p>
               <p>1. Protestants lay down this as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as the very beginning and first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of their confidence and Confession, that <hi>all
Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</hi> as the Holy
Ghost teacheth them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. That is, that the
<hi>Books of the Old and New Testament</hi> were all of them
written by the immediate guidance, direction, and
inspiration of God; <hi>the hand of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
speaks, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>being upon</hi> the Penmen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>in writing;</hi> and his Spirit, as <hi>Peter</hi> informs us,
<hi>speaking</hi> in them, 1 <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t.</hi> 1. 11. So that whatever is
contained and delivered in them, is <hi>given</hi> out from
God, and is received on his Authority. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
I suppose you grant to be <hi>true;</hi> do you not?
if you will deny it say so, and we will proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
untill we have proved it. I know you have various


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50044:84"/>
wayes laboured to <hi>undermine</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures; many Queries you put unto men, How
they <hi>can know it</hi> to be from God, to be <hi>true,</hi> from
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and not of men; many <hi>scruples</hi> you indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to possess them with, against its Authority; it is
not my present business to remove them: It is <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
unto mee, 1. That you your selves who <hi>differ</hi>
from us in other things, and with whom our contest
about the <hi>best way</hi> of coming to settlement in the
Truth alone, is, do acknowledg this Principle were
proceed upon to be <hi>true.</hi> And 2. That yee cannot
oppose it without setting your selves to <hi>digge</hi> up the
very <hi>foundations</hi> of Christian Religion, and to open a
way to let in an inundation of <hi>Atheism</hi> on the world.
So our first step is fixed on the grand <hi>fundamentall</hi>
Principle of all the Religion and acceptable worship
of God that is in the world.</p>
               <p>2. They affirm <hi>that this Scripture evidenceth it self
by many infallible <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to be so given by Inspiration
from God; and besides is witnessed so to be, by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Church of God from the dayes of</hi> Moses,
<hi>wherein it began to be written, to the dayes wherein we
live;</hi> our Lord Christ and his Apostles asserting and
confirming the same <hi>Testimony;</hi> which Testimony is
conveyed unto us by uninterrupted <hi>Catholick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The first part of this Position, I confess, <hi>some</hi>
of you deny; and the latter part of it you generally
all of you <hi>pervert,</hi> confining the Testimony mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto <hi>that</hi> of your present Church, which is a very
inconsiderable <hi>part</hi> of it, if any part at all. But how
groundlesly, how prejudicially, to the <hi>verity</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christian Religion in generall you do these
things, I shall briefly shew you.</p>
               <p>Some of you, I say deny the first part of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so doth <hi>Andradius Defens. Concil. Trident.</hi>

<hi>de Authoritate Eccles. &amp; Script.</hi> gathers up <hi>a many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
out of the Book of the Scripture, which he
declares to be altogether <hi>incredible,</hi> were it not for
the Authority of the Church I need not mention
any more of your Leaders, concurring with them;
you know who is of the <hi>same mind</hi> with them, if the
Author of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> be not unknown to you. Your
resolving <hi>Vniversal Tradition</hi> into the Authority of
your present Church, to which end there is a Book
written not long since by a <hi>Jesuit</hi> under the name of
<hi>Vincentius Severinus,</hi> is no less notorious. Some of
you, I confess, are more modest, and otherwise mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as to both parts of our Assertion. See <hi>Malderus
Episcop. Antwerp. de Object. Fidei,</hi> qu. 1. <hi>Vaselius

Hock. Alliacens. in Lib. 1. Sentent. Artic. 3. Gerson

twenty other places. But when you come to deal
with <hi>Protestants,</hi> and consider well the <hi>Tendency</hi> of
this Assertion, you use I consess an hundred <hi>rergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,</hi>
and are most unwilling to come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of it; and rather then <hi>suffer</hi> from it,
deny it downwright; and that with <hi>Scurrilous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi>
and Comparisons, likening it, as to any
characters of Gods truth and Holiness upon it, unto
<hi>Livy</hi>'s Story, yea <hi>Aesops</hi> Fables, or a <hi>Piece of Poetry.</hi>
And when you have done so, you apply your selves


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50044:85"/>
to the <hi>canvasing</hi> of <hi>Stories</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and
to find out appearing <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and tell us of the
uncertainty of the <hi>Authors</hi> of some particular <hi>Books;</hi>
that the whole is of its self <hi>a dead letter</hi> which can
prove nothing at all; enquiring, Who told us that the
<hi>Penmen</hi> of it were <hi>divinely inspired,</hi> seeing they <hi>testify</hi>
no such things of themselves and if they should, yet
others may do, and have done so, who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
were not so <hi>inspired;</hi> and ask us, Why we receive
the Gospel of <hi>Luke</hi> who was not an Apostle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that of <hi>Thomas</hi> who one; with many the like
<hi>Cavilling</hi> Exceptions.</p>
               <p>But (1.) That must needs be a <hi>bad Cause</hi> which
stands in need of such a Defence. Is this the voice
of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Esau?</hi> Are these the expressions of
<hi>Christians,</hi> or <hi>Pagans?</hi> from whose <hi>quiver</hi> are these
arrows taken? Is this fair, sober, Candid Christian
dealing? have you no way to defend the <hi>Authority
of your Church,</hi> but by Questioning the <hi>Authority
of the Scripture?</hi> Did ever any of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of
old, or any in the world before your selves, take
this course to plead their <hi>interests</hi> in any thing they
professed? Is this Practice <hi>Catholick,</hi> or like many
of your Principles; singular, your own, <hi>Donatisticall?</hi>
Is it any great sign that you have an interest in that
<hi>living Child,</hi> when you are so ready he should be
destroyed, rather than you would be cast in your
<hi>Contest</hi> with Protestants? (2.) Do you think that this
course of proclaiming to <hi>Atheists, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
that the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which all Christians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
against them to be the <hi>Word of the Living GOD,</hi>
given by inspiration from Him, and on which the
Faith of all the <hi>Martyrs</hi> who have suffered from their
opposition, rage, and cruelty, and of all others that
<hi>truly believe</hi> in Jesus Christ, was and is founded, and


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50044:86"/>
whereinto it is resolved, hath no Arguments of its
<hi>Divine Original</hi> implanted on it, no <hi>lines</hi> of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and Perfections of its <hi>Author</hi> drawn on it,
no <hi>power</hi> or efficacy towards the Consciences of men,
evidencing its Authority over them, no <hi>ability</hi> of
its self to comfort and support them in their tryals
and sufferings with the hope <hi>of things that are not
seen?</hi> Is this, think you, an <hi>acceptable service</hi> unto the
Lord Christ, who will one day judg the secrets of all
hearts according unto that Word? or, Is it not really
to <hi>expose</hi> Christian Religion to scorn and contempt?
And do you find so much sweetness in, <hi>Delus an Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus?
quis in hoste requirat,</hi> as to cast off <hi>all Reverence
of God</hi> and his Word, in the pursuit of the supposed
Adversaries of your earthly Interests? (3.) If your
Arguments and Objections are <hi>effectuall</hi> and <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
unto the end for which you intend them, will
not your direct issue be the utter overthrow of the
very <hi>foundation</hi> of the whole Profession of Christians
<hi>in the world?</hi> And are you, like <hi>Sampson,</hi> content to <hi>pull
down the house</hi> that must fall upon your selves also, so
that you may <hi>stifle</hi> Protestants with its sall? It may
be, it were well you should do so; were it an house
of <hi>Dagon,</hi> a Temple dedicated unto Idols: but, to
deal so with that <hi>wherein dwels the Majesty of the
Living GOD,</hi> is not so justifiable. It is true; <hi>Evert</hi>
this Principle, and you overthrow the <hi>foundation</hi> on
which the faith of Protestants is built; but it is no
less true, that you do the same to the <hi>foundation</hi> of
the Christian Faith in generall, wherein <hi>wee</hi> hope your
own concernment also lyes And this is the thing
that I am declaring unto you; namely, that either
you acknowledg the Principles on which <hi>Protestants</hi>
build their Faith and Profession, or by denying them
you open a door unto <hi>Atheism,</hi> at least to the


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50044:86"/>
extirpation of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> out of the world. I
confess you pretend a relief against the present <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>

as you say to give a <hi>Credibility</hi> unto the Scriptures,
though its own <hi>self-evidencing</hi> Power and Efficacy,
with the Confirmation of it by <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi>
exclusive to your <hi>present suffrage,</hi> be rejected. Now
I suppose you will grant, that the <hi>Prop</hi> you supply
men withall upon your casting down the foundations
on which they have laid the <hi>weight of their eternall
Salvation,</hi> had need be firm and immoveable. And
remember that you have to do with them, who
though they may be otherwise inclineable unto you,
<q>Non tamen ignorant quid distent aera a lupinis;</q>
and must use their <hi>own judgement</hi> in the Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what you tender unto them. And they Ask
you, 1. What will you do if it be as you say with
them who <hi>absolutely</hi> reject the Authority of your

                  </gap>ch, which is the condition of more than a <hi>moye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the Inhabitants of the world, to speak suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
within compass? And 2. What will you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
us to say to <hi>innumerable</hi> other Persons that are
pious and <hi>rational,</hi> who, upon the meer considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>lives</hi> of many, of the most, of the guides of
your Church, your <hi>bloody inhumane practices,</hi> your
pursuit of worldly <hi>carnall</hi> designs, your <hi>visible secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
interest wherein you are combined and united,
cannot perswade themselves, that the <hi>Testimony</hi> of
your Church in and about things that are <hi>invisible,</hi>
spirituall, heavenly, and eternall, is at all <hi>valuable,</hi>
much less that it is sufficient to bear the weight you
would lay upon it. 3. Was not this the way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of <hi>Vaninus</hi> for the Introduction of his <hi>Atheism;</hi>
first to <hi>question,</hi> sleight, and <hi>sophistically</hi> except


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50044:87"/>
against the old approved <hi>Arguments,</hi> and Evidences
manifesting the beeing and existence of a <hi>Divine self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subsisting
Power,</hi> substituting in their room, for the
confirmation of it, his own <hi>Sophisms,</hi> which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
knew might be easily discussed and disproved?
Do you deal any better with us in decrying the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's
<hi>self-evidencing Efficacy,</hi> with the <hi>Testimony</hi>
given unto it by God himself, substituting nothing
in the room thereof but the Authority of your
Church? A man certainly can take up nothing upon
the <hi>sole</hi> Authority of your Church, untill, contrary
to the <hi>pretensions,</hi> Reasons, and Arguments of far a
greater number of Christians than your selves, he
acknowledge you to be <hi>a true Church</hi> at least; if
not the <hi>only</hi> Church in the world. Now, how I pray
will you bring him into that state and <hi>condition</hi> that
he may <hi>rationally</hi> make any such judgement? How
will you prove unto him that there is any such thing
as a <hi>Church</hi> in the World; that a Church hath <hi>any</hi>
Authority, that its <hi>Testimony</hi> can make any thing
<hi>credible,</hi> or meet to be believed, You must prove
these things to him, or whatever <hi>assent</hi> he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what you say, is from <hi>fanaticall credulity.</hi> To
suppose that he should <hi>believe</hi> you upon <hi>your word,
because you are the Church,</hi> is to suppose that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<hi>that,</hi> which you are yet but attempting to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi>
him to believe. If you persist to press him
without other <hi>proof,</hi> not only to believe what you
<hi>first</hi> said unto him, but also even this, that whatever
you <hi>shall say</hi> to him hereafter that he must <hi>believe</hi> it,
because you <hi>say</hi> it; Will not any rationall man <hi>nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
at your unreasonable importunity? and tell you
that men who have a mind to be <hi>befooled,</hi> may meer
with such <hi>Alchymisticall</hi> pretenders all the world
over. Will you perswade him that <hi>you are the


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50044:87"/>
Church,</hi> and that the Church is furnished with the
Authority mentioned, by <hi>rational Arguments?</hi> I
wish you would inform me of any <hi>one</hi> that you can
make use of, that doth not include a <hi>Supposition</hi> of
something <hi>unproved</hi> by you, and which can never
be <hi>proved</hi> but by your own Authority, which is the
thing in Question, or the <hi>immediate Authority</hi> of
God which you reject. A number indeed of <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
or, it may be, <hi>Probabilities</hi> you may heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which yet upon examination will not be found
so much neither, unless a man will swallow amongst
them that which is destitute of all <hi>Probability;</hi> but
what is included in the evidence given unto it by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation which is not yet pleaded unto him.
It may be then you will work <hi>Miracles</hi> to confirm
your Assertions. Let us see them. For although ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many things are <hi>requisite</hi> to manifest any <hi>works</hi> of
<hi>wonder</hi> that may be wrought in the world to be <hi>reall
Miracles,</hi> and good Caution be required to judge
unto what <hi>end</hi> Miracles are wrought; yet if we
may have any tolerable evidence of your <hi>working
Miracles</hi> in Confirmation of this Assertion, that
you are the <hi>true and only Church of God,</hi> with the
other Inferences depending thereon, which we are in
the Consideration of, you will find us very <hi>easie to be
treated</hi> withall. But herein also you fail. You have
then no way to <hi>deal</hi> with such a man as we first sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
but as you <hi>do</hi> with us; and produce <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Scripture</hi> to prove and confirm the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of your Church; and then you will quickly find
<hi>where</hi> you are, and what snares you have cast your
selves into. Will not a man who hears you proving
the <hi>Authority of your Church</hi> by the Scripture, ask
you, And whence hath this <hi>Scripture its Authority?</hi>
yea that is supposed to be the thing in <hi>Question,</hi>


                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:50044:88"/>
which denying unto it an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, you yet produce
to confirm the Authority of that, by whose Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
alone, its self is <hi>evidenced</hi> to have any Authority
at all. <hi>Rest</hi> in the Authority of God <hi>manifesting</hi> its
self in the Scripture, witnessed unto by the <hi>Catholick

prove the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the Word of God by the

Would you knew where to begin and where
to end? But you are indeed in a <hi>Circle</hi> which hath
neither beginning nor ending; I know not when we
shall be enabled to say,
<q>Inventus, Chrysippe, tui finitor acervi.</q>
Now do you think it <hi>reasonable</hi> that we should leave
our stable and immoveable firm <hi>foundations,</hi> to run
round with you in this <hi>endless Circle,</hi> untill through
giddiness we fall into Unbelief or Atheism? This is
that which I told you before, you must either <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi>
our Principle in this matter to be <hi>firm</hi> and
certain, or open a door to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Christian Religion; seeing you are not able
to <hi>substitute</hi> and thing in the room thereof, that is
able to bear the <hi>weight</hi> that must be laid upon it, if
we believe. For how should you do so; <hi>shall man
be like unto God,</hi> or equall unto him? The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
we rest in is <hi>Divine,</hi> fortified from all Objections
by the strongest <hi>humane Testimony</hi> possible, namely

4. your Importunity in <hi>opposing</hi> this Principle, is so

you openly oppose your selves to <hi>express</hi> Testimonies

<hi>Clemens Alexand. Strom.</hi> 7. speaks fully to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as he doth also <hi>lib.</hi> 4. where he plainly affirms
that the Church proved the <hi>Scripture by its self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
other things,</hi> as the Unity of the Deity, <hi>by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
But his own words in the former place are
worth the recital, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>For the beginning of Faith, or Principle of
what we teach, we have the Lord; who in sundry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and by divers parts, by the Prophets, Gospel, and
holy Apostles, leads us to knowledge. And if any one
suppose, that a Principle stands in need of another</hi> (to
prove it) <hi>he destroys the nature of a Principle;</hi> or, <hi>it
is no longer preserved a Principle.</hi> This is that we
say: The Scripture, the <hi>Old and New Testament,</hi> is the
Principle of our Faith. This is <hi>proved by its self,</hi> to
be of the Lord who is its Author; and if we cause it
to depend on any thing else, it is no longer the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of our Faith and Profession. And a little after,
where he hath shewed that a <hi>Principle</hi> ought not to
be disputed, nor to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of any debate,
he addes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
<hi>It is meet then, that receiving by Faith the most
absolute Principle without other demonstration, and


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50044:89"/>
taking demonstrations of the Principle from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
its self, that we be instructed by the voice of the
Lord unto the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> That is;
we <hi>believe the Scripture</hi> for its own sake, and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
that God gives unto it, in it and by it; and
do prove every thing else by it, and so are confirmed
in the <hi>faith</hi> or knowledge of the Truth. So he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explains himself, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>For we do not simply or absolutely attend or give heed
unto men determining or defining, against whom it is
equall that we may define or declare our judgements.</hi>
So it is; whilest the <hi>Authority</hi> of man, or men, any
<hi>Society</hi> of men in the world, is pleaded, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of others, may be as <hi>good reason</hi> be objected
against it; as whilest, you plead your Church and its
<hi>definitions,</hi> others may on as good grounds oppose
theirs unto you therein. And therefore <hi>Clemens</hi>
proceeds; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>For if it be not sufficient
meerly to declare or assert that which appears to be
truth, but also to make that Credible or fit to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
which is spoken, we seek not after the Testimony that
is given by men, but we confirm that which is proposed,
or enquired about with the voice of the Lord, which is
more full than any demonstration, or rather is its self
the only demonstration; according to the knowledge
whereof they that have tasted of the Scriptures, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi>
Into the <hi>voice,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of God alone, the
Church then <hi>resolved</hi> their Faith, this <hi>only</hi> they built
upon, acknowledging all <hi>humane Testimony</hi> to be too


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50044:89"/>
weak, and infirm to be made a foundation for it;
And this <hi>voice of God</hi> in the Scripture evidencing its
self so to be, is the only <hi>Demonstration</hi> of Faith which
they rested in; whereupon a little after he addes
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
<hi>so wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
perfect Demonstrations out of the Scriptures,
are by Faith demonstratively assured or perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Truth of the things proposed.</hi> This was
the Profession of the Church of old; this the <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi>
of their faith; This is that which <hi>Protestants</hi>
in this Case adhere unto. They <hi>proved</hi> the Scripture
to be from God, as he elswhere speaks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as we also do. <hi>Strom.</hi> 4. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
speaks <hi>Salvianus</hi> de Gub. Lib. 3. <hi>Alia omnia
(idest humana dicta) argumentis &amp; testibus egent;
Dei autem Sermo ipse sibi test is est, quia necesseest ut
quicquid incorrupta verityas loquitur, incorruptum
sit testimonium veritatis: All other sayings stand in
need of Arguments and witnesses to confirm them, the
Word of God is witness to its self; For, whatever the
Truth incorrupted speaks, must of necessity be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt
Testimony of Truth,</hi> And although some of
them allowed the <hi>Testimony of the Church</hi> as a motive
unto believing the Gospell or things preached from
it, yet as to <hi>the belief of the Scripiure</hi> with faith Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Supernaturall to be the Word of God, they
required but these two things; 1. That <hi>Self-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
in the Scripture its self which is needfull for an
<hi>indemonstrable Principle;</hi> from which, and by which,
all other things are to be demonstrated: And that
Self-Evidence <hi>Clemens</hi> puts in the place of all Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.
2. The <hi>Efficacy of the Spirit</hi> in the heart,
to enable it to give a <hi>saving assent</hi> unto the Truth
proposed unto it: Thus <hi>Austin</hi> in his Confessions


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50044:90"/>

with so great Authority thou hast setled almost in all
Nations, were to be blamed; but those who believe
them not, and that I should not hearken unto any of

I would bear and understand, O Lord, how thou hast
made the Heavens and the earth:</hi> Moses <hi>wrote this, he
wrote it and is gene, and he is gone to Thee. For now
he is not present with mee; if he were, I would lay hold
on him, and ask him and beseech him for thy sake, that
he would unfold these things unto me, and I would
cause the ears of my body to attend unto the words of
his mouth. But if he should speak in the Hebrew tongue,
he would only in vain strike upon my outward sense,
and my mind within would not be affected with it. If
he speak in Latine, I should know what he sayed; but
whence should I know that he spake the Truth? should
I know this also from him? The Truth, that is neither
Hebrew, Greck, Latine, nor expressed in any Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Language, would say unto me inwardly in the
dwelling place of my thoughts, without the organs of
mouth or tongue, or noyse of syllables, He speaks the
Truth; and I with confidaence should say unto him thy
servam, Thou speakest the Truth. Seeing therefore I
cannot enquire of him, I beseech Thee that art Truth,
with whom he being filled spake the Truth, I beseech
thee O my God, pardon my sinnes, and thou who gavest
unto him by servant to speak these things, grant unto
me tounderstand Thus</hi> this holy man ascribes

I have often thought with my self Whence the
Scripture is so perswasive, whence it doth so powerfully
influence the minds of the hearers; whence it hath so

it proposeth. Non, <hi>saith he,</hi> est hoc imputandum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum

But whence are wee perswaded, that it is from the First
Verity, but from it Self; Its own Authority draws us
to believe it. But whence obtains it this Authority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
we see not God preaching, writing, teaching; but yet,
as if we had seen him, we believe and firmly hold that
which we read to have come from the Holy Ghost. It
may be that this is a reason of our firm adhering unto
it, that the Truth in it is more solid, though not more
clear (<hi>than in any other way of proposall</hi>) and all
truth hath a power to incline unto belief; the greater
the Truth the greater its power, and the greatest Truth
must have the greatest power so to incline us. But, why
then do not all believe the Gospell? I answer, because
all are not drawn of God. There is then in the holy
Scripture somewhat more sublime than Nature, that
is, the Divine Inspiration from whence it is, and the
Divine Irradiation wherewith it is accompanied. <hi>This
is the Principle of Protestants. The Sacred Scripture
is</hi> credible <hi>as proceeding from the first Verity: this
it manifests by its</hi> own Light and Efficacy; <hi>and we
are enabled to believe it by the</hi> effectuall <hi>working of
the Spirit of God in our hearts. Whence our Saviour
asks the</hi> Jews, <hi>Joh 5.</hi> If you believe not the writing of
Moses, how will you believe my words. <hi>They who
will not believe the</hi> written Word <hi>of the Scripture,
upon the Authority that it hath in its self, would
not</hi> believe <hi>if Christ should</hi> personally <hi>speak unto
them. So saith</hi> Theophylact <hi>on the place;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>?</p>
               <p>3. Protestants <hi>believe and profess,</hi> that the End


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50044:92"/>
wherefore God gave forth his Word by Inspiration, was
that it might be a stable Infallible Revelation of his
mind and will, as to that knowledge which he would
have mankind entertain of him, with that Worship
and Obedience which he requireth of them, that so they
may please him in this world, and come unto the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of him unto all eternity. <hi>God who is the</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
object, <hi>is also the</hi> prime Cause <hi>of all Religious
worship. What is</hi> due <hi>unto him as the</hi> first Cause, <hi>last
End, and Soveraign Lord of all, as to the substance
of it, and what he further</hi> appoints <hi>himself, as to the</hi>
manner <hi>of its performance, suited unto his own Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Condition wherein in reference unto
our</hi> Last end <hi>we stand and are, making up the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le
of it. That he hath given his</hi> Word <hi>to reveal these
things unto us, to be our</hi> Rule, <hi>Guide, and Direction
in our wayes, walkings, and universal deportment
before him, is, as I take it, a</hi> fundamentall Principle <hi>of
our Christian Profession. Neither do I know that
this is denied by</hi> your Church; <hi>although you startle
at the inferences that are</hi> justly <hi>made from it. I shall
not need therefore to adde any thing in its</hi> Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>but only mind you again, that the calling of it
into</hi> question, <hi>is directly against the very</hi> heart <hi>of all
Religion, and the unanimous consent of all that in
the world are called</hi> Christians, <hi>or ever were so. Yea,
and it must be granted, or the whole Scripture
esteemed a</hi> Fable, <hi>because it frequently declares, that
it is given unto us of God for this End and Purpose.
And hence do Protestants inferre two other</hi> Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>on which they build their Perswasion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the</hi> Vnity of Faith, <hi>and the proper means of their</hi>
Settlement <hi>therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>That</hi> therefore <hi>the Scripture is perfect and every
way compleat;</hi> namely with respect unto that <hi>end</hi>


                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:50044:92"/>
whereunto of God it is designed. A <hi>Perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Revelation of the Will of God</hi> as to his Worship,
and our Obedience. And we cannot but wonder
that any who profess themselves to <hi>believe</hi> that it was
given for the <hi>end</hi> mentioned, should not have that
sacred <hi>Reverence</hi> for the Wisdome, Goodness, and
Love of its Author unto mankind, as freely <hi>to assent</hi>
unto this Inference and Conclusion, <hi>He is our Rock,
and his work is perfect.</hi> And lest any men should
please themselves in the imagination of <hi>contributing</hi>
any thing towards the effecting of the end of his
Word, by a <hi>supply</hi> unto it, he hath strictly <hi>forbidden</hi>
them any such addition, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. &amp; 12. 12. <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 6. Which if it were not compleat in reference
unto its <hi>proper End,</hi> would hold no great <hi>correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
with that Love and goodness which the same
Word every where declares to be in Him. I suppose,
you know with how many <hi>express Testimonies</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
its self, this Truth is confirmed, which, added
unto that <hi>light and evidence,</hi> which as a <hi>deduction</hi>
from the former <hi>fundamental Truth</hi> it hath in its self,
is very sufficient to render it unquestionable. You
may at your leasure, besides these forenamed consult,

<hi>Rev</hi> 22. 18. For though <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture are not
appointed for us to <hi>throw at one anothers heads</hi> as you
talk in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> yet they are for us to <hi>use</hi> and insist
on in the Confirmation of the Truth; if we may take
the <hi>example</hi> of Christ and all his Apostles, for our
warrant. And it were endless to recite the <hi>full</hi> and
<hi>plain Testimonies,</hi> of the Ancient Fathers and


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50044:93"/>
                  <hi>Councels</hi> to this purpose. Neither is that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
design; though I did somwehat occasionally <hi>that
way,</hi> upon the former Principle. It shall suffice me
to shew, that the <hi>deny all</hi> of this Assertion also, as it is
inferred from the foregoing <hi>Principle,</hi> is Prejudiciall,
if not <hi>pernicious</hi> to Christian Religion in Generall.
The whole of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Profession</hi> is resolved into
the <hi>known Excellencies</hi> and Perfections of the Nature
of God. Amongst these, there are none that have a
more <hi>immediate</hi> and quickning influence into them,
than his <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Grace, Care</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, unto whom he is pleased to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Nor is there any <hi>property</hi> of his <hi>Nature</hi> that in his
Word he more frequently gives testimony unto. And
all of them doth he declare himself to have <hi>exalted</hi>
and glorified in a signall manner, in that <hi>Revelation,</hi>
which he hath made of himself, his Mind and Will
therein. I suppose, this cannot be denied by <hi>any,</hi>
who hath the least sense of the importance of the
things revealed. Now, if the <hi>Revelation</hi> made for
the End before proposed be not <hi>perfect</hi> and compleat,
that is <hi>sufficient</hi> to enable a man to <hi>know</hi> so much of
God his Mind and Will, and to <hi>direct</hi> him so in his
Worship and Obedience unto him, as that he may
<hi>please him here,</hi> and come to the <hi>fruition</hi> of him
hereafter; it must needs become an evident means of
<hi>deceiving him,</hi> and ruining him, and that to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
And the least fear of any such <hi>event,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
all the <hi>notions</hi> which he had before entertained
of those blessed <hi>Properties</hi> of the Divine Nature,
and so consequently disposeth him unto <hi>Atheism.</hi>
For if a man hath once received the Scripture as the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> and that given unto him to be <hi>his guide</hi>
unto Heaven, by God himself; if one shall come to
him and tell him, Yea but it is not <hi>a perfect Guide,</hi>


                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50044:93"/>
but though you should attend sincerely to all the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi>
that it gives you, yet you may come short
of your <hi>Duty</hi> and Expectation; you may neither
<hi>please</hi> God here, nor come to the <hi>fruition</hi> of Him
hereafter: In case he should assent unto this <hi>suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
can he entertain any other thoughts of God,
but such as our <hi>first Parents</hi> did, when by attendance
unto the false insinuations of the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> they
cast off his Soveraignty, and their dependance on
him? Neither can you relieve him against such
thoughts by your pretended <hi>Traditionall supply;</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it will still be impossible for him to look on this
<hi>Revelation</hi> of the Will of God, as <hi>imperfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient</hi>
for the End, for which it plainly professeth
its self to be given forth by him, without some <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment</hi>
on those notions of his Nature which he
had before received. For it will presently occurr un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, that seeing this <hi>way of revealing</hi> himself for
the Ends mentioned, is <hi>good</hi> and approved of Himself
so to be, if he hath not made it <hi>compleat</hi> for that
end, it was either because he <hi>could not,</hi> and where
then is his <hi>Wisdome;</hi> or because he would not, and
where then is his <hi>Love, Care, and Goodness;</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he saith, <hi>he hath done,</hi> what you would have
him to believe, that <hi>he hath not done,</hi> where is his
<hi>Truth</hi> and Veracity? Certainly a man that serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ponders what he hath to do, and knows the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an irrationall <hi>fanatical Credo,</hi> will conclude,
that either the Scripture is to be <hi>received</hi> as <hi>Perfect,</hi>
or not to be received at all.</p>
               <p>2. Protestants conclude hence, <hi>That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
given of God for this purpose is intelligible unto
men, using the means by God appointed to come to the
understanding of his Mind and Will therein.</hi> I know
many of your way are pleased grievously to mistake


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50044:94"/>
our <hi>intention in this</hi> Infêrence and Conclusion.
Sometimes they would impose upon us to say, that
<hi>All places of Scripture, all words and sentences</hi> in it
are <hi>plain,</hi> and of an obvious sense, and easie to be
understood. And yet this you <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> know
if you please, and I am sure <hi>ought</hi> to know, before you
talk of these things with us, that we absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
It is one thing to say, that all <hi>necessary Truth</hi> is
plainly and clearly revealed in the Scripture, which
we do say; and another that <hi>every text and passage</hi>
in the Scripture is plain and easie to be understood,
which we do not say; nor ever thought, as confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that to say so, were to contradict our own <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi>
and that of the Disciples of Christ in all
ages. Sometimes you faign, as though we <hi>asserted</hi>
all the <hi>things that are revealed</hi> in the Scripture, to be
plain and obvious to every mans understanding;
whereas we acknowledge that the <hi>things themselves</hi>
revealed are many of them <hi>mysterious,</hi> surpassing the
comprehension of any man in this world; and only
maintain that the <hi>propositions</hi> wherein the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them is made, are <hi>plain and intelligible</hi> unto
them that use the means appointed of God to come
to a right understanding of them. And sometimes
you would commit this with <hi>another Principle</hi> of
ours; whereby we assert that the <hi>supernaturall Light
of Grace</hi> to be wrought in our hearts by the Holy
Ghost, is necessary to give unto us a <hi>saving perception</hi>
and understanding of the Mind of God in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
for what needs such <hi>speciall assistance</hi> in so
plain a matter? as though the asserting of <hi>perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in the <hi>object,</hi> made ability to discern in the <hi>subject</hi>
altogether unnecessary: Or that he who affirms the
Sun to give <hi>light,</hi> doth at the same time affirm also
that men have no need of <hi>eyes</hi> to see it withall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50044:94"/>
we know there is a vast difference between a <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
speculative apprehension,</hi> and perception of the
meaning and Truth of the Propositions contained in
the Scripture, which we acknowledge that every
<hi>reasonable unprejudiced Person</hi> may attain unto; and
a gracious <hi>saving spirituall perception</hi> of them, and
assent unto them with faith Divine and Supernatural;
and this we say is the especiall work of the Holy
Ghost in the hearts of the Elect. And I know not
how many other <hi>exceptions</hi> you make to keep your
selves from a <hi>right understanding</hi> of our intention in
this Inference; but, as your self elsewhere learnedly
observes, <hi>who so blind as he that will not see?</hi> I shall
therefore once more, that we may proceed, declare
unto you <hi>what it is</hi> that we intend in this Assertion.
It is, namely; that <hi>the things which are revealed in
the Scripture,</hi> to the end that by the belief of them,
and obedience unto them, we may <hi>please</hi> God, are
<hi>so proposed and declared,</hi> that a man, <hi>any man,</hi> free
from prejudices and temptations; in and by the use
of the <hi>means</hi> appointed him of God for that purpose,
may come to the <hi>understanding</hi> (and that infallibly)
of <hi>all</hi> that God would have him <hi>know</hi> or <hi>do</hi> in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
there being no defect or hinderance in <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
or manner of its revealing things necessary,
that should <hi>obstruct</hi> him therein. What are the
<hi>means</hi> appointed of God for this purpose, we do
not <hi>now</hi> enquire, but shall <hi>anon</hi> declare. What <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
blindness, or darkness, there is, or may be, in and
upon the <hi>minds</hi> of men in their depraved <hi>lapsed</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
what disadvantages they may be cast under
by their <hi>prejudices, Traditions,</hi> negligences, sins, and
prophaneness, belongs not unto our present disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
That which we assert concerns meerly the
<hi>manner of the proposall of the Truths</hi> to be believed,


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50044:95"/>
which are revealed in the Scripture; and this we say
is such, as that there is <hi>no impossibility,</hi> no nor great
difficulty, but that a man may come to the <hi>right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
of them; not as to the <hi>comprehension</hi> of
the things themselves, but the <hi>perception</hi> of the sense
of the <hi>Propositions</hi> wherein they are expressed. And
this Assertion of ours, is, as the former, <hi>grounded</hi> on
the Scripture its self. See if you please, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.
11. <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 19. 9. and 119. 105. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
3. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 19. And to deny it, is to pluck up all
Religion by the roots, and to turn men loose unto
<hi>Scepticism, Libertinism,</hi> and <hi>Atheism;</hi> and that with
such an horrible <hi>reproach</hi> unto God himself, as that
nothing more abominable can be invented. The
<hi>Devil</hi> of old, being not able to give out <hi>certain</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
unto them that came to onquire about their
Concernments at his <hi>Oracles,</hi> put them off a long
time with dubious, <hi>aenigmaticall,</hi> unintelligible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisms.
But when once the world had by <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
study, and observation, improved its self into a
<hi>Wisdome</hi> beyond the pitch of its first <hi>rudeness,</hi> men
began generally to <hi>despise</hi> what they saw could not be
certainly understood. This made the <hi>Devil</hi> pluck
in his horns, as not finding it for the interest of his
kingdome to expose himself to be <hi>scoffed</hi> at by them,
with whose follies and <hi>fanaticall</hi> credulity in esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>highly</hi> of that which could not be understood, he
had for many generations sported himself. And do
they not <hi>blasphemously</hi> expose the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the true,
holy, and living God, to no less contempt, who for
their own <hi>sinister</hi> ends would frighten men from them
with the ugly scare-crow of <hi>obscurity,</hi> or their not
being <hi>intelligible</hi> unto every man by the use of means,
so far as he is concerned to know them, and the
mind of God in them. And herein also Protestants


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50044:95"/>
stand as firmly as the fundamentals of Christianity
will bear them.</p>
               <p>4. Protestants believe, that <hi>it is the Duty of all men
who desire to know the will of God, and to worship him
according unto his mind, to use diligence in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the means appointed for that end, to come unto a
right and full understanding of all things in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
wherein their faith and obedience are concerned.</hi>
This <hi>necessarily</hi> follows from the Principles before
laid down. Nor is it <hi>possible</hi> it should be otherwise.
It is doubtless incumbent on every man to <hi>study</hi> and
know his <hi>Duty;</hi> that cannot be a mans <hi>Duty</hi> which
he is not bound to know, especially not such a <hi>Duty</hi>
as whereon his eternall welfare should depend: And
I suppose a man can take no better Course to come to
the knowledge of his <hi>Duty,</hi> than that which God
hath appointed for that purpose. The <hi>Commands</hi>
and <hi>Exhortations</hi> which we have given us in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
for our <hi>Diligence</hi> in this matter, with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
and improvements of them in the <hi>Writings</hi>
of the Fathers, are so obvious, trite, and known,
that it were meer loss of time to insist on the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. I suppose, I should speak within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
if I should say, that one <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth in a
<hi>hundred places</hi> exhort Christians of all sorts, to the
diligent study and search of the Scriptures, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> not the most plain and
easie part of them. I know, the <hi>practise</hi> of your
Church lyes to the contrary, and what you plead in
the justification of that practise; but I am sorry both
for Her and you; both for the <hi>contrivers</hi> of and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
unto this abomination: and I fear what your
<hi>accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> will be as to this matter, at the last day.
God having granted the <hi>inestimable benefit of his
Word</hi> unto mankind, revealing therein unto them


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50044:96"/>
the <hi>only way</hi> by which they may attain unto a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
eternity; Is it not the greatest <hi>ingratitude</hi> that
any man can possibly contract the guilt of, to <hi>neglect</hi>
the use of it? What then is your Condition, who,
upon sleight and <hi>triviall</hi> pretences, set up your own
Wisdome and Authority, against the Wisdome and
Authority of God; advising and <hi>commanding</hi> men,
upon the pain of <hi>your displeasure</hi> in this world, not
to attend unto that which God commands them to
attend unto, on pain of <hi>his displeasure</hi> in the world
to come? So that though I confess that you <hi>deny</hi>
this Principle, yet I cannot see but that you do so,
not only upon the <hi>hazard</hi> of your own souls, and the
souls of them that attend unto you, seeing, <hi>that if the
blind lead the blind, both must fall into the ditch;</hi> but
also, that you do it to the great <hi>prejudice</hi> of Christian
Religion in the very foundations of it. For what
can a man rationally conclude, <q>that shall see you
<hi>driving all Persons,</hi>
                  </q> and that on no small penalties,
excepting <hi>your selves</hi> who are concerned in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
and some <hi>few others</hi> whom you suppose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<hi>initiated in your Mysteries,</hi> from the reading
and study of those Books, wherein the world knows,
and your selves confess, that the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Christian
Religion are contained; but that there are some
things in them like the <hi>hidden Sacra</hi> of the old <hi>Pagan
Hierophants,</hi> which may not be disclosed, because
however countenanced by a remote veneration, yet
are indeed <hi>turpia</hi> or <hi>ridicula,</hi> things to be <hi>ashamed</hi>
of, or <hi>scorned?</hi> And the Truth is, some of your <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
have spoken very <hi>suspiciously</hi> this way; whilest
they justifie your practise in <hi>driving</hi> the people from
the study of the Scripture, by intimations of things
and expressions, not so <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>chast</hi> as to be fit for
the knowledge of the promiscuous multitude; when


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50044:96"/>
in the mean time Themselves or their <hi>Associates</hi> do
publish unto all the world, in their <hi>rules and directions
for Confession,</hi> such abominable filth and ribaldry, as
I think was never by any other means vented amongst
mankind.</p>
               <p>5. Protestants say <hi>that the Lord Christ hath insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
his Church, and therein appointed a Ministry, to
preside over the rest of his Disciples in his Name, and
to unfold un to them his mind and will as recorded in his
Word;</hi> for which end he hath promised his <hi>presence</hi>
with them by his Spirit unto the <hi>end of the World,</hi> to
enable them <hi>in an humble dependance</hi> on his assistance,
to find out and declare his Commands and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto their brethren. This Position, I suppose,
you will not <hi>contend</hi> with us about; although I know
that you put <hi>another sense</hi> upon most of the terms
of it, than the Scripture will allow, or wee can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of.</p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Principles</hi> of Protestants; this is the
Progress of their Faith in coming unto <hi>settlement</hi> and
assurance. These are their Foundations, which are
as <hi>unquestionable</hi> as any thing in Christianity; the
<hi>most</hi> of them, your selves being judges. And from
them, one of these two things will <hi>necessarily</hi> follow;
Either that all men, unto whom the Word of God
doth come, will come to an <hi>agreement</hi> in the Truth,
or the Unity of Faith; or Secondly, That it is their
<hi>own fault</hi> if they do not so do: For what upon these
Principles should hinder them from so doing? <hi>All
saving Truth</hi> is revealed by God in the Scripture,
unto <hi>the end</hi> that men may come to the knowledge
of it. It is <hi>so revealed</hi> by Him, that it is <hi>possible,</hi>
and with his assistance, <hi>easie</hi> formen to know aright
his Mind and Will about the things so revealed: and
be hath appointed <hi>regular wayes</hi> and means for men


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50044:97"/>
to wait upon him in and by, for the <hi>obtaining</hi> of
his assistance. Now pray revive your <hi>Question</hi> that
gave occasion unto this discourse; however men
may <hi>differ in Religion,</hi> why is not the Scripture <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
to bring them unto an agreement and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Take heed that in your <hi>Answer,</hi> you deny not
some Principle that will <hi>involve</hi> the whole interest of
Christianity in its ruine: Where is the defect? where
the hinderance, why all men upon these Principles
however <hi>differing</hi> at present, may not come to a full
Settlement and Agreement? I hope, you will find
<hi>none</hi> but what are in them selves; and for them; <hi>ipsi-viderint;</hi>
the Scripture is blameless. Here is <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
of Revelation from God, <hi>Fullness</hi> of that
Revelation as to our Duty, <hi>Clearness</hi> and perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
for our understanding of it, <hi>Means</hi> appointed and
sanctified for that end; what I pray is wanting? All
Truths wherein it is the Duty of men to agree are
<hi>fixed</hi> and stated, so that it can never be <hi>lawfull</hi> for
any man, in any generation, to call any of them into
question; <hi>plain</hi> and evident, that no man can mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
the mind of God in them in things wherein his
Duty is concerned, without his own <hi>crime</hi> and guilt.
You will say then, it may be, <hi>But why then do not men
agree, why do you not agree among your selves,</hi> but I
would hope, that it is scarcely possible for any man to
be so <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>Condition</hi> of mankind, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them of the <hi>best</hi> of men, as seriously to ask
this Question. Are not all men <hi>naturally blind</hi> in
the things of God? Do not the <hi>best of men</hi> know on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in part? have not the different <hi>tempers,</hi> constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Educations of men, a great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their understandings and judgements? Besides do
not <hi>Lusts,</hi> Corruptions, <hi>Carnall Interests,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto Worldly things bear sway sin the minds of


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50044:97"/>
many that profess Christian Religion? Are not many
prepossessed with <hi>prejudices, traditions,</hi> customes and
usages against the Truth? And are not these things
and the like, <hi>sufficient</hi> to keep up variance in the world
without the least suspition of any <hi>disability</hi> in the
Scripture to bring them to an holy <hi>agreement</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
<hi>Settlement?</hi> Neither is there any <hi>other way</hi>
for men to come unto <hi>Settlement</hi> and Agreement in
Religion according to the mind of God, but that only
which hath been now proposed, and this they <hi>will
come</hi> unto, when all men shall be perswaded to <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their understandings</hi> to the obedience of Faith.
I deny not but that by <hi>outward force</hi> and compulsion,
by <hi>supine negligence</hi> of their own concernments, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to <hi>btehink</hi> themselves, and such other wayes
and means, some men may come to <hi>some Agreement</hi>
amongst themselves in the things of Religion. But
this <hi>Agreement,</hi> we say, is not of God, it is not built
upon the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the foundation of
faith towards God,</hi> and so is of no <hi>esteem</hi> with him.
That such is all the <hi>Vnity</hi> which on your Principles
you are able to bring men unto, wee shall manifest
in our next Discourse. For the present, I dare <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi>
you, or any man in the world, to question or
oppose any one of the <hi>Principles</hi> before laid down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I shall close this Discourse with a passage out
of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> which fully confirms all that I have
asserted; it is in <hi>Homil</hi> 33. <hi>in Act. Apost. Chap.</hi> 15.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>There are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
seditions, and tumults amongst you: what
opinion to choose I know not: every one sayes, I am in
the Truth; and I am utterly ignorant of what is in
the Scripture about these things.</hi> Do you know <hi>whose</hi>
Objections these are, and by whom they have been
lately mannaged? Will you hear what <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
answers? Saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>This makes wholly
for us; for if wee should say, that wee believe on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
reasonings, thou maist justly be troubled; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee profess that we believe in the Scriptures, which
are plain and true, it is easie for thee to judg and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
He that yeilds his consent unto them, he is a
Christian; and he that contends against them, is farre
from the Rule of Christianity.</hi> And in the process of
his Discourse, which is well worth the perusall before
you write any more <hi>familiar Epistles,</hi> he requires
no more of a man to settle him in the Truth, but that
he <hi>receive the Scripture</hi> and have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>a mind

               <p>It remaineth now that wee consider <hi>what it is</hi> that
you propose unto men to bring them unto a <hi>Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in Religion, and all Christians to the <hi>Vnity of
Faith,</hi> with the Principles that you proceed upon to
that purpose: which because I would not too far

               <p>YOur Plea to this purpose is blended with <hi>a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
pretence of <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> Sometimes you
tell us of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his succession to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter;</hi> And
sometimes of the <hi>Church</hi> and its Authority. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you speak as if <hi>both</hi> these were one and the
same; And sometimes you seem to distinguish
them. Some of you, lay most weight upon the
<hi>Papall suceession</hi> and <hi>Infallibility;</hi> and some on
the Churches <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> I shall
crave leave to take your <hi>pleas a-sunder:</hi> and first to
consider what force they have in them as unto
the End whereunto they are applied, <hi>severally and
apart;</hi> and then see what in their <hi>joint concurrence</hi> they
can contribute thereunto. And what ever <hi>you think</hi>
of it, I suppose this course of proceeding will please
<hi>ingenuous persons,</hi> and Lovers of Truth; because
it enables them to take a <hi>distinct view</hi> of the things
whereon they are to give judgment. Whereas in
your handling of them, something you <hi>suppose,</hi>
something you <hi>insinuate,</hi> something you <hi>openly averr,</hi>
yet so confound them with other <hi>heterogenious</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
that it can hardly be discerned what <hi>grounds</hi>
you build upon. A way of proceeding, which as it
argues a <hi>secret guilt</hi> and fear of bringing forth your
Principles to Light, so a gross kind of <hi>Sophistry,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
by all Masters of Reason whatsoever. They
would not have us <hi>fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50044:99"/>
dare lucem,</hi> darken things clear and perspicuous in
themselves; but to make things dark and confused,
perspicuous. And the Orator tells us, that <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
his discourse was ambiguous, because his <hi>Sententia</hi>
was <hi>inhonesta,</hi> his <hi>Opinion shamefull.</hi> And to what
purpose should any one contend with you about
such generall ambiguous expressions; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
I shall then begin with the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi>
because you seem to lay most weight thereon
and tell us plainly, pag. 379 of your Fiat, Edit, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>,
<hi>That if the Pope be not an unerring guide in Affairs of
Religion, all is lost;</hi> And that, <hi>A man once rid of his
Authority, may as easily deride, and as solidly confute
the Incarnation, as the Sprinkling of Holy water;</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
our faith of the <hi>Incarnation of Christ</hi> into his
Authority or Testimony: Yea and in the same page;
<hi>That if it had not been for the Pope, Christ himself had
not been taken in the world for any such Person, as he is
believed this day:</hi> And p. 378. to the same purpose;
<hi>The first great fundamental of Christian Religion,
which is the Truth and Divinity of Christ, had it not
been for him, had failed long ago in the world;</hi> with
much more to the same purpose. Hence it is evident
that in your judgment, <hi>all Truth and Certainty in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
depends on the <hi>Popes Anthority and Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
or, as you express it, his <hi>unerring guidance.</hi>
This is your <hi>Principle,</hi> this you propose as the only
<hi>medium</hi> to bring us unto that <hi>Settlement</hi> in Religion,
which you suppose the Scripture is <hi>not able</hi> to do.
What course should we now take? would you have
us believe you at the first word without <hi>further tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
or examination? would you have a man to do so,
who never before heard of <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Church?</hi> We are
commanded <hi>to try all things, and to hold fast that
which is good;</hi> to try pretending Spirits and the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeans</hi>


                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:50044:99"/>
are commended for <hi>examining</hi> by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
what <hi>Paul</hi> himself preached unto them: An
<hi>implicit Credulity</hi> given up to such Dictates, is the
height of <hi>Fanaticism.</hi> Have wee not reason then
to call you and your copartners in this design to an
<hi>accoun</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>how you prove that which you so strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
assert and suppose; and to examine the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of that Authority whereunto you <hi>resolve</hi> all
your faith and Religion. If upon mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
these prove <hi>Solid,</hi> and the Inferences you
make from them <hi>Cogent,</hi> it is good Reason that you
should be attended unto. If they prove otherwise;
if the first be <hi>false,</hi> and the latter <hi>Sophistical;</hi> you
cannot justly take it ill of him that shall advise you
to take heed, that whilest you are gloriously <hi>display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
your Colours, the ground that you stand upon
do not <hi>sink</hi> under your feet. And here you are forced
to go many a <hi>step backward</hi> to fix your first footing,
(untill you leave your <hi>Pope</hi> quite out of sight) from
whence you advance towards him by severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and so arive at his Supremacie and Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and so we shall have—<hi>Reditum Diomedis ab
interitu Meleagri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Your first Principle to this purpose is, <hi>That
Peter was the Prince of the Apostles, and that in him
the Lord Jesus founded a Monarchy in his Church.</hi> So
<hi>pag.</hi> 360. you call him, <hi>the head and Prince of the
whole Congregation.</hi> Now this wee think no <hi>meet</hi>
Principle for any one to begin withall, in asserting the
foundation of Faith and Religion: Nor do we think
that if it were <hi>meet</hi> so to be used, that it is any way
<hi>subservient</hi> unto your design and purpose.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A Principle, fundamental, or first entrance into
any way of Settlement in Faith or Religion, it cannot
possibly be;</hi> because it presupposeth the knowledg of,


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50044:100"/>
and assent unto many other <hi>great fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of Christian Religion; yea upon the matter all
that are so: For before you can rationally talk with
a man about <hi>Peters Principality,</hi> and the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical
state</hi> of the Church hereon depending, you
must suppose that he <hi>believes the Scripture</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be the
Word of God, and all things that are taught therein
concerning <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> his, Person, Nature, Offices,
Work, and Gospell, to be certainly and infallibly
true: for they are all: <hi>supposed</hi> in your Assertion;
which without the knowledg of them is <hi>uncouth,</hi> hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
insignificant, and forraign to all notions that
a man can <hi>rationally</hi> entertain of God or Religion:
Nay no <hi>attempt</hi> of proof or confirmation can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto it, but by and from <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereby
you fall directly into the Principle which you seek
so carefully to avoid: namely that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
the only way and means of <hi>setling</hi> us in the Truth;
since you cannot <hi>settle</hi> any man in the very first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which you make to lead him into <hi>another</hi>
way but by the Scripture: So powerfull is Truth,
that those who will not <hi>follow</hi> it willingly, it will
lead them <hi>captive</hi> in Triumph, whether they will
or no.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>It is unmeet for any purpose, because it is not
true.</hi> No <hi>one word</hi> from the Scripture can you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in its confirmation: wherein yet if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
it must pass as a very <hi>uncertain</hi> and frivolous
conjecture. You can produce no <hi>suffrage</hi> of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church unto your purpose; which yet if you
could, would not presently render any Assertion so
confirmed <hi>infallibly</hi> certain, much less fundamental.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50044:100"/>
                  <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Ruler.</hi> And when the <hi>ambiguity</hi> of that
word began to be <hi>abused</hi> unto pretensions of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence,
the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
it, allowing none to be termed <hi>Princeps Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotum.</hi>
Many in those dayes thought <hi>Peter</hi> to be
among the Apostles like the <hi>Princeps Senatus,</hi> or
<hi>Princeps Civi atis,</hi> the chief in their Assemblies, or
Principall in dignity, how truly I know not; but
that he should be amongst them and over them a
<hi>Prince in Office,</hi> a <hi>Monarch</hi> as to Rule and Power, is
a thing that they never once dreamed of; and the
Asseveration of it is an <hi>open</hi> untruth. The Apostles were
equall in their <hi>Call, Office, Place, Dignity, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
All the difference between them, was in their
<hi>Labours,</hi> Sufferings, and Success; wherein <hi>Paul</hi>
seems to have had the pre-eminence; who as <hi>Peter,</hi>
and all the rest of the Apostles, every one <hi>singly</hi> and
for himself, had the <hi>care of all the Churches</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him; thought it may be for the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their <hi>Duty,</hi> ordinarily they divided their
work, as they found it necessary for them to apply
themselves unto it in particular. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And
this <hi>equality</hi> between the Apostles is more than once
insinuated by <hi>Paul,</hi> and that with speciall reference
unto <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. Gal. 1. 18, 19. ch. 2. 9. And is
it not wonderfull, that if this <hi>Assertion</hi> should not
only be <hi>true,</hi> but such a Truth as on which the
whole faith of the Church was to be <hi>built,</hi> that the
Scripture should be utterly <hi>silent</hi> of it, that it should
give us no <hi>Rules</hi> about it, no <hi>directions</hi> to use and
improve it, afford us no <hi>one instance</hi> of the exercise
of the Power and Authority intimated, no not one?
but that on the contrary it should lay down Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<hi>exclusive</hi> of it; <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 25, 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 26.
And when it comes to make an <hi>enumeration</hi> of all the


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50044:101"/>
Offices appointed by Christ in his Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.
should pass over the <hi>Prince</hi> and his Office in silence,
on which all the rest were to depend? You see what
a <hi>Foundation</hi> you begin to build upon; a meer ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
and <hi>groundless</hi> presumption which hath
not the least countenance given unto it by Scripture
or Antiquity. What a <hi>perplexed condition</hi> must you
needs cast men into, if they shall attend unto your
perswasions to rest on the Pope's <hi>unerring guidance</hi>
for all their Certainty in Religion, when the <hi>first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
you propose unto them to gain their Assent, is
a Proposition so far <hi>destitute</hi> of any cogent Evidence
of its Truth or innate Credibility, that it is <hi>apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false,</hi> and easily manifested so to be.</p>
               <p>3. Were it never so true, as it is notoriously false,
<hi>yet it would not one jot promote your design:</hi> It is
about <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, and not the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that we are yet discoursing. Do you think a man
can easily commence <hi>per saltum,</hi> from the imaginary
Principality of <hi>Peter</hi> unto the Infallibility of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome? Quid Pape cum Petro?</hi> what
relation is there between the one and other? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man have so good a <hi>mind unto your company,</hi>
as to be willing to set out with you in this <hi>ominous
stumbling at the threshold,</hi> what will you next lead
him unto? You say.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>That</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter <hi>besides his Apostolical Power
and Office, (wherein setting aside the prerogative of
his Princedome before mentioned, the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were partakers with him,) had also an Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Episcopal Power invested in him, which was to
be transmitted unto others after him.</hi> His Office pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Apostolical,</hi> you have no mind to lay claim unto.
It may be, you dispair of being able to prove, that
your <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>immediately called</hi> and sent by Christ:


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50044:101"/>
that he is furnished with a power of <hi>working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
and such other things as concurred to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Office <hi>Apostolical:</hi> and perhaps
himself hath but little mind to be exercised in the
<hi>discharge</hi> of that Office, by travelling up and down,
<hi>poor,</hi> despised, persecuted, to preach the Gospel:
<hi>Monarchy, Rule, Supremacie, Authority, Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
Infallibility,</hi> are words that better please him:
And therefore have you mounted this Notion of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Episcopacy,</hi> whereunto you would have us think
that all the <hi>fine things</hi> you so love and dote upon, are
annexed. Poor, labouring, perfected <hi>Peter</hi> the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> may die and be forgotten: but <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
harnessed</hi> with Power, Principality, Soveraignty,
and Vicarship of Christ,. This is the man you enquire
after: But you will have very <hi>hard work</hi> to find him
in the Scripture, or Antiquity, yea the least footstep
of him. And do you think indeed that this <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
of <hi>Peter,</hi> distinct from his <hi>Apostleship,</hi> is a <hi>meet
stone</hi> to be layed in the foundation of faith? It is a
thing that plainly overthrows his <hi>Apostleship;</hi> For
if he were a <hi>Bishop, properly</hi> and distinctly, he was no
<hi>Apostle:</hi> If an <hi>Apostle,</hi> not such a <hi>Bishop:</hi> That is, if
his <hi>Care</hi> were <hi>confined</hi> unto any one Church, and his
<hi>residence</hi> required therein, as the Case is with a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Bishop,</hi> how could the <hi>Care of all the Churches</hi> be
upon him? How could he be <hi>obliged</hi> to pass up and
down the world in pursuit of his Commission of
<hi>preaching the Gospel unto all Nations?</hi> or to travail
up and down as the <hi>necessity</hi> of the Churches did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?
But you will say, that he was not <hi>Bishop</hi> of
this or that particular, but of the <hi>Church Vniversal.</hi>
But I supposed you had thought him Bishop of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that you will plead him after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards
so to have been: And I must assure you, that


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50044:102"/>
he that thinks the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of
<hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> was the same with the <hi>Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
and not looked on as <hi>particular</hi> a Church as
that of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>Corinth;</hi> is a
person with whom I will have as little to do as I can
in this matter. For to what purpose should any one
spend time to debate things, with men <hi>absurd</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
and who will affirm that it is midnight
at noon day? I know, the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Office did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in it the power of all other <hi>Offices</hi> in the
Church whatever, as the less are included in the
greater: But that he who was an <hi>Apostle</hi> should <hi>formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
also be a <hi>Bishop,</hi> though an Apostle might exercise
the whole Power and Office of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

you see what a <hi>Quagmire</hi> you are building upon? I

which after you have painted and gilded, you
may prevail with many <hi>harbourless</hi> Creatures to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of an habitation therein: For when you have

that all your building is on <hi>a Rock,</hi> whereas indeed
you have nothing but the <hi>rotten posts</hi> of such Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
as these, to support it withall. But suppose
that <hi>Peter</hi> was thus a <hi>Prince, Monarch, Apostle, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi>
that is, a <hi>Catholick, Particular Officer,</hi> What is
that to you? Why</p>
               <p>III. <hi>This Peter came and preached the Gospel at
Rome.</hi> Though you can by no means prove this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
so as to make it <hi>de fide,</hi> or <hi>necessarily</hi> to be
believed of any one man in the world, much less to
become meet to enjoy a place among those <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi>
that are tendred unto us to bring us unto <hi>Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement</hi>
in Religion; yet being a matter very <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and of little importance, I shall not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50044:102"/>
with you about it. Witnesses meerly <hi>humane</hi>
and fallible you have for it a great many; and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
almost without number may be put in against
your <hi>Testimonies,</hi> and those of great weight and
moment. Now although that which you affirm
might be granted you, without any reall <hi>advantage</hi>
unto your Cause, or the enabling of you to draw
any lawfull inferences to uphold your <hi>Papal</hi> claim
by, yet to let you see on what sorry <hi>uncertain</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
you build your faith and profession, and
that in and about things which you make of <hi>indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable</hi>
necessity unto Salvation; I shall in our passage
remind you of some few of them, which I profess se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
unto you, make it not only <hi>Questionable</hi> unto
me whether or no, but also somewhat <hi>improbable</hi>
that ever <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome.</hi> 1. Though those
that follow and give their assents unto this Story are
<hi>many,</hi> yet it was taken up upon the credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Persons, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> manifests,
<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. Whether <hi>Dionysius Corinthius,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi>
first began the Story, I know not; but I know
certainly that both of them manifested themselves in
other things, to be a little <hi>too credulous.</hi> 2. That
which many of them built their <hi>Credulity</hi> upon, is
very uncertain, if not certainly false; namely that
<hi>Peter</hi> wrote his <hi>first Epistle</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> which he
calls <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Subscription of it. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he should then so call it, no man can tell. The
<hi>Apocalypse</hi> of <hi>John</hi> who prophesied what <hi>Rome</hi>
should be in after-Ages, and thereon what <hi>name</hi>
should be accommodated unto it for its false wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Persecution, was not yet written. Nor
was there any thing yet spoken of or known among
the <hi>Disciples,</hi> whence they might conjecture <hi>Rome</hi>
to be intended by that Appellation. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50044:103"/>
unto this Supposition, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> intending to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them unto whom he wrote, <hi>where</hi> he was,
when he wrote unto them, and to present them with
the respects of the <hi>Church</hi> in that place, had by an
<hi>aenigmatical</hi> expression rather <hi>amuzed</hi> than informed
them. Besides, he had before this, <hi>agreed</hi> with and
solemnly engaged himself unto <hi>Paul</hi> to take care of
the <hi>Circumcision;</hi> unto whom after he had preached
a while in <hi>Palestine,</hi> it is more than probable that he
betook himself unto <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Assyria,</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
seat of their residence in their first and most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<hi>dispersion,</hi> from whence he wrote unto all their
<hi>Colonies</hi> scattered abroad in the neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So that although I will not, because of the
consent of many of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> deny that <hi>Peter</hi>
went to <hi>Rome</hi> and preached there, yet I am fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that this <hi>foundation</hi> of the Story told by them,
is a perfect mistake, consisting in an unwarrantable
causless wresting of a <hi>plain</hi> expression unto a <hi>mystical</hi>
sense and meaning. 3. Your Witnesses agree not at
all in their Story; neither as to the <hi>time</hi> of his going
to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor as to the <hi>occasion</hi> of it, nor as to the <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of his abode there. Many of them assign unto
him 25 years for his residence there, which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
false and easily disproved. This computation
is ascribed to <hi>Eusebius</hi> in <hi>Chron. Lib.</hi> 1. but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
an addition of <hi>Hieroms,</hi> in whose dayes the
Tradition was encreased; for there is no such thing
in the <hi>Original Greek Copy of Eusebius,</hi> nor doth it
agree with what he had elsewhere written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. And it is very well worth while, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>For the first nine years after the death of Christ, unto
the beginning of the second year of <hi>Claudius, it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the Acts, and Epistle to the Galatians, that</hi>
Peter <hi>went not out of</hi> Palestine. <hi>If therefore, as all
agree, he came at that time to</hi> Rome, <hi>it is certain that
he bad not abode at</hi> Antioch <hi>seven years before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thither;</hi> (which yet all the Witnesses agree in)
<hi>but this his</hi> Antiochian <hi>Chair fell out at some other
time. Wherefore I thus order the whole matter from
the Testimony of most Ancient Authors,</hi> (not that
any one before him ever wrote any such thing, but
this he supposeth may be said to reconcile their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions);
<hi>In the second year of</hi> Claudius <hi>He came
to</hi> Rome. <hi>From thence unto his death were 25 years


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50044:104"/>
more or less: which space of time although the Ancients
write that he sate at</hi> Rome, <hi>yet it doth not follow thence,
that he alwayes abode in the City; for in the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>year
after his coming, he returned unto</hi> Jerusalem <hi>to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the Council of the Apostles; thence going unto</hi>
Antioch, <hi>he continued there seven years, unto the raign
of</hi> Nero. <hi>In the beginning of his raign, he returned
unto</hi> Rome, <hi>to repair the decaying Church there;
from thence passing almost through all</hi> Europe, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to</hi> Rome <hi>in the last year of</hi> Nero, <hi>and
under went Martyrdome by the Cross.</hi> You may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern the <hi>uncertainty</hi> at least of that Story,
which this learned man, can give no countenance
unto, but by multiplying improbable <hi>imaginations</hi> to
shelter one another. For, 1. Who ever said that
<hi>Peter</hi> came from <hi>Rome</hi> to come up to the <hi>Councel</hi> at
<hi>Hierusalem;</hi> when it is most manifest from the <hi>Story</hi>
of the <hi>Acts</hi> that he had never before departed out of
<hi>Judea;</hi> and this <hi>Councel</hi> being granted to have been
in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as here it is by <hi>Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
quite overthrows the <hi>Tradition</hi> of his going to
<hi>Rome</hi> in his second. 2. The abode of 25 years at
<hi>Rome,</hi> as thus disposed, is no abode indeed; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
almost twice as long at <hi>Antioch</hi> as he did at
<hi>Rome.</hi> 3. Here is no time at all allowed unto him
for preaching the Gospel in <hi>Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,</hi>
and <hi>Bythinia,</hi> which certainly are not Provinces of
<hi>Europe,</hi> in which places <hi>Eusebius, Hist. Lib. 3. cap.</hi> 1.
<hi>Origen,</hi> and all the Ancients agree that he did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto his Apostleship towards the <hi>Jews;</hi> and his
<hi>Epistles</hi> make it evident. 4. Nor is there any time
left for him to be at <hi>Babylon,</hi> where yet we know he
was; so that this fancy can have no countenance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it, without a full rejection of all that we know to
be true in the Story.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:50044:104"/>
4. The Scripture is utterly silent of any such
thing as <hi>Peters</hi> going to <hi>Rome.</hi> Other journeyings
of his it records, as to <hi>Samaria, Lydda, Joppa,
Caesaria, Antioch.</hi> Now it was no way materiall
that his coming unto any of these places should be
known, but only in reference unto the things <hi>done</hi>
there by him; and yet they are recorded. But this
his going to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is supposed to be of such
huge importance in Christian Religion, and that
according to <hi>Onuphrius</hi> falling out in the middest of
his other journeyings, as it must do if ever it fell
out, is utterly passed by in silence. If it had been to
have such <hi>an influence</hi> into the very being of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
as now is pretended, some men will be apt to
think, that the <hi>mention</hi> of it would not have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
5. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> written a good
while after this imaginary going <hi>of Peter</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi>
makes no mention of him, when yet he saluted by
name those of <hi>chief note</hi> and dignity in the Church
there. So that undoubtedly he was not then come
thither. 6. The same Apostle being at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the
reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> in the amidst of the time allotted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the abode of <hi>Peter</hi> there, never once mentions
him in any of the <hi>Epistles</hi> which from thence he
wrote unto the Churches and his fellow labourers;
though he doth remember very many <hi>others</hi> that
were with him in the City. 7. He asserts that in
one of his <hi>Epistles</hi> from thence, which as I think
sufficiently proves that <hi>Peter</hi> was not then there; for
he saies plainly <hi>that in his triall he was forsaken by all
men, that no man stood by him,</hi> which he mentions as
their sin, and prays for pardon for them. Now no
man can reasonably think, that <hi>Peter</hi> was amongst the
number of them whom he complained of. 8. The
Story is not consistent with what is expresly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50044:105"/>
of <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>Luke</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in his
Epistle to the <hi>Galatians. Paul</hi> was converted unto
the faith about the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of Christ, or 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> after
his Ascension. After this he continued 3 years
preaching the Gospel about <hi>Damascus,</hi> and in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia.</hi>
In the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or 41<hi rend="sup">st</hi> year of Christ he came to
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to conferr with <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 1. which was
the first of <hi>Claudius.</hi> As yet therefore, <hi>Peter</hi> was
not removed out of <hi>Judaea:</hi> 14 <hi>years</hi> after, that is,
either <hi>after</hi> his first going up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or rather
14 years <hi>after</hi> his first Conversion, he went up again
to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and found <hi>Peter</hi> still there, which was
in the 52<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of Christ, and the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>laudius.</hi>
Or if you should take the date of the 14 <hi>years</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by him shorter by 5 or 6 years, and reckon
their beginning from the passion and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of
Christ, which is not improbable; then this going up
of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> will be found to be the same
with his going up to the <hi>Councel</hi> from <hi>Antioch,</hi> about
the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or rather 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Claudius. Peter</hi> was
then yet certainly at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> That is, about the
46<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of Christ; some while after you would
have the Church to be founded by him at <hi>Rome.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, when <hi>Paul</hi> had taken a long progress through
many Countreys, wherein he must needs spend some
years, returning unto <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 18. 22. he there
again met with <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2. 11. <hi>Peter</hi> being yet still
in the <hi>East</hi> to wards the end of the Raign of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
At <hi>Antioch</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> found him, if any of your
<hi>Witnesses</hi> may be believed, he abode 7 years. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
he was now very old, and <hi>ready to lay down his
mortality, as our Lord had shewed him;</hi> and in all
probability after his remove from <hi>Antioch,</hi> spent the
residue of his dayes in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Dispersion of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> For, 9<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, much of the Apostles work in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi>


                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50044:105"/>
among the <hi>Jews</hi> was now drawing to an end;
the elect being gathered in, troubles were growing
upon the Nation; and <hi>Peter</hi> had, as we observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
agreed with <hi>Paul</hi> to take the Care of the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
of whom the greatest number by far, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
only <hi>Judaea</hi> its self, was in <hi>Babylon</hi> and the
<hi>Eastern Nations</hi> about it. Now whether these and
the like observations out of the <hi>Scripture</hi> concerning
the Course of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peters</hi> life, be not sufficient to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance
the <hi>Testimony</hi> of your <hi>disagreeing</hi> Witnesses,
impartial and unprejudiced men may judge. For
my part, I do not intend to conclude peremptorily
from them, that <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome,</hi> or never
preached the Gospel there; but that your Assertion
of it is <hi>improbable,</hi> and built upon very Questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds, that I suppose I may safely conclude.
And God forbid, that we should once imagine the
present <hi>faith</hi> of Christians, or their Profession of
Christian Religion, to be built upon such <hi>uncertain
Conjectures,</hi> or to be concerned in them whether
they be true, or false. Nothing can be spoken with
more <hi>reproach</hi> unto it, than to say, that it stands in
need of such supportment. And yet if this one <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
fail you, all your <hi>building</hi> falls to the ground
in a moment. Never was so stupendous a <hi>fabrick</hi>
raised on such imaginary <hi>foundations.</hi> But that we
may proceed; Let us suppose this also, that <hi>Peter</hi>
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and preached the Gospel there, What
will thence follow unto your advantage? what, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the settlement of any man in Religion, or
bringing us unto the Unity of faith, the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after? He was at, he preached the Gospel at
<hi>Hierusalem, Samaria, Joppa, Antioch, Babylon,</hi> and
sundry other places, and yet we find no such Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
pleaded from thence, as you urge from his


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50044:106"/>
Coming to <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore you adde,</p>
               <p>1 V. <hi>That</hi> St Peter <hi>was Bishop of the Roman
Church; that he fixed his seat there, and there he died.</hi>
In gathering up your Principles I follow the footsteps
of <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and other great Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your Church; so that you cannot except
against the <hi>method</hi> of our proposals of them. Now
this <hi>Conclusion</hi> is built on these three Suppositions.
1. That <hi>Peter</hi> had an <hi>Episcopal Office</hi> distinct from
his <hi>Apostolical;</hi> 2. That he was at <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. That
he fixed his <hi>Episcopal Sea</hi> there; whereof the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
is very Questionable, the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
false. So that the <hi>Conclusion</hi> its self must
needs be a notable fundamentall <hi>Principle</hi> of Faith.
It is true, and I shewed it before, that the Apostles
when they came into any Church did exercise all the
<hi>Power</hi> of Bishops in and over that Church, but not
<hi>as</hi> Bishops but as Apostles. As a King may in any of
the Cities of his dominions where he comes, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
all the Authority of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> or particular
Governour of that place where he is, which yet
doth not make him become the <hi>Mayor</hi> of the place;
which would be a diminution of his royall Dignity.
No more did the Apostles become <hi>Local Bishops,</hi>
because of their exercising <hi>Episcopal</hi> Power in any
particular Church, by virtue of their Authority
Apostolical, wherein that other was included, as
hath been declared. And <hi>Cui Bono?</hi> to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
serves this <hi>fictitious Episcopacy?</hi> All the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
that you contend for the Assignation of unto
<hi>Peter,</hi> were be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>owed upon him as an Apostle, or as
a believing disciple of Christ. As such he had those
peculiar grants made unto him. The <hi>Keys</hi> of the
Kingdome of heaven were given unto him as an
Apostle (or, according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Austin,</hi> as a <hi>believer</hi>) as


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50044:106"/>
such was he commanded to <hi>feed the sheep</hi> of Christ.
It was unto him as an Apostle, or a professing belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that Christ promised to <hi>build the Church,</hi> on
the faith that he had professed. You reckon all these
things among the priviledges of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle,
who <hi>as such</hi> is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>first</hi> in order.
As an Apostle he had the <hi>Care of all Churches commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him;</hi> As an Apostle he was <hi>divinely inspired</hi>
and enabled infallibly to reveal the mind of Christ.
All these things belonged unto him <hi>as an Apostle;</hi> and
what Priviledge he could have besides <hi>as a Bishop</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you nor I can tell; no more than you can <hi>when,
how,</hi> or by <hi>whom</hi> he was called and ordained unto any
such office; all which we know well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Apostleship. If you will then have any
to succeed him in the enjoyment of any, or of all
these <hi>Privileges,</hi> you must bespeak him to succeed
him in his <hi>Apostleship,</hi> and not in his <hi>Bishoprick.</hi>
Besides, as I said before, this <hi>imaginary Episcopacy</hi>
which limits and confines him unto a particular
Church, as it doth if it be an <hi>Episcopacy</hi> properly
so called, is destructive of his <hi>Apostolical</hi> Office, and
of his Duty in answering the Commission given him
of preaching the Gospel to <hi>every Creature,</hi> following
the Guidance of Gods Providence, and <hi>conduct</hi> of
the Holy Ghost in his way. Many of the Ancients I
confess affirm that <hi>Peter</hi> sate <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> but they all evidently use the word in a <hi>large
sense</hi> to imply that during his abode there, (for
that there he was, they did suppose,) be took upon
him the <hi>especial Care</hi> of that Church. For the same
Persons constantly affirm that <hi>Paul</hi> also was <hi>Bishop</hi>
of the same Church, at the same time; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be otherwise understood than in the large sense
mentioned. And <hi>Ruffinus, Prafat. Recog. Clement.

Peter <hi>attending unto his office Apostolical.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
doth he utterly discard the present new <hi>plea</hi> of the
foundation of your faith. For though he assert that
<hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle was at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he denies that he
ever sate <hi>Bishop</hi> there, but names two others that
ruled that Church at <hi>Rome</hi> joyntly during his time,
either in <hi>one</hi> Assembly, or in <hi>two,</hi> the one of the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
the other of the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts. And
if <hi>Peter</hi> were thus <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and entred as you
say upon his <hi>Episcopacy</hi> at his first coming thither,
whence is it that you are forced to confess that he
was so long <hi>absent</hi> from his charge? <hi>Five</hi> years, saith
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but that will by no means salve the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.

whereas in the mean time he <hi>wrote</hi> two <hi>Epistles</hi>

<hi>find</hi> our way out of this maze of uncertainties. This
is but a sad disquisition after <hi>Principles</hi> of faith, to
settle men in Religion by them; And yet if we should

of the same nature with them that went before, And
this is,</p>
               <p>V. <hi>That some one must needs succeed</hi> Peter <hi>in his
Episcopacy:</hi> But why so? why was it not needfull
that one should succeed him in his <hi>Apostleship?</hi> Why
was it not needfull that <hi>Paul</hi> should have a successor
as well as <hi>Peter?</hi> and <hi>John</hi> as well as either of them?
Because, you say, <hi>that</hi> was <hi>necessary</hi> for the Church,
not so <hi>these.</hi> But who <hi>told</hi> you so? where is the <hi>proof</hi>
of what you averre? who made you <hi>judges</hi> of what
is <hi>necessary,</hi> and what is <hi>not</hi> necessary for the Church
of Christ, when himself is silent? And why is not the
<hi>succession of an Apostle</hi> necessary as well as of such a
<hi>Bishop</hi> as you fancie? had it not been better to have
had one still residing in the Church, of whose <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
there could have been no doubt or question?
One that had the power of <hi>working Miracles,</hi> that
should have no need to scare the people by <hi>shaking
fire</hi> out of his slieve, as your Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
was wont to do, if <hi>Cardinall Benno</hi> may be believed.
But you have now carried us quite off from the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
and <hi>Story,</hi> and probable conjectures, to attend
unto you whilest you give the Lord Jesus <hi>prudentiall
advice,</hi> about what is necessary for his Church; It
must <hi>needs</hi> be so, it is <hi>meet</hi> it should be so, is the best
of your proof in this matter: Only your <hi>fratres Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenburgici</hi>
adde, <hi>that never any man ordained the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a Community more weakly, than Christ
must be supposed to have done the Government of his
Church, if he have not appointed such a Successour to</hi>
Peter <hi>as you imagin.</hi> But it is easie for you to <hi>assert</hi>
what you please of this nature, and as easie for any
one to <hi>reject</hi> what you so assert if he please. These
things are without the <hi>verge</hi> of Christian Religion;

and what therewithall? his <hi>Authority,</hi> Power and
Jurisdiction over all Churches in the world, with an
<hi>unerring judgement</hi> in matters of faith. But all these
belonged unto <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>far</hi> as ever they belonged
unto him, as he was an <hi>Apostle,</hi> long before you fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
him to have been a <hi>Bishop:</hi> As then his <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi>
came without these things, so for ought you
know, it might goe without it. This is a matter of
huge importance in that <hi>Systeme</hi> of Principles, which
you tender unto us, to bring us unto settlement in
Religion, and the Unity of Faith; would you would
consider a little, how you may give some <hi>tolerable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi>

                  </gap> with his
Claim. For you say.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>That the Bishop of Rome is the man that thus sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cceds</hi>
Peter <hi>in his Episcopacy, which though it were settled
at</hi> Rome, <hi>was over the whoee Catholick Church.</hi> So
you <hi>say,</hi> and so you profess your selves to <hi>believe.</hi>
And we desire that you would not take it amiss if we
desire to know upon what <hi>grounds</hi> you do so; being
unwilling to cast away all <hi>Consideration</hi> that we may
embrace a <hi>fanatical Credo</hi> in this unlikely business.
We desire therefore to know, who. appointed that
there should be any <hi>such</hi> succession; <hi>who,</hi> that the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should be <hi>this</hi> Successor, Did <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> do it? we may justly expect you should say. He
did: but if you do, we desire to know <hi>when, where,
how;</hi> seeing the Scripture is utterly <hi>silent</hi> of say such
thing. Did S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> himself do it? Pray, manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us that by the appointment of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> he had


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50044:108"/>
                  <hi>power</hi> so to do; and that secondly he <hi>actually</hi> did so:
Neither of these can you prove, or produce any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
worth <hi>crediting</hi> in confirmation of it. Did
it necessarily follow from hence, because that was
the place where <hi>Peter died:</hi> But this was <hi>accidentall,</hi>
a thing that <hi>Peter</hi> thought not of: for, you say, that
a <hi>few dayes</hi> before his death he was leaving that place.
Besides according to this insinuation, why did not
every Apostle leave a <hi>Successour</hi> behind him in the
place where he <hi>dyed,</hi> and that by vertue of his <hi>dying</hi> in
that place? or produce you any <hi>Patent</hi> granted to
<hi>Peter</hi> in especiall, that where he <hi>dyed</hi> there he
should leave a Successour behind him. But it seems
the whole weight of your faith, is layed upon a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>fact</hi> accidentally falling out, yea and that very
incertain whether ever it fell out or no. Shew us any
thing of the <hi>will</hi> and institution of <hi>Christ</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
As, that <hi>Peter</hi> should go to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he should
fix his <hi>seat</hi> there, that he should <hi>dye</hi> there, that he
should have a <hi>Successour,</hi> that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
should be his Successour, that unto this Successour I

in other places, where he abode, and preached, and
exetcised <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> without all question? Was
it because <hi>he dyed at</hi> Rome? This is to acknowledg
that the whole Papacy is built, as was said, upon an
accidentall matter of fact; and that supposed not
proved. Further, if he must be supposed to <hi>succeed
Peter,</hi> I desire to know <hi>what</hi> that succession is, and
<hi>wherein</hi> he doth succeed him: Doth he succeed him


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50044:109"/>
in <hi>all that hee had and was,</hi> in reference unto the
Church of God? Doth he succeed him in <hi>the manner of
his Call</hi> to his Office? <hi>Peter</hi> was called immediately by
<hi>Christ</hi> in his own Person: the <hi>Pope</hi> is chosen by the
<hi>Conclave of Cardinals,</hi> concerning <hi>whom,</hi> their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Priviledges, Power, Right to choose the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
of <hi>Peter,</hi> there is not one <hi>iota</hi> in the Scripture, or
any Monuments of the best Antiquity: and how in
their <hi>Election</hi> of Popes they have been influenced by
the interest of powerfull <hi>Strumpets,</hi> your own <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
will inform you. Doth he succeed him in the
<hi>way and manner</hi> of his Personal <hi>Discharge</hi> of his
Office and imployment? Not in the least; <hi>Peter</hi> in
the pursuit of his Commission and in obedience unto
the command of his Lord <hi>and Master,</hi> travailed up
and down the world, preaching the Gospel, <hi>plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>watering</hi> the Churches of Christ, in patience,
self-deniall, humility, zeal, temperance, meekness.
The <hi>Pope</hi> raigns at <hi>Rome</hi> in case, exalting himself
above the Kings of the earth, without taking the least
<hi>pains</hi> in his own Person for the conversion of Sinners,
or edification of the Disciples of Christ, Doth he
succeed him in his <hi>Personal Qualifications</hi> which
were of such extraordinary advantage unto the
Church of God in his dayes; his Faith, Love, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Light and Knowledg; you will not say so.
Many of your <hi>Popes</hi> by your own confession, have
been <hi>ignorant</hi> and stupid; many of them <hi>flagitiously
wicked,</hi> to say no more. Doth he succeed him in the
<hi>way and manner</hi> of his exercising his Care and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
towards the Churches of Christ? as little as
the rest: <hi>Peter</hi> did it by his <hi>prayers</hi> for the Churches,
personal visitation, and instruction of them, writing
by inspiration for their direction and guidance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the will of God: The <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Bulls,</hi> and

Doth he succeed him in his <hi>power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles?</hi>
you do not so much as pretend thereunto.
Doth he succeed him in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that he taught?
it hath been proved unto you <hi>a thousand times,</hi> that
he doth not; and wee are still ready to prove it again
if you call us thereunto. Wherein then doth this
<hi>Succession consist</hi> that you talk of? In his <hi>Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
Jurisdiction, Supremacy, Monarchy,</hi> with the
Secular Advantages of Riches, Honour, and pomp that
attend them; things sweet and desireable unto <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
mindes: This is the <hi>Succession</hi> you pretend to
plead for: And are you not therein to be <hi>commended</hi>
for your wisdome? In the things that <hi>Peter</hi> really
enjoyed, and which were of <hi>singular</hi> Spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto the Church of God, you disclaim any
Succession unto him; and fix it on things wherein he
was no way <hi>concerned,</hi> that make for your own <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
advantage and interest. You have certainly
layed your <hi>design</hi> very well if these things would
<hi>hold good</hi> to Eternity. For, hence it is that you draw
out the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of your <hi>Pope, direct</hi> and absolute
in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> things over the whole Church; <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct</hi>
at least, and in <hi>ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> over the
whole world. This the <hi>Diana</hi> in making of <hi>Shrines</hi>
for whom your occupation consists, and it brings <hi>no
small gains</hi> unto you. Hence you wire-draw his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
Infallibility,</hi> Legislative Authority, Freedom
from the <hi>Judgment</hi> of any, whereby you hope to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him and your selves from all <hi>opposition,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to terrifie them with this <hi>Medusa</hi>'s head that

approach unto you. Hence are his <hi>Titles: The Vicar
of Christ,</hi> Head <hi>and Spouse of his Church, Vice-Deus,
Dius alter in Terris,</hi> and the like, where by you keep
up <hi>popular</hi> venexation, and preserve his <hi>Majestick</hi>
distance from the poor Disciples of Christ. Hence you
warrant his <hi>practices</hi> suited unto these pretensions and
Titles, in the <hi>deposing</hi> of Kings, <hi>transposing</hi> of Titles
unto Dominion and Rule, <hi>giving away</hi> of Kingdoms,
stirring up and waging <hi>mighty warres,</hi> causing and
commanding them that <hi>dissent</hi> from him, or refuse
to yield obedience unto him, to be <hi>destroyed</hi> with fire

               <p>This is the <hi>way,</hi> this the <hi>progress,</hi> whereby you

It is not a <hi>meer agreement</hi> wee aym at, but an

are able by so many <hi>uncertainties</hi> and untruths to
bring men unto a Certainty and <hi>Scttlement</hi> in the
Truth, you need not despair of compassing and thing,
that you shall have a mind to attempt.</p>
               <p>But you have yet <hi>another Plea</hi> which you make no
less use of than of the former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which must therefore be
also, (now you have engaged us in this work,) a
little examined: This is the <hi>Church,</hi> its Authority
and <hi>Infallibil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty.</hi> The truth is, when you come to


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50044:111"/>
make a <hi>practical Application</hi> of this Plea unto your
own use, you <hi>resolve</hi> it into, and confound it with
that foregoing of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom solely many of
you would have this <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of
the Church to reside. Yet because in your mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, you proceed on other Principles than those
before mentioned, this <hi>pretence</hi> also shall be apart
considered. And here you tell us,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That the Church was before the Scripture, and
giveth Authority unto it.</hi> By the Scriptures you know
that wee understand <hi>the Word of God,</hi> with this <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne
Adjunct</hi> of its being written by his command and
appointment. We do not say that it belongs unto
the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Word of God that it be written:
Whatever is <hi>spoken</hi> by God. wee admit as his Word,
when wee are <hi>infallibly</hi> assured that by Him it was
spoken; and that wee should do so <hi>before,</hi> himself
doth not require at our hands: for he would have
us use our <hi>utmost diligence</hi> not to be <hi>imposed upon</hi> by
any in his Name. Therefore wee grant that the <hi>Word
of God</hi> was given out for the Rule of men in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>two thousand years</hi> before it was written; but
it was <hi>so given forth,</hi> as that they unto whom it <hi>came,</hi>
had <hi>infallible</hi> assurance that from Him it came and
his Word it was: And if you, or any man else, can
give us <hi>such assurance,</hi> that any thing is, or hath been
spoken by him, besides what we have <hi>now written</hi> in
the Scripture, wee shall receive it with the same <hi>faith</hi>
and obedience, wherewith wee receive the Scripture
its self. Whereas therefore you say, <hi>That the Church
was before the Scripture,</hi> if you intend no more but
that there <hi>was a Church in the world,</hi> before the <hi>word
of God was written,</hi> wee grant it true; but not at all
to your purpose. If you intend that the <hi>Church is
before the Word of God,</hi> which at an appointed time
<hi>was written,</hi> it may possibly be wrested unto your


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50044:112"/>
purpose, but is farre from being true; seeing the
Church is a <hi>society of men, called to the knowledg and
worship of God by his Ward.</hi> They become a Church
by the <hi>call of that Word,</hi> which it seems you would
have not given untill they are a Church: of <hi>Effects</hi>
produce their Causes, <hi>Children</hi> beget their Parents,
<hi>Light</hi> brings forth the Sunne, and <hi>Heat</hi> the Fire: So
are the <hi>Prophets</hi> and Apostles built upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Corner
stone:</hi> So was the <hi>Judaical</hi> Church before the <hi>Law</hi>
of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> constitution, and the <hi>Christian</hi> before the
Word of <hi>Promise</hi> whereon it was founded, and the
Word of <hi>Command</hi> by which it was edified. In brief;
from the day wherein Man was first <hi>created</hi> upon the
earth, to the <hi>days</hi> wherein we live, never did a Person
or Church yield any <hi>obedience,</hi> or perform any <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
worship</hi> unto God, but what was founded
on, and <hi>regulated</hi> by his Word, given unto them <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi>
unto their obedience and worship, to be the
<hi>sole</hi> foundation and Rule of it. That you have no
concernment in what <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> be <hi>truly</hi> spoken of the
Church, we shall afterwards shew; but it is not for
the <hi>interest of Truth,</hi> that wee should suffer you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>controul,</hi> to impose such <hi>absurd notions</hi> on the
minds of men; especially when you pretend to direct
them unto a <hi>Settlement</hi> in Religion. Alike true is it,
that the <hi>Church gives Authority unto the Scripture:</hi>
Every true Church indeed <hi>gives witness or Testimony</hi>
unto it, and it is its Duty so to do; it <hi>holds it forth,</hi>
declares, and manifests it, so that it may be <hi>considered</hi>
and taken notice of by all; which is one main End
of the <hi>Institution</hi> of the Church in this world: But
the Church no more <hi>gives Authority</hi> to the Scripture
than it gives Authority to <hi>God</hi> himself: He requires
of men the discharge of that <hi>Duty</hi> which he hath
assigned unto them, but stands not in need of their


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50044:112"/>
                  <hi>suffrage</hi> to confirm his Authority. It was not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
with the <hi>Idols</hi> of old, of whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> said
rightly; <hi>Si Deus homini non placuerit, Deus non erit:</hi>
The reputation of their Deity depended on the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of men; as, <hi>you say,</hi> that of <hi>Christ's</hi> doth on
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Pope. But I shall not farther
insist upon the <hi>disprovement</hi> of this vanity; having
shewed already, that the Scripture hath <hi>all its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
both in its self, and in reference unto us, from
<hi>Him</hi> whose Word it is: and wee have also made is
appear, that your <hi>Assertions</hi> to the contrary, are meet
for nothing but to open a door unto all <hi>Irreligious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Prophaneness, and Atheism; so that there is

of Christian Religion in this your <hi>Position.</hi>
This ground well fixed you tell us.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>That the Church is infallible, or cannot erre in
what she teacheth to be believed.</hi> And we ask you
what <hi>Church</hi> you mean, and how far you intend
that it is <hi>infallible?</hi> The only <hi>known Church</hi> which
was then in the world, was in the <hi>Wilderness</hi> when
<hi>Moses</hi> was in the mount. Was it <hi>infallible</hi> when it
made the <hi>golden Calf,</hi> and danced about it proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a feast unto <hi>Jebovah</hi> before the Calf? was the

Judges, when it worshipped <hi>Baalim</hi> and <hi>Aftaroth?</hi> or
in the dayes of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when it sacrificed before
the <hi>Calves at Dan and Bethel?</hi> or in the other
branch of it in the dayes of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when the <hi>High-Priest</hi>

                  </hi> and <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when the High-Priest
with the rest of the Priests, <hi>imprisoned</hi> and
would have slain <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for preaching the word of


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50044:113"/>
God? or when they preferred the <hi>worship of the
Queen of Heaven</hi> before that of the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi>
Or was it <hi>infallible</hi> when the High-Priest,

<hi>judicially</hi> condemned as far as in them lay their own
<hi>Messias,</hi> and rejected the Gospel that was preached
unto them? You must inform us what <hi>other Church</hi>
was them in the world, or you will quickly perceive
how ungrounded your <hi>generall Maxim</hi> is, of the
Churches <hi>absolute infallibility.</hi> As farre indeed as it
attends unto the <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> given unto it, it is
so; but not one jot farther. Moreover, we desire
to know, <hi>What Church</hi> you mean in your <hi>Assertion,</hi>
or rather what is it that you mean by the Church?
Do you intend the <hi>Mystical</hi> Church, or the whole
number of <hi>Gods Elect</hi> in all Ages, or in any Age,
<hi>militant</hi> on the Earth, which principally is the
Church of God, Ephes. 5. 26? Or, do you intend
the whole <hi>diffused body</hi> of the Disciples of Christ in
the world, separated to God by <hi>Baptism</hi> and the
Profession of saving truth, which is the <hi>Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
visible;</hi> Or, do you mean any <hi>particular
Church</hi> as the <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>constantinopolitan,</hi> the
<hi>French, Dutch,</hi> or <hi>English</hi> Church? If you intend
the <hi>first</hi> of These, or the Church in the <hi>first sense;</hi> we
acknowledge that it is thus far <hi>infallible,</hi> that no
true member of it shall ever <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
lose, or forsake that faith, without which
they cannot <hi>please God</hi> and be saved. This the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
teacheth, this <hi>Austin</hi> confirmeth in an <hi>bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
places.</hi> If you intend the Church in the <hi>second
sense;</hi> we grant that also so far unerring and <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
as that there ever <hi>was,</hi> and ever <hi>shall</hi> be in the
world, a number of men making Profession of the
<hi>saving Truth</hi> of the Gospel, and yielding professed
subjection unto our Lord Jesus Christ according unto


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50044:113"/>
it, wherein consists his <hi>visible Kingdome</hi> in this
world; that never was, that never can be <hi>utterly</hi>
overthrown. If you speak of a Church in the <hi>last
sense,</hi> then we tell you, That no <hi>such Church</hi> is by
virtue of any <hi>Promise</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, freed
from <hi>erring,</hi> yea so farre as to deny the <hi>fundamentals</hi>
of Christianity, and thereby to lose the very <hi>being</hi>
of a Church. Whilst it continues a Church, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>erre fundamentally;</hi> because such Errours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the very <hi>being</hi> of a Church; but those who
were <hi>once a Church,</hi> by their failing in the Truth,
may cease to be <hi>so</hi> any longer: And a Church <hi>as such</hi>
may so <hi>fail,</hi> though every <hi>Person</hi> in it do not so; for
the <hi>individual members</hi> of it, that are so also of the
<hi>Mysticall Church,</hi> shall be preserved in its <hi>Apostasie.</hi>
And so the <hi>Mysticall</hi> Church, and the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Church of Professors may be continued, though all
<hi>particular</hi> Churches should fail: So that <hi>no Person,</hi> the
Church in no sense is <hi>absolutely</hi> freed in this world
from the danger of all errours: that is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wee shall attain <hi>in Heaven;</hi> here where we know
butin part wee are incapable of it. The Church of
<hi>the Elect</hi> and every member of it, shall <hi>eventually</hi> be
preserved by the power of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> from any
such <hi>errour</hi> as would <hi>utterly</hi> destroy their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ in Grace here, or <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of him in Glory hereafter: or, as the Apostle
speaks, they shall assuredly be <hi>kept by the Power of
God through faith unto salvation.</hi> The Generall
Church of <hi>Visible Professors,</hi> shall be alwayes <hi>so farre</hi>
preserved in the world, as that there shall never <hi>want</hi>
some, in some place or other of it, that shall profess
all <hi>needfull saving Truths</hi> of the Gospel, in the belief
whereof and <hi>obedience</hi> whereunto a man may be saved.
But for <hi>Particular Churches</hi> as such, they have no
<hi>security</hi> but what lyes in their diligent attendance


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50044:114"/>
unto that <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> which will preserve them
from all hutfull Errours, if through their <hi>own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault</hi>
they neglect not to keep close unto it. And
your <hi>flattering your selves</hi> with an imagination of any
other Priviledge, is that which hath wrought your
ruine: You are deceived if in this matter you are of
<hi>Menander</hi>'s mind, who sayed <gap reason="foreign">

that, all will of its <hi>own
accord</hi> fall out well with you though <hi>you sleep</hi> secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As for <hi>all other Churches</hi> in the world besides your

be <hi>fallible,</hi> that is to propose unto us the <hi>things</hi> and

truly <hi>I know not</hi> how we can, if we believe them only
upon <hi>her Authority,</hi> or she propose them to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>solely</hi> upon that account; but when she <hi>proposeth</hi>
them unto us to be believed on the <hi>Authority of God</hi>
speaking in the Srciptures, we both can, and do believe
what she teacheth and <hi>proposeth,</hi> and that with faith
<hi>infallible</hi> resolved into the Veracity of God in his
Word: and we grant <hi>every Church</hi> to be so farre <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
as it attends unto the only <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men: When you prove that <hi>any one Church</hi> is

or intimated in the Scripture, placed in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
condition,</hi> any farther than as in the <hi>use of the

                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:50044:114"/>
to attend unto that Rule whether she will or no,
whereby she may be preserved, or can give us an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of any Church since the foundation of the
world, that hath been <hi>actually preserved</hi> and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
from all errour, (other than that of your own,
which you know we cannot admit of,) as you will do,

                  </gap>, <hi>a great and memorable work,</hi> so
we shall grant as much as you can reasonably desire
of us upon the account of the <hi>Assertion</hi> under consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
But untill you do some <hi>one,</hi> or all of these,
your crying out, <hi>The Church, the Church the Church
cannot erre,</hi> makes no other noyse in our ears, than
that of the Jews, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord, the Law shall not fail,</hi> did in the
ears of the Prophets of old. Neither do we speak
this of <hi>the Church,</hi> or any Church, as though we
were concerned to question or deny any <hi>just Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
belonging unto it, thereby to <hi>secure</hi> our
selves from any pretensions of yours; but meerly
for the <hi>sake of Truth.</hi> For we shall manifest anon
unto you, that you are <hi>as little concerned</hi> in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Church, be they what they will,
<hi>more</hi> or less, as any Society of the Professours of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in the world; if so be that you are concerned
in them at all. So that if the Truth would <hi>permit</hi> us
to agree with you in all things that you assign unto
<hi>the Church,</hi> yet the <hi>difference</hi> between you and us
were never the nearer to an end; for we should still
<hi>differ</hi> with you about your share and interest therein;
and for ever abhor your frowardness in <hi>appropriating</hi>
of them all unto your selves: And herein, as I sayed,
hath lyen a great <hi>part</hi> of your ruine; Whilest you have
been <hi>sweetly dreaming</hi> of an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

your imagination, as that you think them <hi>no errours,</hi>
upon this only ground, because <hi>you cannot erre.</hi> I am

For why should he once <hi>look about</hi> him, or indeed so

he can never be out of his way. Hence you inquire
not at all, whether what you profess be <hi>Truth</hi> or not,
but to <hi>learn</hi> what your Church teacheth and defend
it, is all that you have to do about Religion in this
world: And whatever <hi>Absurdities</hi> or Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
you find your selves driven unto in the handling
of <hi>particular points,</hi> all is one, they must be right
though you cannot defend them, because your Church
which <hi>cannot erre</hi> hath so declared them to be: And if
you should chance to be convinced of any Truth in
particular that is contrary to the <hi>determination</hi> of your
Church, you know not how to embrace it, but must
shut your eyes against its <hi>light</hi> and evidence, and cast
it out of your minds, or <hi>wander</hi> up and down with a

Their perswasion in this matter is expressed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Epistle of <hi>Clemens,</hi> or Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
unto the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>the Church
that is at Rome, to the Church that is at Corinth;</hi> both
locall Churches, both equall: And such is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of all the Writers of those times. It was not so
in the dayes of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> of the next
three <hi>Centuries,</hi> who still accounted it a particular
Church; <hi>Diocesaen</hi> or <hi>Patriarchal;</hi> but all of them <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
never calling it <hi>Catholick,</hi> but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of its holding the <hi>Catholick faith,</hi> as they called


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50044:116"/>
all other Churches that did so, in opposition to the
Errours, <hi>Heresies,</hi> and Schilms of any in their dayes.
We desire then to know <hi>when</hi> it became the <hi>only</hi> or
<hi>absolutely</hi> Catholick Church of Christ: As also (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly)
by <hi>what means</hi> it became so to be? It did not
do so by virtue of any <hi>Institution,</hi> Warrant, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Christ: You were never able to produce the
least intimation of any such <hi>Warrant</hi> out of any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> nor approved <hi>Catholick
Writer</hi> of the first Ages after Christ, though it hugely
concern you so to do, if it were possible to be done;
but they all expresly teach that which is <hi>inconsistent</hi>
with such pretences. It did not do so, by any <hi>Decree</hi>
of the first <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> which are all of them <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
as to any such thing, and some of them, as those
of <hi>Nice, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>don,</hi> expresly declare and
determine the contrary, at least that which is contrary
thereunto. We can find no other way or <hi>means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it can pretend unto this vast Priviledge, unless it be
the grant of <hi>Phocas</hi> unto <hi>Boniface,</hi> that he should be
called the <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi> who to serve his own
ends was very liberal of that which was not at <hi>all</hi> in
his power to bestow: And yet neither is this, though it
be a <hi>means</hi> that you have more reason to be <hi>ashamed</hi>
than to boast of, sufficient to found your present
Claim, considering how <hi>that name</hi> was in those dayes
no more <hi>than a name,</hi> a meer a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, We cannot give our assent unto this
<hi>Claim</hi> of yours, because we should thereby be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to <hi>cut</hi> off from the Church, and consequently
<hi>all hope of salvation,</hi> farre the greatest number of men
in the world who in this and all foregoing Ages have
called and do <hi>call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ,</hi> their Lord and ours. This we <hi>dare</hi> not do espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50044:116"/>
considering that many of them have <hi>spent</hi> and
do <hi>spend</hi> their dayes in great <hi>Affliction</hi> for their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
unto Christ and his Gospell, and many of them
every day seal their Testimony with <hi>their blood,</hi> so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
as we believe unto <hi>that holy army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
which continually praiseth God: Now as herein
we <hi>dare</hi> not concurre with you considering the
charge given unto <hi>Timothy</hi> by <hi>Paul, <gap reason="foreign">

be not partaker of other mens sins,</hi> so indeed
we are perswaded that your <hi>opinion,</hi> or rather <hi>presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
in this matter, is extreamly injurious to the
Grace of Christ, the Love and Goodness of God, as
also to the Truth of the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We suppose this the most <hi>Schismaticall</hi>
Principle that ever was broached under the Sun, since
there was a Church upon the earth: and that because,
1. It is the most <hi>groundless,</hi> 2. The most <hi>unchrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
that ever was; and 3. Of the most <hi>pernicious</hi>
consequence, as having a principal influence into the
present <hi>irreconcileableness</hi> of Differences among
Christians in the world; which will one day be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the <hi>Authors</hi> and Abettors of it; For it will one
day appear, that it is not the <hi>various Conceptions</hi> of
the minds of peaceable men about the things of God,
nor the <hi>various degrees</hi> of knowledge and faith that
are found amongst them, but <hi>groundless impositions</hi>
of things as <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed and practised,
beyond Scripture warrant, that are the Springs and
Causes of <hi>all,</hi> or at least the most <hi>blameable</hi> and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
differences among Christians.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We know this pretence should it take
place, would prove extreamly <hi>hazardous</hi> unto the
Truth of the <hi>Promises</hi> of Christ given unto the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</hi> For, suppose that to be one and the
same with the <hi>Roman,</hi> and whatever mishap may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the <hi>one</hi> must be thought to befall the <hi>other;</hi> for


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50044:117"/>
on your Supposition, they are not only like <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
twins, that being born together, wept and joyed
together, and together died, but like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
himself, as the same individuall Person or thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both the same; <hi>one</hi> Church, that hath <hi>two</hi> names,
Catholick and Roman, that is Universall-Particular;
no otherwise <hi>two,</hi> than as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was, when
by his overawing his Collegue from the execution of
his Office, they dated their Acts at <hi>Rome, Julio &amp;
Casare Consulibus.</hi> For, as they said,
<q>
                     <l>Non Bibulo qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <l>Nani Bibulo fieri Consule nil memini.</l>
                  </q>
Now, besides the <hi>failings</hi> which we know your Church
to have been subject unto in point of Faith, Manners,
and Worship; it hath also been at least in <hi>danger</hi> of
Destruction in the time of the prevalency of the
<hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ths, Vandals, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Longobards;</hi> especially
when <hi>Rome</hi> its self was left desolate and without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant
by <hi>Totilas.</hi> And what yet farther may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
it before the End of the world, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Only this I know that many are in expectation of a
<hi>sad Catastrophe</hi> to be given unto it, and that on
grounds not to be despised. Now God forbid, that
the Church unto which the <hi>Promises</hi> are made, should
be once thought to be subject unto all the dangers
and hazards that you <hi>wilfully</hi> expose your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
So that as this is a very groundless <hi>presumption</hi> in
its self, so it is a very great aggravation of your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
also, whilest you seek to entitle the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church</hi> of Christ unto them, which can neither
contract any such guilt as you have done, nor be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any such misery or punishment as you are.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We see not the <hi>Promises,</hi> made unto the
Catholick Church, <hi>fulfilled</hi> unto you; as we see that
to have befallen your Church, which is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50044:117"/>
the Promises that ever is should befall the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
The conclusion then will necessarily on <hi>both
instances</hi> follow, that either your are <hi>not the Catholick</hi>
Church, or that the <hi>Promises</hi> of Christ have failed
and been of none effect. And you may easily guess,
which part of the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> it is best and most <hi>safe</hi>
for us to give assent unto. I shall give you one or
two <hi>instances</hi> unto this last head. Christ hath <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
his Spirit unto his Church, that is the Catholick
Church, to <hi>abide with it for ever,</hi> Joh. 14. 16. But
this <hi>Promise</hi> hath not been made good unto your
Church at all times; because it hath not been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>head</hi> of it. Many a time the <hi>Head</hi> of your
Church hath not <hi>received</hi> the Spirit of Christ; for
our Saviour tells us in the next words, that <hi>the world
cannot receive him;</hi> that is men of the world, carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
minded men cannot do so: for he is the peculiar
<hi>inheritance</hi> of those that are <hi>called, sanctified,</hi> and do
<hi>believe.</hi> Now if ever there was <hi>any world</hi> in the
world, any of the world in the earth, some, many
of your <hi>Popes,</hi> have been so, and therefore by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Christ could <hi>not receive the Spirit</hi> that he
promised unto his Church. Again it is promised, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church <hi>Mysticall</hi> or Catholick in the first and
chiefest notion of it, <hi>that all her children shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all taught of God,</hi> and all <hi>that are so taught,</hi> as
our Saviour informs us, <hi>come to him by saving faith;</hi>
you will not I am sure for shame affirm that this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi>
hath been made good to all, either <hi>Children</hi> or
<hi>Fathers,</hi> of your Church. Innumerable other <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
made to the Catholick Church, may be instanced
in, which you can no better or otherwise apply unto
your Church, than one of your <hi>Popes</hi> did that of the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> to himself, <hi>Thou shalt tread on the Lion and
the Basilisk,</hi> when he set his foot on the neck of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick</hi>
the Emperour. But the Arguments are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50044:118"/>
whereby the vanity of this pretence may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sproved;
I shall only adde,</p>
               <p>Sixtly, That it is contrary to all <hi>Story,</hi> Reason, and
common sense: For it is notorious that far the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part</hi> of Christians, that belong to the Catholick
Church of Christ, of have done so from the dayes that
Christianity first entred the world successively in all
Ages, never thought themselves any otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> than in any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church of name in the world: And is it not a
madness to exclude them all from being <hi>Christians,</hi>
or belonging to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> because they
belonged not to the <hi>Roman:</hi> This I could easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
throughout all <hi>Ages</hi> of the Church succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.
But we need not insist longer on the dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that <hi>Assertion,</hi> which implyes a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in the very terms of it. If any Church be the
<hi>Catholick,</hi> it cannot therefore be the <hi>Roman;</hi> and if
it be the <hi>Roman</hi> properly, it cannot therefore be the
<hi>Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you shall say that you mean only that you
are a <hi>Particular Church</hi> of Christ, but yet <hi>that,</hi> or
<hi>such</hi> a Particular Church, as hath the great <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of Infallibility, and <hi>universall Authority</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto it, which makes it of necessity for all men
to submit unto it, and to acquiesce in its Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
I answer, 1. I fear you will not say so; you will
not, I fear, renounce your claim unto <hi>Catholicism.</hi> I
have already observed that your self in particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Church to be one and
the same. It is not enough for you that you belong any
way to the Church of Christ, but you plead that <hi>none</hi>
do so but your selves. 2. Indeed you do not own
your selves in this very Assertion to be a <hi>Particular
Church;</hi> your claim of Universall Authority and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
which you still carry along with you, is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent</hi>


                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:50044:118"/>
with any such concession 3. To make the best
of it that we can; what ground have you to give us
this Difference between the Churches of Christ, that
one is <hi>fallible,</hi> another <hi>infallible;</hi> that one hath power
over all the rest, that one depends on Christ, all the
rest on that one? where is the <hi>least intimation</hi> given of
any such thing in the Scripture? where or by whom is
it expresly asserted amongst the <hi>Antient Writers</hi> of
the Church? Was this <hi>Principle</hi> pleaded or once as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
in any of the Antient <hi>Councels?</hi> Some ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
expressions of particular Persons, most of them
<hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in the declining days of the Church,
you produce indeed unto this purpose: But can any
rationall man think them a <hi>sufficient foundation</hi> of that
stupendious fabrick, which you endeavour to erect
upon them? I suppose you will not find any such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
hasty in their so doing: Those who are already
<hi>engaged</hi> will not be easily recovered: For new <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi>
unto these Principles you have small ground to
expect any, unless it be of Persons whose <hi>lives</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tainted with sensuality, which they would gladly
have a refuge for against the accusations of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
or whose <hi>minds</hi> are entangled with worldly
secular advantages suited to their conditions, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and inclinations.</p>
               <p>Thus I have, with what <hi>briefness</hi> I could, shewed you
the <hi>uncertainty,</hi> indeed <hi>falsness</hi> of those Generall
Principles from which you educe all your other <hi>pleas</hi>
and reasonings, into which they must be resolved.
And now I pray consider the <hi>ground-work</hi> you lay for
the bringing of men unto a <hi>Settlement</hi> in the Truth
and unto the unity of Faith, in opposition to the
<hi>Scripture</hi> which you reject as insufficient unto this
purpose. The summe of it is, an <hi>acquiesceney</hi> in the
proposals and Determinations of your Church, as
to all things that concern faith and the worship of


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50044:119"/>
God. The <hi>two main Principles</hi> that concurre unto
it, we have apart considered, and have found them
every way insufficient for the end proposed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they one <hi>jot</hi> more of strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they
are <hi>complicated</hi> and blended together, as they usually
are by you, than they have in and of themselves as
they stand <hi>singly</hi> on their own bottoms. A thousand
<hi>falshoods</hi> put together will be farre enough from
making one Truth. A multiplication of them may
encrease a <hi>Sophism</hi> but not adde the least weight or
strength to an Argument. An army of <hi>Cripples</hi> will
not make one sound man. And can you think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that we should renounce our <hi>sure and firm
Word of Prophecy,</hi> to attend unto you in this chase
of uncertain Conjectures, and palpable untruths?
Suppose this were a way that would bring you and us
to an <hi>Agreement,</hi> and take away the evil of our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences;
I can name you <hi>twenty,</hi> that would do it as
effectually; and they should none of them have any
<hi>evil</hi> in them, but only that whch yours also is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guilty of, namely the <hi>Relinquishment</hi> of our Duty
towards God, and Care of our own Souls, to come
to <hi>some peace</hi> amongst our selves in this world, which
would be nothing else, but a plain <hi>Conspiracy</hi> against
Jesus Christ, and rejection of his <hi>Authority.</hi> At
present I shall say no more, but that he who is lead
into the <hi>Truth</hi> by <hi>so many Errors,</hi> and is brought
unto <hi>establishments</hi> by so many <hi>uncertainties,</hi> hath
singular success, and such as no other man hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to look for. Or he is like <hi>Robert Duke</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
who when he caused the <hi>Saracens</hi> to carry him
into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> sent word unto his friends in <hi>Europe,</hi>
that he was <hi>carried into Heaven on the backs of Devils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may also in particular be easily made to appear
how <hi>unsuited</hi> your means of bringing men unto the
unity of faith, are unto that <hi>Supposition</hi> of the present


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50044:119"/>
Differences in Religion between you and us, which
you proceed upon. For, suppose a man be <hi>convinced</hi>
that many things taught by your Church are <hi>false,</hi>
and contrary to the mind of God, as you know the
case to be between you and us; what course would
you take with him to <hi>reduce</hi> him unto the Unity of
Faith? would you tell him that your Church <hi>cannot
erre,</hi> or would you endeavour to perswade him that
the <hi>particulars</hi> which he instanceth in as <hi>Errours,</hi>
are not so indeed, but real <hi>Truths</hi> and necessarily by
him to be believed? The former, if you would speak it
out, down-right and openly, as becometh men who
<hi>distrust</hi> not the Truth of their Principles (for he that
is perswaded of the Truth never fears its strength)
would soon appear to be a very <hi>wise course</hi> indeed.
You would perswade a man in generall that you <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
erre,</hi> whilest he gives you instances that you have
<hi>actually erred.</hi> Do not think you have any <hi>Sophisms</hi>
against <hi>Motion</hi> in generall, that will prevail with any
man to assent unto you, whilest he is able to <hi>rise and
walk</hi> to and fro. Besides, he that is convinced of any
thing wherein you <hi>erre,</hi> believes the <hi>opposite</hi> unto it to
be true, and that on grounds unto him sufficiently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to require his assent: If you could now perswade
him that <hi>you cannot erre,</hi> whilest he actually believes
things to be <hi>true,</hi> which he knows to be contrary to
your Determination, what a sweet condition should
you bring him into? can you enable him to believe
<hi>Contradictions</hi> at the same time? Or, when a man on
particular grounds and evidences is come to a <hi>setled</hi>
firm perswasion that any Doctrine of your Church,
suppose that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> is false and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
unto Scripture and right Reason; if you
should, abstracting from particulars, in generall
<hi>puzzle</hi> him with <hi>Sophisms</hi> and pretences for your
Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> do you think it is an easie thing


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50044:120"/>
for him immediately to forego that perswasion in
particular, which his mind upon <hi>cogent</hi> and to him
unavoidable grounds and arguments was possessed
withall, without a rationall removall of those grounds
and Arguments? Mens belief of things never pierces
deeper into their Souls than their <hi>imagination,</hi> who
can take it up and lay it down at their pleasure. I am
perswaded therefore, you would take the <hi>latter
course,</hi> and strive to convince him of his <hi>mistakes</hi> in
the things that he judgeth <hi>erroneous</hi> in the Doctrine
of your Church. And what way would you proceed by
for his Conviction? Would you not produce <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Scripture,</hi> with Arguments drawn from them,
and the <hi>Suffrage</hi> of the Fathers to the same purpose?
Nay would you not do so, if the <hi>errour</hi> he charge you
withall, be that of the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of
your Church? I am sure, all your <hi>Controversie-Writers</hi>
of note take this course. And do you not see then,
that you are brought, whether you will or no, unto the
use of <hi>that way</hi> and means for the reducing of men
unto the Unity of Faith, which you before rejected,
which <hi>Protestants</hi> avow as sufficient to that purpose?</p>

happiness consisteth not in the <hi>knowing</hi> the things of
the Gospell, but in <hi>doing</hi> of them; and seeing that no
man can expect any <hi>benefit</hi> or advantage from or by
Christ Jesus, but <hi>only they</hi> that yeeld <hi>obedience</hi> unto
him, to whom alone he is a <hi>Captain of Salvation;</hi> the
first thing wherein all that profess Christianity ought
<hi>to agree</hi> and consent together is, joyntly to <hi>obey</hi> the
commands of Christ, to <hi>live godlliy, righteously and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50044:121"/>
in this present world,</hi> following after holiness
without which no man shall see God: Untill we all
agree in this, and make it our <hi>business,</hi> and fix it as our
<hi>end,</hi> in vain shall we attempt to agree in <hi>notionall</hi> and
speculative Truths; nor would it be much to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
so to do. For as I remember I have told you
before, so I now on this occasion tell you again, It will
at the last day appear, that it is all one to any man
what <hi>party</hi> or way in Christian Religion he hath been
of, if he have not <hi>personally</hi> been <hi>born again,</hi> and upon
mixing the <hi>Promises</hi> of Christ with faith, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>yeilded obedience</hi> unto him unto the end. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
men may have many <hi>advantages</hi> in one way that
they may not have in another: They may have better
<hi>means</hi> of instruction, and better <hi>examples</hi> for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
But as to the <hi>event,</hi> it will be one and the same
with all unbelievers, all unrighteous, and ungodly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
And men may be very zealous believers in a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
who are in the sight of God <hi>unbelievers</hi> as to the
whole design of the Gospell. This is a Principle
wherein as I take it all <hi>Christians agree,</hi> namely that
the <hi>Profession</hi> of Christianity will do no man the least
Good as to his eternall concernments, that lives not
up to the <hi>power</hi> of it; yea it will be an aggravation of
his condemnation: And the want hereof, is that
which hath lost all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ustre and splendour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
taught by Jesus Christ in the world. Would
Christians of all <hi>Parties</hi> make it their business to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
its reputation, wherein also their own bliss and
happiness is involved, by an <hi>universall obedience</hi> unto
the precepts of it, it would insensibly sink a <hi>thousand</hi>
of their Differences under ground. Were this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto, the world would quickly say with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<q>
                     <l>Magnus ab integro sêcloram nascitur ordo:</l>

The old glorious <hi>beautifull</hi> face of Christianity
would be restored unto it again, which many deform
more and more every day by <hi>painting</hi> a dead carcass
in stead of the living Spouse of Christ. And if ever
we intend to take <hi>one step</hi> towards any <hi>agreement</hi> or
unity, it must be by fixing this Principle in the minds
of all men, that it is of <hi>no advantage</hi> to any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Church or way in Christian Religion he be of,
unless he <hi>personally believe</hi> the promises, and live in
obedience unto all the precepts of Christ. And that
for him who doth so, that it is a trampling of the
whose Gospel <hi>underfoot</hi> to say that his salvation could
be endangered, by his not being of <hi>this</hi> or that Church
or way; especially considering how much of the <hi>world</hi>
hath immixed its self into all the known wayes that
are in it. Were this once well fixed on the minds of
men, and did they practically <hi>believe</hi> that men shall
not be dealt with all at the last day by <hi>gross,</hi> as of this
or that party or Church, but that every <hi>Individuall</hi>
Person must stand upon his own bottome, <hi>live by his
own faith,</hi> or perish for want of it, as if there had
been no other persons in the world but himself; wee
should quickly find their <hi>keenness</hi> in promoting and
contending for their severall parties, taken off, <hi>their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat</hi>
allayed, and they will begin to find their business
and concernment in Religion to be utterly another
matter than they thought of. For the present, some
Protestants think that when the <hi>Roman Power</hi> is by
one means or other <hi>broken</hi> which they expect, that
then wee shall agree and have peace; <hi>Romanists</hi> on
the other side look for, and <hi>desire</hi> the extirpation of
all that they call <hi>Heresy</hi> or <hi>Hereticks</hi> by one way or
other: some pretending highly to <hi>Moderation</hi> on
both sides, especially among the <hi>Protestants,</hi> hope
that it may be attained, by <hi>mutuall condescension</hi> of
the Parties at variance, contemperation of opinions


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50044:122"/>
and practises unto the present distant apprehensions
and interests of the <hi>chief leaders</hi> of either side; what
issue and event their desires, hopes, and attempts,
will have, <hi>time</hi> will shew to all the world. For my
part, until by a <hi>fresh powring</hi> out of the Spirit of God
from on high, I see Christians in <hi>profession,</hi> agreeing
in pursuing the end of Christianity, endeavouring to
be <hi>followers of Jesus Christ</hi> in a conversation becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospell, without trusting to the Parties
wherein they are engaged; I shall have very little
<hi>hopes</hi> to see any Unity amongst us, that shall be one <hi>jot</hi>
better than our present Differences: To see this, if
any thing, would make me say
<q>O mihi tam longe maneat pars ultima vitae.</q>
The present <hi>face</hi> of Christianity makes the world a
wearisome wilderness: Nor should I think any thing a
more <hi>necessary</hi> Duty, than it would be for Persons of
Piety and ability to <hi>apologize</hi> for the Religion of Jesus
Christ; and to shew how <hi>inconcerned</hi> it is in the wayes
and practises of the most that profess it; and how <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly</hi>
another thing it is, from what in the world it is
represented to be, so to put a stop unto that <hi>Atheism</hi>
which is breaking in upon us from the contempt that
men have of that <hi>Idaea</hi> of Christian Religion which
they have taken from the <hi>manner</hi> of its profession,
and <hi>lives</hi> of its Professors; were it not that I suppose
it more immediately <hi>incumbent</hi> on them and us all, to
do the same work in a <hi>reall expression</hi> of its power
and excellency, in such a kind of goodness, holiness,
righteousness, and heavenliness of conversation, as
the world is only as yet in sacret acquainted withall,
When this is done, the way for a farther agreement
will be <hi>open</hi> and facile; and, untill it be so, men will

We shall have no end of our Quarrels. Could I see an

but in <hi>their spirits &amp; affections;</hi> could I see them taking
up the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, not on their backs in its <hi>figure,</hi>
but on their hearts in its <hi>power,</hi> and in their whole

example, so teaching all others of their <hi>parties</hi> what it
is that they build upon for a blessed Eternity, that they
may not please and deceive <hi>themselves</hi> with their

they have with other Christans, I should hope the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Power, and we shall be nearer unto <hi>quietness</hi> than
most men imagine. When Christians had any unity is
the world, the <hi>Bible</hi> alone was thought to contain
their Religion, and every one endeavoured to <hi>learn</hi>
the mind of God out of it, both by their <hi>own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
and as they were instructed therein by their

their hoping and <hi>endeavouring</hi> to bring all Persons
that profess the Religion of Jesus Christ, to <hi>acquiesce</hi>
in the <hi>same opinions</hi> about all <hi>particulars,</hi> which are
any way determined to belong thereunto; especially
considering how <hi>endlesly</hi> they are multiplied and
branched into instances, such for ought appears the

knew, nor understood any thing of them, in the <hi>sense</hi>
and <hi>termes</hi> wherin they are now proposed as a <hi>tessera</hi>

of it to be contained in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which
men searched and studied, to become themselves, and
to teach others to be <hi>wise</hi> in the knowledg of God,
and living unto him, and the most of the <hi>Contests</hi> that
are in the world, will quickly vanish and disappear.

generous <hi>amplitude</hi> wherein it was delivered in the

<hi>Causes</hi> of strife and Contentions would be
taken away: but—<hi>ferri video meà gaudia ventis,</hi>
small hopes have I to see any such <hi>impression</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to besall the minds of concerned men; and yet I
must confess, I have not one <hi>jot more,</hi> of the <hi>reuniting</hi>
the Disciples of Christ in love and concord. But most
men that profess any thing of <hi>Divinity,</hi> have learned
it as an <hi>Art,</hi> or humane Science; out of the road,
compass, and track where of, they know <hi>nothing</hi> of the
mind of God; nay many scarce know the <hi>things</hi> in
themselves and as they are to be <hi>believed,</hi> which they
are <hi>passing skilfull</hi> in, as they are expressed in their
<hi>arbitrary termes of Art,</hi> which none almost under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
but themselves. And is it likely that such men
who are not a <hi>few</hi> in the world, will let go their <hi>skill</hi>
and <hi>knowledge,</hi> and with them their repntation and
advantage, and to sacrifice them all to the <hi>peace</hi> and
agreement that we are seeking after? Some learn their
<hi>Divinity</hi> out of the late, and <hi>Modern Schools,</hi> both in
the <hi>Reformed</hi> and <hi>Papall Church;</hi> in both which a
<hi>Science</hi> is proposed under that name, consisting in a
<hi>farrago of Credible Propositions,</hi> asserted in termes
suited unto that <hi>Philosophy</hi> that is variously predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant
in them. What a kind of <hi>Theology</hi> this hath
praduced in the Papacy, <hi>Agricola, Erasmus, Vives,
Jansenius,</hi> with innumerable other Learned men of


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50044:124"/>
your own, have sufficiently declared. And that it hath
any better success in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> many
things which I shall not now instance in, give me
cause to doubt. Some boast themselves to learn their
<hi>Divinity</hi> from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and say they depart not
from their sense and <hi>idiome</hi> of expression in what
they beleive and profess: But we find by experience,
that what for want of <hi>wisedom</hi> and judgement in
themselves, what for such reasons taken from the
<hi>writings</hi> which they make their <hi>Oracles,</hi> which I
shall not insist upon, much of the Divinity of some of
these men consists in that, which to avoid provocation
I shall not express. Whilest men are thus <hi>preing aged,</hi>
it will be very hard to prevail with them to think,
that the greatest part of their <hi>Divinity,</hi> is such, that
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> either as to the <hi>matter,</hi> or at least
as to that <hi>mode</hi> wherein alone they have <hi>imbibed</hi> it, is
little or not at all concerned in; nor will it be easie to
perswade them that it is a <hi>Mystery</hi> layed up in the
Scripture; and all true Divinity a <hi>Wisedom</hi> in the
Knowledg of that Mystery; and <hi>skill</hi> to live unto God
accordingly; without which as I said before, we shall
have <hi>no Peace or agreement</hi> in this world. <hi>Nobis curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositate
opus non est post Jesum Christum, nec inquisitione
post Evangelium,</hi> sayes <hi>Tertullian. Curiosity after the
Doctrine of Christ, and Philosophicall inquisitions (in
Religion) after the Gospel belongs not unto us.</hi> As we are</p>
               <p>IV. It were well, if Christians would but seriously
consider, what and <hi>how many things they are wherein
their present Apprehensions of the mind and will of God
do center and agree;</hi> I mean as to the <hi>substance</hi> of them,
their nature and importance, and how far they will
lead men in the wayes of <hi>pleasing God,</hi> and coming to
the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of him. Were not an endeavour to this
purpose <hi>impeded</hi> by many mens importunate cryes of
<hi>all</hi> or <hi>none,</hi> as good <hi>nothing at all,</hi> as not <hi>every thing,</hi>

I must acknowledg unto you, that I think it is <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi>
Carnall interest, love of Power, and present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
with other Secular Advantages, joyned
with <hi>Pride,</hi> Self-will and contempt of others, that
keep the professours of Christianity from <hi>conspiring</hi>
to improve this Consideration. But God help us, we
are all for <hi>Partyes,</hi> and our own exact being in the
<hi>right,</hi> and therein the <hi>only Church</hi> of Christ in the

agree with us, we being our selves the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>
of all Gospell Church state, laying weight upon
what we <hi>differ</hi> from others in, for the most part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly

at least, how far he hath <hi>instructed</hi> them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

may produce. And to tell you truly; I do not think

by Christians in their present divisions in the world,

it is not in the power of this, or that, no not of <hi>all the

all these cryes that are in the world, <hi>We are the Church,</hi> and <hi>we

Church, perswade me but that as <hi>every Assembly</hi> in the generall

that ordinarlly meet to worship God in Christ according to
his appointment, is a Church of Christ,

when you talked of <hi>Moderation</hi> and Unity, such Principles as
these, had better become you, than those which you either
privately <hi>couched</hi> in your Discourse, or openly insisted on. Men
that think of Reducing <hi>unity</hi> among Christians, upon the precise
terms of that <hi>Truth</hi> which they suppose themselves <hi>insolidum</hi>
possessors of, <hi>Ipsi fibe somnia fingunt,</hi> do but entertain themselves
with <hi>pleasant dreams,</hi> which a little Consideration may awake
them from Charity, condescension, a retrenchment of opinions
with a rejection of secular interests, and a design for the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of generall obedience,</hi> without any such respect to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
enclousures</hi> which diversity of opinions and different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Light and Knowledge have made in the field of the Lord
as should <hi>confine</hi> the effects of any <hi>Duty</hi> towards the Disciples of
Christ, unto those within them, with the <hi>like actings of minds</hi>
suited unto the example of Jesus Christ, must introduce the
<hi>desired Vnity,</hi> or wee shall expect it in vain.</p>
               <p>These are some of my <hi>hasty thoughts</hi> upon the Principles of
<hi>Protestants</hi> before mentioned, which you and others, may make
use of, as you and they please. In the mean time, I shall pray
that we may amidst all our <hi>Differences, love</hi> one another, <hi>pray</hi>
for one another, <hi>wait patiently</hi> for the communication of farther
Light unto one another, <hi>leave</hi> evil surmizes, and much more the
<hi>condemning</hi> and seeking the ruine of those that dissent from us,
which men usually do on <hi>various</hi> pretences, most of them
<hi>false</hi> and <hi>coyned</hi> for the present purpose. And when we can <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive</hi>
thereunto, I shall hope that from such <hi>generall Principles</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
before mentioned, somewhat may be <hi>advanced</hi> towards the
Peace of Christians; and that there will be so, when the whole
<hi>concernment</hi> of Religion shall in the Providence of God be <hi>unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled</hi>
from that <hi>worldly</hi> and <hi>secular interest,</hi> wherewith it hath
been wound up and entangled for sundry Ages; and when men
shall not be <hi>ingaged</hi> from their <hi>cradles</hi> to their <hi>graves</hi> in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
<hi>Zeal</hi> for any Church, or way of Profession, by outward
Advantages inseparably mixed and blended with it before they
came into the world. In the mean time, to expect <hi>unity</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
by the <hi>Reduction</hi> of all men to a precise agreement in <hi>all
the Doctrines</hi> that have been and are ventilated among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and in all Acts and wayes of worship; is to refer the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi>
and last Determination of things evangelical to the sword
secular power, and violence; and to inscribe <hi>vox ultima Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti,</hi>
upon great <hi>guns</hi> and other engines of war; seing otherwise
it will not be effected, and what may be done this way I know
not.

               <p>IT is time to return, and put an end unto our
review of those <hi>Principles,</hi> which I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your Discourse to be built upon. The next as
laid down in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> p. 103. is, <hi>That the
Pope is a good man, one that seeks nothing but our good,
that never did us harm, but hath the Care and inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rn
of us committed unto him by Christ.</hi> In the Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereof you leave out all the last part, and express
no more, but <hi>the Pope is a good man, and seeks nothing
but our good:</hi> and therein aim at a double advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
unto your self. First, That you may with some
<hi>colour</hi> of Truth, though <hi>really</hi> without it, deny the
Assertion to be yours, when as the <hi>latter part</hi> of it,
which upon the matter, is that which gives the sence,
and determines the meaning of the whole, is <hi>expresly</hi>
contended for by you, and that <hi>frequently,</hi> and at
large. Secondly, That you may vent an empty
<hi>Cavill</hi> against that expression, <hi>seeks nothing, but our
good;</hi> whereas had you added the next words, <hi>and
never did us harm,</hi> every one would have perceived in
what sense the <hi>former</hi> were spoken, and so have
prevented the frivolous exception. Your words are,
<hi>This also I nowhere aver, for I never saw him, nor
have any such acquaintance with him as to know
whither he be a good man, or no: though in charity
I do not use to judge hardly of any body; much less
could say, that he whom I know to have a general
sollicitude for all Churches, seeks nothing but our good,


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50044:127"/>
Sir if I had pondered my words in</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>no better
then you heed yours in your Animadversions upon it;
they might even go together both of them to lay up Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Spices, or some yet more vile employment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what you have said of the <hi>Pope,</hi> I desire the
Reader to consult your <hi>Paragraph</hi> so entitled: and
if he find not that you have said <hi>ten times more</hi> in
the commendation of him then I intimated in the
words layed down for your <hi>Principle,</hi> I am content
to be esteemed to have done you wrong. You have
indeed not only set him out as <hi>a good man,</hi> but have
made him <hi>much more then a man,</hi> and have ascribed
that unto him, which is not <hi>lawful</hi> to be ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any man whatever. Some of your <hi>Expressions</hi>
I have again reminded you of; and many others of
the same nature might be instanced in: and what
you can say <hi>more</hi> of him then you have done, unless
you would exalt him above <hi>all that is called God,</hi> and
worshipped; unless you should set him in <hi>the Temple
of God,</hi> and shew <hi>him that he is God,</hi> I know not.
Let the Reader if he please, consult your expressions,
where you have placed them; I shall <hi>stain Paper</hi> with
them no more. And you do but trifle with us, when
you tell us that <hi>you know not the Pope, nor have any
such acquaintance with him, as to know whether he be
a good men or no?.</hi> As though your personal <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
with this or that Pope, belonged at all to our
question. Although I must needs say, that it seems
very strange unto me, that you should hang the
weight of Religion, and the salvation of your own
soul, upon one of whom <hi>you know not so much as
whither he be a good man, or no.</hi> For my <hi>part</hi> I am
perswaded there is no such hardship in Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as that we should be bound to believe, that
all the safety of our Faith and Salvation depends


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50044:127"/>
on a <hi>man,</hi> and he such an one as concerning wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m
we know not whither he be <hi>a good man or no.</hi> The
Apostle layes the foundation of our hope in better
ground, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. And yet what ever opinion
you may have of your <hi>present Pope,</hi> you are forced
to be at this indifferency about his <hi>honesty,</hi> because
you are not able to deny but that very many of his
Predecessors, on whose shoulders the weight of all
your Religion lay, no less then you suppose it doth
on his who now swayes the <hi>Papal Scepter,</hi> were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
brutes, so far from <hi>being good men,</hi> as that they
may be reckoned amongst the <hi>worst</hi> in the world.
Protestants as I said, are perswaded that their <hi>faith</hi>
is laid up in better hands. With the latter part of my
words, as by you set down, you play <hi>sophistically,</hi>
that you might say something to them: (as to my
knowledge, I never observed any man so hard put
to it, to say somewhat, were it right or wrong)
which seems to be the utmost of your design. You
<hi>feign</hi> the sense of my words to be, <hi>that the Pope doth
no other thing in the world</hi> but seek our good: and
confute me by saying, that <hi>he hath a general sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for all Churches.</hi> But Sir, I said nor, <hi>be doth
nothing but seek our good;</hi> but only, <hi>he se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but our good, and never did us harm.</hi> And you may

else, hath any just cause to except against this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of my intention, which yet is the <hi>only one,</hi>
that in that kind, falls under your censure. For
whereas I say, that the <hi>Pope seeks nothing but our
good,</hi> and <hi>that he never did us harm,</hi> would any man
living but your self, understand these words any
otherwise, but with reference unto them of whom
I spake? that is as to us, he <hi>seeks nothing but our
good,</hi> whatever he doth in the world besides. And
is it not a <hi>wild</hi> interpretation, that you make of my
words, whilest you suppose me to intimate, that
<hi>absolutely</hi> the Pope <hi>doth nothing in the world,</hi> or hath
no other business at all that he concerns himself in,
<hi>but only the seeking of our good in particular?</hi> If you
cannot allow the books that you read the common
<hi>Civility</hi> of interpreting things indefinitely expressed
in them, with the limitations that the subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof they treat requires, you had better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your time in any thing then study, as being not
able to understand many lines in any <hi>Author</hi> you
shall read. Nor are such expressions to be avoided
in our common discourse. If a man talking of <hi>your
Fiat</hi> should say that <hi>you do nothing but seek the
good of your Countreymen,</hi> would you interpret his
words, as though he denyed that you <hi>say Mass,</hi>
and <hi>hear Confessions,</hi> or to intimate that you do
nothing but <hi>write Fiats?</hi> and you know with whom
lies both <hi>jus &amp; norma loquendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth and last Principle is, <hi>That the Devotion
of Catholicks far transcends that of Protestants;</hi> so
you now express it: what you mention being but
one part of three, that the <hi>Animadversions</hi> speak
unto. Hereunto you reply; <hi>But Sir, I never made
in</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>any Comparisons between your Devotions;
nor can I say how much the one is, or how little the


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50044:128"/>
other: but you are the maddest Commentator that I
have ever seen: you first make the Text, and then
Animadversions upon it.</hi> Pray Sir have a <hi>little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and learn from this instance not to be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
upon your memory for the future. I shall
rather think that <hi>fails you</hi> at present, then your
Conscience; but a <hi>failure</hi> I am sure there is, and
you shall take the liberty to charge it where you
please, which is more then every one would allow
you. I would indeed <hi>desirously</hi> free my self from
the labour of <hi>transcrtbing</hi> ought that you have
written to this purpose in your <hi>Fiat;</hi> and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you to the places which you seem to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.
But because this is the <hi>last instance</hi> of this
kind that we are to treat about, and you have
by degrees raised your <hi>Confidence, in denying your
own words</hi> to that height, as to accuse them <hi>of
madness,</hi> who do but remind you of them; I shall
represent once again unto you what you have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to this purpose; and I am perswaded upon your
review of it, you will <hi>like it so well,</hi> as to be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that ever you disowned it. I shall instance only in
one place, which is <hi>Sect.</hi> 22. <hi>p.</hi> 270, 271. where your
wordsare these, <hi>When I beheld</hi> (in the Catholick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys)
<hi>the deep reverence and earnest Devotion of the
people, the Majesty of their Service, the Gravity of
their Altars, the decency of their Priests; certainly
said I within my self, this is the House of God, the
Gate of Heaven. Alass our Churches in</hi> England <hi>as
they be now, be as short of those, either for decency,
use, or piety, as stables to a Princely Pallace. There
they be upon their knees all the week long at their
prayers, many of them constantly an hour together in
the morning, and half an hour he that is least; and
my house said God, is the house of Prayer; but our


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50044:129"/>
Churches are either shut up all the week, or if they
be open, are wholly taken up with boyes shouting,
running and gambolling all about. On</hi> Sundayes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
our people sit quiet, and decently drest, but to
bow the knee is quite out of fashion; and if any one
chance to do it, as it is rare to behold, so he is very
nimble at it, and as soon up as down, as if he made a
courtship with his knees, and only tryed if his nerves
and sinews were as good to how as to stand upright,
and our whole Religious work here, is to sit quietly
whilest the Minister speaks upon a Text,—and
that we spend all our dayes, ever learning and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
&amp;c. If this Discourse must be esteemed <hi>Text,</hi>
I pray tell me whose it is, yours or mine; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it doth not contain a <hi>comparison</hi> between the
Devotion of your <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> and
whether that that of the <hi>former</hi> be not preferred
above the other: And when you have done so, pray
also tell me whether you suppose it an <hi>honest and
candid</hi> way of handling matters of this importance,
or indeed of any sert whatever, for a man to say
and unsay at his pleasure, according unto what he
apprehends to be for his present advantage. And
whether a man may believe you, that you so <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi>
pondered the words of your <hi>Fiat,</hi> as you seem
to pretend; seeing you dare not abide by what you
have written, but disclaim it! And yet I confess
this may fall out, if your design in the weighing of
your words, was so to place them, as to deceive us
by them; which indeed it seems to have been. But
it is your unhappiness, that your words are brought
unto other mens seales after they had so fairly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
your own. For the Devotion its self (by the
way) of Catholicks which you here <hi>paint</hi> forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, it looks very suspitiously to be painted. The


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50044:129"/>
piety of your Churches wherein they exceed ours,
I confess I understand not; and your peoples fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
<hi>publick places</hi> to perform their <hi>private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi>
leans much to the old <hi>Pharisaism,</hi> which
our Saviour himself hath branded to all eternity for
<hi>hypocriticall,</hi> and carried on with little attendance
unto his precept of making the <hi>closet,</hi> and that with
the <hi>door shut</hi> upon the Devotionists, the most <hi>proper
seat</hi> of private supplications. Besides if their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
consist, as for the most part they do, in going
over by <hi>tale</hi> a set number of sayings which they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
understand; you may do well to commend your
<hi>Devotion</hi> to them that understand not one word of
Gospel for those that do, will not attend unto
it. And so I have once more passed through the
<hi>Principles</hi> of your work, with a fresh discussion of
some of them, which I tell you again I suppose
sufficient to satisfie <hi>judicious and ingenuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
in the sophistry and inconclusiveness of the
whole: My further proceedure being intended for
the satisfaction of your self, and such others as
have imbided the <hi>prejudices</hi> which you endeavour to
forestall your minds with all, and thereby have
given no small impeachment unto your <hi>judgement</hi>
and ingenuity.</p>

                  <hi>judgement or ingenuity,</hi> may be also written for
their use who have both. Neither did I speak <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi>
of them that were ingenuous and judicious,
but added also, that they were such as had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with the <hi>state of Religion of old, and at
this day in</hi> Europe, with the concernment of their
own souls in these things. With such as these, I suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then, and do still, that a discovery of the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of
your Discourse, and the falseness of the Principles you
proceeded on, was sufficient to give them satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
as to the <hi>uselesness</hi> of the whole, without a
particular <hi>ventilating</hi> of the flourishes that you made
upon your sandy foundations. But because I know
there were some, that might by the commendation
of your friends light upon your Discourse, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being prepossessed by <hi>prejudices</hi> might want
the ingenuity to examine particularly your Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Inferences, or through unacquaintedness
with the <hi>Stories</hi> of some things, that you referred
unto, might be disenabled to make a right <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of what you averred, I was willing to take
some further pains also for your satisfaction. And
what was herein done, or spoken amiss, as yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern. But I am perswaded, that if you had
not supposed that you had some of <hi>little judgement</hi>
and <hi>less ingenuity</hi> to give satisfaction unto, you
would never have pleased your self, with the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of such <hi>empty Trifles,</hi> in a business wherein you
pretend so great a concernment.</p>
               <p>Pag. <hi>31. You observe that I say, the</hi> Schoolmen
were the hammerers and forgers of Popery: <hi>And add,
Alas Sir, I see that anger spoyls your memory; for
in the twelfth and thirteenth Chapter you make Popery
to be hammered and forged not a few hundreds of years
before any Schoolmen were extant; And thorefore tell</hi>


                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:50044:131"/>
me that I hate the Schoolmen as the Frenchmen do
<hi>Talbot,</hi> for having been frightened with them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
<q>Sed risu inepto res ineptior nulla est.</q>
I confess the <hi>language</hi> of your Schoolmen is so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and barbarous, many of the <hi>things</hi> they sweat
about, so vain, curious, unprofitable, their <hi>way</hi> of
handling things, and expressing the notions of their
minds, so <hi>perplexed,</hi> dark, obscure, and oftentimes
unintelligibe, divers of their <hi>Assertions</hi> and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
so horrid and monstrous; the whole <hi>system</hi>
of their pretended Divinity, so <hi>aliene</hi> and forreign
unto the mysterie of the Gospel that I know no great
reason that any man hath much to delight in them.
These things have made them the sport and scorn of
the learnedest men that ever lived in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of your own Church. What one said of old of
others, may be well applyed unto them.

and <hi>Sophisms,</hi> attended with <hi>Obs</hi> and <hi>Sols,</hi>
speaking part the language of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and part

as the sight of the <hi>Harpyes</hi> did of old to

But the Truth is, there is no real cause of <hi>fear</hi> of

they are resolved aforehand to give up their

them, but that they understood not themselves.</hi>
Others may be entangled by them, who if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<hi>unty your knots,</hi> they may break your webbs,
especially when they find the <hi>Conclusions,</hi> as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they are, directly contrary to Scripture, right
reason, and natural sense it self. For they are the
genuine off-spring of the old <hi>Sophisters</hi> whom <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
talks of in his <hi>Menippus,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
tells us that in hearing the Disputations, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>That,</hi>
saith he, <hi>which seemed the most absurd of all, was,


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50044:132"/>
that when they disputed of things absolutely contrary,
they yet brought invincible and perswasive reasons to
prove what they said: so that I durst not speak a
word against him that affirmed hot and cold to be the
same, although I knew well enough that the same thing
could not be hot and cold at the same time.</hi> And
therefore he tells us that in hearing of them, he did
like a man half asleep, sometimes <hi>nod</hi> one way, and
sometimes another, which is certainly the <hi>deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the generality of them who are conversant
in the <hi>wrangles</hi> of your Schoolmen. But whatever
I said of them, or your Church, is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with its self, and the Truth. I grant that
before the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> set forth in the world, many
<hi>unsound opinions</hi> were broached in, and many <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
practices</hi> admitted into your Church: and
a great pretence raised unto a <hi>Superintendency</hi> over
other Churches, which were parts of that <hi>Mass</hi>
out of which your Popery is formed. But before
the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> took it in hand, it was <hi>rudis indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<expan>
                        <am>

moles,</hi> an heap, not an house. As <hi>Rabbi Juda
Hakkadosh</hi> gathered the <hi>passant Traditions</hi> of his
own time among the Jews, into a body or Systeme,
which is called the <hi>Mishnae</hi> or Duplicate of their
Law, wherein he composed a new Religion for them,
sufficiently distant from that which was professed
by their fore-fathers; so have <hi>your Schoolmen</hi> done
also. Out of the <hi>passant Traditions</hi> of the dayes
wherein they lived, blended with <hi>Sophistical</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
notions of their own, countenanced and
gilded with the sayings of some <hi>Ancient Writers</hi> of
the Church, for the most part wrested or misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
they have hammered out that <hi>Systeme of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical

                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:50044:132"/>
being as far distant from the Divinity of the
New Testament, as the <hi>Farrago</hi> of Traditions col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by <hi>Rabbi Juda,</hi> and improved in the <hi>Talmuds,</hi>
is from that of the old.</p>
               <p>Pag. 33, 34, 35. Having nothing else to say, you
fall again upon my <hi>pretended mistake,</hi> of considering
that as <hi>spoken absolutely by you, which you spake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon supposition;</hi> and talk of <hi>Metaphysical Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
in your</hi> Fiat, <hi>which you conceive me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet
to deal withal; and direct me to</hi> Bellarmines <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
as better suiting my inclination and capacity.</hi>
But Sir, we are not wont here in <hi>England</hi> to account
<hi>cloudy dark Sophistical declamations</hi> to be <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
Speculations;</hi> nor every feigned supposition
to be a Philosophical abstraction. I wish you
would be perswaded that there is not the least <hi>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi>
of any solid <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> in your whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
It may be indeed you would be angry with
them that should undeceive you; and cry out,
<q>
                     <l>—Pol me occidistis amici,</l>
                     <l>Non Servâstis,</l>

As he did,
<q>Cui demptus per vim mentis gratissimus Error.</q>
You may perhaps please your self with conceits of
your <hi>Metaphysical atchievements;</hi> but yonr friends
cannot but pitty you to see your vanity. The least
youth in our <hi>Vniversities</hi> will tell you, that to make
a <hi>general Supposition true or false,</hi> and to flourish
upon it with words of a seeming probability, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any cogency or proof, belongs to <hi>Rhetorick,</hi>
and not at all to <hi>Metaphysicks.</hi> And this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature of your Discourse. Nor do I <hi>mistake</hi> your
aim in it, as you pretend: I grant in the place you


<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50044:133"/>
would be thought to reply unto, though you speak
not one word to the purpose, that your <hi>enquiry is
after a means of setling men in the Truth,</hi> upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that they are not yet attained thereunto;
and you labour to shew the difficulty that there is in
that attainment, upon the account of the insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of <hi>many mediums</hi> that may be pretended to
be used for that end. In answer unto your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
I tell you directly, that the only means of
setling men in the Truth of Religion, is <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
and that this Revelation is <hi>entirely</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi>
contained in the Scripture, which therefore is
a <hi>sufficient means</hi> of setling all men in the Truth.
Suppose them <hi>rasae tabulae,</hi> suppose them utterly <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi>
of Truth; suppose them <hi>prejudiced</hi> against
it; suppose them <hi>divided</hi> amongst themselves about
it; the only safe, rational, secure way of bringing
them all to settlement is their belief of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God contained in the Scripture. This I
manifested unto you in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
you reply by a commendation of your own
<hi>Metaphysical Abilities</hi> with the excellencies of your
Discourse: without taking the least notice of my
answer; or the reasons given you against that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
groundless credo,</hi> which you would now
again impose upon us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PAg. 36. You insist upon somewhat in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that</hi> looks <hi>towards your purpose, which shall
therefore be discussed; for I shall not willingly miss
any opportunity that you will afford me, of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what ever you have to tender in the behalf of
your</hi> dying Cause. <hi>You mind me therefore of my
answer unto that discourse of yours;</hi> If the Papist
or Roman Catholick who first brought us the news of
Christianity, be now become so odious; then may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the whole story of Christianity be thought a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
You speak with the like extravagancy, and
mind not my Hypotheticks at all, to speak directly to
my inference as it became a man of Art to do: but
neglecting my Consequence, which in that Discourse is
principally and solely intended; you seem to deny my
Supposition: which if my Discourse had been drawn
into a Syllogisme, would have been the Minor of it.
And it consists of two Categories; First, That the
Papist is now become odious. Secondly, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
delivered us the first news of Christianity. The
first of these you little heed: the second you deny.
That the Papist say you, or Roman Catholick first
brought Christ and his Christianity into this Land, is
most untrue: I wonder, &amp;c. And your reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if any Romans came hither, they were not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and indeed our Christianity came from the East.
And this is all you say to my Hypothetick, or conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal


<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50044:134"/>
ratiocination, as if I had said nothing at all, but
that one absolute Category, which being delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I now only suppose. You use to call me a Civil
Logician; but I fear a natural one as you are, will
hardly be able to justifie this notion of yours as arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.
A Conditional hath a verity of its own, so
far differing from the supposed Category, that this
being false, that may yet be true. For example, if I
should say thus, A man who hath wings as an Eagle, or
if a man had wings of an Eagle, he might flye in the
ayre as well as another Bird; and such an Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not to be confuted by proving that a man hath
not the wings of an Eagle.</p>
               <p>The substance of this whole Discourse, is no
more but this; that because the Inference upon a
Supposition, may be a Consequence <hi>Logically</hi> true,
though the Supposition be false, or faigned: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Consequent,</hi> or thing inferred also is <hi>really
true,</hi> and a man must <hi>fly in the ayre,</hi> as you say, like
<hi>another Bird.</hi> But Sir, though every <hi>Consequence</hi> be
true <hi>Logically,</hi> that is lawfully inferred from its <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
be they true or false; and so must in Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be allowed: Yet where the <hi>Consequent</hi> is the
thing in Question, to suppose that if the <hi>Consequence</hi>
be lawfully educed from the premises, that it also
must be true, is a fond surmize. And therefore
they know <hi>qui nondum aere lavantur,</hi> that the
way to disappoint the conclusion of an <hi>hypothetick
Syllogisme,</hi> is to disprove the <hi>Category</hi> included in the
supposition, when reduced into an <hi>Assumption</hi> from
whence it is to be inferred. For instance, if the
thing in question be, <hi>Whether a man can fly in the ayre
(as you say) like another Bird;</hi> and to prove it,
you should say, <hi>if he has wings he can do so:</hi> the
way I think to stop your progress, is to <hi>deny that


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50044:134"/>
he hath wings.</hi> And if you should continue to
<hi>wrangle</hi> that your Inference is good, <hi>if he hath
wings, he may fly like another Bird,</hi> you would but
make your self ridiculous. But if you may be
allowed to make <hi>false and absurd</hi> suppositions, and
must have them taken for granted, you are very
much to blame if you inferr not <hi>Conclusions</hi> unto
your own purpose. And this in general is your
constant way of dealing: unless we will allow you
to <hi>suppose</hi> your selves to be the Church, and that
all the excellent things which are spoken of the
Church, beloog unto you alone, with the like ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
presumptions you are instantly mute, as if there
had appeared unto you
<q>Harpocrates digito qui significat St.</q>
But if in the case in agitation between us, I should
permit you without controul to make what <hi>supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
you please, and to make <hi>Inferences</hi> from them,
which must be admitted for truth, because <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
following upon your suppositions, what <hi>man
of Art</hi> I might have appeared unto you, I know
not: I fear with others, I should scarcely have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the reputation of <hi>Common sense</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
And I must acknowledge unto you, that
I am ignorant of <hi>that Logick</hi> which teacheth men
to suffer their <hi>Adversaries</hi> to proceed and insert
upon absurdities and false suppositions, to oppose
the Truth which they maintain. And yet I know
well enough what <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath taught us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
in which part of his <hi>Logick,</hi> you seem
to have been most conversant.</p>
               <p>But let us once again consider your <hi>ratiocination</hi>
as here you endeavour to reinforce it. Your <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>


                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:50044:135"/>
you say <hi>includes these two Categories; First,
that the Papists are become odious unto us: Secondly,
That the Papists delivered us the first news of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi>
Well, both these propositions I deny. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
are not become odious unto us, though we love
not their Popery: Papists did not bring us the first
news of Christianity. This I have proved unto you
already, and shall yet do it further. Will you now
be angry and talk of <hi>Logick,</hi> because I grant not
the <hi>consequent</hi> of these false pretensions to be <hi>true;</hi>
as if every <hi>Syllogisme</hi> must of necessity be true <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,</hi>
which is so in form. But yet farther, to
discover your mistake, I was so willing to hear you
<hi>out</hi> unto the utmost of what you had to say, <hi>that
in the Animadversions</hi> after the discovery of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the Assertions that it arose from, I suffered
your <hi>supposition</hi> to pass, and shewed you the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Inference upon it. And the reason of
my so doing, was this; that because though the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
brought not the Gopel first into <hi>England,</hi> yet
I do not judge it impossible but that they may be
the means of communicating it unto some other
place or People; and I would be loth to grant, that
they who receive it from them, must either alwayes
embrace their <hi>Popery,</hi> or renounce the <hi>Gospel.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
a great intanglement would be put on the
thoughts and minds of such <hi>Persons,</hi> by the Principle
of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of them that sent your Teachers,
whereinto it may be also they would labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
your belief. But yet if withal you shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto them the <hi>Gospel</hi> its self, as the great
<hi>Repository</hi> of the Mysteries of that Religion wherein
your instruct them, there is a <hi>sufficient foundation</hi>
laid for their reception of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of your <hi>Popery.</hi> For when once the Gospel


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50044:135"/>
hath evidenced its self unto their <hi>consciences</hi> that it
is from God, as it will do, if it be received unto
any <hi>benefit</hi> or advantage at all, they will, or may
easily discern, that those who brought it unto them,
were themselves in many things deceived in their
<hi>apprehensions</hi> of the mind of God therein revealed;
especially as to your pretence of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of
any man, or men, any further then his conceptions
agree with what is revealed in that Gospel which
they have received, and now for its own sake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be from God. And once to imagine, that
when the Scripture is received by faith, and hath
brought the soul into subjection to the Authority
of God exerting it self in it, and by it, that it will
not warrant them in the rejection of any respect
unto men whatever, is, <hi>to err not knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nor the Power of God.</hi> In this condition of
things, men will bless God for <hi>any means</hi> which he
was pleased to use in the communicating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
unto them; and if those who were employed in
that work shall persist in obtruding upon their faith
and worship, things that are <hi>not revealed,</hi> they will
quickly discover such a contradiction in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
as that it is <hi>utterly impossible</hi> that they should
rationally assent unto, and embrace them all, but
either they must <hi>renounce</hi> the Gospel which they
have brought them, or reject those other <hi>Principles</hi>
which they would impose upon them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto. And whither of those they will do,
upon a supposition that the <hi>Gospel</hi> hath now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that <hi>Authority</hi> over their consciences and
minds, which it claims in and over all that receive
it, it is no hard matter to determine. Men then
who have themselves mixed the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the
Gospel with many <hi>abominable errors</hi> of their own,


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50044:136"/>
may in the <hi>Providence</hi> of God be made instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to convey the Gospel unto others. At the first
tender of it they may for the <hi>Truths sake</hi> which
they are convinced of, receive also the <hi>errors</hi> that
are tendered unto them, as being as yet not able to
discern the <hi>chaff</hi> from the <hi>wheat.</hi> But when once
the Gospel is rooted in their minds, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to have their <hi>senses exercised therein</hi> to discern
between good and evil, and their faith of the Truth
they receive is resolved into the Authority of God
himself the Author of the Gospel, they have their
<hi>warrant</hi> for the rejection of the Errors which they
had before imbibed, according as they shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
unto them. For though they may first <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
the Gospel on the proposition of them that first
bring them the tidings of it, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> came to
our Saviour upon the information of the <hi>woman;</hi> yet
when they come to experience themselves its power
&amp; efficacy, they believe it for its own sake, as <hi>those</hi> did
also <hi>in our Lord Jesus Christ</hi> upon his own account;
when this is done, they will be enabled to distinguish,
as the Prophet speaks, <hi>between a dream and a prophecy,
between chaff and wheat,</hi> between error and Truth.
And thus if we should grant that the first <hi>News of
Christianity</hi> was brought into <hi>England</hi> by Papists,
yet it doth not at all follow, that if we reject <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
we must also reject the Gospel or esteem it a
<hi>Romance.</hi> For if we should have received <hi>Popery,</hi>
we should have received it only upon the credit and
<hi>Authority</hi> of them that brought it: but the Truth
of Christianity we should have received on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Gospel, which was brought unto us:
So that our entertainment of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
standing not on the same bottom or foot of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
we might well reject the <hi>one,</hi> and retain the


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50044:136"/>
other. But this consideration as to us, is needless;
they were not <hi>Papists</hi> which brought Christianity
first into this Land. Wherefore well knowing that
the whole strength of their reasoning depends on
the <hi>supposition</hi> that they were so, you proceed to
confirm it in your manner, that is, by saying it over
again. But we will hear you speaking your own
words.</p>
               <p>We had not our Christianity immediately from the
East, nor from <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> we Englishmen
had not. For as he delivered his Christianity unto
some Britans, when our Land was not called <hi>England</hi>
but <hi>Albion</hi> or <hi>Brittany,</hi> and the inhabitants were
not Englishmen but Britans or Kimbrians, so likewise
did that Christianity, and the whole news of it quite
vanish, being suddenly overwhelmed by the entient
deluge of Paganism; nor did it ever come from them
to us: nay the Brittans themselves had so forgot and
lost it, that they also needed a second Conversion, which
they received from Pove <hi>Eleutherius:</hi> And that was
the only news of Christianity which prequiled and lasted
even amongst the very Britans, which seems to me a
great seeret of Divine Providence in planting and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
his Church, as if he would have nothing to
stand firm and lasting, but what was immediately fixed
by, and seated upon that Rock: for all other conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
have variety, and the very seats of the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
failed, that all might the better cement in the
unity of one head: Nay the Tables which God wrote
with his own hand were broken, but the other written
by <hi>Moses</hi> remained; that we might learn to give a
due respect unto him, whom God hath set over us as
our Head and Ruler under him, and none exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against him. I know you will laugh at this my
Observation: but I cannot but tell you what I think.


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50044:137"/>
Where I speak then of the news of Christianity first
brought to this Land I mean not that which was first
brought upon the earth or soyle of this Land, and spoken
to any body then dwelling here, but which was delivered
to the forefathers of the now present Inhabitants, who
were Saxons or English men. And I say, that we the
now present Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> off spring of the
Saxons or English, had the first news of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
immediately from <hi>Rome,</hi> and from Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius</hi>
the Roman Patriarch, by the hands of his
Missioner St. <hi>Austin.</hi> Sith then the Categorick Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are both clear, namely that the Papists first brought
us the news of Christianity: and Secondly, that the
Papist is now become odi us unto us: What say you
to my Consequent? that the whole story of Christianity
may as well be deemed a Romance, as any part of that
Christianity we at first received, is now judged to
be a part of a Romance. This Consequence of mine,
it behoved a man of those great parts you would be
thought to have, to heed attentively, and yet you never
minded it.</p>
               <p>Some few Observations upon this Discourse of
yours, will further manifest the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of that
Consequence, which you seign not to have been
taken notice of in the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> for which you
had no cause, but that you might easily discern that
it did not deserve it. 1. Then you grant that the
<hi>Gospel</hi> came out of the <hi>East</hi> into this Land. So then
we did not first receive the Gospel from <hi>Rome,</hi> much
less by the means of <hi>Papists.</hi> But the Land was then
called <hi>Albion,</hi> or <hi>Brittany,</hi> and the people <hi>Brittans</hi>
or <hi>Kimbrians,</hi> not <hi>Englishmen.</hi> What then, though
the names of places or people are changed, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
whereever it is, is still the same. But the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
lost the Gospel until they had a new Conversion


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50044:137"/>
from <hi>Rome</hi> by the means of <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> But you
fail Sir, and are either <hi>ignorant</hi> in the story of those
times, or else wilfully pervert the truth. All the
Fathers and favourers of that <hi>Story,</hi> agree, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
was well rooted and known in <hi>Brittain,</hi> when
<hi>Lucius</hi> as is pretended, sent to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> for <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi>
in its propagation. Your own <hi>Baronius</hi> will
assure you no less, <hi>ad An.</hi> 183. <hi>n.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>Gildas de
Excid,</hi> will do it more fully. <hi>Virunnius</hi> tells us,
that the <hi>Brittans</hi> were then <hi>strengthened in the faith,</hi>
not that they then received it: <hi>Strengthened</hi> in what
they had, not newly <hi>converted,</hi> though some as it is
said, were so. And the dayes of <hi>Lucius</hi> are assigned
by <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> as the time wherein the <hi>whole Province</hi>
received the name of Christ, <hi>publicitus cum ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>
by publick decree: That it was received there
<hi>before,</hi> and abode there, as in <hi>other places</hi> of the
world under persecution, all men agree. In this
interval of time did the British Church bring forth
<hi>Claudia, Ruffina, Elvanus</hi> and <hi>Meduinus,</hi> whose
names amongst others are yet preserved. And to
this space of time do the Testimonies of <hi>Tertullian
ad Judae</hi> and of <hi>Origen. Hom.</hi> 4. <hi>in Ezek.</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christianity in <hi>Brittain</hi> belong. Besides, if the
only prevalent Religion in <hi>Brittany</hi> were as you fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that which came from <hi>Rome,</hi> how came the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Easter</hi> both amongst the <hi>Brittans,</hi> as
<hi>Beda</hi> manifests, and the <hi>Scots,</hi> as <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis</hi>
declares to be answerable to the Customs of the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Church, and contrary to those of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
Did those that came from <hi>Rome</hi> teach them to
do that which they judged their duty not to do?
But what need we stay in the confutation of this
sigment? The very <hi>Epistle of Eleutherius</hi> manifests
it abundantly so to be. If there be any thing of


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50044:138"/>
Truth in that <hi>rescript,</hi> it doth not appear that
<hi>Lucius</hi> wrote any thing unto him about <hi>Christian
Religion,</hi> but about the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> to govern his
Kingdom by; and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in his answer plainly
intimates that the Scripture was received amongst
the <hi>Brittans,</hi> and the Gospel much dispersed over the
whole Nation. And yet this <hi>figment</hi> of your own
you make the <hi>Bottom</hi> of a most strange contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
namely that God in his <hi>Providence would
have all that Christianity fail which came not from
Rome.</hi> That is the meaning of those expressions,
<hi>be would have nothing stand firm or lasting, but what
was immediately fixed by, and seated on that Rock,
for all other Conversions have vanished.</hi> Really Sir,
I am sorry for you, to see what wofull shelves your
<hi>prejudicate Opinions</hi> do cast you upon, who in your
self seem to be <hi>a well meaning goodnatured man.</hi> Do
you think indeed that those <hi>Conversions</hi> that were
wrought in the world by the means of any Persons
not coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> which were Christ himself
and all his Apostles, were not fixed on the <hi>Rock?</hi>
Can such a blasphemous thought enter into your
heart? If those primitive <hi>Converts</hi> that were called
unto the faith by Persons coming out of the <hi>East,</hi>
were not built on the <hi>Rock,</hi> they all perished ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
every soul of them; and if the other
Churches planted by them, were not immediately
fixed and seated on the <hi>Rock,</hi> they went all to Hell,
the <hi>Gates</hi> of it prevailed against them. Do you
think indeed that God suffered all the Churches in
the world to come to <hi>nothing,</hi> that all Christians
might be brought into subjection to your <hi>Pope,</hi> which
you call <hi>cementing in an Vnity of one Head?</hi> If you
do so, you <hi>think wickedly, that he is altogether like
unto your self; but be will reprove you, and set your


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50044:138"/>
faults in order before your eyes.</hi> Such horrible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
thoughts do men allow themselves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
withall, who are resolved to <hi>sacrifice</hi> Truth,
Reason and Charity unto their prejudices and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests.
Take heed Sir, least the <hi>Rock</hi> that you boast
of, prove not <hi>seven hills</hi> and deceive you. In the
persuit of the same Consideration, you tell me. <hi>that
I will laugh at your Observation, that the Tables
written by Gods own hand were broken, but those
written by</hi> Moses <hi>remained, that we may learn to give
a due respect to him whom God hath set over us.</hi> But you
do not well to say so; I do not <hi>laugh</hi> at your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
but I really pitty you that make it. Pray
Sir, what were those <hi>Tables</hi> that were <hi>written by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
when those written by God were broken? Such
<hi>mistakes</hi> as these you ever and anon fall into, and
I fear for want of being conversant in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi>
which it seems your Principles prompt you unto a
neglect of. Sir, the <hi>Tables</hi> prepared by <hi>Moses</hi> were
no less <hi>written with the finger of God,</hi> then those
were which he first prepared himself: <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 28.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 4. And if you had laid a good ground
for your notion, that the <hi>Tables</hi> prepared by God
were broken, and those <hi>hewed</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> preserved:
and would have only added what you ought to have
done, that there <hi>was nothing in the Tables</hi> delivered
unto the people by <hi>Moses,</hi> but what was written by
the finger of God, I should have commended both
it, and the inference you make from it. As it is
built by you on the sand, it would fall with its own
weight, were it no <hi>heavier</hi> then a feather. But you
lay great stress I suppose on that which follows:
namely, that the <hi>Brittans</hi> being expelled by the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> first received their Christianity
from <hi>Rome.</hi> You may remember what hath been


<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50044:139"/>
told you already in answer to this Case, about <hi>Romes</hi>
being left without inhabitants by <hi>Totilas.</hi> Besides if
we that are now Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> must be
thought to have first received the Gospel then when
it was first preached unto our <hi>own Progenitors</hi> in a
direct line ascending, this will be found a matter so
dubious and uncertain, as not possibly to be a thing
of any concernment in Christian Religion; and
moreover will exempt most of the <hi>chief families</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> from your enclosure, seeing one way or
other they derive themselves from the <hi>Antient Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
Such pittifull trifles are you forced to make
use of, to give countenance unto your cause. But
let it be granted that Christianity was first commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
unto the <hi>Saxons</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of
Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> which yet indeed is not true neither:
for Queen <hi>Berta</hi> with her Bishop <hi>Luidhardus</hi> had
both practised the worship of Christ in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his coming, and so prepared the people, that
<hi>Gregory</hi> sayes in one of his Epistles, <hi>Anglorum gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
voluisse fieri Christianam.</hi> What will thence ensue?
why plainly, that we must be all <hi>Papists</hi> or Atheists,
and esteem the whole Gospel a <hi>Romance.</hi> But why
so I pray? Why, the <hi>Categorick Assertions are both
clear;</hi> namely, that the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pist first brought us the
news of Christianity; and that Papists are now odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But how comes this about? we were talking
of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and some that came from <hi>Rome</hi> in his
dayes. And if you take them for <hi>Papists,</hi> you are
much deceived. Prove that there was one <hi>Papist</hi> at
<hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of that <hi>Gregory,</hi> and I will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I mean such a <hi>Papist</hi> as your present <hi>Pope</hi> is,
or as your self are. Do you think that <hi>Gregory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Catholick Supremacy and Infallibility of
the Pope, the doing whereof in an especial manner


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50044:139"/>
constitutes a man a Papist. If you have any such
thoughts, you are an utter <hi>stranger</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the state of
things in those dayes, as also to the writings of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
himself. For your better information you may
do well to consult him, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 32, 36, 38. And
sundry other instances may be given out of his own
writings, how remote he was from your <hi>present Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
Irregularities and superstitious observations
were, not a few in his dayes crept into the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which you still pertinaciously adhere unto,
as you have the happiness to adhere firmely unto
any thing that you once irregularly embrace. But
that the main Doctrines, Principles, Practices and
Modes of Worship which constitute <hi>Popery,</hi> were
known, admitted, practised, or received at <hi>Rome</hi> in
the dayes of <hi>Gregory,</hi> I know full well that you are
not able to prove. And by this you may see the
Truth of your first Assertion, that <hi>Papists brought
us the first news of Christianity:</hi> which you do not
in the least endeavour to prove; but take it hand
over head, to be the same with this, that <hi>some from</hi>
Rome <hi>preached the Gospel to the Saxons in the dayes
of</hi> Gregory, which it hath no manner of affinity
withall. Your second true Assertion is, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
is now become odious unto us;</hi> but yet neither
will this be granted you. <hi>Popery</hi> we dislike, but
that the <hi>Papists</hi> are become odious unto us, we abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny. Though we like not the <hi>Popery</hi> they
have admitted, yet we love them for the <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
which they have retained. And must not that needs
be a doubty Consequence that is enduced out of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
where in there is not a word of truth! Besides,
I have already in part manifested unto you, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<hi>both</hi> of them to be true, as <hi>neither</hi> of them
is; yet your Consequence is altogether inconsequent,


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50044:140"/>
and will by no means follow upon them. And this
will yet more fully appear in an examination of
your ensuing Discourse.</p>
               <p>That which you fix upon to accept against, is
towards the close of my Discourse to this purpose
in these words as set down by you, pag. 40. <hi>Many
things delivered us at first with the first news of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
may be afterwards rejected for the love of
Christ, and by the Commission of Christ.</hi> The truth
of this Assertion I have newly proved again unto
you, and have exemplified it in the instance of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
bringing the first news of Christianity to any
place, which is not impossible but they may do,
though to this Nation they did not. I had also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confirmed it with such reasons as you judged it
best to take no notice of; which is your way with
things that are too hard for you to grapple withall.
I must I see, <hi>drive</hi> these things through the thick <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles</hi>
of your prejudices with more instances, or you
will not be sensible of them. What think you then of
those who received the first news of Christianity by
believers of the <hi>circumcision,</hi> who at the same time
taught them the necessity of being circumcised, and
of <hi>keeping Moses Law?</hi> were they not bound after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
upon the discovery of the <hi>mistake</hi> of their
teachers to <hi>retain</hi> the Gospel, and the truth thereof
taught by them, and to <hi>reject</hi> the observation of
<hi>Mosaical</hi> rites and observations? or were they free
upon the discovery of their mistake to esteem the
whole <hi>Gospel a Romance?</hi> What think you of those
that were converted by <hi>Arians,</hi> which were great
multitudes, and some whole Nations? were not
those Nations bound for the <hi>Love of Christ,</hi> by his
word, to retain their Christianity, and reject their
<hi>Arianisme,</hi> or must they needs account the whole


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50044:140"/>
Gospel a fable, when they were convinced of the
Errour of their first teachers, denying Christ Jesus
in his Divine nature to be of the same substance
with his Father, or essentially God! To give you an
instance that it may be will please you better; There
are very many <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> or elsewhere
Converted unto Christianity by <hi>Prote stants,</hi> without
whose instruction they had never received the least
rumor or report of it. Tell me your judgement;
if you were now amongst them, would you not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to perswade them that <hi>Christian Religion</hi>
indeed was true, but that their <hi>first Instructers</hi> in it
had deceived them as to many particulars of it, which
you would undeceive them in, and yet keep them
close to their Christianity! And do you not know
that many who have in former dayes been by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
converted to Christianity from <hi>Paganism,</hi>
have afterwards from the Principles of their
Christianity been convinced of their <hi>heresie,</hi> and
retaining the one, have rejected the other? It
is not for your advantage to maintain an oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against so evident a Truth, and exemplified by so
many instances in all ages. I know well enough the
ground of your <hi>pertinaciousness</hi> in your mistake, it is
that men who receive the Gospel, do resolve their
faith into the Authority of them that first preach it
unto them. Now this <hi>supposition</hi> is openly false and
universally as to all persons what ever not divinely
inspired, yea as to the Apostles themselves but only
with respect unto their working of Miracles, which
gave Testimony unto the Doctrine that they taught.
Otherwise Gods Revelation contained in the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
is that which the <hi>faith</hi> of men is formally and
ultimately resolved into; so that what ever Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are made unto them, they may reject, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50044:141"/>
they do it with a <hi>non obstante</hi> for its supposed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
the whole Revelation abides unshaken,
and their saith founded thereon. But as to the
<hi>Persons</hi> who first bring unto any the tidings of the
Gospel, seeing the faith of them that receive it, is
not resolved into their <hi>Authority or Infallibility,</hi>
they may, they ought to examine their proposals by
that unerring word which they ultimately rest upon,
as did the <hi>Beraeans,</hi> and receive or reject them at first
or afterwards as they see cause, and this without the
least impeachment of the truth or Authority of the
Gospel its self which under this <hi>formal</hi> consideration
as revealed of God, they absolutely believe. Let
us now see what you except hereunto. First you ask,
<hi>What love of Christs dictates, what commission of Christ
allows you to choose and reject at your own pleasure?
Ans.</hi> None; nor was that at all in question, nor do you
speak like a man that durst look upon the true state of
the Controversie between us. You proclaim your
cause desperate by this perpetual tergiversation. The
Question is, whither when men preach the Gospel unto
others, as a Revelation from God, and bring along
the <hi>Scripture</hi> with them wherein they say that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is comprized, when that is received as such,
and hath its authority confirmed in the minds of
them that receive it, whither are they not bound to
<hi>try</hi> all the teaching in particular of them that first
bring it unto them, or afterwards continue the
preaching of it, whither it be consonant to that
Rule or Word, wherein they believe the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the will of God relating to the Gospel
declared unto them to be contained, and to <hi>embrace</hi>
what is <hi>suitable</hi> thereunto, and to <hi>reject</hi> any thing
that in particular may be by the mistakes of the
teachers imposed upon them? Instead of believing


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50044:141"/>
what the Scripture teacheth, and rejecting what it
condemns, you substitute <hi>choosing or rejecting at your
own pleasure,</hi> a thing wherein our discourse is not at
all concerned. You adde, <hi>What Heretick was ever
so much a fool as not to pretend the Love of Christ, and
Commission of Christ for what he did?</hi> What then I
pray! may not others do a thing really upon such
grounds as some pretend to do them on falsly? may not
a Judge have his Commission from the King, because
some have counterfeited the great Seal? May not you
sincerely seek the good and peace of your Country
upon the Principles of your Religion, though some
pretending the same Principles have sought its distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and ruine? If there be any force in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
it overthrows the Authority and Efficacy
of every thing that any man may <hi>falsly pretend</hi> unto,
which is to shut out all order, Rule, Government,
and vertue out of the world. You proceed, <hi>How
shall any one know you do it out of any such Love or
Commission, sith those who delivered the Articles of
saith now rejected, pretended equal love to Christ and
Commission of Christ for the delivery of them as any
other!</hi> I wonder you should proceed with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
enquiries. How can any man manifest
that he doth any thing by the Commission of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but by his producing and manifesting his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to be his? and how can be prove that the doth
it out of <hi>Love</hi> to him, but by his diligence, care, and
conscience in the discharge of his Duty, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells us, saying <hi>if you love me, keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
which is the proper effect of love unto him,
and open evidence or manifestation of it. Now
how should a man prove that he doth any thing by
the Commission of Christ, but by <hi>producing that
Commission?</hi> that is, in the things about wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch we


<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50044:142"/>
treat, by declaring and evidencing that the things he
proposeth to be believed, are revealed by his spirit in
his word, and that things which he <hi>rejects</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereunto! And what ever men may pretend,
Christ gives out no adverse Commissions; his word
is every way and everywhere the same, at perfect
harmony and consistency with its self; so that if it
come to that, that several Persons do teach contrary
doctrines either before or after one another, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
under the same pretence of receiving them
from Christ, as was the case between the Pharises of
old that believed, and the Apostles, they that attend
unto them, have a perfect <hi>guide</hi> to direct them in
their choice, a perfect <hi>Rule</hi> to judge of the things
proposed. As in the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises</hi>
had taught the people many things as from God,
for their Traditions or <hi>Oral Law</hi> they pretended to
be from God: Our <hi>Saviour</hi> comes, really a teacher
from God, and he disproves their <hi>false Doctrines</hi>
which they had prepossessed the people withall, and
all this he doth by the <hi>Scripture</hi> the Word of Truth
which they had before received. And this <hi>Example</hi>
hath he left unto his Church unto the end of the
world. But you yet proceed; <hi>Why may we not at
length reject all the rest for love of something else,
when this Love of Christ which is now crept into the
very out side of our lips is slipt off from thence! Do you
think men cannot find a cavil against him as well as
his Law delivered unto us with the first news of him,
and as easily dig up the root as cut up the branches!</hi>
You are the pleasantest man at a disputation that
ever I met withal, <hi>haud ulli veterum virtute secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus;</hi>
you outgo your masters in palpable Sophistry.
If we may, and ought for the Love of Christ, reject
errours and untruths taught by fallible men, then we


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50044:142"/>
may reject him also for the love of other things.
Who doubts it, but men <hi>may</hi> if they will, if they have
a mind to do so? they may do so <hi>Physically,</hi> but may
they do so <hi>Morally?</hi> may they do so upon the <hi>same</hi>
or as good grounds and reasons as they reject <hi>errours</hi>
and false worship for the sake of Christ? With such
kind of arguing is the <hi>Roman Cause</hi> supported.
Again, you suppose the <hi>Law</hi> of Christ to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore say that his <hi>Person</hi> may be so also.
But this contains an application of the general <hi>Thesis</hi>
unto your particular case, and thereupon the <hi>begging</hi>
of the thing in Question. Our enquiry <hi>was general</hi>
Whither things at first delivered by any Persons that
preach the Gospel may not be <hi>rejected</hi> without any
impeachment of the Authority of the Gospel it self?
Here, that you may insinuate that to be the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and us, you suppose the things <hi>rejected</hi> to
be the <hi>Law</hi> of Christ, when indeed they are things
rejected because they are <hi>contrary to the Law</hi> of
Christ, and so affirmed in the Assertion, which you
seek to oppose. For nothing may be <hi>rejected</hi> by the
<hi>Commission</hi> of Christ, but what is contrary to his
<hi>Law.</hi> The truth is, he that rejects the <hi>Law</hi> of Christ
as it is his, needs no other inducement to reject his
<hi>Person;</hi> for he hath done it already in the rejection
of his <hi>Law:</hi> but yet it may not be granted, though
it belong not unto our present discourse, that every
one that <hi>rejects</hi> any part of the Law of Christ, must
therefore be in a propensity to reject Christ himself,
provided that he do it only because he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it to be any part of his Law. For whilest a
man abides firm and constant in his <hi>faith</hi> in Christ
and love unto him, with a resolution to submit himself
to his whole Word, Law, and Institutions, his misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of this or that particular in them, is no


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50044:143"/>
impeachment of his faith, or Love. Of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
is that which you add, namely, <hi>Did not the
Jews by pretence of their love to the immortal God,
whom their forefathers served, reject the whole Gospel
at once? and why may not we possibly by piece meale?</hi>
You do only cavil at the expression I used, <hi>of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the thing</hi> mentioned <hi>for the love of Christ,</hi> but I
used it not alone, as knowing how <hi>casie</hi> a thing it
was to pretend it, and how <hi>unwarrantable</hi> a ground
of any actings in Religion such a pretence would
prove; where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore I added unto it, his <hi>Commission,</hi>
that is his Word. And so I desire to know of you
whither the Jews <hi>out of love to God and by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his word</hi> did reject the Gospel or no. This
you must assert if you intend by this <hi>instance</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
my assertion. Besides indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> did
scarce pretend to reject the Gospel out of <hi>love to
God,</hi> but to their old Church-State, and Traditions,
on which very account your selves at this day reject
many important truths of it. But it is one thing
<hi>vainly</hi> to pretend the Love of God, another <hi>so to
love</hi> him indeed as to keep his Commandments, and
in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o doing to cleave unto the Truth, and to reject
that which is contrary thereunto. You add as the
issue of these enquiries, <hi>Let us leave cavils, grant my
supposition which you cannot deny; then speak to my
Consequence, which I deem most strong and good, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Conclusion which neither you nor I can grant.
Answ.</hi> I wish you had thought before of leaving
<hi>Cavils</hi> that we might have been eased of the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the foregoing Queries, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, and those very trivial. Your supposition
which is, that <hi>Papists first brought the Gospel into
England,</hi> you say I cannot deny: but Sir, I do deny
it, and challenge you or any man in the world to


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50044:143"/>
make it good, or to give any colour of Truth unto
it. Then your Consequence you say you <hi>deem strong

that I greatly <hi>pitty</hi> you for your di courte, and that
on many accounts. First, That in the same breath
wherein you so solemnly <hi>protest before God and his

intimate that you <hi>descend</hi> unto <hi>no conclusions</hi> in this
affair, wherein notwithstanding your pretences you


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50044:144"/>
really <hi>dogmatize</hi> and that with as much confidence
as it is possible I think for any man to do. And
2. That you cast <hi>before God and his holy Angels</hi> the
light froth of your scoffing expressions, <hi>my honest
Parsons,</hi> &amp;c. a sign with what conscience you are
conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to write and declare your mind in things of the
nature and importance that these are of, you should
have no more judgement in them or about them,
then so solemnly to entitle such a <hi>trifling Sophism</hi> by
the name of <hi>irrefragable Consequence.</hi> As also
4. That in the Solemnity of your Protestation you
for got to express your mind <hi>in sober sense;</hi> for aiming
to make a <hi>disjunctive conclusion</hi> you make the <hi>parts</hi>
of it not at all <hi>disparate,</hi> but <hi>coincident</hi> as to your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
the one of them bring the direct consequent
of the other. 5. That you so much make naked
your <hi>desires</hi> after <hi>Benefices and gleab lands,</hi> as though
they were the great matter in contest amongst us,
which reflects no small <hi>shame</hi> and stain on Christian
Religion and all the Professors of it. 6. Your <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable

                  </gap>y,
built upon I know not how many false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
as 1. That <hi>Papists are become odious unto
us,</hi> where as we only reject <hi>your Popery,</hi> love your
Persons, and approve of your Christianity. 2. That
<hi>Papists brought us the first tidings of the Gospel,</hi>
which hath been sufficiently before disproved.
3. That <hi>Papists hold all things in Religion that they
did,</hi> and as they did, who first brought us the news
of Christianity, which we have also manifested to
be otherwise in the <hi>signal</hi> instance of the opinion of
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> about your Papal Power and titles.
4. That we have no occasion of exception against
<hi>Papists,</hi> but only their holding the things that those


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50044:144"/>
did, who first preached the Gospel here; when that
is no <hi>cause</hi> at all of our exceptions, but their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of pretended <hi>Articles of faith,</hi> and idolatrous
superstitious practises in worship, superadded by
them since that time, are the things they stand charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withall. Now your Consequent being built on
all these suppositions, fit to hold a principal place in
<hi>Lucians vera historia,</hi> must needs be <hi>irrefragable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What you add farther on this <hi>subject,</hi> is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
in other words of what you had said before,
with an application of your <hi>false</hi> and groundless sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
unto our present differences; but yet least
you should flatter your self, or your Disciples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves with thoughts that there is any
thing of weight or <hi>moment</hi> in it, shall also be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
You adde then, <hi>that if any part, much more
if any parts, great substantial parts of Religion brought
into the Land with the first news of Christianity be
once rejected (as they are now amongst us) as Romish
or Romanical, and that rejection or Reformation be
permitted, then may other parts and all parts, if the
gap be not stopped, be looked upon at length as points of
no better a condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have given you sundry instances already, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
evincing that some opinions of them who first
bring the <hi>news</hi> of Christian Religion unto any, may
be afterwards rejected without the least impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the whole, or of our faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Yea men may be necessitated so to reject them,
to keep entire the Truth of the <hi>whole.</hi> But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
supposed, is of <hi>mens</hi> opinions that bring
Christian Religion, and not of any <hi>parts</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion it self. For the <hi>mistakes</hi> of any men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whither in Speculation or Practice about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
are no <hi>parts</hi> of Religion, much less <hi>substantial</hi>


                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:50044:145"/>
parts of it. Such was the Opinion of the necessity
of the observation of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Rites taught with a
suitable practice, by many believers of the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
who first preached the Gospel in sundry places
in the world. And such were the Rites and Opinions
brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> that are rejected
by <hi>Protestants,</hi> if any such there were, which as yet
you have not made to appear. There is no such
<hi>affinity</hi> between Truth and Errour, however any
men may endeavour to blend them together, but
that others may separate between them, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Light of the Gospel is of that nature, as that if it be
once sincerely received in the mind and embraced, it
will <hi>work out</hi> all those false notions, which by any
means together with it may be instilled: As <hi>rectum</hi>
is <hi>index sui &amp; obliqui.</hi> Whilest then we know and
are perswaded that in any <hi>Systeme</hi> of Religion which
is proposed unto us, it is only <hi>error</hi> which we reject,
having an infallible <hi>Rule</hi> for the guidance of our
judgement therein, there is no danger of weakning
our assent unto the Truth which we retain. Truth
and falshood can never stand upon the same <hi>bottom,</hi>
nor have the same evidence, though they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
at the same <hi>time</hi> unto us, and by the same
<hi>Persons.</hi> So that there is no difficulty in apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the one may be <hi>received,</hi> and the other <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>
Nor may it be granted (though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
lye not therein at all) that if a man reject
or <hi>disbelieve</hi> any point of Truth that is delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to give a <hi>firm assent</hi> unto them, unless he reject
or disbelieve it upon a notion that is common to

the <hi>Authority</hi> of God revealing things to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and knowing that Revelation to be <hi>entirely</hi>
contained in the Scriptures, by which we are to
examine and <hi>try</hi> whatever is by any man or men
proposed unto us as an object of our faith, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it only upon this consideration that it is a part
of that which is revealed by God in the Scripture for
us to believe, without which they have no ground
nor warrant to <hi>propose</hi> any thing at all unto us in
that kind, we may reject any of their <hi>proposals</hi> which
we find and discern not to be so revealed, or not to
be agreeable to what is so revealed, without the
least <hi>weakning</hi> of our assent unto what is revealed
indeed, or making way for any man so to do. For
whilest the <hi>formal reason</hi> of faith remains absolutely
unimpeached, different apprehensions about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
things to be believed, have no efficacy to <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi>
faith its self, as we shall farther see in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of your ensuing Discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same way and means that lopt off some branches,
will do the like to others, and root too:</hi> (but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and mistakes of men are not branches growing
from the root of the Gospel) <hi>A Vilification of
that Church wherein they find themselves who have a
mind to prevaricate upon pretence of Scripture and
power of interpreting it, light, spirit or reason, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
with a personal obstinacy that will not submit,
will do it roundly and to effect. This first brought off
the Protestants from the Roman Catholick Church;


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50044:147"/>
this lately separated the Presbyterians from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Protestant Church, the Independent from the
Presbyterian, and the Quakers from the other Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.
And this left good, maintains nothing of
Christian Religion but the moral part, which indeed
and truth is but honest Paganism. This speech is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all serious Consideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which this <hi>Discourse</hi> seems to amount unto,
is that if a man question or reject <hi>any thing</hi> that is
taught by the Church whereof he is a member,
there remains no way for him to come unto any <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
in the remaining parts of Religion, but that
he may on as good grounds question and reject all
things as any. As you phrase the matter, by <hi>mens vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
a Church which a mind to prevaricate upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. though there is no consequence
in what you say, yet no man can be so mad as to plead
in justification of such a proceeding. For it is not
much to be doubted, but that he who layeth <hi>such a
foundation,</hi> and makes such a beginning of a <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from any Church, will make a progress suitable
thereunto. But if you will speak unto your own
<hi>purpose,</hi> and so as they may have any concernment
in what you say with whom you deal, you must
otherwise frame your <hi>hypothesis.</hi> Suppose a man
to be a member of any Church, or to find himself in
any Church state with others, and that he doth at
any time by the <hi>light</hi> and direction of the Scripture,
discover any thing or things to be <hi>taught</hi> or <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
in that Church whereof he is so a member, which
he cannot assent unto, unless he will contradict the
<hi>Revelation</hi> that God hath made of himself, his mind
and will, in that compleat Rule of all that Religion
and worship which are pleasing unto him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth <hi>suspend</hi> his assent thereunto, and therein


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50044:148"/>
                  <hi>dissent</hi> from the determination of that Church;
then you are to assert for the promotion of your
design, that all the Consequents will follow which
you expatiate upon. But this supposition fixes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably
upon the penalty of forfeiting their <hi>interest</hi>
in all saving truth, all Christians whatever, <hi>Greeks,
Abissines, Armenians, Protestants</hi> in the Churches
wherein they find themselves, and so makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ustrate
all their attempts for their reconciliation to the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For do you think they will attend
unto you, when you perswade them to a relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Communion of that Church wherein
they <hi>find themselves</hi> to joyn with you, when the first
thing you tell them is, that if they do so, they are
<hi>undone</hi> and that for ever? And yet this is the summ
of all that you can plead with them, if there be any
<hi>sense</hi> in the Argument you make use of against our
relinquishment of the opinions and practises of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because we or our forefathers were
at any time members thereof, or lived in its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But you would have this the special Priviledge
of your Church alone. Any <hi>other</hi> Church a man
may leave, yea <hi>all other</hi> Churches besides; he may
relinquish the principles wherein he hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
yea it is his duty to renounce their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
only your Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is wholly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
a man that hath <hi>once</hi> been a member of it must
be so for <hi>ever;</hi> and he that questions <hi>any thing</hi>
taught therein, may on the same grounds question
<hi>all</hi> the Articles of faith in the Christian Religion.
And who gave you leave to <hi>suppose</hi> the only thing in
<hi>Question</hi> between us, and to use it as a <hi>medium</hi> to
educe your Conclusion from? is it your business to
take care,

To disintangle you out of this <hi>Labyrinth</hi> whereinto
you have cast your self, I shall desire you to observe,
that if the Lord Christ by his Word be the <hi>Supream
Revealer</hi> of all Divine Truth; and the Church, that
is any Church whatever, be only the <hi>Ministerial
proposer</hi> of it, under and from him, being to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
in all its propositions by his Revelation, if
it shall chance to <hi>propose</hi> that for Truth, which is not
by him revealed, as it may do, seeing it hath no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of being preserved from such <hi>failures,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in its attendance unto that <hi>Rule,</hi> which it may
neglect or corrupt: A man in such a Case cannot
discharge his Duty to the <hi>Supream Revealer,</hi> without
dissenting from the <hi>Ministerial proposer.</hi> Nay if it
be a <hi>Truth</hi> which is proposed, and a man dissent
from it, because he is not convinced that it is <hi>revealed,</hi>
he is in no danger to be induced to question other


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:50044:149"/>
                  <hi>Propositions,</hi> which he knows to be so revealed, his
faith being built upon, and resolved into that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
alone. All that remains of your discourse
lyes with its whole weight on this <hi>presumption,</hi> because
some men may either <hi>wilfully</hi> prevaricare from the
Truth, or be <hi>mistaken</hi> in their apprehensions of it,
and so dissent from a Church <hi>that teacheth</hi> the truth,
and <hi>wherein</hi> she so teacheth it, without cause; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no man may or ought to relinquish the <hi>errors</hi> of
a Church, which he is really and truly convinced by
Scripture and solid reason suitable thereunto, so to
be. An inference so wild and so destructive of all
<hi>assurance</hi> in every thing that is <hi>knowable</hi> in the world,
that I wonder how your <hi>Interest</hi> could induce you to
give any countenance unto it. For if no man can
certainly and <hi>infallibly</hi> know any thing by any way
or means wherein some or other are <hi>ignorantly</hi> or
<hi>wilfully</hi> mistaken, we must bid <hi>adiew</hi> for ever to the
certain knowledge of any thing in this world. And
how slightly soever you are pleased to speak of
<hi>Scripture</hi> Light, <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> they are the
proper names of the wayes and <hi>helps</hi> that God hath
graciously given to the sons of men, to come to the
knowledge of himself. And if the <hi>Scripture</hi> by the
assistance of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, and the <hi>light</hi> unto
it communicated unto men by him, be not sufficient
to lead them in the use and improvement of their
<hi>Reason</hi> unto the saving knowledge of the will of
God, and that <hi>assurance</hi> therein which may be a firm
foundation of acceptable obedience unto him, they
must be content to go without it; for other wayes
and means of it, there are none. But this is your
manner of dealing with us. All other Churches must
be sleighted and <hi>relinquished,</hi> the means appointed
and sanctified by God himself to bring us unto the


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50044:149"/>
knowledge of, and settlement in the Truth must be
<hi>rejected,</hi> that all men may be brought to a <hi>fanatical</hi>
unreasonable resignation of their faith to you and
your Church; if this be not done, men may with as
<hi>good reason</hi> renounce Truth as Error; and after they
have rejected one error, be inclined to cast off all
that Truth, for the sake whereof that error was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by them. And I know not what other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
and mischiefs will follow: It must needs be
well for you, that you are
<q>—Gallinae filius albae,</q>
Seeing all others are
<q>—Viles pulli nati infelicibus ovis.</q>
Your only misadventure is, that you are fallen into
somewhat an unhappy age, wheréin men are hard-hearted,
and will not give away their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
to every one that can take the confidence to beg
them at their hands.</p>
               <p>But you will now prove by <hi>instances,</hi> that if a man
deny any thing that your Church proposeth, he may
with as good reason deny every Truth whatever.
I shall follow you through them, and consider what
in your <hi>matter</hi> or manner of proposal is worthy
that serious perusal of them which you so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
To begin, <hi>See if the Quakers deny not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
the regenerating power of Baptisme, as you
the efficacy of Absolution. See if the Presbyterians
do not with as much reason evacuate the Prelacy of
Protestants, as they the Papacy.</hi> All things it seems
are alike, Truth and Error, and may with the same
reason be opposed and rejected. And because some
men renounce <hi>errors,</hi> others may on as good grounds
renounce the Truth, and oppose it with as solid and


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50044:150"/>
cogent reasons. The <hi>Scripture</hi> it seems is of no
use to direct, guide, or settle men in these things that
relate to the worship and knowledge of God. What
a strange <hi>dream</hi> hath the Church of God been in
from the dayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> if this be so! Hitherto
it hath been thought that what the <hi>Scripture</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in these things turned the <hi>scales,</hi> and made the
embracement of it reasonable, as the rejection of
them the contrary. As the <hi>woman</hi> said to <hi>Joab, They
were wont to speak in old time, saying, they shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask counsel at</hi> Abel, <hi>and so they ended the matter:</hi>
They said in old time concerning these things, To the
<hi>Law and the Testimonies,</hi> search the Scriptures, and
so they ended the matter. But it seems <hi>tempora
mutantur,</hi> and that now Truth and Falsehood are
equally probable, having the same grounds, the same
evidences. <hi>Quis leget haec, min, tu istud ais.</hi> Do
you think to be believed in these incredible figments,
fit to bear a part in the stories of <hi>Vlysses</hi> unto <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous!</hi>
Yet you proceed, <hi>See if the Socinian Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against the Trinity, be not as strong as yours
against the Eucharist.</hi> But where did you ever read
any Arguments of ours against the <hi>Eucharist?</hi> Have
you a dispensation to say what you please for the
promotion of the Catholick Cause? Are not the
Arguments you intend, indeed rather <hi>for</hi> the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
then <hi>against</hi> it? Arguments to vindicate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that holy <hi>Eucharistical</hi> Ordinance, and to
preserve it from the manifold abuses that you and
your Church do put upon it. That is, they are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
against your <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and <hi>proper
sacrifice</hi> that you intend. And will you now say,
that the Arguments of the <hi>Socinians</hi> against the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
the great fundamental Article of our Prosessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
plainly <hi>taught</hi> in the Scripture, and <hi>constantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi>


                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:50044:150"/>
by the Church of all Ages, are of equal force
and validity, with those used against your <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
and <hi>Sacrifice of the Mass,</hi> things never
mentioned, no not once in the whole Scripture, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of, nor believed by the Church of old,
and destructive in your reception unto all that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and sense, whereby we are, and know that we
are men and live? But suppose your prejudice and
partial addiction unto your way and faction, may
be allowed to countenance you in this monstrous
comparing and coupling of things together like
his, who
<q>Mortua jungehat corpora vivis;</q>
is your inference from your enquiry any other but
this, that the Scripture setting aside the Authority
of your Church, is of no use to instruct men in the
Truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all things are alike uncertain unto

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you farther manifest to be your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your following enquiries. <hi>See</hi> say you, <hi>if the
Jew do not with as much plaufibility deride Christ, as
you his Church.</hi> And would you could see what it
is to be a <hi>zealot</hi> in a faction, or would learn to deal
candidly and honestly in things wherein your own
and the souls of other men are concerned. Who is
it amongst us that <hi>derides</hi> the Church of Christ?
Did <hi>Elijah</hi> deride the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when he
opposed the <hi>Priests of Baal?</hi> or must every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
be judged to <hi>deride the Church of Christ,</hi> who
opposeth the corruptions that the <hi>Roman faction</hi>
have endeavoured to bring into that <hi>part</hi> of it,
wherein for some ages they have prevailed? What
<hi>Plausibility</hi> yon have found out in the <hi>Jews derision</hi>
of Christ, I know not. I know some that are as
conversant in their writings at least, as you seem to


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:50044:151"/>
have been, who affirm that your arguings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings
are utterly destitute of all <hi>plausibility</hi> and
tolerable pretence. But men must have leave to say
what they please, when they will be <hi>talking</hi> of they
know not what; as is the case with you, when by
any chance you stumble on the <hi>Jews</hi> or their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.
This is that which for the present you
would perswade men unto; That the Arguments of
the <hi>Jews</hi> against Christ, are as good as those of
<hi>Protestants</hi> against your Church, <hi>credat Apella.</hi> Of
the same nature with these is the remainder of your
Instances and Queries. You suppose that a man
may have as good reasons for the denyal of <hi>Hell,</hi>
as <hi>Purgatory;</hi> of <hi>Gods Providence</hi> and the Souls
Immortality, as of any <hi>piece of Popery;</hi> and <hi>then
may not want appearing incongruities, tautologies,
improbabilities to disenable all Holy Writ at once.</hi>
This is the condition of the man who disbelieves
any thing proposed by your Church, nor in that
state is he capable of any relief. Fluctuate he must
in all <hi>uncertainties:</hi> Truth and error are all one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and he hath as good grounds for the one
as the other. But Sir, pray what serves the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
for all this while? Will it afford a man no
Light, no Guidance, no Direction? Was this quite
out of your mind? or did you presume your <hi>Reader</hi>
would not once cast his thoughts towards it for his
relief in that maze of <hi>uncertainties</hi> which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to cast him into? or dare you manage such
an <hi>impeachment</hi> of the wisdom and goodness of God,
as to affirm that that Revelation of himself which
he hath graciously afforded unto men to reach them
the knowledge of himself, and to bring them to
settlement and assurance therein, is of no use or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
to any such purpose? The Holy Ghost tells


<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50044:151"/>
us, that <hi>the Scripture is profitable for doctrine and
instruction, able to make the man of God perfect, and
us all wise unto salvation, that the sure Word of
Prophecy, where unto he commands us to attend is a
light shining in a dark place;</hi> directs us to <hi>search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it;</hi> that we may come to the acknowledgement
of the Truth; sending us unto it for our <hi>settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
affirming that they who speak not according
<hi>to the Law and the Testimonies</hi> have no light in them.
He assures us that the <hi>word of God</hi> is a light unto ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

feet, and his Law <hi>perfect,</hi> converting the soul: That
it is able <hi>to build us up, and to give us an inheritance
among all them that are sanctified:</hi> that the things
in it are written <hi>that we might believe that Jesus is
the Christ the Son of God, and that believing we may
have life through his name.</hi> See also <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29, 31.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 18. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 19. <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. Is there no truth in all this, and much
more that is affirmed to the same purpose? or are
you surprized with this mention of it, as <hi>Caesar
Borgia</hi> was with his sickness at the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pope Alexander,</hi> which spoiled all his designs,
and made him cry, that he had never thought of it,
and so had not provided against it. Do you not
know that a, <hi>volume</hi> might be filled with Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of antient fathers, bearing witness to the <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi>
and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Scripture for the settlement
of the minds of men in the knowledge of God and
his worship? Doth not the experience of all Ages,
of all places in the world render your <hi>Sophistry</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible?
are there not, were there not <hi>millions</hi> of
Christians alwayes, who either knew not, or regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not, or openly rejected the Authority of your
Church, and disbelieved many of her present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
who yet were, and are <hi>stedfast</hi> and in move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50044:152"/>
in the faith of Christ, and willingly seal the
Truth of it with their dearest blood? But if neither
the <hi>Testimony</hi> of God himself in the Scriptures, nor
the concurrent <hi>suffrage</hi> of the antient Church, nor
the experience of to many thousands of the Disciples
of Christ, is of any moment with you, I hope you
will not take it amiss if I look upon you as one
giving in your self as <hi>signal an Instance</hi> of the power
of prejudice, and partial addiction to a party and
interest, as a man can well meet withall in the world.
This discourse you tell me in your close, you have
bestowed upon me in a way of <hi>supererogation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you deal with us as you do with God himself.
The <hi>Duties</hi> he expresly by his commands requireth
at your hands; you <hi>pass by</hi> without so much as take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
notice of some of them; and others, as those
of the <hi>second Command</hi> you openly reject, offering
him somewhat of your own that he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
by the way, as <hi>you barbarously call</hi> it of
<hi>Supererogation;</hi> and so here you have passed over
in <hi>silence</hi> that which was incumbent on you to have
replyed unto, if you had not a mind <hi>vadimonium

you had undertaken; and in the room thereof sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
this <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>useless diversion,</hi> by the way
as you say of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> But yet because you
were to free of your <hi>Charity,</hi> before you had <hi>payed
your debts,</hi> as to bestow it upon me, I was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing

I am not your <hi>Rivall</hi> in the admiration of it, and
shall therefore leave you quietly in the <hi>embracements</hi>
of your Darling. And for the latter, we have had
enough of it already, and so by this time I hope
you think also. The close only of your Discourse
<hi>is considerable,</hi> and therefore I shall transcribe it for
your second thoughts. And it is this,</p>
               <p>But Sir what you say here, and so often up and
down your book of Papists contempt of the Scripture,
I beseech you will please to abstain from it for the
time to come. I have conversed with the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
of <hi>France, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>anders</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> I have
read more of your Books both Histories, Contempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Scholastical Divines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n I believe you
have ever seen or heard of. I have seen the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Sacred Priests and Religious houses, I have
communed with all sort of people and perused their
Counsells. And after all this I tell you, and out of
my love I tell you that their respect to Scripture is


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50044:153"/>
real, absolute and cordial, even to admiration. Others
may talk of it, but they act it, and would be ready
to stone that man that should diminish Holy Writ. Let
us not wrong the innocent. The Scripture is theirs,
and Jesus Christ is theirs, who also will plead their
Cause when he sees time.</p>
               <p>What you mention of your own <hi>diligence</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
what you have <hi>done,</hi> where you have
<hi>been,</hi> what you have seen and discoursed, I shall not
trouble you about. It may be as to your souls
health
<q>—Tutior, poter as esse domi.</q>
But yet for all the report that you are pleased to
make of <hi>your self,</hi> it is not hard to discern that you
and I
<q>
                     <l>—Nec pondera rerum</l>
                     <l>Nec momenta sumus.</l>
                  </q>
And notwithstanding your Writings, it would have
been very difficult for any man to have guessed at
your <hi>great reading,</hi> had you not satisfied us by this
your own information of it. It may be if you had
spared some of the <hi>time</hi> which you have spent in the
reading of your <hi>Catholick Books</hi> unto the study of
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it had not been unto your disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
In the mean time there is an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in
your confidence a little too evident. For it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable
that <hi>I may,</hi> and true that I have <hi>seen more of
your Authors</hi> in <hi>half</hi> an <hi>hour,</hi> then you can read I
think in <hi>an hundred years;</hi> unless you intend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to give no other account of your reading,
then you have done in your <hi>Fiat</hi> and <hi>Epistola:</hi> But
we are weary of this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,

                  <q>Quin tu alium quaer as quoi centones farcias.</q>
But to pass by this <hi>boasting,</hi> there are two parts of
your Discourse, the one concerning the <hi>faith,</hi> the
other expressing the <hi>Charity</hi> of Roman Catholicks.
The first contains what <hi>respect</hi> you would be thought
to <hi>have for the Scripture,</hi> the latter what you really
have for all <hi>other Christians besides</hi> your selves. As
to the former you tell me, that I speak of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
contempt of the Scripture, and desire me to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from it for the time to come.</hi> Whither I have
used that expression anywhere of <hi>contempt</hi> of the
Scripture, well I know not. But whereas I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you as my <hi>friend,</hi> at least for the <hi>good advice</hi> I
have frequently given you, I have deserved that you
should be so, and therefore shall not deny you any
thing that I can <hi>reasonably grant;</hi> and whereas I
cannot readily comply with you in your <hi>present
request,</hi> as to the alteration of my mind in reference
unto the <hi>respect</hi> that <hi>Papists</hi> bear unto the Scriptures,
I esteem my self <hi>obliged</hi> to give you some account of
the reasons why I persist in my former thoughts,
which I hope, as is usual in such cases, you will be
pleased to take in friendly part. For besides Sir,
that you back your <hi>request</hi> with nothing but some
overconfident <hi>asseverations,</hi> subscribed with <hi>teste
meipso,</hi> I have many reasons taken from the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
and Doctrine of your Church, that strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me to abide in my former perswasion. As
1. You know that in these and the neighbouring
Nations, Papists have <hi>publickly burned</hi> the Scriptures,
and destroyed more Copies of them then ever <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
Epiphanes</hi> did of the <hi>Jewish Law.</hi> And if
you should go about to prove unto me that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
have no great regard to <hi>Sacred Images that


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:50044:154"/>
have been worshipped,</hi> because in these and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations they brakes and burned a great
number of them, I should not readily know what
to answer you. Nor can I entertain any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of your abilities, as to expect from you a
satisfactory <hi>answer</hi> unto my instance of the very
same nature, manifesting what respect <hi>Papists</hi> bear
unto the Scriptures. 2. You know that they have
<hi>imprisoned</hi> and <hi>burned</hi> sundry persons for keeping
the Scripture in their houses, or some parts of them,
and reading them for their instruction and comfort.
Nor is this any <hi>great sign</hi> of respect unto them, no
more then it is of mens respect to <hi>treason</hi> or <hi>murder,</hi>
because they hang them up who are guilty of them.
And 3. Your Church <hi>prohibiteth the reading of them</hi>
unto Lay-men, unless in some special cases, some few
of them be licenced by you so to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you study &amp;
sweat for arguments to prove the reading of them
needless and dangerous, putting them as translated,
into the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of Books prohibited. Now this is
the very mark and stamp that your <hi>Church</hi> sets upon
these books which she disapproves, and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanceth
as pernicious to the faithful. 4. Your
<hi>Councel of Trent</hi> hath decreed that your <hi>unwritten
Traditions</hi> are to be received with the same <hi>faith
and veneration</hi> as the Scripture, constituting them
to be one part of the Word of God, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
another, then which nothing could be spoken
more in <hi>contempt</hi> of it, or in reproach unto it. For
I must assure you, <hi>Protestants</hi> think you cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
contract a greater guilt by any contempt of
the Scripture then you do, by reducing it into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with your <hi>unwritten Traditions.</hi> 5. You have
<hi>added Books</hi> not only written with an <hi>humane and
fallible Spirit,</hi> but farced with <hi>actual mistakes</hi> and


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50044:154"/>
falshoods unto the Canon of the Scripture, giving
just occasion unto them who receive it from you
only, to question the Authority of the whole. And
6. You teach the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Scripture at least
in respect of us, (which is all it hath, for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and must regard some in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto whom it doth consist) depends on the
<hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Church; the readiest way in the
world to bring it into <hi>Contempt</hi> with them that
know what your Church is, and what it hath been.
And 7. <hi>You plead that it is very obscure and unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi>
of its self, and that in things of the greatest
moment, and of most indispensible necessity unto
Salvation; whereby you render it perfectly <hi>useless,</hi>
according to the old Rule, <hi>Quod non potest intelligi,
debet negligi;</hi> it is fit <hi>that should be neglected, which
cannot be understood.</hi> And 8. There is a book lately
written by one of your party, after you have been
frequently warned and told of these things, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> giving countenance unto many other
hard reflections upon it, as hath been manifested in
the <hi>Animadversions</hi> written on that Book. 9. Your
great <hi>Masters</hi> in their writings have spoken very
<hi>contemptuously</hi> of it: whereof I shall give you a few
instances. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> which is properly
<hi>yours,</hi> determines as I told you, that their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be received and venerated <hi>pari pietatis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu
&amp; reverentia,</hi> with <hi>an equal affection of piety
and reverence,</hi> as the Scriptures of the Old and New
Testament: which is a setting up of the <hi>Altar of
Damascus</hi> with that of God himself in the same Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Sess.</hi> 4. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. And <hi>Andradius,</hi> no small part
of that Convention, in his defence of that <hi>Decree</hi>
tells us that, <hi>cum Christus fragilitati memoriae Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio
scripto succurrendum putavit, it a breve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50044:155"/>
libris tradi voluit, ut pars maxima tanquam
magni precii thesaurus traditionibus intimis Ecclesiae
visceribus infixis relicta fuerit. As our Lord Christ
thought meet to relieve the frailty of memory by the
written Gospel, so he would have a short compendium
or abridgement committed unto books, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part as a most precious treasure might be left unto
Traditions fixed in the very inward bowels of the
Church.</hi> This is that <hi>cordial and absolute respect</hi>
even <hi>unto admiration</hi> that your Catholicks bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scripture: And he that doth not <hi>admire it,</hi>
seems to me to be very stupid. It contains some
<hi>small part</hi> of the mysteries of Christian Religion,
the <hi>great treasure</hi> of them lying in your <hi>Traditions;</hi>
and thereupon he concludes, <hi>Canonem seu Regulam
fidei exactissimam non esse Scripturam, sed Ecclesiae
judicium; that the Canon or most exact Rule of Faith
is not the Scripture but the judgement of the Church;</hi>
Much to the same purpose as you plead in your <hi>Fiat</hi>
and <hi>Epistola. Pighius</hi> another Champion of your
Church, <hi>Ecclesiast. Hierarch. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. after he
hath given many reasons to prove the obscurity of
the Scripture, with its flexibility to every mans
sense, as you know who also hath done, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
all things to be determined by the Church,
concludes, <hi>Si hujus Doctrinae memores fuissemus, hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticos
scilicet non esse informandos, vel convincendos
ex Scripturis, meliore same loco essent res nostrae; sed
dum ostentandi ingenii &amp; eruditionis gratia cum</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thero
<hi>in certamen discenditur Scripturarum, excitatum
est hoc quod, proh dolor, nunc videmus incendium.
Had we been mindful of this Doctrine, that Hereticks
are not to be instructed, nor convinced out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
our affairs had been in a better condition
then now they are: but whilest some to shew


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50044:155"/>
their wit and learning would needs contend with</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>out of the Scriptures, the fire which we now
with grief behold, was kindled and stirred up.</hi>
And it may be you remember who it was that called
the Scripture <hi>Evangelium nigrum,</hi> and <hi>Theologiam
atramentariam,</hi> seeing he was one of the most famous
champions of your Church and Cause. But before
we quite leave your <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> we may do
well to remember the advice which the <hi>Fathers</hi> of
it, who upon the stirs in <hi>Germany</hi> removed unto <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
gave to the <hi>Pope, Julius</hi> the third, which one
that was then amongst them afterwards published.

quadam cautione &amp; diligentia, ne ea res majores nobis
turbas ac tumultus excitet, Last of all, that which
is the most Weighty of all the advices which that at this
time we shall give unto you, we have reserved for the
close of all. Your eyes are here to be opened; you are
to endeavour with the utmost of your power, that as
little as may be of the Gospel (especially in any vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongue) be read in those Cities which are under your
government and Authority; but let that little suffice
them which is wont to be read in the Mass</hi> (of which
mind you also know who is) <hi>neither let it be lawful
for any man to read any more of it. For as long as
men were contented with that little, your affairs were
as prosperous as heart could desire, and began immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to decline upon the custome of reading any more of
it. This is in brief that book which above all others
hath procured unto us those tempests and storms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are almost carryed away headlong. And the
Truth is, if any one shall diligently consider it, and then
seriously ponder on all the things that are accustomed
to be done in our Churches, he will find them to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different the one from the other, and our Doctrine
to be divers from the Doctrine thereof, yea and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
plainly contrary unto it. Now this when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

man or other amongst the adversaries, they make no end

We <hi>respect</hi> the Scriptures, but there is <hi>another

Scriptures, but <hi>Traditions</hi> contain more of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Truth; we <hi>respect</hi> the Scriptures, but

them; we <hi>respect</hi> the Scripture, but do not think
that it hath any <hi>character</hi> in it of its own Divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
for which we should believe it; we <hi>respect</hi> the
Scripture, but yet we would not believe, were it not

Scripture, but it is <hi>dark, obscure,</hi> not intelligible but
by the interpretation of our Church. Pray Sir, keep
your respects at home, they are <hi>despised</hi> by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
it self, which gives Testimony unto its own
<hi>Authority, Perfection, Sufficiency,</hi> to guide us to God,
<hi>Perspicuity</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> without any respect unto
your Church, or its Authority: And we know its
Testimony to be true. And for our parts we fear
that whilest these <hi>Joabs</hi> kisses of respect are upon
your lips, you have a sword in your right hands to
let out all the Vitals of Divine Truth and Religion.
Do you think your general expressions of <hi>respect,</hi>
and that <hi>unto admiration,</hi> are a covering long and
broad enough to hide all this contempt and reproach
that you continually poure upon the Scriptures?
Deal thus with your <hi>Ruler,</hi> and see whether he will
accept your Person. Give him some good words in
general, but let your particular expressions of your
esteem of him come short of what his state and <hi>regal</hi>
dignity do require, will it be well taken at your
hands? Expressions of the same nature with these
instanced in, might be collected out of your chiefest


<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50044:157"/>
Authors sufficient to fill a volume, and yet I never
read nor heard that any of them were ever <hi>stoned</hi> in
your Catholick Countreys, whatever you intimate of
the boyling up of your zeal into a rage <hi>against those
that should go about to diminish it.</hi> Indeed whatever you
pretend, this is your faith about the Scripture; and
therefore I desire that you would accept of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
why I cannot comply with your wish, and not
speak any more of <hi>Papists</hi> slighting the Scripture,
seeing I know they do so in the sense and way by me
expressed, and other wayes I never said they did so.</p>
               <p>From the account of your <hi>Faith,</hi> we may proceed
to your <hi>Charity</hi> wherewith you close this Discourse.
Speaking of your <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> you say, <hi>the
Scripture is theirs,</hi> and <hi>Jesus Christ is theirs, who will
one day plead their Cause.</hi> What do you mean Sir
by theirs? Do you intend it exclusively to all others;
so <hi>theirs</hi> as not to be the right and portion of any
other. It is evident that this is your <hi>sense,</hi> not only
because unless it be so, the words have neither <hi>sense</hi>
nor <hi>emphasis</hi> in them; but also because suitably unto
this sense, you elsewhere declare that the <hi>Roman</hi> and
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> are with you one and the same.
This is <hi>your Charity</hi> fit to accompany, and to be the
fruit of the faith before discoursed of. This is your
<hi>Chatholicism,</hi> the impaling of Christ, Scripture, the

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50044:158"/>
rule, as no way impeach its rationality. To vindicate
your discourse in your <hi>Fiat</hi> upon this <hi>subject</hi> you
make use of two <hi>mediums.</hi> (1.) You pretend <hi>that to
be the whole subject of your Discourse about Reason,</hi>
which is but a part of it: and (2.) You deny <hi>that</hi>
to <hi>be the Design and aime</hi> of your Book which your
self know, and all other men acknowledge so
to be.</p>
               <p>On the first head you tell me that your Discourse
concerned <hi>Reason to be excluded from the employment
of framing Articles of Religion.</hi> It is true, you talk
somewhat to that purpose; and you were told that
<hi>Protestants</hi> were no way concerned in that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
And it is no less true, that you dispute
against the <hi>use</hi> and exercise of Reason in our <hi>choise</hi>
of or adhering unto any Religion, or any way or
practice in Religion; that is the Liberty of a mans
<hi>rational judgement</hi> in determining what is right, and
what is wrong, what true, what false, in the things
that are proposed unto him, as belonging unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
guided, bounded, and determined by the <hi>only
Rule</hi> measure and last <hi>umpire</hi> in and about such things;
This you <hi>oppose</hi> and that directly; and that to this end,
to shew unto <hi>Protestants</hi> that they can come unto <hi>no
certainty</hi> in Religion by this exercise of their Reason,
in and about the things of God. That men should by
the use of Reason endeavour to <hi>find out</hi> and frame
a Religion, is fond to imagine. They who ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
any such thing, knew it was <hi>not Religion</hi> but
a pretence to some other end, that they were coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
To make the reason of a man proceeding and
acting upon it its own light and <hi>inbred Principles,</hi> the
absolute and Soveraign judge of the things that are
proposed to be believed or practised in Religion, so
as that it should be free for him to receive or reject


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50044:159"/>
them according as they answer and are suited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
is no less <hi>absurd</hi> and foolish; and who ever
will assert it must build his Assertion on this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that a man is capable of comprehending fully
and clearly, whatsoever God <hi>can reveal</hi> of himself;
which is contrary to the <hi>prime Dictates</hi> of Reason in
reference unto the simplicity and infiniteness of Gods
being, and so would imply a <hi>contradiction</hi> in its first
admission. It is no less untrue, that a man in the
<hi>lapsed depraved condition</hi> of nature, can by the light
thereof and the utmost improvement of his reason,
come to a <hi>saving, sanctifying</hi> perception of the
things themselves, that God hath revealed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself his will and worship, which is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<hi>effect</hi> of the spirit and grace of Christ. But
to say, that a man is not <hi>to use his reason</hi> in finding
out the sense and meaning of the <hi>propositions</hi> wherein
the Truths of Religion are represented unto him,
and in judging of their truth and falshood by the
<hi>Rule</hi> of them, which is the Scripture, is to deny that
<hi>indeed we are men,</hi> and to put a reproach upon our
mortality, by intimating, that men do not, cannot,
nor ought to do that which they not only <hi>know</hi>
they do, but also that they cannot <hi>but</hi> do. For they
do but vainly deceive themselves who <hi>suppose</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>dream</hi> that they make any determination of
what is <hi>true</hi> or false in Religion, without the <hi>use</hi> and
exercise of <hi>their Reason;</hi> it is to say they do it as
<hi>beasts,</hi> and not as men; then which nothing can be
spoken more to the dishonour of Religion, nor more
effectual to <hi>deter</hi> men from the entertainment of it.
For our parts, we rejoyce in this, that we dare avow
<hi>the Religion</hi> which we profess to <hi>be highly rational;</hi>
and that the most <hi>mysterious Articles</hi> of it are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto our belief on grounds of the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable


<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50044:159"/>
reason, and such as cannot be rejected
without a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the most Soveraign di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of that Intellectual nature wherewith of God
we are endued. And it is not a <hi>few trifling instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of some mens <hi>abuse</hi> of their Reason in its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
exercise about the things of God, that shall
make us ingrateful to God that he hath made us <hi>men,</hi>
or to neglect the laying out of the <hi>best</hi> that he hath
intrusted us with by nature, in his service in the
work of Grace. And what course do you your self
proceed in? When any thing is <hi>proposed</hi> unto you
concerning Religion, do you not <hi>think</hi> upon it?
doth not your mind exercise about it those <hi>first acts</hi>
of Reason or Understanding which prepare and
dispose you to <hi>discourse</hi> and <hi>compute</hi> it with your
self? do you not consider whither the thing it self
be <hi>good</hi> or evil? and whither the <hi>propositions</hi> wherein
it is made unto you are true or false? do you not call
to mind the <hi>Rule</hi> and measure whereby you are to
make a <hi>judgement,</hi> whither they be so or no? we talk
not now, <hi>what that Rule</hi> is, but only whither you do
not make a judgement of the Propositions that are
made unto you by some <hi>Rule</hi> or other, and whither
with that judgement, your mind do not assent unto
them or dissent from them? Yea is not <hi>your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
which you so make, the <hi>assent</hi> or <hi>dissent</hi> of your
mind? or what course do you take? I wish you
would inform us of your excellent expedient to teach
a man to cry <hi>Credo</hi> without the use or exercise of his
<hi>Reason</hi> to bring him thereunto. But when you have
done so, I know it is no other way but that by it
you may teach a <hi>Parrat</hi> or <hi>Starling</hi> to say as much,
or the <hi>Crow</hi> that cryed of old <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But
you would evade all concernment in this Discourse,
by denying that your <hi>Fiat Lux, was written unto any


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50044:160"/>
such concernment against Protestants.</hi> I know not
well what you mean by your, <hi>Vnto any such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against Protestants.</hi> That the main design of
your Discourse, is to bring <hi>Protestants</hi> unto an <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
in their profession by everting the Principles
which you apprehend them to build upon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to perswade them unto <hi>Popery,</hi> I was in hope you
would have no more denyed. It hath been eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto you with as needless a labour as ever any
man was put unto; but it is done because you would
needs have it so, and shall not now be done again.</p>
               <p>Your ensuing Discourse wherein you attempt to
say something unto the ninth <hi>Chapter of the Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions</hi>
is not unlike the preceding; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall cast them under one head. Your business
in it, is to cast a <hi>fresh dishonour</hi> upon Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by questioning the <hi>defensibility</hi> of its Principles
against <hi>Jewish Objections,</hi> any otherwise then by an
<hi>irrational Credo.</hi> Let us hear you speak in your own
language; <hi>Your vaunting florishes,</hi> You say, <hi>about
Scripture which you love to talk on, will not without
the help of your Credo and humble resignation solve
the Argument, which that you may the easilier be quit
of, you never examine, but only run on in your usual
florishes about the use and excellency of Gods Word. I
told you in</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>what the Jew will reply to all such
reasonings: but you have the pregnant wit not to heed
any thing that may hinder your florishes; but if you
were kept up in a Chamber with a learned Jew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bread, water and fire, till you had satisfied him in
that objection, I am still well enough assured, for all
your veryvaunts, that if you do not make use of your</hi>
Credo, <hi>which here you contemn, you might there stay till
hunger and cold have made an end of you.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Discourse is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> pretence


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:50044:160"/>
of rejecting Christ upon the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of their Church, was not, nor is to be satisfied by
<hi>Testimonies</hi> given in the Scripture unto the <hi>Person,
Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Messias.</hi> The sum of the
Objection said down in your <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> is that which
I have now mentioned; It was the Plea of <hi>the Jews</hi>
against Christ and his Doctrine, managed from the
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> of their Church; That
Christ and his Apostles gave the Answer unto this
objection, which I have now <hi>intimated,</hi> namely the
Testimony of God himself in the Scripture to the
Truth of that which they objected against, which
was to be preferred unto the Authority and Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their Church, I have undeniably proved
unto you in the <hi>Animadversions;</hi> and it is manifest
to every one that hath but read the <hi>New Testament</hi>
with any Consideration or understanding. The
same way was persisted in by the <hi>Antient Fathers,</hi> as
all their writings against the Jews do testifie. And I
must now tell you that your calling the <hi>validity of this</hi>
Answer into Question, is highly injurious unto the
<hi>honour of Christianity,</hi> and <hi>blasphemous</hi> against Christ
himself. The best interpretation that I can give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your words, is, that you are a person <hi>wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
of the Controversies that are between the <hi>Jews
and Christians,</hi> and the way that is to be taken for
their satisfaction or confutation. You tell us indeed
in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> that the Jews <hi>will reply</hi> to these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Scripture which are alledged as giving
witness to our Lord Jesus Christ and his Doctrine,
and contend about the <hi>interpretation</hi> of them; and
this you tell me, <hi>I have the wit to take no notice of;</hi>
which by the way is unduly averred by you, and
contrary to your own <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> seeing
you profess that you have read over my <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi>


                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:50044:161"/>
and probably the very place wherein I do take
notice of what you said to that purpose and replyed
unto it, was not far from your eye when you wrote
the contrary. And as I shewed you what was the <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
of the <hi>Antients</hi> of that reply of the <hi>Jews</hi> which
you mention, so I shall now add, that nothing but
<hi>gross ignorance</hi> in these things can give countenance
to an imagination that there is any thing but <hi>folly</hi>
and <hi>madness</hi> in the <hi>Rabbinical</hi> evasions of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the old Testament given unto our Lord
Christ and his Gospel. And your substitution of a
<hi>naked fananical Credo,</hi> not resolved into the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Holy Writ in the room of that <hi>express
Witness</hi> which is given in Holy Scripture unto the
<hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
therewith the <hi>Judaical Plea</hi> from their Church,
State, Power and Authority, is an Engine fit to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
the very root of Christianity, and to render
the whole Gospel highly Questionable. Besides it is
so absurd as to the Conviction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> such a
mere <hi>petitio principii</hi> or begging of what is in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
between Christians and them, that I challenge
you to produce any <hi>one learned man</hi> that hath made
use of it to that purpose. To think that your <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
built on principles which <hi>he despiseth,</hi> which you
cannot prove unto him, will convince another man
of the <hi>Truth of what you believe,</hi> can have no other
ground but a <hi>magical fancy,</hi> that the <hi>fixing</hi> of your
<hi>imagination</hi> shall affect his, and conform it unto your
apprehension of things. Such is your course in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Authority of your Church, and
your <hi>Credo</hi> thereupon, which cannot be supposed to
have any <hi>existence</hi> in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> unless it be first
supposed that their Church was failed, which <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal</hi>
that it was not, is the sole foundation of their


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50044:161"/>
objection. What end you can <hi>propose</hi> herein, but
to expose your self and your profession unto their
<hi>scorn</hi> and contempt, I know not. Sir, the Lord
Christ <hi>confirmed</hi> himself to be the Son of God, and
Saviour of the world by <hi>the Miracles</hi> which he
wrought; and the Doctrine which he taught was
<hi>testified</hi> to be Divine by signs and express words from
Heaven. He proved it also by the <hi>Testimonies</hi> out
of the Law and Prophets, all which was confirmed
by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the dead. This <hi>coming</hi> of
the <hi>promised Messiah,</hi> the work that he was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and the <hi>characteristical</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of him, in
application unto the person of <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
the Apostles and Evangelists proved out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to the conviction and conversion of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of the Jews, and the confusion of the rest.
And if you know not that the <hi>Antients Fathers</hi> and
learned men of succeeding Ages, have undenyably
proved against the <hi>Jews</hi> out the Scripture of the <hi>Old
Testament,</hi> and by the Testimony thereof, that the
<hi>promised Messiah</hi> was to be God and man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that he was to come at the time of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>our Lord Jesus Christ in the flesh,</hi> that <hi>the
work</hi> which he was to perform was the very same
and no other then what was wrought and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
by him, with all the other <hi>important concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of his Person and office, so that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left to countenance them in their obstinacy,
but meer <hi>senseless trifles,</hi> you are exceedingly unmeet
to make use of their objections, or the condition of
the controversie between them and Christians. For
what you add in reference unto my self, I shall need
only to mind you that the Question is not about any
<hi>Personal</hi> ability of mine to <hi>satisfie a Jew,</hi> which
whatever it be, when I have a mind to encrease it,


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50044:162"/>
for somewhat that I know of, and which I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of their writings, I will not come unto you
for assistance; but concerning the sufficiency of <hi>that
Principle</hi> for the confronting of <hi>Judaical objections,</hi>
taken from <hi>the Authority of their Church,</hi> which I
have formerly proved unto you, that our Lord Jesus
Christ and his Apostles made use of unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And I will not say that it was from the <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of your wit,</hi> that whatever heed you took unto
the stating of the Case between you and <hi>Protestants</hi>
in the <hi>Animadversions</hi> parallel unto that between the
<hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (seeing a very little wit will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to direct a man to let that alone which he finds
too heavy for him to remove out of his way) that you
speak not one word unto it, yet I will say, that it is a
thing of that kind whereof there are frequent instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in your whole Discourse, and for what reason, is
not very difficult for any man to conjecture.</p>

Principles again, which former Protestants had cast
down for Popish, as is the Authority of the visible
Church, efficacy of ordination, difference between Clergy

are Popish; But Sir, there are some Jews even at this

               <p>What acquaintance you have with the <hi>Jews,</hi> we

you may be pleased to take notice that men who know

those Opinions to be <hi>Popish,</hi> and should do so still,
were I accused for so doing before a <hi>Roman</hi> Judge as

them, yet they may be <hi>Christian.</hi> This is spoken as to
the <hi>Principles</hi> themselves, not unto your explanation
of them, which in sundry particulars is <hi>Popish,</hi> which
were never owned by Prelate Protestants. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<hi>You challenge me to prove that these Principles
were ever denyed by our Prelate Protestants, And this
you do wittily and like your self. You therefore bid me
prove that those principles were ever denyed by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Protestants, because I say that our Prelate Protestants
here in</hi> England, <hi>as soon as they became such, took up again
those forenamed Principles, which Protestants their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
both here in England and beyond Seas before our
Prelacy was set up had still rejected. When I say then
that our Prelate Protestants affirmed and asserted those
Principles which former Protestants denyed, you bid
me prove that ever our Prelate Protestants ever denyed
them.</hi> But whatever you can prove or cannot
prove, you have made it very easie for any man to
prove, that you have very little regard unto <hi>truth</hi>

your self from that which presseth you, and
which according to the rules of them you cannot
stand before. You tell us in the entrance of this
discourse, that you said, <hi>that Prelate Protestants for
their own preservation took up some of those Principles
again which former Protestants had cast down for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish.</hi>
And here expresly, that you <hi>said not that they took
up the Principles which themselves had cast down, but
only those which other before them had so dealt withall.</hi>
Now pray take a view of your own words, whereby


<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50044:163"/>
you express your self in this matter. Chap. 3. S.

charge the <hi>Prelate Protestant</hi> with building up what
<hi>others</hi> had pulled down, or what he had destroyed
<hi>himself?</hi> Is your Rule out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> applicable
unto him upon any other account, but that <hi>he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
was both the <hi>builder</hi> and <hi>destroyer?</hi> Sir, such
miscarriages as these <hi>Protestants</hi> know to be mortal
sins; and if without contrition for them you have
celebrated any Sacrament of your Church, it cannot
be avoided but that you have brought a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
on some of your Disciples. Besides sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you had spoken as you now <hi>faign</hi> your self to
have done, I desire to know who they are whom you
intend when you say <hi>our Prelate Protestants so soon
as they became such,</hi> as though they were <hi>first Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
at large and destroyed those Principles, which
afterwards they built up when they became <hi>Prelate
Protestants;</hi> seeing all men know that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was begun by <hi>Prelates</hi> themselves, and such
as never disclaimed the <hi>Principles</hi> by you instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in.</p>
               <p>But you tell me, <hi>I do not only reject what you object
against Prelate Protestants, but also what you alledge


<pb n="374" facs="tcp:50044:164"/>
in their behalf.</hi> I do so indeed; though I <hi>laugh</hi> not
at you or it, as you pretend; and so must any man
do, who pleading for <hi>Protestancy</hi> hath not a mind
<hi>openly</hi> to prevaricate. For your <hi>Plea</hi> for them is
such, as if admitted, would not only overthrow your
<hi>Prelacy</hi> which you pretend to assert, but also destroy
your <hi>Protestancy</hi> which you will not deny but that
you seek to oppose. Nay it is no other, but what
was contradicted in the very <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> by the
<hi>Spanish Prelates,</hi> as that which they conceived to
have been an engine contrived for the Ruine of
<hi>Episcopacy</hi> under a pretence of establishing it; and
which insteed of asserting them to be <hi>Bishops</hi> in the
Church, would have rendred them all <hi>Curates</hi> to the
Pope. You would have us believe that Christ hath
appointed <hi>one Episcopal Monarch</hi> in his Church
with plenitude of power to represent his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which is the <hi>Pope,</hi> and from him all other <hi>Bishops</hi>
to derive their power, being substituted <hi>by him,</hi> and
<hi>unto him</hi> unto their work. And must not this needs
be an <hi>acceptable defensative</hi> or Plea unto <hi>Prelate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
which if it be admitted, they can be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
supposed to be made <hi>Overseers of their flocks</hi> by
the Holy Ghost, but by the Pope, which forfeits their
<hi>Prelacy,</hi> and besides asserts his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
their <hi>Protestancy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this occasion, you proceed to <hi>touch</hi> upon
somewhat of great <hi>importance</hi> concerning the <hi>Head
of the Church,</hi> wherein you know a great part of
the difference between your self and those whom you
oppose to consist. In your passage you mention the
use of <hi>true Logick,</hi> but I fear we shall find that in
your Discourse <hi>laudatur &amp; alget.</hi> I should have
been glad to have found you making what use you
were able of that which you commend. It would I


<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50044:164"/>
suppose have directed you to have stated <hi>plainly</hi> and
clearly what is it that you assert, and what it is that
you <hi>oppose,</hi> and to have given your Arguments <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasceuastical</hi>
of the one, and <hi>Anasceuastical</hi> of the
other; but either you know not that way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure,
or you considered how little advantage unto
your end you were like to obtain thereby. And
therefore you make use only of that <hi>part of Logick</hi>
which teacheth the nature and kinds of <hi>Sophisms;</hi> in
particular, that of confounding things which ought
to be distinguished. However your Discourse, such
as it is, shall be examined, and that by the rules of that
<hi>Logick</hi> which your self commend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You say pag. 51.</hi> The Church says I must have a
Bishop, or otherwise she will not have such a visible
Head as she had at first. This that you may enervate,
you tell me, that the Church hath still the same Head
she had which is Christ, who is present with his Church
by his Spirit and his Laws, and is man God still as
much as ever he was; and ever the same will be; and
if I would have any other visible Bishop to be head,
then it seems I would not have the same head, and
so would have the same, and not the same.</p>
               <p>This is but <hi>one part</hi> of my answer, and that very
<hi>lamely</hi> and <hi>imperfectly</hi> reported. The <hi>Reader</hi> if he
please may see the whole of it, <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 223, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therewithall take a <hi>specimen</hi> of your ingenuity
in this Controversie. It were very sufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your following <hi>exceptions</hi> against it useless unto
your purpose, meerly to <hi>repeat</hi> what you seek to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but because you shall not have any pretence,
that any thing you have <hi>sayd</hi> is passed over <hi>undiscus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
I shall consider what you offer in way of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to so much of my answer as you are pleased your
self to express, and as may be supposed, thought


<pb n="376" facs="tcp:50044:165"/>
your self <hi>qualified</hi> to deal withal. Thus then you
proceed;</p>
               <p>I cannot in Reason be thought to speak otherwise,
if we would use true Logick, of the Identity of the
head, then I do of the Identity of the body of the
Church. This body is not numerically the same; for
the men of the first age are long ago gone out of the
world, and another generation come, who yet are a
body of Christians of the same kind, though not nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically
the same; So do I require that since Jesus
Christ as man, the head immediate of other believing
men, is departed hence to the glory of his father, that
the Church should still have an Head of the same
kind, as visibly now present, as she had in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
or else say I, she cannot be compleatly the same
body, or a body of the same kind visible as she was.
But this she hath not, this she is not, except she have
a visible Bishop as she had in the beginning present
with her guiding and ruling under God. Christ our
Lord is indeed still Man God, but his manhood is now
separate; nor is he visibly present as man, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
headed his believers under God, on whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
their nature depended. His Godhead is still
the same in all things not only in its self, but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Church also as it was before equally invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and in the like manner believed; but the nature
delegate under God, and once ruling visibly amongst
us by words nnd examples, is now utterly withdrawn.
And if a nature of the same kind be not now delegate
with a power of exterior Government, as at the first
then was, then hath not the Church the same head now,
which she had then: <hi>qui habet aures andiendi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How
you have secured your <hi>Logick</hi> in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
shall afterwards be considered; your <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>


                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:50044:165"/>
seems at the first view lyable unto just except<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.
For, 1. You suppose Christ in his <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture
only</hi> to have been the Head of his Church, and
therefore the absence of that, to necessitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of another. Now this supposition is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>false</hi> and dangerous to the whole being of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
It is the <hi>Son of God</hi> who is the Head of the
Church; who as he is man, so also is he <hi>over all God
blessed for ever:</hi> And as God and man in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
is that Head, and ever was since his <hi>incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and ever will be to the end of the world. To
deny this is to overthrow the <hi>foundation</hi> of the
Churches faith, preservation and consolation, it
being founded and built on this, that he <hi>was the Son
of the living God,</hi> Matth. 16. and yet into this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
alone, is your imaginary necessity of the
<hi>Substitution of another Head</hi> in his room resolved.
2. You plainly confess that the present Church hath
not the <hi>same head,</hi> that the Church had when our
Lord Christ conversed with them in the <hi>dayes of his
flesh.</hi> That, you say, was his <hi>humane nature delegate
under God,</hi> which being now removed and separate,
<hi>another Person so delegate under God,</hi> is substituted in
his place. Which not only deprives the Church of
its <hi>first</hi> Head, but also deposeth the <hi>humane nature
of Christ</hi> from that office of headship to his Church,
which you confess that for a while it <hi>enjoyed:</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him nothing but what belongs unto him as <hi>God,</hi>
wherein alone you will allow him to be that unto
his Church which formerly he was: Confessing I
say, the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ to have been the
head of the Church, and now denying it so to be,
you do what lyes in you to depose him from his
<hi>Office</hi> and Throne, allowing his humane nature as
far as I can perceieve to be of little other use then


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50044:166"/>
to be <hi>eaten</hi> by you in the <hi>Mass.</hi> 3. You make your
intention yet more evident, by intimating that the
<hi>Humane Nature of Christ</hi> is now no more Head of
the Church, then the present Church is made up of
the same numerical members, that it was constituted
of in the days of his flesh. What <hi>change</hi> you suppose in
the <hi>Church</hi> the body, the same you suppose and assert
in the <hi>head</hi> thereof. And as that change excludes those
<hi>former members</hi> from being present members: so
this <hi>excludes</hi> the former Head from being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Head. Of old the Head of the Church was
the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ delegate under God;
now that is <hi>removed,</hi> and another person in the same
nature is so delegated unto the same office. Now
this is not <hi>an Head</hi> under Christ, but in <hi>distinction</hi>
from him in the same place wherein he was, and so
exclusive of him, which must needs be <hi>Antichrist,</hi>
one pretending to be in his room and place to his
exclusion, that is, one set up against him. And thus
also what you seek to avoid doth inevitably <hi>follow</hi>
upon your discourse, namely that <hi>you would have the
Church for the preservation of its oneness and same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to have the same head she had, which is not the
same,</hi> unless you will say that the Pope is Christ:
these are the Principles that you proceed upon. First,
you tell us, that the <hi>humane nature of Christ delegate
under God was the visible Head of the Church;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That <hi>this nature is now removed from us and
ceaseth so to be,</hi> that is, not only to be visible, but
the visible Head of the Church, and is no more so,
then the present Church is made up of the same
individual members as it was in the dayes of his
flesh, which, as you well observe, it is not. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>a nature of the same kind in another Person</hi>
is now delegate under God to the same office of a


<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50044:166"/>
Visible Head, with that power of external Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which Christ had whilest he was that head.
And is it not plain from hence, that you exclude the
<hi>Lord Christ</hi> from being that head of his Church
which he was in former dayes? and <hi>substituting</hi>
another in his room and place, you at once depose
him, and assign another head unto the Church, and
that in your attempt to prove that her head must
still be the same, or she cannot be so. Farther, the
<hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ was personally united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Son of God: and if that Head which you
now <hi>fancy</hi> the Church to have, be not <hi>so united,</hi> it
is not the <hi>same Head</hi> that that was: and so whilest
you seek to establish not indeed a <hi>sameness</hi> in
the Head of the Church, but a <hi>likeness</hi> in several
Heads of it as to <hi>visibility,</hi> you evidently assert a
change in the nature of that Head of the Church
which we enquire after. In a word, Christ and
the Pope are not the <hi>same;</hi> and therefore if it be
necessary to maintain that the Church hath the <hi>same
Head</hi> that she had, to assert that in the room of
<hi>Christ</hi> she hath the <hi>Pope,</hi> you prove that she hath
the same <hi>head</hi> that she had, because she hath one
that is not the <hi>same</hi> she had: and so <hi>qui habet aures
audiat.</hi> 4. You vainly <hi>imagine</hi> the whole Catholick
Church any otherwise <hi>visible,</hi> then with the eyes of
faith and understanding. It was never so, no not
when <hi>Christ</hi> conversed with it in the earth; no not
if you should suppose only his <hi>blessed Mother,</hi> his
twelve Apostles, and some few more only to belong
unto it. For though all the members of it might
be <hi>seen,</hi> and that at once by the bodily eyes of men,
as might also the <hi>humane nature</hi> of him who was the
head of it, yet <hi>as</hi> he was Head of the Church, and
in that his whole <hi>Person</hi> wherein he was so, and is


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:50044:167"/>
so, he was never <hi>visible</hi> unto any, <hi>for no man hath
seen God at any time.</hi> And therefore you, substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an Head in his room who in his <hi>whole person</hi>
is visible, seeing he was not so, do change the
Head of the Church as to its <hi>visibility</hi> also, (for
one that is in his whole person <hi>visible,</hi> and another
that is not so, are not alike visible) wherein you
would principally place the <hi>identity</hi> of the Church.
5. Let us see whether <hi>your Logick</hi> be any better
then your Divinity. The best <hi>Argument</hi> that can
be formed out of your discourse, is this. <hi>If the
Church hath not an head visibly present with her, as
she had when Christ in his humane nature was on the
earth, she is not the same that she was; but according
to their Principles she hath not an head now so visibly
present with her; therefore she is not the same accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto them.</hi> I desire to know how you prove
your inference. It is built on this supposition, that
the <hi>sameness</hi> of the Church depends upon the <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of its Head, and not on the <hi>sameness</hi> of the
Head its self; which is a fond conceit, and contrary
to express Scripture, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and not
capable of the least countenance from Reason. It
may be you will say, that though your <hi>Argument</hi>
do not conclude that on our supposition the Church
is not the <hi>same</hi> absolutely as it was, yet it doth that
it is not the same as to <hi>visibility.</hi> Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
1. That there is no necessity that the Church
should be alwayes the <hi>same</hi> as to <hi>visibility,</hi> or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<hi>visible</hi> in the same manner, or alwayes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visible as to all concernments of it. 2. You mistake
the whole nature of the <hi>visibility</hi> of the Church,
supposing it to consist in its being seen with the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi>
eyes of men: whereas it is only an affection of
its <hi>publick profession</hi> of the Truth, whereunto its


<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50044:167"/>
being <hi>seen</hi> in part or in whole by the eyes of any, or
all men, doth no way belong. 3. That the Church,
as I said before, was indeed never absolutely <hi>visible</hi>
in its Head and members: He who was the <hi>Head</hi> of
it being never in his <hi>whole person visible</hi> unto the
the eyes of men, and he is yet as he was of old
<hi>visible</hi> to the eyes of faith, whereby we <hi>see</hi> him
that <hi>is invisible.</hi> So that to be <hi>visible</hi> to the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eyes of men in its head and members, was never
a property of the Church, much less such an one,
as that thereon its <hi>sameness</hi> in all Ages should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
6. You fail also in supposing that the <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
sameness</hi> of the Church as a body, depends
absolutely on the <hi>sameness</hi> of its members: For
whilest in succession it hath all things the <hi>same</hi> that
concur unto its Constitution, order, and existence, it
may be still the <hi>same body corporate,</hi> though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
not of the same <hi>individual persons</hi> or bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
As the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the same King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that it was two hundred years ago, though
there be not now <hi>one</hi> person living that then it was
made up of. For though the <hi>matter</hi> be the same
only <hi>specifically,</hi> yet the <hi>form</hi> being the same <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,</hi>
that denominates the body to be so. But
that I may the better represent unto you, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>genius</hi> and design of your Discourse, I shall
briefly mind you of the principles which you <hi>oppose</hi>
in it, and seek to evert by it, as also of those which
you intend to <hi>compass</hi> your purpose by. Of the
first sort are these; <hi>1. That the Lord Christ God and
Man in one person is, and ever continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to be the only
absolute Monarchical Head of his own Church.</hi> I
suppose it needless for me to confirm this Principle
by Testimonies of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which it being a matter
of <hi>pure Revelation</hi> is the only way of confirmation


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50044:168"/>
that it is capable of. That he is the <hi>Head of his
Church,</hi> is so frequently averred, that every one
who hath but read the New Testament will assent
unto it upon the bare repetition of the words, with
the same <hi>faith</hi> whereby he assents unto the writing
its self whatever it be: and we shall afterwards see
that the <hi>notion</hi> of an Head is absolutely exclusive of
<hi>competition</hi> in the matter denoted by it. An <hi>Head</hi>
properly is <hi>singly</hi> and absolutely so: and therefore
the substitution of <hi>another head</hi> unto the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rch in
the room of Christ, or with him, is perfectly <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>
of him from being so. 2. That <hi>Christ as God-man
in his whole person was never visible to the fleshly
eyes of men:</hi> and whereas, <hi>as such,</hi> he was Head
of the Church, as the Head of the Church,
he was never absolutely visible. His <hi>humane
nature</hi> was seen of old, which was but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of him; <hi>as</hi> he was, and is the Head of the
Church, otherwise then by faith, no man hath seen
him at any time: and it changeth the condition of
the Church, to suppose that now it hath a <hi>Head,</hi>
who being a meer man, is in his <hi>whole person visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
so far as a man may be seen. 3. That the <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of the Church consisteth in its <hi>publick profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of the Truth, and not in its being objected to
the bodily eyes of men. It is a thing that faith may
<hi>believe,</hi> it is a thing that <hi>Reason</hi> may take notice of,
consider and comprehend; the eyes of the body
being of no use in this matter. When a Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
the Truth, it is the <hi>ground and pillar</hi> of it, a
City on a hill; that is visible though no man see it,
yea though no man observe or contemplate on any
thing about it. Its own <hi>Profession,</hi> not other mens
observation constitutes it visible. Nor is there any
thing more required to a Churches <hi>visibility,</hi> but


<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50044:168"/>
its Profession of the Truth, unto which all the
outward advantages which it hath or may have of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<hi>conspicuously</hi> or gloriously to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of men, are purely accidental, which may be
separated from it without any prejudice unto its
visibility. 4. That the <hi>sameness</hi> of the Church in all
Ages doth not depend on its <hi>sameness</hi> in respect of
<hi>degrees</hi> of visibility. That the Church be the same
that it was, is required that it profess the same Truth
it did, whereby it becomes <hi>absolutely</hi> visible: but the
<hi>degrees</hi> of this visibility, as to conspicuousness and
<hi>notoriety,</hi> depending on things <hi>accidental</hi> unto the
being, and consequently visibility of Church, do no
way <hi>affect</hi> as unto any change. Now from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
1. That the <hi>presence</hi> or <hi>absence</hi> of the <hi>Humane
nature of Christ</hi> with, or from his Church on earth,
doth not belong unto the <hi>visibility</hi> of it; so that the
absence of it, doth no way inferr a necessity of
<hi>substituting</hi> another visible head in his stead. Nor
was the <hi>presence</hi> of his humane Nature with his
Church any way necessary to the <hi>visibility</hi> of it; his
conversation on the earth being wholly for other
ends and purposes. 2. That the <hi>presence</hi> or <hi>absence</hi>
of the humane nature of Christ, not varying his
headship, which under both considerations is still the
same, the supposition of <hi>another Head</hi> is perfectly
destructive of the whole Headship of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there
being no <hi>vacancy</hi> possible to be imagined for that
supply, but by the removal of Christ out of his
place. For he being the Head of his Church as God
and man, in his whole person invisible, and the visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church consisting solely in its own <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of the Truth, the absence of his humane nature
from the earth, neither changeth his own <hi>Headship,</hi>
nor prejudiceth the Churches <hi>visibility:</hi> so that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:50044:169"/>
the one or the other of them should induce a
necessity of the supply of another Head. Consider
now what it is that you oppose unto these things.

the inconvenience which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Disciples apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
would ensue thereupon, so that they should have
great cause to rejoyce at it, as that wherein their
great advantage would lye: <hi>John</hi> 16. 7. That this
should be by giving us a <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> in his stead,
he hath no way intimated. And unto those who
know what your <hi>Pope</hi> is, and what he hath done in
the world, you will hardly make it evident, that the
great <hi>advantage</hi> which the Lord Christ promised un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Disciples upon his <hi>absence,</hi> is made good unto
them by his Supervisorship. 3. You would have
the <hi>visibility of the Church depend on the visibility of
its Head, as also its sameness in all ages.</hi> And no
one, you are secure, who is now visible, pretends


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50044:169"/>
to be the Head of the Church, but the Pope alone,
and therefore of necessity he it must be. But Sir,
if the Lord Jesus Christ had had no other nature
then that wherein he was <hi>visible</hi> to the eyes of men,
he could never have been a <hi>meet Head</hi> for a Church
dispersed throughout the whole world, nor have
been able to discharge the Duty annexed by God
unto that office. And if so, I hope you will not
take it amiss, if on that supposition, I deem your
<hi>Pope,</hi> of whom millions of Christians know nothing
but by <hi>uncertain</hi> rumors, nor he of then, to be very
unmeet for the discharge of it. And for the <hi>visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of the Church, I have before declared wherein
it doth consist. Upon the whole matter, you do
not only come short of proving the <hi>Indentity</hi> and
<hi>Oneness</hi> of the Church to depend upon one visible
Bishop as its <hi>Monarchical</hi> Head, but also the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
whereby you attempt the confirmation of that
absurd position, are of that nature that they <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi>
the Headship of Christ, and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er no less
change or alteration in the Church, then that which
must needs ensue thereon, and the substitution of
another in his room, which destroyes the very <hi>essence</hi>
and being of it.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider what you further reply unto
that which was offered in the <hi>Animadversions</hi> unto
the purpose now discoursed of. Your ensuing words
are,</p>
               <p>And here by the way we may take notice what a fierce
English Protestant you are, who labour so stoutly to
evacuate my argument for Episcopacy, and leave none
of your own behind you, nor acquaint the world with
any, though you know far better, but would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
notwith tanding those far better reasons, for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
that Christ himself, as he is the immediate Head


<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50044:170"/>
of invisible influence, so is he likewise the only and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Head of visible direction and government
amongst us, without the interposition of any Person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
in his stead to oversee and rule under him in his
Church on earth, which is against the tenor both of sacred
Gospel and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, and all Antiquity, and
the present Ecclesiastical Polity of <hi>England,</hi> and is
the Doctrine not of any English Protestant, but of the
Presbyterian, Independent and Quaker.</p>
               <p>How little cause you have to attempt an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my <hi>Protestancy,</hi> I hope I have in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
evidenced unto you, and shall yet farther make
it manifest, as you give me occasion so to do. In the
mean time as I told you before, that I would not
plead the particular <hi>concernment</hi> of any party amongst
<hi>Protestants,</hi> no more then you do that of any party
among your selves, so I am sure enough that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
nothing <hi>prejudicial</hi> unto any of them, because
I have kept my self unto the defence of their <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy</hi>
wherein they all agree. Nor have I given you
an answer unto any Argument that tends in the least
to the <hi>confirmation</hi> of such a <hi>Prelacy</hi> as by any sort
of <hi>Protestants</hi> is admitted, but only shewed the
emptiness and pernicious Consequences of your <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism,</hi>
wherewith you plead in pretence for Prelacy,
indeed for a <hi>Papal Supremacy,</hi> and that on such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as are absolutely destructive of that <hi>Protestant
Prelacy</hi> which you would be thought to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
unto. And your ensuing Discourse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you labour to justifie your reflection on me, is a
<hi>pittiful piece</hi> of falsehood and Sophistry. For first,
this <hi>double Head</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> one of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
the other of direction and government,
which you fancy some Protestants to admit of, is a
thing that—they declare against as injurious to


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50044:170"/>
the Lord Christ, and that which would render the
Church <hi>biceps monstrum</hi> horrid and deformed. It
is Christ himself, who as by <hi>his Spirit</hi> he exercises the
office of an head by invisible influence, so by <hi>his
Word</hi> that of visible direction and rule; He is I say
the only Head of visible direction to his Church,
though he be not a <hi>visible Head</hi> to that purpose,
which that he should be, is to no purpose at all. 2. If
by the <hi>interposition of any person under Christ,</hi> dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
in his stead, you understand any one single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
delegated in his stead to oversee and rule the
<hi>whole Catholick Church,</hi> such an one as you now
plead for in your Epistle, it is intolerable arrogancy
to intimate that he is designed either in <hi>the Gospel</hi> or
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, or <hi>Antiquity;</hi> whereas you are
not able to assign any place, or text, or word in them,
directly or by fair Consequence to justifie what you
assert. And for the present <hi>Ecclesiastical policy</hi> of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if you yet know it not, let
me inform you, that the very <hi>foundations</hi> of it are
laid in a direct contrary supposition; namely that
there is no such <hi>single Person</hi> delegated under Christ
for the Rule of the whole Catholick Church; which
gives us a new evidence of your Conscientious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are
in what you say and write. 3. If you intend, (that
which is not at all to your purpose) <hi>Persons to rule
under Christ in the Church,</hi> presiding according to
his direction and institution, in and over the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Churches whereunto they do relate, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in his name, by his Authority, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Word, I desire you to inform me, wherein
I have said, or written, or intimated any thing that
may give you the least countenance in your affirming
that by me it is <hi>denied;</hi> or where it was ever <hi>denied</hi>
by any Protestant whatever, Prelatical, Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,


<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50044:171"/>
or Independent: neither doth this concession
of theirs in the least impeach the <hi>sole Soveraign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>
of Christ, and single Headship over his
Church to all ends and purposes. A <hi>Monarch</hi> may
be, and is the sole supream Governour and Political
Head of his Kingdom, though he appoint others to
execute his Laws by virtue of Authority derived
from him, in the several <hi>Provinces,</hi> Shires and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
of it. And Christ is the only head of his
Church, though he have appointed others to <hi>preside</hi>
and rule in his name, in those distributions of his
Disciples whereinto they are cast by his appoinment.
But you proceed, <hi>Christ in their way is immediat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
head not only of subministration and influence, but of
exterior derivation also and government to his Church.
Ans.</hi> He is so, the <hi>supream and only Head</hi> of the
Church Catholick in the one way and other, though
the <hi>means</hi> of conveying influences of Grace, and of
exterior Rule be various. <hi>Then</hi> say you, <hi>is he such
an Head to all Belivers or no?</hi> to all, the whole body
in general, and every individual member thereof in
particular? <hi>if he be so to all,</hi> you say, <hi>then no man
is to be governed in Affairs of Religion by any other
man:</hi> But why so I pray? can no man govern in any
sense or place but he must be a supream Head? The
<hi>King</hi> is immediate Head unto <hi>all</hi> his subjects, he is
<hi>King</hi> not only to the whole Kingdom, but to every
individual person in his Kingdom; doth it thence
follow that they may not <hi>be governed</hi> by officers sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
delegated under him to rule them by his
<hi>Authority</hi> according to his Laws? or that if they
may be so, that he is not the <hi>only immediate King</hi> and
supream Head unto them all? The Apostle tells us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
that the <hi>Head of every man is Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3.
And that an head of Rule, as the <hi>husband is the head


<pb n="389" facs="tcp:50044:171"/>
of the wife,</hi> Ephes. 5. 23. as well as he is an head of
<hi>influence</hi> unto the whole body, and every member of
it in particular, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. And it is
a senseless thing to imagine, that this should in the
least impeach his appointment of men <hi>to rule</hi> under
him in his Church according to his Law; who are
thereupon not <hi>heads,</hi> but in respect of him <hi>servants,</hi>
and in respect to the particular Churches wherein
they serve him, <hi>Rulers</hi> or guides, yea their <hi>servants</hi>
for his sake; not <hi>Lords</hi> over the flocks, but <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
of their faith. By these are the <hi>flocks</hi> of Christ
governed, as by <hi>shepherds</hi> appointed by him the great
<hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Shepherd</hi> of their souls, according to the
Rules by him prescribed for the rule of the one, and
obedience of the other. But if by <hi>governed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man,</hi> you mean <hi>absolutely, supreamly,</hi> at his will
and pleasure, then we deny that any <hi>Disciple</hi> of
Christ is in the things of God, <hi>so to be governed</hi> by
any man, and affirm that to assert it, is to cast down
Jesus Christ from his Throne. But you say, <hi>if he be
not immediate head unto all, but Ministers head the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Christ heads the Ministers, this in effect is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to make every Minister a Bishop. Why do
you not plainly say what it is more then manifest you
would have? All this while you heed no more the Laws
of the Land, then constitutions of the Gospel.
Answ.</hi> I have told you how Christ is the <hi>immediate
Head</hi> unto all, and yet how he hath appointed
others to preside in his Churches under him;
and that this should infer an <hi>equality</hi> in all that are
by him appointed to that work, is most senseless to
imagine, nor did I in the least intimate any such
thing, but only that therefore there was no need of
any <hi>one supream head</hi> of the whole Catholick Church,
nor any place or room left for such an one without


<pb n="390" facs="tcp:50044:172"/>
the <hi>deposition</hi> of Christ himself. Because the King
is the only <hi>supream Head</hi> of all his people, doth it
therefore follow that if he appoint <hi>Constables</hi> to rule
in every parish, with that allotment of power which
by his Laws he gives unto them, and <hi>Justices of Peace</hi>
to rule over them in an whole County, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
every <hi>Constable</hi> in effect is a Justice of Peace, or
that there is a <hi>sameness</hi> in their office? Christ is the
head of every man that is in the Church, be he Bishop,
or Minister, or private man: and when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are said to <hi>head the people,</hi> or the <hi>Bishops</hi> to head
them, the expression is improper; an inferiour <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial</hi>
subordinate rule being expressed by the
name of that which is supream and absolute: or they
<hi>head them</hi> not absolutely, but in some respect only,
as every one of them <hi>dischargeth</hi> the Authority over
and towards them wherewith he is intrusted. This
assertion of Christs sole absolute Headship, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of any <hi>Monarchical</hi> state in the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
but what ariseth from thence, doth not as every
child may see, concern the difference that is about
the superiority of <hi>Bishops</hi> to Ministers or <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
For notwithstanding this, there are <hi>degrees</hi> in the
Ministry of the Church, and several <hi>orders</hi> of men are
engaged therein, and whatever there are, there might
have been more, had it seemed to our good Lord
Christ to appoint them. And whatever <hi>order</hi> of men
may be supposed to be instituted by him in his
Church, he must be supposed to be the <hi>Head</hi>
of them all, and they are all to serve him in the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and Offices that they have to discharge towards
the Church and one another. This headship of
Christ is the thing that you are to <hi>oppose,</hi> and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusiveness
to the substitution of an absolute Head


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50044:172"/>
over the whole Catholick Church in his place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his bodily absence from the earth. But this
you cast out of sight, and instead thereof, fall upon
the <hi>equality</hi> of Bishops and Ministers, which no
way ensues thereon. Both Bishops and Presbyters
agreeing well enough in the Truth we assert and plead
for: <hi>This,</hi> you say, <hi>is contrary to the Gospel and the
Law of the Land.</hi> What is I pray? that <hi>Christ is the
only absolute Head of the Catholick Church?</hi> No;
but <hi>that Bishops and Ministers are in effect all one.</hi> But
what is that to your purpose? will it advantage your
Cause what way ever that <hi>problem</hi> be determined?
Was any occasion offered you to discourse upon that
Question? Nay you perceive well enough your self,
that this is nothing at all to your design, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in your following discourse you <hi>double</hi> and <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticate,</hi>
making it evident that either you <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not your self</hi> what you say, or that you would
not have <hi>others</hi> understand you, or that you <hi>confound</hi>
all things with a design to deceive: for when you
come to speak of the <hi>Gospel</hi> you attempt to prove the
appointment of <hi>one supream Pastor</hi> to the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and by <hi>the Law of the Land,</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
of Bishops over Ministers, as though these
things were the <hi>same,</hi> or had any relation one to
another: whereas we have shewed the <hi>former</hi> in
your sense to be destuctive to the latter. Truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put any man upon such <hi>subter fuges;</hi> and I hope
the difficulties that you find your self <hi>perplexed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
may direct you at length to find, that there is <hi>a
deceit in your right hand.</hi> But let us hear your own
words.</p>
               <p>As for the Gospel, the Lord who had been visible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Pastor of his flock on earth, when he was
now to depart hence, as all the Apostles expected one to


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:50044:173"/>
be chosen to succeed him in his care, so did he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his own invisible presence and providence over
his flock, publickly appoint one. And when he taught
them, that he who was greatest among them should be as
the least, he did not deny but suppose one greater; and
taught in one and the same breath, both that he was
over them, and for what he was over them, namely to
feed, not to tyrannize; not to domineer and hurt, but to
direct, comfort, and conduct his flock in all humility and
tenderness, as a servant of all their spiritual necessities;
and if a Bish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p be otherwise affected, it is the fault of
his Person not his place.</p>
               <p>And what is it that you would prove hereby? is
it that <hi>Bishops are above Ministers,</hi> which in the
words <hi>immediately</hi> foregoing you asserted, and in
those <hi>next</hi> ensuing confirm from the <hi>Law of the
Land?</hi> is there any tendency in your Discourse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any such purpose? Nay do not your <hi>self</hi> know
that what you seek to <hi>insinuate,</hi> namely the insti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>one supream Pastor</hi> of the whole Catholick
Church, <hi>one</hi> of the Apostles to be above and ruler
over all the rest of the Apostles, and the <hi>whole
Church</hi> besides, is perfectly destructive of the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
of Bishops in <hi>England</hi> as established by Law;
and also at once casting down the <hi>main</hi> if not <hi>only</hi>
foundation that they plead for their station and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For all <hi>Prelate Protestants</hi> as
you call them, assert an equality in <hi>all the Apostles,</hi>
and a <hi>superiority</hi> in them, to the 70. <hi>Disciples,</hi> whence
by a <hi>parity of reason,</hi> they conclude unto he <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of Bishops</hi> over <hi>Ministers</hi> to be continued in the
Church. And are you not a <hi>fair Advocate</hi> for your
Cause, and well meet for the reproving of others
for not consenting unto them? But waving that

in, let us see how you <hi>prove</hi> that which we know
you greatly desire to give some countenance unto;
that is, an <hi>universal visible Pastor</hi> over the whole
Catholick Church in the place and room of Christ

And how do you prove that the Apostles had any
<hi>such expectations</hi> as that which you mention? Our
Saviour gave them <hi>equal commission</hi> to teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
told them that as his father had <hi>sent him,</hi> so
he <hi>sent them;</hi> that he had chosen them <hi>twelve,</hi> but
that one of them was a <hi>Devil:</hi> never that one of
them should be <hi>Pope.</hi> Their Institution, Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Priviledges, Charge, Calling, were all equal.
How then should they come to have this <hi>expectation</hi>
that one of them should be chosen to <hi>succeed Christ</hi>
in his Care, when they were all chosen to <hi>serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
him in the <hi>continuance</hi> of his <hi>care</hi> towards his

upon their perswasion that <hi>one</hi> should be <hi>chosen</hi> in
particular to <hi>succeed the Lord Christ in his Care,</hi>
whereupon they fell into difference about the place,
But 1. Is it not somewhat strange unto your self,


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:50044:174"/>
how they should contest about <hi>a succession</hi> unto
Christ in his absence, who had not once thought that
he would ever be <hi>absent</hi> from them, nor could bear
the mention of it without great sorrow of heart
when afterwards he began to acquaint them with it?
2. How should they come in your apprehension to
<hi>quarrel</hi> about that which as you suppose and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
was <hi>somewhile before determined?</hi> For this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of yours, was somewhile after the promise of <hi>the
Keys to Peter,</hi> and the saying of Christ that he <hi>would
build his Church on the Rock.</hi> Were the Apostles think
you as <hi>stupid</hi> as Protestants, that they could not see
the <hi>Supremacy of Peter</hi> in those passages, but must
yet fall at variance who should be <hi>Pope?</hi> 3. How
doth it appear that this <hi>strife</hi> of theirs who should
be <hi>greatest,</hi> did not arise from their apprehension of
an <hi>earthly Kingdom,</hi> a hope whereof according to
the then current perswasion of the <hi>Judaical Church,</hi>
to be erected by their master whom they believed in
as the true Messiah, they were not delivered from,
until <hi>after his Resurrection,</hi> when they were filled
with the Spirit of the New Testament? <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
from that root sprang the ambitious desire of
the <hi>Sons of Zebedee,</hi> after preheminence in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and the designing of the rest of them in this
place from the manner of its management, <hi>by strife,</hi>
seems to have had no better a spring. 4. The <hi>stop</hi>
put by our Lord Jesus unto the <hi>strife</hi> that was
amongst them, makes it manifest that it arose from no
such <hi>expectation</hi> as you imagine; or that at least if it
did, yet your <hi>expectation</hi> was irregular, vain, and
groundless. For, 1. He tells them that there should
<hi>be no such greatness</hi> in his Church, as that which
they contended about, being like to the <hi>Soveraignty</hi>
exercised by, and in the Nations of the earth, from


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:50044:174"/>
which he that can shew a difference in your <hi>Papal</hi>
Rule, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> 2. He tells them, that
his Father had equally <hi>provided a Kingdom,</hi> that is
heavenly and eternal, for all them that believed,
which was the <hi>only greatness</hi> that they ought to look
or enquire after. 3. That as to their <hi>Priviledge</hi> in
his Kingdom, it should <hi>be equal</hi> unto them all, for
they <hi>should all fit on Thrones, judging the twelves
tribes of Israel;</hi> so ascribing equal power, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and dignity unto them all; which utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
the figment of the supremacy of any <hi>one</hi> of
them over the rest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 28.
And 4. Yet further to prevent any such conceit as
that which you suppose them to have had concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>prelation</hi> of any one of them, he tells them
that <hi>one</hi> was their <hi>Master,</hi> even Christ, and <hi>that all
they were brethren,</hi> Mat. 23. 8. so giving them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that he had designed them to be perfectly
&amp; every way <hi>equal</hi> among themselves. So ill have you
layed the foundation of your Plea, as that it guides
us to a <hi>full determination</hi> of the contrary to your
pretence, and that given by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself,
with many reasons perswading his Disciples of the
<hi>equity</hi> of it, and unto an acquiescency in it. And
what you add, that he <hi>presently appointed one to the
preheminence</hi> you imagine, is altogether <hi>inconsistent</hi>
with what you would conclude from the stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e about
it. For the appointment you <hi>fancy,</hi> preceded this
<hi>contention,</hi> and had it been real, and to any such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
would certainly have prevented it. Thus you
do neither prove from the <hi>Gospel</hi> what you <hi>pretend</hi>
unto, namely <hi>that Bishops are above Ministers,</hi> so
well do you plead your Cause, nor what you <hi>intend,</hi>
namely <hi>that the Pope is appointed over them all.</hi> Only
you wisely add a caution about what <hi>a Bishop</hi> ought


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:50044:175"/>
to be and do <hi>de jure,</hi> and what any one of them may

                  </gap>an to find the least difference between the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which our <hi>Saviour</hi> expresly <hi>condemns,</hi> and that
which your <hi>Pope</hi> doth <hi>exercise;</hi> Although I know
not whither you would think meet to have him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
of that <hi>Authority</hi> on the pretence whereof he
so <hi>domineers</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>Finding your self <hi>destitute</hi> of any countenance
from the <hi>Gospel,</hi> you proceed to the <hi>Laws of the
Land.</hi> To what purpose? to prove that Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>one amongst his Apostles to preside with pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Power over all the rest of them,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
over the whole Catholick Church, <hi>succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in his care?</hi> certainly you will find little
countenance in our Laws to this purpose. But let
us hear your own words again. <hi>As for the Laws of
the Land,</hi> say you, <hi>it is there most strongly decreed by the
consent and Authority of the whole Kingdom, not
only that Bishops are our Ministers, but that the Kings
Majesty is head of the Bishops also in the line of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
from whose hand they receive both their places
and jurisdiction. This was established not only by one,
but by several Parliament Acts, both in the reign of
King</hi> Edward, <hi>and Queen</hi> Elizabeth. What will
hence follow? that there is <hi>one universal Bishop</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to succeed Christ in his Care over the Church
Catholick, the thing you attempted to <hi>prove</hi> in the
words immediately foregoing? Do not the same
<hi>Laws</hi> which assert the order you mention, exclude
that which you would introduce? Or would you
prove that Bishops by the <hi>Law of this Land</hi> have a
jurisdiction superior unto Ministers? who ever went
about to deny it? or what will the remembrance of
it advance your pretension<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> And yet neither is this


<pb n="397" facs="tcp:50044:175"/>
                  <hi>fairly</hi> expressed by you. For as no Protestants as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
the <hi>King</hi> to be in his power and office interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
between Christ and Bishops or Ministers, as to
their <hi>ministerial office</hi> which is purely spiritual, so
the power of supream Jurisdiction which they
ascribe unto him, is not as you falsly insinuate, <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
unto him, by the <hi>Laws of King</hi> Edward <hi>and
Queen</hi> Elizabeth, but is an inseparable Priviledge of
his imperial Crown, exercised by his Royal Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
and asserted by them against the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and usurpations of the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> only <hi>diclared</hi>
by those and other Laws. But I perceive you have
another design in hand. You are entring upon a

with <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> but <hi>Prelate
Protestants</hi> also, in what you ascribe unto <hi>Kings in

and Metaphorically expressed: 2. So <hi>Sophistical</hi>
and inclusive; 3. So <hi>inconsistent</hi> in sundry instances

qualifications</hi> to be paralleld with any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in your <hi>Fiat</hi> or your <hi>Epistola.</hi> First, It is <hi>loose
and ambiguous:</hi> 1. Not stating what you intend by
the <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> which you discourse about:
2. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Popes Determinations on the penalty of
the <hi>forfeiture of his Christianity;</hi> which I doubt we
shall find to be your opinion; 3. Not <hi>declaring</hi>

                  </gap> the Concession of the Pope, whereon it should
solely depend, unto whom it is in all things to be

playing with the ambiguity of that expression <hi>Head

of the Church,</hi> and by the advantage thereof impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

not in the other: (whereas there is a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancy
between them in the sence wherein they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand

sence and opinion in the mean time under the same
ambiguity. (2.) In <hi>supposing</hi> an absolute univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Head of the whole Catholick Church, and then
giving reasons why <hi>no King</hi> can be that Head; when
you know that the whole Question is whither there
by <hi>any such head</hi> of the Catholick Church on earth
or no. (3.) In <hi>supposing</hi> the Principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> to have been the same

nature may be observed in it. Thirdly, <hi>Inconsistent</hi>
with the Principles and Practices of your own
Church, both 1. In what you <hi>ascribe</hi> unto Kings,
and 2. In your stating of the power and Jurisdiction
of your Pope, if the ambiguity of your words and
expressions will allow us to conclude what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

of fact, as to what you relate of the <hi>obedience</hi> of
your Church unto Kings. (2.) In the <hi>principles</hi> and

such <hi>reflections</hi> upon your Church and way, as may

you should enjoy all that peace and liberty

however the equity of it may at any time be
pleaded or urged to relieve others in other places,
under bondage and persecution. But I am sure,
if I judge your proceedings against other men <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi>
from you in Conscience, to be unjustifiable
by the Scripture or Light of Nature, or suffrage of
the Antient Church, as I do, I have no reason to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that they should be drawn into president against
their selves, in any place in the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

it may be are ready to seek their disturbance and
trouble from an apprehension of the evil that may
ensue upon them, and had not set them up in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
with the <hi>Principles of Protestants</hi> of all sorts,
and for the setting off your own with the better
grace and luster, untruly and individiously reported
theirs, to expose them unto those thoughts, and that
severity from supream powers which you seek your
selves to wave, I should have wholly passed by this
discourse, unto which no occasion was administred


<pb n="401" facs="tcp:50044:177"/>
in the <hi>Animadversions;</hi> but now as you have han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are more suited unto the establishment and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Kings of these Nations, then those of <hi>Protestants,</hi>
which in Truth I do not believe, I must of necessity
make a little further enquiry into your Discourse.
And I desire your pardon, if in my so doing, any
thing be spoken that suits not so well your interest
and designs, neither expecting nor desiring any, if
ought be delivered by me not according to Truth.</p>
               <p>To make our way the more clear, some of the <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
expressions</hi> which you make use of to cloud and
hide your intention in your enquiry after the <hi>Head
of the Church,</hi> must be explained.</p>
               <p>1. By the <hi>Church,</hi> you understand, not this, or
that particular Church, not the Church of this of
that Nation, Kingdom, or Countrey, but the <hi>whole
Catholick Church</hi> throughout the world. And when
you have explained your self to this purpose you
endeavour by <hi>six Arguments,</hi> (no less, <hi>p.</hi> 67, 68.)
to prove that <hi>no King</hi> ever was or can be Head of
it. He said well of old,
<q>In causa facili quemvis licet esse disertum.</q>
I wonder you contented your self to give us <hi>six
Reasons</hi> only, and that you proceeded not at least
unto the high hills <hi>of eighteenthly and nineteenthly,</hi>
that you talk of in your <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> where you scoff
at the <hi>preaching of Presbyterians;</hi> it may be you
will scarely ever obtain such another opportunity of
shewing the fertility of your invention. So did he
florish who thought himself secure from adversaries.

But you do like him, you only <hi>beat the ayre;</hi> Do you
think any man was ever so <hi>distempered</hi> as to dream
that any <hi>King</hi> whatever could be <hi>the absolute Head
of the whole Catholick Church of Christ?</hi> we no
more think <hi>any King</hi> in any sence to be the Head of
the Catholick Church, then we think the <hi>Pope</hi> so to
be. The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was at its hight and glory
when first Christianity set forth in the world, and
had extended its bounds beyond those of any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that arose <hi>before</hi> it, or that hath since <hi>succeeded</hi>
unto it. And yet within a very few years, after the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ, the Gospel had diffused it self
beyond the limits of that Empire, among the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
and <hi>Indians,</hi> and unto <hi>Britannorum Romanis
inaccessa loca,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls them. Now none
ever supposed that any <hi>King</hi> had power or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any sort in reference unto the Church, or any
<hi>members of it,</hi> without or beyond the precise limits
of his own <hi>Dominions.</hi> The Enquiry we have under

obedience due unto them in Ecclesiastical things, is

unto those of their subjects which are Christians in
them. And this

A little observation of this one known and granted
Principle, renders not only your <hi>six Reasons</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
useless, but surpersedes also a great part
of <hi>your Rhetorick,</hi> which under the ambiguity


<pb n="403" facs="tcp:50044:178"/>
of that expression you display in your whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
You pleasantly lead about your <hi>unwary
Reader</hi> with the ambiguity of the other term, <hi>the
Head.</hi> Hence p. 58. you fall into a great exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against Protestants, <hi>that acknowledging the King
to be the Head of the Church, they do not supplicate
unto him, and acquiesce in his judgement in Religious
affairs,</hi> as if ever any Protestant acknowledged <hi>any
King</hi> or any mortal man to be <hi>such an Head</hi> of the
Church as you fancy to your selves, in whose deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in Religion all men are bound <hi>spiritually</hi>
and as to their eternal concernments to acquiesce;
and that not because they are <hi>true</hi> according to the
Scripture, but because they are <hi>his.</hi> Such an <hi>Head</hi>
you make the <hi>Pope;</hi> such an one on earth all Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
deny, which evacuates your whole Discourse
to that purpose, <hi>p.</hi> 58, 59. It is true in opposition
unto your <hi>Papal claim</hi> of Authority and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over the subjects of this Kingdom, Protestants
do assert the King to be <hi>so Head</hi> of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own Realms and Dommions, as that he is by
Gods appointment the <hi>sole fountain</hi> and spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men of all Authority and Power to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
over the Persons of his subjects in matters of
external cognizance and order; being no way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the direction, supervisorship and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency
of any other, in particular not of the
Pope. He is not only the <hi>only striker</hi> as you phrase
it, in his Kingdoms, but the only <hi>Protector</hi> under
God of all his subjects, and the only <hi>Distributor</hi> of
Justice in rewards and punishments unto them, not
depending in the administration of the <hi>one</hi> or other
on the determinations or orders of your <hi>Pope</hi> or
Church. Not that any of them do use absolutely


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:50044:179"/>
that expression of <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> but that
they ascribe unto him, all <hi>Authority</hi> that ought or
can be exercised in his Dominions over any of his
Subjects whither in things <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi>
that are not <hi>meerly Spiritual,</hi> and to be <hi>ministerially</hi>
ordered in obedience unto Christ Jesus: And that
you may the better see what it is that <hi>Protestants</hi>
ascribe unto the King, and to every King that is
Absolutely supream, as his <hi>Majesty</hi> is, in his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and withall, how exceeding vain your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
reproach is, which you cast upon them
for not giving themselves up unto an absolute <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escency</hi>
in humane determinations as meerly such, on
pretence that they proceed from the Head of the
Church; I shall give you a brief account of their
thoughts in this whole matter.</p>
               <p>First, They say, that the <hi>King is the supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
over all Persons</hi> whatever, within his Realms
and Dominions, none being exempted on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
from subjection unto his Regal Authority.
How well you approve of this <hi>Proposition</hi> in the
great astignations you pretend unto <hi>Kingly power</hi>
we shall afterwards enquire. Protestants found
their perswasion in this matter, on the <hi>Authority</hi> of
the Scripture both Old Testament and New, and the
very Principles constituting Soveraign Power
amongst men. You speak fair to Kings, but at first
dash <hi>exempt</hi> a considerable number of their born sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
owing them <hi>indispensible</hi> natural Allegiance,
from their jurisdiction. Or this sort are the Clergy.
But the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> of old were not of your
mind. <hi>Solomon</hi> certainly thought <hi>Abiathar</hi> though
High Priest subject to his Royal Authority, when he
denounced against him a sentence of death, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
deposed him from the <hi>Priest hood.</hi> The like course


<pb n="405" facs="tcp:50044:179"/>
did his successors proceed in. For neither had God
in the first <hi>provision</hi> he made for a King amongst his
people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. nor in that <hi>prescription</hi> of the
manner of the Kingdom which he gave them by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
once intimated an exemption of any persons,
<hi>Priests</hi> or others from the Rule or Authority of the
Prince, which he would set over them. In the <hi>New
Testament</hi> we have the Rule, as the practice in the
Old, Rom. 13. <hi>Let every soul be subject to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Powers,</hi> the power that bears the sword, <hi>the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi>
And we think that your Clergy men have
souls (at least <hi>pro sale</hi>) and so come within the
circumference of this Command and Rule. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
in his Comment on that place is of our
mind, and prevents your pretence of an <hi>exception</hi>
from the Rule by <hi>special Priviledge,</hi> giving us
a distribution of the universality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
here intended into their several kinds.
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>He sheweth that these things are commanded unto all,
unto Priests and Monks, and not to secular persons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which he declareth in the very entrance of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
saying Let every soul be subject to the higher
Powers; whither thou be an Apostle, or an Evangelist,
or a Prophet, or whatever thou be. For subjection
overthrows not Piety. And he saith not simply, Let
him obey, but let him be subject.</hi> The very same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are given by <hi>Theodoret, Oecumenius,</hi> and
<hi>Theophilact. Bernard,</hi> Epist. 42. ad <hi>Archiepisc. Seno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens.</hi>
meets with your <hi>exception</hi> which in his dayes


<pb n="406" facs="tcp:50044:180"/>
began to be broached in the world, and tells you
expresly that it is a <hi>delusion.</hi> In conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Rule of St. <hi>Paul, Peter</hi> exhorts <hi>all Christians,</hi>
none excepted, to <hi>submit themselves unto the King as
Supreme,</hi> 1 Epist. ch. 2. 13. And what ever we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from these words in reference unto the <hi>King,</hi>
I fear that if instead of the <hi>King,</hi> he had said <hi>the
Pope,</hi> you would have thought us very <hi>impudent,</hi> if
we had persisted in the denyal of your <hi>monstrous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi>
Headship. But in this <hi>Principle,</hi> on these
and the like grounds do all Protestants concur. And
indeed to fancy a <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>veraign Monarch</hi> with so great
a number of men as <hi>yonr Clergy</hi> consists of in many
Kingdome exempted from his regal Authority, is to
lay such an ax unto the root of his Government, as
whereby with one stroke you may <hi>hew</hi> it down at
your pleasure.</p>
               <p>2. Protestants affirm, that <hi>Rex in regno suo,</hi> every
King in his own Kingdom is the <hi>Supreme dispenser of
Justice and Judgement unto all Persons, in all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
that belong unto, or are determinable <hi>in foro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriori</hi>
in any Court of Judicature, whither the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which they concern be <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical.</hi>
No Cause, no difference determinable by any Law of
man, and to be determined by <hi>Coercive Vmpirage</hi>
or Authority, is exempted from his cognizance.
Neither can any man, on any pretence, claim any
<hi>Jurisdiction</hi> over any of his Subjects not directly and
immediately derived from him. Neither can any
King, who is a <hi>Soveraign Monarch,</hi> like the Kings of
this Land, yield or grant a power in any other to
judge of any <hi>Ecclesiastical Causes</hi> among his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
as arising from any other <hi>Spring,</hi> or growing on
any other root but that of his own Authority,
without an impeachment and irreparable prejudice


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:50044:180"/>
to his Crown and Dignity: neither doth any such
<hi>Concession,</hi> grant or supposition make it indeed so
to be, but is a meer fiction and mistake, all that is
done upon it, being <hi>ipso facto</hi> null, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Neither if a <hi>King</hi> should make a <hi>pretended le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
grant of such power unto any, would any <hi>right</hi>
accrew unto them thereby; the making of such a
Grant being a matter <hi>absolutely</hi> out of his power,
as are all things whereby his regal Authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Majesty of his Kingdom is enwrapped, may be
<hi>diminished.</hi> For that King, who hath a power to
diminish <hi>his Kingly Authority,</hi> never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with <hi>absolute Kingly Power.</hi> Neither is this
Power granted unto our Kings by the <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
which you mention made in the beginning
of the Reformation; but was alwayes <hi>inherent</hi> in
them, and exercised in innumerable instances, and
often vindicated with an high hand from <hi>Papal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments,</hi>
even during the hour and power of
your darkness, as hath been sufficiently proved by
many, both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers.</hi> Things of <hi>meer
spiritual order</hi> as <hi>preaching the word, Administration</hi>
of the Sacraments and the like, we ascribe not unto
<hi>Kings,</hi> nor the communicating of power unto any
for their performance. The Soveraign Power of
these things, is <hi>vested</hi> in Christ alone, and by him
committed unto his <hi>Ministers.</hi> But Religion hath
many concernments that attend it, which must be
desposed of by <hi>forensical, juridical</hi> process and
and determinations. All these with the Persons
of them, that are interested in them, are subject
<hi>immediately</hi> to the power and Authority of the
King, and none other; and to exempt them, or any
of them, or any of the like nature, which may
<hi>emerge</hi> amongst men in things relating unto Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="408" facs="tcp:50044:181"/>
and Religion, whose <hi>Catalogue</hi> may be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
extended, from <hi>Royal Cognizance,</hi> is to make
meer properties of Kings in things which in a very
special manner concern the peace and wellfare of
their subjects, and the distribution of rewards and
punishments among them. Of this sort are all
things that concern the authoritative <hi>publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of Church Officers,</hi> and differences amongst
them about their interests, practices, and publick
profession of Doctrines, Collations of Legal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Benefices, by and with investitures <hi>legal</hi>
and valid, all <hi>Ecclesiastical revenews</hi> with their inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies,
the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Persons</hi> for the reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ement of the outward man
by Censures and Sentences of Law, with the like.
And as this whole matter is sufficiently confirmed by
what was spoken before of the Power of Kings over
the Persons or all their Subjects, and (for to what
end should they have such a power, if in respect of
many of them, and that in the chief concernments
of their rule and Government, it may never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted?)
so I should tire your patience, if I should
report one half of the <hi>Laws,</hi> Instances and <hi>Pleas,</hi>
made, given and used, by the <hi>Antient</hi> Christian
Kings and Emperours in the persuit, and for the
Confirmation of this their just power. The Decrees
and Edicts of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, commanding,
ruling and disposing of <hi>Bishops</hi> in Cases Ecclesiastical,
the Laws of <hi>Justinian, Charls</hi> the Great, <hi>Ludovicus</hi>
his Son, and <hi>Lotharius</hi> his Successor, with more innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
to the same purpose are extant and known
unto all. So also are the <hi>Pleas, Protestations</hi> and
Vindications of most of the Kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
once the pretensions of Papacy began to be
broached to their prejudice. And in particular,


<pb n="409" facs="tcp:50044:181"/>
notable instances you might have, of the exercise of
this <hi>royal power</hi> in the first Christian Magistrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with supreme Authority, both in the case of
<hi>Athanasius, Socrat. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 34.
<hi>Athan. Apol.</hi> 2. as also of the <hi>Donatists, Euseb. lib.</hi>
10. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>August. Epist.</hi> 162, 166. and <hi>advers.
Crescon. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 17. whereunto innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in his Successors may be added.</p>
               <p>3. Protestants reach unanimously, that it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent</hi>
on Kings to find out, receive, embrace and
promote the Truth of the Gospel, and the Worship
of God appointed therein, confirming, protecting
and defending of it, by their <hi>Regal Power</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
as also that in their so doing, they are to
use the Liberty of their <hi>own judgements</hi> informed by
the wayes that God hath appointed for that end, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently
on the dictates, determinations and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of any other Person or Persons in the world,
unto whose <hi>Authority</hi> they should be obnoxious.
<hi>Heathen Kings</hi> made Laws for God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 6.
<hi>Jona</hi> 3. And the great thing that we find any of the
<hi>Good Kings of Judah</hi> commended for is, that they
<hi>commanded the worship of God to be observed</hi> and
performed, according unto his own appointment.
For this end were they then <hi>bound to write out a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of the Law with their own hands, Deut.</hi> 14. 18.
and to study in it continually. To this purpose were
they warned, charged, exhorted and excited by the
Prophets; that is, that they should <hi>serve God as Kings.</hi>
And to this purpose are there <hi>innumerable Laws</hi> of
the best Christian Kings and Emperours still extant
in the world.</p>
               <p>In these things consists that <hi>Supremacy or Headship
of Kings</hi> which Protestants <hi>unanimously</hi> ascribe unto
them; especially those in <hi>England,</hi> to his Royal


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:50044:182"/>
Majesty. And from hence you may see the frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousness
of sundry things you object unto them.</p>
               <p>As first of the <hi>Scheme</hi> or Series of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Power</hi> which you ascribe to <hi>Prelate Protestants,</hi> and
the Laws of the Land, from which you say, the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> dissent, which you thus express;
<q>By the Laws of
our Land, our
Series of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
Eccle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>siastical
stands
thus,
<list>
                        <item>God,</item>
                        <item>Christ,</item>
                        <item>King,</item>
                        <item>Bishop,</item>
                        <item>Ministers,
People.</item>
                     </list>
The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
is
thus,
<list>
                        <item>God,</item>
                        <item>Christ,</item>
                        <item>Minister,</item>
                        <item>People</item>
                     </list>
                  </q>
So that the Ministers head in the Presbyterian Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament
toucheth Christs feet immediately and nothing
intervenes. You Pretend indeed that hereby you do
exalt Christ; but this is a meer cheat as all men may
see with their eyes. For Christ is but where he was,
but the Minister indeed is exalted, being now set in
the Kings place one degree higher then the Bishops, who
by Law is under King and Bishops too.</p>
               <p>If I mistake not in my guess, you greatly pleased
your self with your <hi>Scheme,</hi> wherein you pretend
to make forsooth an <hi>ocular Demonstration</hi> of what
you undertook to prove; whereas indeed it is as
<hi>trivial</hi> a fancy as a man can ordinarily meet withal
For 1. Neither the <hi>Law,</hi> nor <hi>Prelates,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
ascribe any place at all unto the <hi>Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
in the Series of <hi>Spiritual Order;</hi> he is neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
nor Minister, nor Deacon, or any way autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
by Christ to convey or communicate power
<hi>meerly spiritual</hi> unto any others. No such thing is
<hi>claimed</hi> by our Kings, or <hi>declared</hi> in Law, or <hi>asserted</hi>
by Protestants of any sort. But in the <hi>series</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour


<pb n="411" facs="tcp:50044:182"/>
Government, both <hi>Prelate Protestants</hi> and
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> assign a Supremacy over all Persons in
his Dominions, and that in all Causes that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable
and determinable by, or in any Court ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
Jurisdiction and Authority, unto his
Majesty. All sorts assign unto him the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
place under Christ in <hi>external Government</hi>
and Jurisdiction. None assign him any place
in Spiritual Order and meerly Spiritual Power.
Secondly, If you place Bishops on the <hi>Series</hi> of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Government as appointed by the King and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Law of the Land, there is yet <hi>no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
with respect unto them. 3. The Question
then is solely about the Series of <hi>Spiritual order,</hi> and
thereabout it is confessed there are various appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of Protestants, which is all you prove, and
so do, <hi>magno conatu nugas agere:</hi> who knows it
not? I wish there were any need to prove it: But
Sir, this difference about the Superiority of <hi>Bishops</hi>
to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or their <hi>equality,</hi> or <hi>Identity,</hi> was agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
in the Church many and many a hundred year
before you or I were born, and will be so probably
when we are both dead and forgotten. So that
what it makes in this dispute, is very hard for a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
man to conjecture. 4. Who they are that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <hi>exalt Christ,</hi> by a meer <hi>asserting Ministers,</hi>
not to be by his institution subject to Bishops, which
you call a <hi>cheat,</hi> I know not, nor shall be their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate;
they exalt Christ who love him and keep
his Commandments, and no other.</p>
               <p>2. You may also as easily discern the <hi>frivolous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of your exclamation against <hi>Protestants</hi> for not
giving up their differences in Religion to the <hi>Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirage</hi>
of Kings upon the assignment of that <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi>
unto them which hath been declared. When


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:50044:183"/>
we make the <hi>King</hi> such an Head of the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> as you make the <hi>Pope,</hi> we shall seek unto
him as the fountain of our faith, as you pretend to
do unto the Pope. For the present we give <hi>that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
to none but Christ himself; and for what we
assign in profession unto the King, we answer it
wholly in our practical submission. Protestants ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>thought,</hi> nor <hi>said</hi> that any King was appointed
by Christ to be supreme <hi>infallible Proposer</hi> of all
things to be believed and done in the Worship of
God; no King ever assumed that power unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
It is Jesus Christ alone who is the <hi>Supreme and
absolute Lawgiver</hi> of his Church, the Author and
finisher of our Faith; and it is the honour of Kings
to serve him in the promotion of his Interest, by
the exercise of that Authority and duty which we
have before declared. What unto the dethroning
and dishonour as much as in you lyeth of Christ
himself, and of <hi>Kings</hi> also, you assign unto the
<hi>Pope,</hi> in making him the <hi>Supreme head</hi> and <hi>fountain
of their faith,</hi> hath been already considered. This
is the substance of what you except against <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
either as to Opinion or Practice in this matter
of <hi>deference</hi> unto Kingly Authority in things Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.
What is the sense of your Church which
you prefer unto your <hi>sentiments</hi> herein, I shall after
I have a little examined your present pretensions
manifest unto you, (<hi>seeing you will have it so,</hi>)
from those who are full well able to inform us
of it;

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:50044:183"/>
in this matter so <hi>loosely, generally</hi> and <hi>ambiguously,</hi>
that it is very hard for any man to collect from
your words, what it is that you assert, or what you
deny. I shall endeavour to draw out your sense
by a few en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quiries. As 1. Do you think the <hi>King</hi>
hath <hi>any An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ority</hi> vested in him <hi>as King</hi> in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
affairs, and over Ecclesiastical Persons? You
tell us, <hi>That Catholicks observe the King in all things
as well Eeclesiastick as Civil,</hi> pag. 59. that in the
line of <hi>Corporal power and Authority the King is
immediately under God,</hi> p. 61. with other words to
the same purpose, if they are to any purpose at all.
I desire to know whither you grant in him an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
derived immediately from God in and over
<hi>Ecclesiastical affairs,</hi> as to convene <hi>Synods</hi> or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
to reform things amiss in the Church, as to
the outward administration of them? or do you
think that he hath such power and Authority to
<hi>make, constitute</hi> or appoint Laws with penal Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in and about things Ecclesiastical? And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Do you think that in the work which he
hath to do for the Church, be it what it will, be may
use the <hi>liberty of his own judgement</hi> directed by the
light of the Scripture, or that he is <hi>precisely</hi> to
follow the declarations and determinations of the
Pope? If he have not this <hi>Authority,</hi> if he may not use
<hi>this liberty,</hi> the good words you <hi>speak</hi> of <hi>Catholicks,</hi>
and <hi>give</hi> unto <hi>him,</hi> signifie indeed nothing at all. If
then he hath, and may, you openly rise up against
the <hi>Bulls, Briefs</hi> and <hi>Interdicts</hi> of your Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and the universal practice of your Church for
many Ages. And therefore I desire you to inform me
Thirdly, Whether you do not judge him <hi>absolutely</hi>
to be <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>accountable</hi> to the Pope for what
ever he doth in <hi>Ecclesiastical affairs</hi> in his own
Kingdoms and Dominions? if you answer suitably


<pb n="414" facs="tcp:50044:184"/>
to the <hi>Principles, Maximes</hi> and practise of your
Church, you must say he is; and if so, I must tell
you that whatever you ascribe unto him in things
<hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> he acts not about them <hi>as King,</hi> but
in some other capacity. For to do a thing as <hi>a King,</hi>
and to be accountable for what he doth therein to
the <hi>Pope,</hi> implyes a Contradiction. Fourthly, Hath
not the <hi>Pope</hi> a power over his Subjects, many of
them at least, to convent, censure judge and punish
them, and to exempt them in <hi>Criminal Cases</hi> from
his Jurisdiction? And is not this a <hi>fair Supremacy</hi>
that it is meet he should be contented withal, when
you put it into the power of another to exempt
as many of his Subjects as <hi>he pleaseth and are willing,</hi>
from his Regal Authority? 5. When you say, <hi>that
in matters of faith, Kings for their own ease remit
their Subjects to their Papal Pastor, pag.</hi> 57. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you do not collude with us, or indeed do at all
think as you speak? Do you think that Kings have
<hi>real power</hi> in, and about those things wherein you
depend on the Pope, and only <hi>remit</hi> their Subjects to
him for their own ease? You cannot but know that
this one Concession would ruine the whole <hi>Papacy,</hi>
as being expresly destructive of all the <hi>foundations</hi>
on which it is built. Nor did ever any <hi>Pope</hi> proceed
on this ground in his interposures in the world
about matters of faith; that such things indeed
belonged unto others, and were only by them <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>

And if so, whether you do not at once overthrow

of their Christianity, and whether you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not among them, their very <hi>Regal Dignity</hi> it

<hi>Protestant Kings and Potentates</hi> are beholding unto
you, seeing it is manifest that they live and rule in a

7. Whether you do not very fondly pretend
to prove your <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> acknowledgement
of the power of Princes to make <hi>Laws in Cases Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi>
from the Laws of <hi>Justinian, p.</hi> 59. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they are instances of <hi>Regal Power</hi> in such Cases
plainly destructive of your present <hi>Hildebrandine</hi>

Laws to have any force or Authority of Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Papal Sanction</hi> and confirmation? 8. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you think indeed that <hi>Confession unto Priests</hi> is
such an effectual means of <hi>securing the peace</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Kings as you pretend, <hi>p.</hi> 59. and whether
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James, Henry</hi> the third and
fourth of <hi>France</hi> had cause to believe it; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you learned this notion from <hi>Parry, Raviliac,
Mariana, Clement, Parsons, Allen, Garnet, Gerard,
Oldcome,</hi> with their Associates? 9. Whether you
forgot not your self when you place <hi>Aaron and Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah
in government together? p.</hi> 64. 10. Whether
you really believe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath Power only to
<hi>perswade in matters of Religion</hi> as you pretend? <hi>p.</hi> 65.
and if so; from what <hi>Topicks</hi> he takes the <hi>Whips,
Wires</hi> and <hi>Racks</hi> that he makes use of in his <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
And whether he hath not a right even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<hi>Kings themselves,</hi> who will not be his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners

come out of the <hi>clouds,</hi> and speak your mind freely
and plainly to some of these enquiries. Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:50044:185"/>
unto your interest, gives no satisfaction, whilest
these <hi>snakes</hi> lye in the grass of it. Wherefore leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you a little to your <hi>second thoughts,</hi> I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of your Masters and Fathers themselves, what
is the <hi>true sense</hi> of your Church in this matter, and
we shall find them speaking it out plainly and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
For they tell us,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>the Government of the whole Catholick
Church is Monarchical:</hi> A State wherein all Power,
is derived from one fountain, one and the same
Person. This is the first Principle that is laid down
by all your Writers, in treating of the Church and
its power; and that which your great <hi>Cardinal Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>
layes as the foundation on whirh he builds the
huge Structure of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Annals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>That the Pope is this Monarch of the Church:</hi>
the Person in whom alone the Soveraign Rule of it is
originally vested: so that it is absolutely impossible
that any other Person should have, enjoy, or use
any <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority,</hi> but what is derived
from him. I believe you suppose this sufficiently
proved by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or others. Your self own it,
nor can deny it without a disclaimure of your <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Papacy.</hi> And this <hi>one Principle</hi> perfectly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the vanity of your pretended attributions of
Power in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> things to Kings and Princes.
For to suppose a <hi>Monarchical</hi> estate, and not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
all Power and Authority in that state to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ived
from the <hi>Monarch</hi> in it and of it alone, is to
suppose a <hi>perfect contraiction,</hi> or a State Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
that is not Monarchical. Protestants place the
<hi>Monarchical</hi> State of the Catholick Church in its
relation unto <hi>Christ</hi> alone: and therefore it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on them to assert that no man hath, or can
have a power in the Church as such, but what is


<pb n="417" facs="tcp:50044:185"/>
derived from and communicated unto him by him.
And you placing it in reference unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> must
of necessity deny that any power can be exercised in
it, but what is derived from him, so that whatever
you pretend in this kind to grant unto kings, you
allow it unto them only by <hi>concession</hi> or delegation
from the Pope. They must hold it from him in <hi>cheif,</hi>
or he cannot be the <hi>chief</hi> only, and absolute head
and Monarch of the Catholick Church which you
would perswade us to believe that he is: Kings then
may even in Church affairs be <hi>strikers</hi> under him; be
the servants and executioners of his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
but <hi>Authority</hi> from God immediately in and
about them they have <hi>none,</hi> nor can have any whilest
your <hi>Imaginary</hi> Monarchy takes place. This one
<hi>fundamental Principle</hi> of your Religion sufficiently
discovers the insignificancy of your <hi>florish</hi> about
Kingly Authority in Ecclesiastical things, seeing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a supposition of it, they can have none at all.
But you stay not here; for</p>
               <p>3. <hi>You ascribe unto your Popes an universal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
even in Civil things over all Christian Kings
and their subjects.</hi> In the explanation of this Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I confess you somewhat <hi>vary</hi> among your
selves; but the thing it self is generally asserted by
you, and made a foundation of practice. Some of
you maintain that the <hi>Pope by Divine right and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
hath an absolute supream Dominion over the
whole world.</hi> This opinion, <hi>Bellarmine Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de
Pont. cap.</hi> 1. confesseth to be maintained by <hi>Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Triumphus, Alvarus, Pelagius, Hostiensis,</hi> and
<hi>Panoruitanus.</hi> And himself in the next words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
the <hi>opinion</hi> of them who deny the Pope to
have any such <hi>temporal power,</hi> as that he may <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
secular Princes,</hi> and deprive them of the


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:50044:186"/>
Kingdoms and Principalities, not only <hi>as false</hi> but
as down right <hi>Heresie.</hi> And why doth he name the
first <hi>opinion</hi> as that of <hi>four or five Doctors,</hi> when it is
the Common opinion of your Church, as <hi>Baronius</hi>
sufficiently manifests in the life of <hi>Gregory the seventh?</hi>
That great preserver of your <hi>Pontificial omnipotency</hi> in
his <hi>Bull</hi> against <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>German Emperour,</hi> affirms
that he hath power <hi>to take away Empires, Kingdoms
and Principalities, or what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver a mortal man may
have, as Platina</hi> records it in his life. As also <hi>Pope
Nicholas</hi> the second in his Epistle <hi>ad Mediolanens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
asserts, that the rights both of the <hi>heavenly and
earthly Empires</hi> are committed unto him. And he
that hath but looked on the <hi>Dictates</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Gregory</hi> confirmed in a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
defended by <hi>Baronius,</hi> or into their <hi>Decretals,</hi> knows
that you give <hi>both swords</hi> to the Pope, and that over
and over. Whence <hi>Carerius, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. affirms
that it is the <hi>Common opinion</hi> of the School Divines
that the Pope hath <hi>plenissimam Potestatem,</hi> plenary
power over the whole world, both in <hi>Ecclesiastical
and Temporal</hi> matters; and you know the <hi>old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi>
made by the <hi>Canonists cap. de Major.</hi> &amp; <hi>Obed.</hi>
between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Emperour,</hi> namely that <hi>he
is as the Sun,</hi> the <hi>Emperour as the Moon,</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
all its light from the other. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and
those few whom he follows, or that follow him,
maintain that the Pope <hi>hath this Power only indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and in order unto spiritual things;</hi> the meaning of
which assertion as he explains himself, is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that <hi>direct power,</hi> which he hath over those
Countreys and Kingdoms which on one pretence or
other he claims to be <hi>Feaudatory</hi> to the Roman See,
which are no small number of the chiefest Kingdoms
of <hi>Europe,</hi> he hath a Power over them all, to <hi>dispose</hi>


                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:50044:186"/>
of them, their <hi>Kings</hi> and Rulers, according as he
judgeth it to conduce to the <hi>good</hi> and interest of the
Church: which as it really differs very little from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormer opinion, so <hi>Barclay</hi> tells us that <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi>
was very little pleased with that seeming depression
of the Papal Power, which his words intimate. But
the stated Doctrine of your Church in this matter is
so declared by <hi>Bozius, Augustinus Triumphus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius,
Schioppius, Marta</hi> and others, all approved
by her Authority, that there can be no question of
it. Moreover to make way for the putting of this
<hi>indirect</hi> Power into <hi>direct</hi> Execution, you declare,</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That the Pope is the supream Judge of faith,
and his Declarations and Determinations so far the
Rule of it, as that they are to be received, and finally
submitted unto:</hi> not to do so, is that which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> or <hi>Apostacy.</hi> About this
Principle also of your Profession there have been, as
about most other things amongst you, great Disputes
and wranglings between the Doctors and props of
your Church. Much debate there hath been whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>this power</hi> be to be attributed unto the <hi>Pope
without</hi> a Council, or <hi>above</hi> a Council, or <hi>against</hi>
one. About these <hi>Chimaera's</hi> are whole volumes
filled with <hi>keen</hi> and subtil argumentations. But the
<hi>Popes Personal,</hi> or at least <hi>Cathedral</hi> Determination
hath at length prevailed. For whatever some few
of you may <hi>whisper</hi> unto your own <hi>trouble</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage,
to the impeachment of his <hi>Personal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
you are easily decryed by the general
voice of your Doctors; and besides those very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
themselves, wherever they would place the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of the Church that they fancy, are for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
to put it so far into the <hi>Popes</hi> hand and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that whatever <hi>he determines</hi> with the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary


<pb n="420" facs="tcp:50044:187"/>
solemnities in matters of faith, is ultimately at
least to be acquiesced in. So your <hi>self assure</hi> us,
averring that he who doth not so, <hi>forfeits his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
and consequently all the Priviledges which
thereby he enjoyes; and we have reason sufficient
from former experience to believe that the <hi>Pope</hi>
have he ability unto his will, is ready enough to
take the forfeiture. Whither upon a Princes falling
into <hi>Heresie,</hi> in not acquiescing in your <hi>Papal deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi>
his subjects are discharged <hi>ipso facto</hi> from
all obedience unto him, as <hi>Dominicus Bannes</hi> and
others maintain, or whither there needs the <hi>Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi>
of a sentence against him by the <hi>Pope</hi> for
their absolution, you are not agreed. But yet</p>
               <p>5. <hi>You affirm that in Case of such Disobedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Pope, he is armed with Power to depose Kings
and Princes, and to give away, and bestow their
Kingdoms and Dominions on others;</hi> Innumerable are
the instances whereby the Popes themselves have
justified their <hi>claim</hi> of this Power in the face of the
world, and it were endless to recount the <hi>Emperours,
Kings,</hi> and free Princes that they have attempted to
ruine and destroy, (in the persuit of some wherof
they actually succeeded) with the desolations of
Nations that have ensued thereon. I shall menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but one and that given us in the dayes of <hi>our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
and it may be in the memory of some yet
alive. <hi>Pope Pius</hi> V takes upon him contrary to the
advice and entreaties of the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi>
and others, to depose <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
her to destruction. To this end he <hi>absolved all
her Subjects</hi> from their Allegiance, and gave away
her <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and Dominions to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
assisting him to his utmost in his attempt to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his grant: and all for refusing obedience


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:50044:187"/>
to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> You cannot I presume be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with my mention of that which is known
unto all, for these things <hi>were not done in a corner.</hi>
And is it not hence evident that all the power which
you grant unto Kings, is meerly <hi>precarious,</hi> which
they hold of your Pope as <hi>Tenants</hi> at will? and
should they not appear to do so, were his force,
wit and courage answerable to his will and pretence
of Authority? But be it that because you cannot
help it, you <hi>suffer</hi> them to live at peace and quietness
in the main of their <hi>Rule,</hi> yet you still <hi>curb</hi> them in
their own Dominions; for</p>
               <p>6. <hi>You exempt all the Clergy from under their Rule
and Power.</hi> See your <hi>Bellarmine sweating</hi> to prove
that they are not bound to <hi>their Laws,</hi> so as to be
<hi>judged</hi> by them, without their leave, if they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress;
or to <hi>pay</hi> any tribute, <hi>De Cleric. Lib.</hi> 1.
<hi>Cap.</hi> 28. They are all reserved to the Power and
Jurisdiction of the Pope. And he that shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into what a vast and <hi>boundless multitude</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the several disorderly orders of your <hi>City
Monks</hi> and Friars, your Clergy is swelled into in
most places of <hi>Europe,</hi> will easily perceive what your
interest is in every Kingdom of it. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
there is scarce a <hi>Considerable Nation</hi> wherein
the Profession of your Religion is enthroned, in
which the Pope hath not an 100000. able fighting
men, that are his peculiar subjects, exempted from
the Power and jurisdiction of Kings themselves;
which you must needs conceive to be a blessed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of that of the Apostle, <hi>Let every soul be
subject to the higher Powers.</hi> And</p>
               <p>7. You extend the <hi>Papal Power to Things as well
as Persons</hi> in the Dominions of all Kings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths.
For the <hi>Lands</hi> and Possessions that


<pb n="422" facs="tcp:50044:188"/>
are given unto any of the Popes especial <hi>Subjects,</hi>
you will have to be exempted from Tributes and
publick burdens of the state. And you farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that it is not in the power of <hi>any Kings or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
to hinder such alienations of Lands and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from their Dominions. By this means no small
part of the <hi>Territories</hi> of many Princes is subduced
from under their power. The dreadful consequences
of which <hi>Principles</hi> so startled the <hi>wise state of Venice,</hi>
that you know they disputed it to the utmost with
your <hi>Vice-god Paul</hi> the V. In dealing with them, as I
remember, their attempt was successless: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the defence made of the <hi>Papal process</hi>
against them by <hi>Baronius, Bellarmine</hi> and others,
yet the actings of that <hi>sober state</hi> in forbidding such
alienation of <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Fees</hi> from their Rule and
power without their consent, with their plea for the
subjection of <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi> unto them in their own
Dominions, was so vindicated by Doctor <hi>Paul Suave,
Marsilius of Padua,</hi> and others, that the <hi>horns</hi> of
the <hi>Bull</hi> which had been thrust forth against them
into so great a length, were pulled in again.</p>
               <p>I told you in the entrance of this Discourse, how
unwilling I should have been to have given you the
least <hi>disquietment</hi> in your way, had you only <hi>attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted</hi>
to set off your own respects unto <hi>Royal Power</hi>

hath made these few instances expressive of the

<hi>your Case</hi> to the same purpose, and almost in the

so that it is altogether needless to divert again to the

               <p>Your next attempt <hi>p.</hi> 72. is upon my <hi>story of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress

thought it was fit you should say so, though you
knew no reason <hi>why,</hi> nor could fix on any thing in it
for your warrant in these intemperate reproaches.
Do I say any thing but what the <hi>stories</hi> of all Ages,

Is it now a <hi>defamation</hi> to report what the <hi>learned</hi>

bewayled, and the sad effects whereof the world
long groaned under, and was at length ruined by?

People that it was composed of, and declare the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

of life, violence and oppression, whereby they

be, why do you exclaim against it? Do I not direct
you unto <hi>Authors</hi> of unquestionable credit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the things which I report from them?
And if you know not that <hi>many others</hi> may be added
unto these by me named, testifying the same things,
you know very little of the matter you undertake
to treat about. But we need go no further then
<hi>your self</hi> to discover how <hi>devoid</hi> of all pretence your

                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:50044:189"/>

you before, that I intend the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> and
that as confirmed and established by <hi>Law</hi> in this
Kingdom; and the advantage you endeavour from
<hi>some differences</hi> that are amongst us, is little to your
purposes, and less to the commendation of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.
For besides that there are <hi>differences</hi> of as
high a nature, and considering the Principles you
proceed upon of <hi>greater importance</hi> among your
selves, and those agitated with as great <hi>animosities</hi>
and subtilties, as those amongst any sort of men at
variance about Religion in the world, you that so
earnestly seek and press after <hi>a forbearance</hi> for your
profession besides and against the established law,
should not, me thinks, at the same time, be so <hi>forward</hi>
in reproaching us, that there are dissenters in the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> from some things established by Law, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering how <hi>utterly inconsiderable</hi> for the
most part they are, in comparison of the things
wherein you differ from us all. This I fear, is the
<hi>reward</hi> that they have cause to expect from many of
you, who are enclined to <hi>desire</hi> that you amongst
others might be partakers of <hi>indulgence</hi> from the


<pb n="426" facs="tcp:50044:190"/>
extremity of the Law, though from others of you
for whose sakes they are enclined unto those desires,
I hope they may look for better things, and such as
accompany charity, moderation, and peace, so that
your first <hi>exception</hi> gives a greater impeachment unto
your <hi>own Candor</hi> and ingenuity then unto the <hi>Truth
or Sobriety</hi> of my story.</p>
               <p>You proceed and say, that <hi>I tell you that the story
of</hi> Fugatius <hi>and</hi> Damianus <hi>Missioners of Pope</hi> Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,
<hi>is suspected by me for many reasons,</hi> and reply,
<hi>because you assign none, I am therefore moved to think
they may be all reduced unto one, which is that you will
not acknowledge any good thing ever to have come from</hi>
Rome. But see what it is for a man to give himself
up unto vain surmizes. You know full well, that I
plead, that you are no <hi>way concerned</hi> in what was
done at <hi>Rome</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who was
neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Papist,</hi> nor knew any thing of that
which we reject as <hi>Popery,</hi> so that I had no reason to
disclaim or deny any good thing that was then done
at <hi>Rome,</hi> or by any from thence. Besides, I can
assure you, that <hi>to this day</hi> I would willingly own,
embrace, and rejoyce in any <hi>good</hi> that is, or may be
done there; may I be truly and <hi>impartially</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it; and should be glad to hear of more then
unprejudiced men have been able of late Ages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us of. I am far from making an <hi>enclosure</hi> of all
goodness unto any <hi>party</hi> of men in the world, and
far from judging or condemning all, of any party,
or supposing that no <hi>good thing</hi> can be done by them
or proceed from them. Such conceits are apt to
<hi>flow</hi> from the high towring thoughts of <hi>Infallibility</hi>
and <hi>supremacy,</hi> and the confining of Christianity to
some certain company of men, in some parts of the
world, which I am a stranger unto, I know no


<pb n="427" facs="tcp:50044:190"/>
                  <hi>party</hi> among Christians that is in all things to be
<hi>admired,</hi> nor any that is in all things to be <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
and can perfectly free you, if you are capable
of satisfaction, from all fears of my dislike of any
thing, because it came, or comes from <hi>Rome.</hi> For
to me it is all one, from whence <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi>
come. They shall be welcome for their own sakes.
But you seem to be guided in these and the like <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes</hi>
by your own <hi>humour,</hi> Principles and way of
managing things in Religion; a <hi>Lesbian Rule,</hi> which
will suffer you to depart from the Paths of Truth
and Charity, no oftener then you have a mind so
to do. To deliver you from your <hi>mistake</hi> in this
<hi>particular,</hi> I shall now give you <hi>some</hi> of those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
which beget in me a suspicion concerning the
Truth of that <hi>story</hi> about <hi>Fagatius and Damianus,</hi>
as it is commonly told, only intimating the heads
of them with all possible brevity.</p>
               <p>First then I suppose the <hi>whole story</hi> is built on the
Authority of the Epistle of <hi>Elutherius</hi> unto <hi>Lucius,</hi>
which is yet extant: other foundations of it, that
I know of, is neither pleaded nor pretended. Now
there want not <hi>Reasons</hi> to prove that <hi>Epistle</hi> as the
most of those fathered on the <hi>old Bishops of Rome,</hi>
to be supposititious. For 1. The Author of that
Epistle condemneth the <hi>Imperial Laws,</hi> and rejecteth
them as unmeet to be used in the <hi>Civil Government</hi>
of this Nation, which <hi>Eleutherius</hi> neither ought to
have done, nor could safely do. 2. It supposeth
<hi>Lucius</hi> to have sent unto <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to have the
<hi>Roman Law</hi> sent unto him, which had been long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exercised in this Nation, and was well known
in the <hi>whole Province,</hi> as he witnesseth of dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these;
<q>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:50044:191"/>
Gallia causidicos docuit facunda Brittannos.</q>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>first Reporters</hi> of this Story agree not in
the <hi>time</hi> wherein the matter mentioned in it, should
fall out. <hi>Beda lib. 1. cap.</hi> 4. assigns it unto the
year 156. which was twenty two years before <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>
was Bishop, as <hi>Baronius</hi> manifests. <hi>Henricus
de Erfordia</hi> ascribes it unto the nineteenth year of
the reign of <hi>Verus</hi> the Emperour who reigned not
so many years at all. <hi>Ado</hi> refers it unto the time of
<hi>Commodus</hi> with some part of whose reign the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> did indeed contemporate.
2. <hi>Geoffrey of Monmouth</hi> the chief promoter of this
report, joyneth it with so many <hi>lyes</hi> and open <hi>ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as may well draw the Truth of the whole story
into Question. So that divers would have us believe
that some such thing was done at one time or
other, but <hi>when</hi> they cannot tell. 3. Both the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of Eleutherius,</hi> and the reporters of it, do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that <hi>Lucius</hi> to whom he wrote, was an <hi>Absolute
Monarch in England,</hi> King over the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with Supreme Authority and Power, ruling
his Subjects by the <hi>Advice of his Nobles,</hi> without
being obnoxious unto or dependent in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on any others. But this Supposition is so
<hi>openly repugnant</hi> to the whole story of the State of
things in the <hi>Province of England</hi> in those dayes, so
that it is beyond the wit of man to make any recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
between them: For besides that <hi>Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Tacitus</hi> do both plainly affirm, that in the dayes of
the <hi>Romans</hi>

become a <hi>Presidiary Province</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi>
and had been so from the dayes of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,
Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Dio</hi> inform us. Especially was it
reduced into, and settled in that form by <hi>Pub.
Ostorius</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Nero,</hi> upon the Conquest of
<hi>Boadicia Queen of the Iceni,</hi> and fully subjected in
its remainders unto the Roman Yoak and Laws, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some struglings for liberty, by <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> in
the dayes of <hi>Vespatian,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> assures us in the
life of his Father in Law. In this Estate <hi>Brittan</hi>
continued under <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
being afterwards secured by <hi>Hadrian</hi> from the
incursion of the <hi>Picts</hi> and other barbarous Nations,
with the defence of his <hi>famous walls,</hi> whereof <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi>
gives us an account. In this condition did
the whole <hi>Province</hi> continue unto the death of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi>
under the rule of <hi>Vlpius Marcellus</hi> as we are
informed by <hi>Dio</hi> and <hi>Lampridius.</hi> This was the state
of affairs in <hi>Britain,</hi> when the Epistle of <hi>Eleutherius</hi>
is supposed to be written. And for my part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discover where this <hi>Lucius</hi> should reign with all
that Soveraignty ascribed unto him. <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks
he might do so beyond the <hi>Picts</hi> wall, which utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overthrows the wholy story, and leaves the
<hi>whole Province of Brittan,</hi> utterly unconcerned in
the coming of <hi>Fugatius and Damianus</hi> into this
Island. These are some, and many other reasons
of my suspition I could add, manifesting it to be far
<hi>more just</hi> then yours that I had no reason for it, but
only <hi>because I would not acknowledge that any good
could come from Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now see what you further <hi>except</hi> against
the account I gave of the <hi>progress</hi> and <hi>declension</hi> of
Religion in these, and other Nations. You add,
<hi>then say you, succeeded times of Luxury, Sloth, Pride,


<pb n="430" facs="tcp:50044:192"/>
ambition, scandalous riots, and corruption both of
faith and manners over all the Christian world, both
Princes, Priests, Prelates and people.</hi> But you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pervert my words, so to make them <hi>lyable</hi>
unto your exception: for as by me they are layed
down, it seems you could find no occasion against
them. I tell you p. 253. <hi>that after these things a sad
decay in faith and holiness of life befell professors, not
only in this Nation, but for the most part all the
world over; the stories of those dayes are full of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then the Oppression, Luxury, Sloth of
Rulers, the pride, ambition and unseemly scandalous
contests for preheminence of Sees, and extent of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
among Bishops, the sensuality and ignorance of
the most of men.</hi> Now whether these words are not
agreeable to Truth and Sobriety, I leave to every
man to judge, who hath any tolerable <hi>acquaintance</hi>
with <hi>History,</hi> or the occurrences of the Ages respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in them. Your reply unto them is, <hi>not a grain
of virtue or Goodness we must think in so many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Kingdoms and Ages:</hi> But why must you think
so? who induceth you thereunto? when the <hi>Church
of Israel</hi> was professedly far more corrupted, then
I have intimated the state of the Christian Church
in any part of the world to have been, yet there
was more then <hi>a grain of virtue or goodness,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Elijah,</hi> but in the meanest of <hi>those seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>
who within the <hi>small precincts of that Kingdom</hi>
had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal:</hi> I never in the
least questioned, but that in that <hi>declension of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
which I intimated, and remission of the most
from their pristine Zeal, but that there were <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi>
and <hi>ten thousands</hi> that kept their integrity
and mourned for all the <hi>Abominations</hi> that they saw
practiced in the world. Pray reflect a little upon


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:50044:192"/>
the condition of the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches mentioned in
the Revelation. The discovery made of their <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
State</hi> by Christ himself <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 3. was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
less then <hi>forty years</hi> after their first planting, and
yet you see most of them had <hi>left their first love,</hi> and
were <hi>decayed in their faith and Zeal.</hi> In one of
them there were <hi>but a few names remaining</hi> that had
any life and integrity for Christ; the body of the
Church having only <hi>a name to live,</hi> being truly and
really dead, as to any acts of Spiritual life, wherein
our Communion with God consists. And do you
make it so strange, that whereas the Churches that
were <hi>planted</hi> and watered by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves
and enriched with many excellent Gifts and Graces,
should within the space of less then <hi>forty years,</hi> by
the Testimony of the Lord Christ himself, so <hi>decay</hi>
and fall off from their first purity, faith and works,
that other Churches who had not their advantages,
should do so within the space of <hi>four hundred years,</hi>
of which season I speak? I fear your vain conceit
of <hi>being rich and wanting nothing,</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi>
and impossibility to stand in need of any Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of being as good as ever any Church was, or
as you need to be, is that which hath more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
your Church in particular then you can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
imagine. And what I affirmed of those other
Churches, I know well enough how to prove out
of the <hi>best</hi> and most approved Authors of those
dayes. If besides <hi>Historians</hi> which give sufficient
Testimony unto my observation, you will please to
consult, <hi>Chrysostome Hom.</hi> 3. <hi>de Incomprehens. Dei
natur. Hom.</hi> 19. <hi>in Ac.</hi> 9. <hi>Hom.</hi> 15. <hi>in Heb.</hi> 8. and
<hi>Augùstin. lib. de Fid. &amp; bon. op. cap.</hi> 19. you will
find that I had good ground for what I said. And
what if I had minded you of the words of <hi>Salvian


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:50044:193"/>

giving you <hi>a story false and defamatory, loaden with
foul language against all Nations, ages and conditions,
that none can like who bear any respect either to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
Religion or Truth: ne saevi magne Sacerdos.</hi>
What ground have you for this intemperate railing?
What instance can you give of any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
What expression giving countenance unto this
severity? If you will exercise your self in writing
<hi>Fiats,</hi> you must of necessity arm your self with a
<hi>little patience</hi> to hear sometimes things that do not
please you, and not presently cry out, <hi>defamations,
false, wrath, foul language, &amp;c.</hi> I suppose you
know that not long after the times wherein I say
Religion as the <hi>power</hi> and purity of it much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
in the world, that God brought an <hi>overflowing
scourge</hi> and deluge of Judgements upon most of the
Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> that made Profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
What in sadness do you think might be the
<hi>cause</hi> of that dispensation of his Providence? Do
you think that all things were well enough amongst
them, and that in all things their wayes pleased
God? is such an apprehension suitable to the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Mercy, Love and faithfulness of God? or must
he lose the glory of all his properties in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of his righteous Judgements, rather then
you will acknowledge a <hi>demerit</hi> in them whom he
took away as with a Flood? So indeed the <hi>Jews</hi>
would have had it of old under their sufferings; but
he pleaded and vindicated the <hi>equality</hi> and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his wayes against their proud repinings.


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:50044:193"/>
Pray be as angry with me as you please, but take
heed of <hi>justifying</hi> any against God: The task will
prove too hard for you. And yet to this purpose
are your following contemptuous expressions; For
unto my <hi>observation,</hi> that after these times, the
<hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> with others, overflowed the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world, you subjoyn, <hi>either to punish them we
may believe, or to teach them how to mend their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
Sir, I know not what you believe, or do not
believe, or whither you <hi>believe any thing of this kind
or no.</hi> But I will tell you what I am perswaded all
the world believes, who know the <hi>story</hi> of those
times, and are not <hi>Atheists:</hi> and it is, that though
the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Saxons, Huns, Francks</hi> and
<hi>Longobards,</hi> with the rest of the barbarous Nations,
who divided the <hi>Provinces of the Western Empire</hi>
amongst them, had it may be no more thoughts to
<hi>punish the Nations professing Christianity,</hi> for their
sins, wickedness and superstition, (though one of
their Chief Leaders proclaimed himself the <hi>Scourge
of God</hi> against them) then had the <hi>King of Babylon</hi>
to punish <hi>Judah</hi> for her sins, and Idolatry in especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
yet that <hi>God ordered them,</hi> no less then he did <hi>him</hi>
in his Providence for those ends which you so <hi>scorn</hi>
and despise, that is, either to <hi>punish them</hi> for their
sins, or to provoke them to leave them by <hi>repentance.</hi>
Take heed of being a <hi>scoffer</hi> in these things, least your
bands be made strong. God is not unrighteous who
<hi>exerciseth judgement.</hi> The Judge of all the world
will do right. Nor doth he afflict any people, much
less extirpate them from the face of the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Cause. Many wicked, provoking, <hi>sinful Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Nations,</hi> he spareth in his patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
and will yet do so; but he destroyes <hi>none</hi>
without a Cause. And all that I intended by the


<pb n="434" facs="tcp:50044:194"/>
remembrance of the <hi>sins</hi> of those Nations, which
were exposed unto devastation, was but to shew that
their <hi>destruction was of themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You leap unto another clause which you rend out
of mydiscourse, that <hi>these Pagans took at last unto
Christianity,</hi> and say, <hi>happily because it was a more
loose and wicked life then their own Pagan Profession.</hi> But are you not ashamed of this <hi>trifling?</hi> doth this
disprove my Assertion? Is it not true? Did they not
do so? Did not the above mentioned Nations when
they had settled themselves in the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the
Empire, take upon them the Profession of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Religion? Did not the <hi>Saxons</hi> do so in <hi>Britta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
the <hi>Francks</hi> in <hi>Gaule,</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> the <hi>Huns</hi> in <hi>Banno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia?</hi>
I cannot believe you are so ignorant in these
things, as your exceptions bespeak you. Nor do I
well understand what you intend by them, they are
so <hi>frivolous</hi> and useless, nor surely can any man in his
right wits suppose them of any validity to impeach
the evidence of the known stories, which my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
relates unto.</p>
               <p>But you lay more weight on what you cull out in
the next place, which as you have layed it down is,
<hi>That these now Christened Pagans advanced the Popes
authority, when Christian Religion Was now grown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi>
and say, <hi>now we come to know how the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Bishop became a Patriarch above the rest, by
means namely of the new converted Pagans.</hi> But I
wonder you speak so <hi>nicely</hi> in their chief affair. As
though that were the Question whether the <hi>Bishop
of Rome</hi> according unto some Ecclesiastical constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were made a <hi>Patriarch</hi> or no, and that whither
he were not esteemed to have some <hi>kind of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
in respect of those other Bishops, who upon


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:50044:194"/>
the same account were so stiled. When we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of this <hi>Question</hi> we shall not be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to declare our thoughts in it. For the present
you represent the Pope unto us as the <hi>absolute Head
of the Church Catholick,</hi> the supream Judge of all
controversies in Religion, the <hi>sole fountain</hi> of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and spring of all Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, &amp;c.
Nor did I say that your Pope was by these <hi>Nations</hi>
after their conversion <hi>advanced unto the height you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
now to fix him in, but only that his Authority
was <hi>signally advanced</hi> by them, which is so certain a
Truth that your own <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Annalists</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proclaim it, and you cannot deny it unless you
would be esteemed the most <hi>ungrateful</hi> Person in the
world. But this is your way and manner; all that
is done for you is <hi>meer duty,</hi> which when it is done
you will thank no man for. Are all the Grants of
Power, Priviledges and Possessions made unto your
<hi>Papal See,</hi> by the <hi>Kings</hi> of this Nation both <hi>before</hi>
and <hi>since</hi> the Conquest, by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and
Emperours of the Posterity of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> by
the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Poland, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the
<hi>Longobards</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> not worth your thanks? It is
well you have got your ends; the <hi>net</hi> may be cast
away when the <hi>fish</hi> is caught.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But an odd chance, you say, it was that they should
think of advancing him to what they never heard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
himself or any other advanced unto before among
Christians:</hi> but yet this was done, and no such <hi>odd
chance</hi> neither. Your <hi>Popes</hi> had for a season be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been aspiring to <hi>greater heights</hi> then formerly
they had attained unto, and used all wayes <hi>possible</hi>
to commend themselves and their Authority, not
what <hi>truly</hi> it was, but what they would have it to
be, unto all with whom they had to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon


<pb n="436" facs="tcp:50044:195"/>
by sundry means and artifices imposed upon
the <hi>nations</hi> some undue conceits of it, though it was
not <hi>fully</hi> nor so easily admitted of as it may be you
may imagine. But in many things they were <hi>willing</hi> to
gratifie him in his pretensions, little knowing the
tendency of them; many things he took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their <hi>streights</hi> and divisions to impose
upon them; many things he obtained from
them by <hi>flattery</hi> and carnal compliances, untill by
sundry <hi>serpentine</hi> advances he had brought them
all unto his <hi>bow,</hi> and some of the greatest of them to
his <hi>stirrup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was yet more odd,</hi> say you, <hi>and strange that all
Christendome should calmly submit unto a power set
up anew by young converted Pagans: no Prince or
Bishop either here or of any either Christian Kingdom
either then or ever after to this day excepting against
it. Had not all the Bishops and Priests of</hi> Africa,
Egypt, Syria, Thrace, Greece <hi>and all the Christian
world acknowledged by an hundred experiments the
supream Spiritual Authority of the Roman Patriarch
in all times before this deluge of Goths and Vandals?
But why do I expostulate with you, who write these
things not to judicious Readers, but to fools and children,
who are not more apt to tell a truth, then to believe a lye.</hi>
But Sir, you shall quickly see whose discourse, yours
or mine, stand in need of <hi>week</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
That which you have in this place to oppose
is only this, <hi>that your Papal Authority received a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
advancement, by and among the Northern Nations,
who after long wars divided the Provinces of the Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
Empire among them.</hi> Now this is so broad a
Truth, that nothing but <hi>brutish ignorance,</hi> or obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
perversness can possibly cause any man to call
it into Question. It was not absolutely the <hi>setting up


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:50044:195"/>
of the Papacy,</hi> but an accession unto the <hi>Papal power</hi>
and authority which I ascribed unto that original.
And this if you dare to deny, it were easie out of
your own <hi>Annalists</hi> to overwhelm you with instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the confirmation of it. But yet neither were
your <hi>Concessions</hi> made, nor his assumptions carried
on in <hi>that silence</hi> which you fancy, when you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that his <hi>aspirings</hi> were neither <hi>taken notice</hi> of,
<hi>nor opposed,</hi> but that all Christendom should calmly
submit unto them. Where do you think you are,
that you talk at this rate? Did you never read of
any opposition made in <hi>former dayes</hi> unto your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Papal Power? none at all? from <hi>no Kings, no
Princes, no Bishops,</hi> no parts of Christendom? happy
man, who hath lived so quietly as you seem to have
done, and so little concerned in things past or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Did you never read or hear of the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and <hi>Edicts</hi> of Emperours and Kings, of <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi>
of Councils, <hi>Writings</hi> of Learned men in
all Ages against your <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations? Did you
never hear how before the times that we now talk of,
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> reproved <hi>Victor,</hi> how <hi>Cyprian</hi> opposed <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
and <hi>Stephen,</hi> how the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
<hi>Celestine</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> of their miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
in their claims of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction?</hi>
Are you an utter stranger unto the opposition made
by the <hi>German Emperours</hi> unto your <hi>Hildebrandine</hi>
Supremacy, with the books written against your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to that purpose? Have you not read your
own <hi>Baronius</hi> a great part of whose <hi>Voluminous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi>
consists in his endeavours to vindicate your <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Power</hi> from the open opposition that was made
to its introduction in every Age? You must needs
<hi>sleep quietly,</hi> seeing you lye so far from noise. I have
already in part let you see the <hi>fondness</hi> of this dream,


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:50044:196"/>
that your Papal Supremacy was ever <hi>calmly submitted</hi>
unto, and have manifested that it was publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
before it was born. But because I then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
my self unto more <hi>antient times</hi> then those
which are now under discourse, I shall mind you of
a <hi>few instances</hi> of the opposition made unto it, either
<hi>about</hi> or presently after that signal advancement,
which I affirmed that it received from the newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
Nations of the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the year 608. presently after the <hi>Saxons</hi>
had received Christianity, and therewithall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
their power, some of them at least to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of your <hi>Papal claim,</hi> which was then set
on foot, though in a much inferiour degree unto
what you have since promoted it unto, it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<hi>excepted against</hi> and disclaimed by a <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or Synod of the Brittish Clergy, who denyed
that they <hi>owed any subjection</hi> unto the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
or any respect, but <hi>such as Christians ought to bear
one towards another,</hi> and would not give place unto
its <hi>Authority</hi> in things of very small weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

<hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket</hi> had the hap to become a <hi>Traytor</hi>

in times more remote, and in those of the

if you are able the <hi>Laws of Charles</hi> the Great and

<hi>Henry the second</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> both <hi>deposed

no less, though with less success. <hi>See Sigibert Chron.

From that time forward untill the <hi>Reformation</hi> no
one <hi>age</hi> can be instanced in, wherein great, open and
signal opposition was not made unto the <hi>Papal</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

already given are sufficient to convince the

was made unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:50044:197"/>
Of the same nature is that which you nextly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<hi>of all the Bishops and Priests of</hi> Africa, Egypt,
Syria, Thrace, Greece, <hi>and all the Christian world
by an hundred experiments acknowledging the supream
spiritual Authority of the Roman Patriarch.</hi> I must I
see still mind you of what it is that you are to speak
unto. It is not the <hi>Patriarchate of your Pope,</hi> with
the Authority, Priviledges and preheminences which
by virtue thereof he layes claim unto, but his <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
succession to Christ,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> in the <hi>absolute
Headship of the whole Catholick Church,</hi> that you
are treating about. Now supposing you may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skilled in the affairs of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church then
for ought as I can yet perceive you are in those of
the <hi>Western,</hi> let me crave this favour of you, that
you would direct me unto <hi>one</hi> of those hundred
experiments, whereby the acknowledgment you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preceding the Conversion of the <hi>Nothern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
may be confirmed. It will I confess unto you
be a <hi>singular kindness,</hi> seeing I know not where to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to tell you the Truth, since unto this day. For
I suppose you will not imagine that the faigned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
of <hi>subjection,</hi> which poverty and hopes of
supplies from the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath extorted of
late from some few mean persons whose <hi>Titles</hi> only
were of any Consideration in the world, will deserve
any place in this disquisition. Untill you are pleased
therefore to favour me with <hi>your information,</hi> I must
abide in my ignorance of any such experiments as
those which you intimate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Artifices</hi> I confess of your Popes in former
dayes to draw men, especially in the <hi>Eastern Church</hi>
to an acknowledgement of that Authority, which
in their several seasons they claimed, have been


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:50044:198"/>
many, and their success various. Sometimes they
obtained a <hi>seeming compliance</hi> in some; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they procured their Authors very <hi>shrewd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes.</hi>
It may not be amiss to recount some of them.</p>
               <p>1. Upon all occasions they set <hi>forth themselves;</hi>
the dignity and <hi>preheminence of your See,</hi> with swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Encomiums</hi> and <hi>Titles, asserting their own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Power.</hi> Such self assumings are many of
the old <hi>Papal</hi> Epistles stuffed withall. A sober hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Christian cannot but <hi>nauseate</hi> at the reading of
them. For it is easily discernable how <hi>Antievange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
such Courses are, and how unbecoming all that
pretend themselves to be Disciples of Jesus Christ;
from these are their chiefest Testimonies in <hi>this Case</hi>
taken; and we may say of them all, they <hi>bear witness
to themselves,</hi> and that contrary to the Scripture, and
their witness is not true.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>When, and wherever such Letters and Epistles as
proclaimed their Priviledges have been admitted
through the inadvertency of Modesty of them to whom
they were sent, unwilling to quarrel with them about
the good opinion which they had of themselves</hi> (which
kind of entertainment they yet sometimes met not
withall) the next successors allwayes <hi>took for granted,</hi>
and pleaded what their predecessours had presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously
broached, as that which of right and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionably
belonged unto them. And this they
made sure of, that they would never lose any
ground, or take any one <hi>step</hi> backwards from what
any of them had advanced unto.</p>
               <p>3. Wherever they heard <hi>of any difference</hi> among
Bishops, they <hi>were still imposing their Vmpirage upon
them,</hi> which commonly by the one or other of the
parties at variance, to <hi>ballance</hi> thereby some disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
that they had to wrestle withall, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:50044:198"/>
yea sometimes they would begin to <hi>take</hi>
part with them that were openly in the wrong, even
<hi>Hereticks</hi> themselves, that they might thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
an address to them from others, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they would interpret as an express of their
subjection. And wherever their <hi>Vmpirage</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
they were never wanting to improve their
own interest by it, like the old <hi>Romans</hi> who being
chosen to determine a Controversie between other
<hi>People</hi> about some lands, adjudged them unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>4.
<hi>If any Person that was really injured,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
so to be, made any Address unto them for
any kind of <hi>Relief,</hi> immediately they laid hold of
their <hi>Address</hi> as an Appeal to their Authority, and
acted in their behalf accordingly, though they were
sometimes <hi>chidden</hi> for their pains, and advised to
meddle with what they had to do withall.</p>
               <p>5. Did <hi>any Bishops of note</hi> write them Letters of
respect, presently in <hi>their rescripts</hi> they return them
thanks for their <hi>profession of subjection to the See
Apostolick;</hi> so supposing them to do that, which in
truth they did not, they promise to do for them that
which they never desired, and by both made way for
the enlargment of the confines of their own authority.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Where any Prince or Emperour</hi> was entangled
in his affairs, they were still ready to crush them into
that condition of trouble, from whence they could
not be delivered but by their assistance; or to make
them believe that their <hi>adherence unto them,</hi> was the
only means to preserve them from ruine, and so
procured their <hi>suffrage</hi> unto their Authority.</p>
               <p>Unto these and the like heads of Corrupt and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Artifices</hi> may the most of the Testimonies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
pleaded for the Popes Supremacy be referred.


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:50044:199"/>
By such wayes and means hath it been erected. Yet
far enough from any such prevalency for <hi>seven
hundred years,</hi> as to afford us any of the experiments
which you boast of.</p>
               <p>The next thing you except against in my <hi>story,</hi> is,
my affirming <hi>that</hi> Austin <hi>the Monk who came hither
from</hi> Rome, <hi>was a man as far as appears by story the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
acquainted with the Gospel.</hi> In the repetition of
which words to keep your hand in ure, you leave
out that expression <hi>as far as appears by the story,</hi>
which is the evidence whereunto I appeal for the
Truth of my Assertion, and add to aggravate the
matter, the word <hi>very, very little,</hi> and then add,
<hi>here is the thanks that good St.</hi> Austin <hi>hath, who out of
his love and kindness entred upon the wild forrest of
our Paganism, with great hazards and inexpressible
sufferings of hunger, cold, and other corporal incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies!</hi>
But in the place you except against,
I acknowledge that God made him a <hi>special instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in bringing the Scripture or Gospel amongst us,
which I presume also he declared, according to the
light and ability which he had. But you are your
<hi>own Mothers Son;</hi> nothing will serve your turn, but
<hi>absolute, most pure</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> For what I have
further intimated of him, there are sundry things
in the <hi>History</hi> of his coming hither, and proceedings
here that warrant the suggestion. The <hi>Questions</hi>
that he sent for Resolution unto <hi>Gregory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
discover what manner of man he was. Let a man
be never so partially addicted unto him, and his
work, he must acknowledge that their <hi>frivolousness</hi>
and impertinency, considering the work he had in
hand, discover somewhat besides learning and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in him. So also did his <hi>driving</hi> of 10000. <hi>men,</hi>
besides an innumerable company or <hi>women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>


                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:50044:199"/>
altogether into the river <hi>Swale</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and
there causing them to baptize one another: His
Contest with the <hi>British Bishops</hi> about the time of
the observation <hi>of Easter,</hi> breaking the peace for a
<hi>Circumstance of a Ceremony</hi> that hath cost the Church
twenty times more trouble then it is worth, is of the
same nature. And I desire to know whence you
have your <hi>story of his inexpressible suffering</hi> here
amongst us. All that I can find, informs us that he
was <hi>right meetly entertained</hi> by King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> at his
first Landing by the means of <hi>Berda</hi> his wife a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
before his coming, with all plentifull provision
for himself and his companions. The next news
we hear of him, is about his Archiepiscopacy, his
<hi>Pall,</hi> and his Throne, from whence he would not
<hi>rise</hi> to receive the <hi>poor Brittans</hi> that came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with him. Further of his sufferings as yet I can
meet with nothing.</p>
               <p>And these are the things which you thought your
self <hi>able</hi> to except against in <hi>my story</hi> or the Progress
and Declension of Religion. The summ of it I shall
now comprize in some few Assertions, which you
may do well to consider, and get them disproved.</p>
               <p>1. The First is, <hi>That the Gospel was preached in this
Island in the dayes of the Apostles,</hi> by persons coming
from the <hi>East,</hi> directed by the Providence of God
for that purpose; most probably by <hi>Joseph of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi>
in chief, without any respect to <hi>Rome,</hi> or
mission from thence.</p>
               <p>2. That the Doctrine preached then by them, was
the <hi>same</hi> that is now publickly professed in <hi>England;</hi>
and not that <hi>taught</hi> by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> where
there is a discrepancy between us.</p>
               <p>3. That the story of the coming of <hi>Fugatius</hi> and
<hi>Damianus</hi> into the <hi>Province of Brittain,</hi> sent by


<pb n="446" facs="tcp:50044:200"/>
                  <hi>Eleutherius</hi> unto <hi>Lucius,</hi> is uncertain, improbable,
and not to be reconciled unto the state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Affairs</hi> in these Nations, at the time sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for its accomplishment.</p>
               <p>4. That about the fourth, fifth and sixth Centuries,
the <hi>Generality of the Professors</hi> of Christian Religion
in the world, were wofully declined from the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
zeal,</hi> piety, faith, love and purity in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, which their Predecessors in the same
<hi>Profession</hi> glorified God by; and that in particular
the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Church</hi> was much degenerated.</p>
               <p>5. There <hi>the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>for five hundred years
never laid claim</hi> unto that Soveraign Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
which they have challenged since the dayes
of <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> the seventh.</p>

by you enumerated.</hi> Now this I did not do,
but you feign it of your own heads, that you may
have somewhat to speak against, and a pretence of
intimating in the close of your discourse, that <hi>you
have considered the Chapter about Reformation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in truth you have not spoken one word unto it,
nor unto any thing contained in it. And yet when
you have done, as if you had been talking about
any thing wherein I am in the least measure concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
you come in, in the close with your grave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>That I should take heed of blaspheming that


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:50044:201"/>
innocent Catholick flock, which the Angels of God
watch over to protect them.</hi> As though a man could
not remember the <hi>wicked crimes</hi> of your <hi>nocent Popes,</hi>
but he must be thought to blaspheme the <hi>innocent
flock</hi> of Christ, which never had greater enemies in
this world, then some of them have been. If this
be to blaspheme, then some of your <hi>own Councils,
all your</hi> Historians, many of the most <hi>learned</hi> men
of your Church are notorious blasphemers. But
you wilfully mistake, and begg that their <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Papal faction</hi> may be esteemed the <hi>innocent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church</hi> of Christ, without a Concession
whereof, your inferences and perswasions are very
weak and feeble.</p>
               <p>Of the like nature unto this, is your ensuing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about the <hi>Contradictions</hi> which you fancied
in your <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> to be <hi>imposed on Papists, pag.</hi> 77.
Two things you insist upon, waving those that you
had formerly mentioned, as finding them in their
examination unable to yield you the advantage you
thought to make of them; you feign a <hi>new contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
which you say is imposed on Papists. <hi>For</hi>
say you, <hi>while our Kings reign in peace, then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
Religion is persecuted as contrary to Monarchy;
when we have destroyed that Government, then is the
Papist harrassed, spoyled, pillaged, murdered, because
their Religion is wholly addicted unto Monarchy, and
Papists are all for Kings; These are Contradictions;
is there not somewhat of the power of darkness in this?</hi>
But you again mistake, and that I fear because you
will do so; There was no Persecution of <hi>Papists</hi> in
this Land at any time, but what was in <hi>persuit</hi> of
some Laws that were made against them. Now not
<hi>one</hi> of those Laws intimate any such thing, as that
they were <hi>opposite unto Monarchy,</hi> but rather their


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:50044:202"/>
design to promote a <hi>double Monarchy</hi> on different
accounts in this Nation, the one of <hi>the Pope,</hi> and the
other of <hi>him</hi> to whom the Kingdom was given by
the Pope, and who for many years in vain attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>possess</hi> himself of it. And on that account
were you charged with an opposition to <hi>our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,</hi>
but not unto <hi>Monarchy</hi> it self. And yet I
must say, that if what hath been before discoursed
of your faith and perswasion concerning the <hi>Papal
Soveraignty</hi> be well considered, it will be found that
if not <hi>your Religion,</hi> yet the <hi>Principles</hi> of some of
the chief Professors of it, do carry in their womb a
great impeachment of <hi>Imperial Power.</hi> Nor can I
gather, that in the times of <hi>our Confusion</hi> you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as <hi>Papists</hi> for your friendship and love to
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> whatever some individual Persons amongst
you might do: Seeing some of you would have been
contented with its <hi>everlasting Seclusion,</hi> so that
your interest in the <hi>land</hi> might have been secured.
And whether your <hi>Popes</hi> themselves be not of that
mind, I leave to all men to judge, who know how
much they are wont to preferr their <hi>own interest</hi>
before the <hi>rights</hi> of other men. In the mean time
you may take notice, that whilest men are owned to
persue <hi>one certain End,</hi> they may at several times
fix on <hi>mediums</hi> for the compassing of it, opposite and
contrary one to another. <hi>Haec non successit, alia
aggrediamur via;</hi> when one way fails, another
quite contrary unto it may be fixed on. And whilest
it is supposed that their end is the <hi>promotion of the
Papal Interest,</hi> it is not improbable but that at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times you may make use of several wayes and
means opposite and contrary one to another; and
that this may be imputed unto you, without the
charge of <hi>Contradictions</hi> upon you. But you may


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:50044:202"/>
if you please omit discourses of this nature. I am
none of those that would charge any thing upon
you to your disadvantage in this world. Neither
do I desire your trouble any more then mine own.
My aim is only to defend the Truth which you
oppose.</p>
               <p>Your next attempt is to vindicate your self from
any such intention in your application of <hi>ejice
ancillam cum puero suo, as I apprehended.</hi> Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what you say to this purpose will satisfie your
<hi>Reader</hi> or no, I greatly question. For my part, as
I shall speak nothing but what <hi>I believe</hi> to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto truth, so if I am, or have been at any
time <hi>mistaken</hi> in my apprehension of your sense and
mind, I am resolved not to defend any thing because
I <hi>have spoken it. Homo sum,</hi> and therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to mistakes; though I am not in the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that I was <hi>actually mistaken</hi> in my conceptions
of your sense and meaning in your <hi>Fiat.</hi> But that
we may not needlesly contend about <hi>words,</hi> yours
or mine, I shall put you into a way whereby you
may <hi>immediately</hi> determine this difference, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that I mistook your intention, if I did so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
And it is this, Do but renounce those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
which if you maintain, you constantly <hi>affirm</hi>
all that in those words I supposed you to <hi>intimate,</hi>
and this strife will be at an end. And they are but
these two; 1. That all those who <hi>refuse</hi> to believe
and worship God according to the Propositions and
Determinations of your Church, are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
2. That <hi>obstinate Hereticks</hi> are to be accursed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
destroyed and consumed out of the world.
Do but renounce <hi>these Principles,</hi> and I shall readily
acknowledge my self mistaken in the intention of
the words you mention. If you will not so do, to


<pb n="452" facs="tcp:50044:203"/>
what purpose is it to contend with you about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>one
single expression,</hi> ambiguously as you pretend used
by you, when in your <hi>avowed Principles</hi> you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whatever is suggested to be intimated in it!
Thus easily might you have saved your <hi>longsome</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in this matter. And as for the <hi>embleme</hi> which
you close it with, of the <hi>Rod of Moses,</hi> which as you
say, <hi>taken in the right end was a walking staff, in the
wrong a Serpent,</hi> it is such a childish figment, as you
have no cause to thank them that imposed it upon
your credulity.</p>

               <p>WE are arrived at length unto the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those <hi>particulars</hi> in your <hi>Roman faith,</hi>
which in your <hi>Fiat</hi> you chose out either to adorn

your <hi>Countreymen</hi> to embrace, or so to <hi>gild</hi> it, as
that they may not take any prejudice from them
against the <hi>whole</hi> of what you profess. The first of
these is that which you entituled <hi>Messach,</hi> which
you now inform us to be a <hi>Saxon</hi> word, the same
with <hi>Mass.</hi> But why you make use of such an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete
word</hi> to amuze your Readers withal, you give
us no account. Will you give me leave to <hi>guess?</hi>
for if I mistake not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not far from your fancy.
<hi>Plain downright Mass</hi> is a thing that hath gotten
a very ill name amongst your <hi>Countreymen,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since so many of their forefathers were <hi>burned
to death</hi> for refusing to resort unto it. Hence it


<pb n="453" facs="tcp:50044:203"/>
may be you thought meet to wave that name, which
both the <hi>thing known to be signified by it</hi> in its own
nature, and your <hi>procedure</hi> about it had rendred
obnoxious to suspicion. So you call it by a <hi>new old
name,</hi> or an <hi>old new name,</hi> that men might not at
first know what you intended upon your invitation
to entertain them withal: and yet it may be, that
they would like it under a <hi>new dress,</hi> which the <hi>old
name</hi> might have startled them from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of. But <hi>Mass</hi> or <hi>Messach</hi> let it be as you
please, we shall now consider what it is, that you
offer afresh concerning it, and hear you speak out
your own words. Thus you say, <hi>p.</hi> 81.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having laughed at my admiration of Catholick
Service, you carp at me for saying that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were never called together to hear a Sermon; to
convince me you bring some places out of St.</hi> Pauls
<hi>Epistles, and the</hi> Acts <hi>which commend the Ministry of
the Word. This indeed is your usual way of refuting
my Speeches. You flourish copiously in that which is
not at all against me, and never apply it to my words,
least it should appear as it is, impertinent. I deny
not that Converts were further instructed, or that the
preaching of Gods Word is good and usefull; but that
which I say, is, that Primitive Christians were never
called together for that end, as the great work of
their Christianity. This I have clearly proved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well Sir, without retorsion, which <hi>just indignation</hi>
against this unhandsome management of a desperate
Cause is ready to suggest, be pleased to take a <hi>little
view</hi> of your own words once more, <hi>pag.</hi> 279. you
tell us, that <hi>the Apostles and Apostolical Christians
placed their Religion not in hearing, or making Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
FOR THEY HAD NONE, but in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to their Christian Lyturgie; and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons


<pb n="454" facs="tcp:50044:204"/>
mentioned in the</hi> Acts, <hi>were made to the Jews
and Pagans for their Conversion, not to any Christians
at all.</hi> Could I now take any other course to confute
these <hi>false and impious Assertions,</hi> then what I did
in the Animadversions? I proved unto you, that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
were made unto Christians by the Apostles for
their edification; that <hi>order</hi> is given by them for the
<hi>instant preaching of the Word, in</hi> and unto the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
unto the end of the world; and that those are by
them signally commended who <hi>laboured</hi> in that work;
and what can be spoken more directly to the confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your Assertion? You would now shrowd your
self under the ambiguity of that expression, <hi>the great
work of their Christianity,</hi> which yet you make no use
of in your <hi>Fiat.</hi> The words there from which you
would <hi>get countenance</hi> unto your present evasion are
these. <hi>Nowhere was ever Sermon made to formal
Christians either by St.</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul <hi>or any other, as
the work of their Religion that they came together for;
nor did the Christians ever dream of serving God after
their Conversion by any such means, but ONLY by
the Eucharist or Liturgy.</hi> Here is somewhat of <hi>the
work of their Religion which they came together for,</hi>
nothing of the <hi>great work of their Christianity.</hi>
Now that preaching was a work of their Religion
that they came together for, though not <hi>the only
work</hi> of it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>only end</hi> for which they so convened,
which no man ever dreamed that it was, and that
the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians did by, and in that work
<hi>serve God,</hi> hath been proved unto you from the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
And all Antiquity with the whole story of
the Church, gives <hi>attestation</hi> to the same Truth. Sir
it were far more <hi>honourable</hi> for you to renounce <hi>a
false and scandalous Assertion</hi> when you are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that such it is, then to seek to palliate it, and to


<pb n="455" facs="tcp:50044:204"/>
secure your self by such unhansome evasions. <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word unto believers</hi> is an Ordinance of
Christ, and that of indispensible necessity unto their
edification or growth in Grace and knowledge
which he requireth of them. In the <hi>practice</hi> of this
ordinance were the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves sedulous,
and commanded others so to be. So were they in
the Primitive following times, as you may learn from
the account given us of <hi>Church meetings</hi> by <hi>Justin
Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> in their Apologies, and all
that have <hi>transmitted</hi> any thing unto Posterity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their Assemblies. For this end, to hear the
word preached, Christians came together, <hi>not only,</hi>
or <hi>solely,</hi> or exclusively to the administration of other
Ordinances, but as to a <hi>part</hi> of that worship which
God required at their hands, and wherein <hi>no small</hi>
of their spiritual advantage was enwrapped. To
deny this, as you do in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> is to deny that the
<hi>Sun shines</hi> at noon day, and to endeavour to dig up
the very roots of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ety, Knowledge, and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
to what ends and purposes, and for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
of what other thing in your room, let all
indifferent men judge. And I shall take leave to say,
that to my best observation, I never met with an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
in any <hi>Author</hi> of what Religion so ever more
remote from <hi>truth,</hi> sobriety and modesty then that
of yours in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> pag. 275. <hi>Nor did the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians for 300. years ever hear a Sermon
made unto them upon a Text, but meerly flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at their Priests appointment unto their Messachs.</hi>
This I say is so <hi>loudly</hi> and notoriously untrue, and so
known to be so, to all that have ever looked into the
stories of those times, that I am amazed at your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the publishing of it. It may be you will
hope to shelter your self under the ambiguity of that


<pb n="456" facs="tcp:50044:205"/>
expression <hi>made unto them upon a text.</hi> Supposing
that an instance cannot be given of that <hi>mode</hi> of
preaching, wherein some <hi>

But this <hi>Fig leaf</hi> will not cover you from the just
Censure of knowing men. For 1. Their following
adversative, <hi>but meerly,</hi> is perfectly exclusive of all
preaching be it of what <hi>Mode</hi> it will be. 2. The
reading of <hi>one certain Text</hi> before Preaching is not
necessary unto it, but all preaching is and ever was
<hi>upon some Text or Texts,</hi> that is, it consisted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
and application of the word of God, that
is, some part of portion of it. 3. Whereas it is
certain that our Saviour himself <hi>preached on a Text,</hi>
Luk. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. as also <hi>did his Apostles,</hi> Act.
8. 35. and the Fathers of the <hi>following Ages,</hi> it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
evident that that was also the <hi>constant mode</hi>
of preaching in the first 300. years, as may be made
good in the instance of <hi>Origen</hi> and sundry others.</p>
               <p>You go on, and except against me for saying,
<hi>that we hear nothing of your Sacrifice of the Mass in

                     </gap> too? but that this incruent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was instituted by the same Lord before his death

that you intend by it, for I suppose you would not

both in your <hi>Fiat</hi> and in your <hi>Epistola</hi> to obscure it


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:50044:205"/>
as much as you are able. 1. You call it an <hi>incruent

an <hi>incruent proper Sacrifice,</hi> such as you would have
this to be, is a proper improper Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
2. You say it <hi>was instituted by our Lord to figure
out his Passion.</hi> (1.) This is a weighty proof of what
you have in hand, being the <hi>only thing</hi> to be proved.
(2.) I suppose in the examination of it, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that you <hi>Sacrifice that very body and blood of
Christ</hi> in your own conceits, which himself offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto God; and how you can make any thing, to
be <hi>a figure of it self,</hi> as yet I do not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
(3.) That the Lord Christ appointed the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
of his body and blood, and our <hi>Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sacrifice</hi> therein to be a Commemoration of his
death and Passion, is the Doctrine of Protestants,
where with your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> hath a perfect inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as we shall find in the Consideration of it. This is
the substance of what you are pleased to acquaint us
with about <hi>this great business of our Religion.</hi> But
because you shall perceive that it was not without
<hi>good grounds</hi> and reasons that I affirmed the Scripture
to be <hi>utterly silent</hi> of this that you make the great
work of Christianity, I shall a little further enquire
after the nature of it; that I mean which by you it
is fancied to be, for it is a mere creature of your own
imagination.</p>
               <p>1. You alwayes contend that it is <hi>a proper Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which you intend.</hi> The first <hi>Canon</hi> of your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil


<pb n="458" facs="tcp:50044:206"/>
accurseth</hi> them who deny it to be <hi>verum &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium
Sacrificium,</hi> a <hi>True and proper Sacrifice,</hi>
wherein as they say before <hi>Christus inimolatur,</hi>
Christ is Sacrificed. Many things in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in respect of their <hi>Analogy</hi> unto the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of the old, are called <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> even almost
all spiritual actions that are acceptable unto God in
Christ. The <hi>preaching of the Gospel</hi> unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of sinners, is termed Sacrificing, Rom. 15. 16.
So is <hi>Faith it self,</hi> Phil. 2. 17. So <hi>Prayers and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi>
are an oblation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. chap. 13. 15. and
<hi>good works</hi> are called Sacrifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>Phil.</hi>
4. 18. And our <hi>whole Christian Obedience</hi> is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Peter</hi> so to be. In the Sacrament of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
it is that you seek for your Sacrifice. And if
you would be contented to call it, and esteem it so,
upon the account of its comprizing <hi>some</hi> of the things
before mentioned, or meerly as a <hi>spiritual action</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God and acceptable unto him, there
would be an end of this contest. But you must have it
<hi>a proper Sacrifice,</hi> like those of <hi>Aaron</hi> of old: not a
<hi>remembrance</hi> of the Sacrifice of Christ, but a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Christ himself,</hi> wherein <hi>Christus immolatur,</hi>
Christ is sacrificed, as the <hi>Council</hi> speaks.</p>
               <p>2. The Secrifices of old were of two sorts, 1. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical,</hi>
or Oblations of the fruits of the earth or
other things, whereby the <hi>Sacrificers</hi> acknowledged
God as the Lord and Author of all good things and
mercies, with thanksgiving. 2. <hi>Propitiatory</hi> for
the atoning of God, the reconciling him unto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
for the turning away of his wrath and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration
of the <hi>pardon</hi> of sin. This was done <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
and Sacramentally by virtue of their respect
unto the <hi>oblation</hi> of Christ, by the old bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Law; <hi>really</hi> and effectually by that <hi>bloody


<pb n="459" facs="tcp:50044:206"/>
Sacrifice</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ once offered
for all. Now because in the Sacrament of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
it is our Duty to offer up unto God our
<hi>thankeful prayers</hi> for his unspeakable love in sending
his only Son to dye for us, we do not contend with
any, who on that accont, and with respect unto that
peculiar act of our duty in it, shall call it an <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical
Sacrifice,</hi> yea affirm it so to be. But you
will have it a <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> a Sacrifice of
Atonement like that made by Christ himself; a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for <hi>the sins of the living and the dead,</hi> making
reconciliation with God, obtaining Pardon of sin,
and eternal life, things peculiar to the <hi>one Sacrifice</hi>
of Christ in his death and passion.</p>
               <p>3. Though you usually exclude the <hi>communion</hi>
from it, wherein you do <hi>wisely,</hi> that it may have
no affinity with the Institution of Christ, yet you
do not <hi>precisely</hi> determine your Sacrifice unto any
<hi>one act</hi> or action in your <hi>Mass,</hi> but make it comprize
the whole with the manner of its celebration, from
the first setting forth of the <hi>Elements of bread</hi> and
wine mixed with water, unto the end of the <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
after their <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
thereupon, and their offering up unto God
the <hi>body and blood</hi> of Christ under the <hi>accidents</hi> of
bread and wine. The <hi>presentation</hi> of the bread and
wine, you would prove to belong unto your Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
from the example of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> Your
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is also of the <hi>essence</hi> of it: for it
is required in a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> sayes your <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that
the <hi>sensible thing to be offered unto God be changed
and plainly destroyed.</hi> de Miss. Lib. 1. cap. 2. which you
esteem the substance of your bread and wine to be
in your <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Your <hi>religious adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the consecrated <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>st</hi> belongs also unto it, for


<pb n="460" facs="tcp:50044:207"/>
that in the <hi>Canon of the Mass</hi> immediately ensues
your <hi>Transubstantiating Consecration,</hi> before the
oblation it self, and so must necessarily be a part of
your Sacrifice: Your <hi>offering up unto God of Jesus
Christ,</hi> praying him to accept of him at the Priests
hands (<hi>supra quae propitio &amp; sereno vultu respicere
digneris &amp; accepta habere</hi>) belongs also unto it. So
doth your direction of it to the <hi>propitiating</hi> of God,
and the expiation of the sins of the Quick and the
Dead; The <hi>Ceremonies</hi> also wherewith your <hi>Masse</hi> is
celebrated, as I suppose, most of them belong to your
<hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and those who believe them not to be <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Piety,</hi> are accursed by your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
The <hi>Priests eating of the Host</hi> belongs to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
yea saith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it is <hi>pars essentialis Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii,</hi>
though not <hi>tota essentia,</hi> an <hi>essential part of the
Sacrifice, though the whole Essence</hi> of it doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
therein. I know you are at a great loss and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance</hi>
among your selves to find out what it is, that
is <hi>properly your Sacrifice,</hi> or wherein the <hi>essence</hi> of it
doth consist. Some of your <hi>discrepant</hi> opinions are
given us by your <hi>Azorius</hi> Lib. 10. Chap. 19. <hi>Sunt</hi>

                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:50044:207"/>
viz. <hi>Consecratione. There are who think the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Sacrifice to consist in the words, rayers,
ceremonies and rites which are used in the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because say they the nature of the Sacrifice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist in the Consecration it self, which rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto the nature of a Sacrament then of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Others think that the Sacrifice consists in three
actions of the Priest, Consecration, Oblation and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
or receiving of the Host. Others in four or five, as
Consecration, Oblation, Fraction, Sumption. Others
in two, Consecration and Oblation; and some in one,
Consecration.</hi> And is not this a <hi>brave business</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on the Consciences of all men, when you know
not your selves what it is that you would so impose?
A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must be believed, and they are all <hi>accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
by you that believe it not; but <hi>what the Sacrifice</hi>
is, and <hi>wherein</hi> it doth consist, you cannot tell. And
an easie matter it were to manifest that all the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi>
which you assign as those that either belong
necessarily unto the <hi>integrity</hi> of a Sacrifice, or those
wherein some of you, or any of you, would have
<hi>its essence</hi> to consist, are indeed of no such nature or
importance; but that is not my present business. I
am only enquiring <hi>what your Sacrifice</hi> is according
unto you own sense and imagination. And that we
may not mistake, I shall set down such a general
description of it, as the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Mass,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>rubrick</hi> of the <hi>Missal,</hi> the rites and <hi>cautels</hi> of
its celebration, will afford unto us. Now in these
it is represented as a <hi>sacred action, wherein a proper
Priest or Sacrificer, arrayed with various consecrated
attire, standing at the Altar, taketh bread and wine,
about which he useth great variety of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ostures and
gestures, inclinations, bowings, kneelings, stretching
out and gathering in his arms, with a multitude of


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:50044:208"/>
Crossings, at the end and in the midst of his pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of certain words of Scripture, turns them into
the real natural body and blood of Christ the Son of
God, worshiping them so converted with religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
shewing them to the people for the same purpose,
and then offering that body and blood unto God, praying
for his acceptance of them so offered, and that it may be
available for the living and the dead, for the pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their sins, and saving of their souls; after which
he takes that body of Christ so made, worshipped and
offered, and eats and deavours it, by all which Christ is
truly and properly Sacrificed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of your Church, wherein as
you inform us, the <hi>main</hi> of your Devotion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
doth consist. Of this Sacrifice I told you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
the <hi>Scripture</hi> is silent; and I now add that so
also is <hi>Antiquity.</hi> You cannot produce any one
approved writer for the <hi>space of</hi> 600. <hi>years</hi> that
gives testimony to this your Sacrifice. For what ever
<hi>florish</hi> you may make with the ambiguity of the
word <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which we cleared before, your
<hi>Transubstantion</hi> and other things asserted by you to
belong unto the <hi>integrity,</hi> if not the <hi>Essence</hi> of your
Sacrifice, are strangers unto Antiquity, as hath been
lately proved unto you, and will no doubt be yet
further <hi>confirmed</hi> so to be.</p>
               <p>I told you as you observe, that this Sacrifice is <hi>an
utter stranger to Scripture,</hi> as also that it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with what is therein delivered. The Apostle
in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly affirms that the
Sacrifice of the Church of the Christians is <hi>but one,</hi>
and that <hi>once offered for all;</hi> whereas those of the
Jews by reason of their <hi>imperfection</hi> were often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated;
which you choose out to reply unto, and
say, <hi>It is true the Sacrifice of our Lords Passion


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:50044:208"/>
of which the Apostle in that whole discourse intends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to treat in opposition unto that of Bulls and goats,
was so done but once, that it could not be done twice.
But as the Sacrifices of the Old Law were instituted
by Almighty God to be often iterated, before the Passion
of the Messias for a continual exercise of Religion; so
did the same Lord for the very same purpose institute
another to be iterated after his death, unto which it was
to have reference when it should be past, as the former
had to the same death when it was to come.</hi> So
you.</p>
               <p>But first, This <hi>begs</hi> the Question; for you only
repeat and say that such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was institued by
Christ, which you know is by us utterly denyed.
(2.) It <hi>plainly contradicts</hi> the Apostle, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
his whole argument and design. 1. It <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts</hi>
him in express terms; for whereas he sayes
not only that <hi>Christ once offered</hi> himself, but also that
he was <hi>once offered</hi> for all, that is, <hi>no more to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
you affirm that he is often offered, and that every
day. 2. His design is to demonstrate the <hi>excellency</hi>
of the Condition of the Church of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and the worship of God therein above that of
the Old. And this he proves to consist here in a
special manner, that they had <hi>many Sacrifices</hi> which
were of necessity to <hi>be reiterated</hi> because they could
not take away sin; for saith he, <hi>if they could, then
should they not have been repeated, nor would there have
been need</hi> of any other Sacrifice. But, now saith
he, this is done <hi>by the one Sacrifice of Christ,</hi> which
hath so taken away sin, as that it hath made the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of its self, or the institution of any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
needless; and therefore we have no more but
<hi>that one,</hi> and that one <hi>once</hi> performed. Now unless
you will deny the Apostles Assertions, either


<pb n="464" facs="tcp:50044:209"/>
(1.) That <hi>if one Sacrifice</hi> can take away sin, there is
no need of another; or (2.) That <hi>the one Sacrifice
of</hi> Christ did perfectly take away sin as to Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and also (3.) assert that the <hi>condition</hi> of the
<hi>Gospel Church</hi> is still the same with that of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and that we have need of <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
not only as theirs was <hi>year</hi> by <hi>year,</hi> from
whence he argues the imperfection of the greatest
solemn Sacrifice of <hi>Expiation, but day by day</hi> with a
further and greater weakness, (repetition in the
judgement of the Apostle being an evidence thereof)
there will be no place left for <hi>your Sacrifice;</hi> that is,
your main worship belongs not to the Church of
God at all. (4.) You pretend that in this <hi>worship</hi>
Christ himself is Sacrificed unto God, but <hi>incruenter,</hi>
and without suffering: but the Apostle plainly tells
us, that if he <hi>be often offered,</hi> he must <hi>often suffer,</hi>
Heb. 9. 26. And the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Christ, without
his passion, his offering without suffering, evacuates
both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>But what of all this? if the <hi>Apostles</hi> used the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
you talk of, that of the <hi>Mass,</hi> is it meet we
should do so also? Hereof you say, <hi>were not the
Apostles according to this rite <gap reason="foreign">

but only preaching Gods word or some such
thing to the people in the name and behalf of God.
But Sir, is this to be in earnest or jest? the sacred text
says they were Sacrificing to our Lord, liturgying and
ministring unto him; you say they were not Sacrificing
to God, but only preaching to the people. And now


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:50044:209"/>
the Question is whither you or I more rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

this his <hi>peculiar separation</hi> to the work of

not to insist on the repetition of my former Answer,
which in your <hi>wonted manner</hi> you lamely and unduly
represent, could you by other Arguments and on
other testimonies, prove that the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> you plead
for was instituted by Christ, and offered by the
Apostles, there might possibly be some colour for a
man to think that they performed <hi>that duty also</hi>
when they were said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the service of
God. But from that general expression intimating
any kind of <hi>publick Ministery</hi> whatever, and never
used in any Author <hi>sacred</hi> or <hi>Prophane</hi> precisely and
absolutely to signifie <hi>sacrificing,</hi> to conclude that
they were <hi>offering Sacrifice,</hi> and to use no other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to prove they had any <hi>such Sacrifice,</hi> is such
a fondness as nothing but insuperable prejudice can
perswade a man in his right wits to give countenance
unto. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that the Magistrate is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;
doth he mean that he is <hi>Gods Sacrificer?</hi> or <hi>his
Minister?</hi> And he sayes of himself that he was

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth he intend that <hi>he was Christs
Sacrificer?</hi> or <hi>his Servant?</hi> Rom. 15. 16. &amp; v. 27.
he sayes that it was the duty of the Gentiles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
doth he mean to <hi>Sacrifice in your
carnal things,</hi> or to <hi>minister of them</hi> to the Jews?
(1.) But you will it may be except that they were

to the Lord; it must needs be <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> because it
was to the Lord. But 1. I have shewed you how
this pretence is perfectly <hi>destructive</hi> of your own
intendment, in that it is the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> that is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

to God, and the <hi>high Priest</hi> looking on? Do you not
see the fondness of your pretension? (3.) I told
you before, but now begin to fear that you are too

against you; so is <hi>Cajetan, Erasmus,</hi> and <hi>Vatablus</hi>
of your own: and do you not now see what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of your boasting? And are not your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
beholding unto you, for endeavouring so
industriously to draw them off from the <hi>Institution</hi>
of Christ, to place their Confidence and devotion in
that which hath not the <hi>least footstep</hi> in Scripture or
Antiquity, but is expresly condemned by them both?


<pb n="469" facs="tcp:50044:211"/>
But to tell you my judgement, you will prevail with
very few of them to answer your desires. Will they
judge it <hi>meet</hi> and equal think you to change a <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament</hi> that Christ hath appointed, to embrace
a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that you have invented? to leave <hi>calling
upon God</hi> according to the sense of their wants with
understanding, as they do in that Celebration of the
<hi>Eucharist</hi> which now they enjoy, to attend unto a
<hi>Priest sometimes muttering,</hi> sometimes <hi>saying,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>singing</hi> a deal of <hi>Latine</hi> whereof they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
never a word? To forego that <hi>internal humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
self abasement, and prostration of soul unto God
which they are enured unto in that Sacrament, to
become <hi>spectators</hi> of the <hi>Theatrical</hi> gestures of
your Sacrificers? Besides they are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with your request, and to make your Mass the
<hi>sum of their Devotion</hi> and worship of God, without
offering the highest violence to their <hi>Faith</hi> as they
are Christians, their <hi>Reason</hi> as they are men, and
that <hi>Sense</hi> which they have in common with other
Creatures. And what are you, or what have you done
for them that you should at once expect such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
largeness at their hands?</p>
               <p>I. For your <hi>Faith,</hi> if it be grounded on the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
as every true <hi>Protestants</hi> is, your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> if
admitted, will unquestionably evert it; To <hi>accept of
a worship</hi> pretended to be of such huge importance,
as to be available for the <hi>impetration of Grace,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Pardon of sins, removal of punishment, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
for the living and the dead, <hi>destitute</hi> of all foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in, or countenance from the Scripture, <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi>
inconsistent with their faith.</p>
               <p>2. It is no less to have <hi>a Sacrament</hi> which is given
unto us of God as a pledge and token of his Love
and Grace, turned into <hi>a Sacrifice,</hi> which is a thing


<pb n="470" facs="tcp:50044:212"/>
by us offered unto God and accepted by him, so that
they differ as in other things, so in their <hi>terms, à quo</hi>
and <hi>ad quem,</hi> from what they proceed, and by whom
they are accepted.</p>
               <p>3. Besides they will quickly discover your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to be contrary unto what the <hi>Scripture</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, both concerning the <hi>Sacrifice of Christ</hi>
and also his institution of his last supper, which is
your Rule and comprizeth the whole of your Duty in
the administration of it. They do not find that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Christ offered</hi> himself unto <hi>his Father,</hi> but to <hi>his
Disciples;</hi> not to him to be accepted of him, but to
them to be by faith received.</p>
               <p>4. And whereas the Apostle expresly affirms that
<hi>he offered himself but once,</hi> if he offered himself a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
in his last Supper,</hi> you must maintain that he
offered himself <hi>twice,</hi> unless you will deny his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
on the Cross.</p>
               <p>5. Moreover it is greatly opposite to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymens
<hi>faith</hi> about the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ and his
real <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which are to them things of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that whosoever shakes their faith in and about
them, shakes the very foundations of their hope,
consolation and salvation. They have been taught
that Christ remains <hi>an High Priest</hi> for ever, and the
multiplication of <hi>Priests</hi> in succession arising meerly
from the mortality and death of them that preceded,
they believe that no <hi>Priest</hi> can be sustituted unto
him in his office to offer a <hi>proper Sacrifice</hi> unto God,
the same which he offered himself, without a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of an <hi>insufficiency</hi> in him for his work. It is
true there are persons who in his name and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as he is the <hi>great Prophet</hi> of the Church, do
Minister unto it, whom some of them, either as the
word may be an abreviation of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or out


<pb n="471" facs="tcp:50044:212"/>
of <hi>analogy</hi> unto them who of old served at the altar,
do call <hi>Priests;</hi> but that any should intervene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Christ in <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> or the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his <hi>Priestly office,</hi> you will not find your
Countrymen ready to believe. For they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
there are as many <hi>Mediators,</hi> and <hi>Sureties</hi> as
<hi>Priests</hi> or Sacrificers of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>6. Moreover they believe that the <hi>Sacrifice of the
Mass</hi> is an high derogation from the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross, and to
be set up in competition with it.</p>
               <p>7. They are at a stand at the whole matter; to
see you <hi>turning bread and Wine</hi> into that very body
and blood of Christ which suffered on the Cross,
and then to <hi>worship them,</hi> and then to pray to God
to accept at your hands that Christ which you have
made, and then to <hi>eat</hi> him. But when they consider
that by so doing, you suppose your selves to <hi>effect</hi>
that which they believe to be wrought only by the
<hi>blood of the Cross of Christ</hi> once offered for all, and
therein fancy a Sacrifice of Christ, wherein he dyeth
not, contrary to so many express Testimonies of
Scripture, they are utterly averse from it. For
whereas they look for <hi>Redemption,</hi> Forgiveness of
sins, and Reconciliation with God by the one Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ upon the Cross, wherein consists the
foundation of their hope and consolation, because it
being absolutely <hi>perfect</hi> was every way able and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
without any repetition, as the Apostle
teacheth them, <hi>to take away sin,</hi> and for ever to
consummate them that are Sanctified, you teach
them now to look for the same things from
this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of yours, which would make them
question the validity and perfection of that of
Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:50044:213"/>
8. And when they have so done, yet they would
still be forced to question the <hi>validity</hi> of yours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a pretended Sacrifice of Christ <hi>without
his death,</hi> which they know to have been indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
required to render his Sacrifice valid and
effectual.</p>
               <p>9. And they cannot but think that this <hi>repeated
Sacrifice</hi> being pretended to be for the very same
ends and purposes with that of Christ himself, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt <hi>to take off</hi> the minds and confidence of men
from that <hi>one Sacrifice</hi> performed so long ago, which
they have not seen, and to fix them on that which
their eyes daily look upon, as the <hi>praesens numen</hi>
that they can immediately apply themselves unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thus they fear that insensibly all faith of the true
<hi>Propitiation</hi> wrought by Christ is obliterated, and
that which they think an Idol set up in the room of
it.</p>
               <p>10. And which further troubles them, they are
<hi>jealous</hi> that by this your <hi>fiction</hi> you quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the <hi>Testament</hi> of Christ, which certainly no
man ought to endeavour the disannulling of. For
whereas in this <hi>Sacrament</hi> believers come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from him the great <hi>Legacy of his body and
blood,</hi> with all the fruits of his death and Passion,
you direct them to be <hi>offering</hi> and <hi>Sacrificing</hi> of
them unto God, which quite alters the <hi>Will</hi> of our
great Testator. And very many other things there
are, wherein your <hi>Countreymen</hi> affirm that your
Sacrifice is contrary to the faith wherein from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
they have been instructed, and that in things
of the greatest importance to their Consolation here,
and Salvation hereafter.</p>
               <p>II. Neither is this all: your request also lies
cross to your <hi>Reason,</hi> no less then to your Faith.


<pb n="473" facs="tcp:50044:213"/>
For your <hi>Sacrifice</hi> cannot be performed, without a
Supposition of a <hi>change of the substance of the bread
and wine into the substance of the body and blood of
Christ,</hi> and the substance of that body and blood,
in every consecrated Host under the species of Bread
and Wine, Christ himself alive being in every <hi>Host</hi>
and every <hi>particle</hi> of it. Hence many things they
say ensue, which no man can possibly <hi>admit of,</hi>
without offering violence unto the main Principles
of that <hi>Reason</hi> whereby we are distinguished from
the beasts that perish. Some few of them may be
instanced in.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Accidents subsisting without a Subject,</hi> follows
hence necessarily in the first place; so that there
should be <hi>whiteness,</hi> and nothing <hi>white; length,</hi> and
nothing <hi>long; bredth,</hi> and nothing <hi>broad; weight,</hi>
and nothing <hi>heavy.</hi> For all these <hi>accidents</hi> of Bread
remain, when you would have them say that the
<hi>bread</hi> is gone; so that there is left a <hi>white, sweet,
long, broad, heavy nothing.</hi> This your <hi>Countreymen</hi>
cannot understand.</p>
               <p>2. Besides they say you hereby teach them, <hi>that one
and the same body of Christ which is in heaven, is also on
the Altar,</hi> not by an impletion of the whole space
between heaven and earth, that some part of it
should be in heaven, and some on earth; but that
the one body which is in heaven, and whilest it is
there, is also on the <hi>Altar</hi> in the Accidents of Bread,
which upon the matter is, that one and the same
body is two, yea an hundred or a thousand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as in the <hi>Mass</hi> you are pleased to multiply it.
Now that <hi>one and the same</hi> body should be <hi>locally</hi>
divided or separated from its self, that whilest <hi>that
one</hi> body is on the Altar, that <hi>other one</hi> body which
is the same, should be in heaven, your Countreymen
think to imply a Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:50044:214"/>
3. And so also they do that a <hi>body</hi> should be in <hi>any
place,</hi> and yet not as a body, but as a Spirit. For
whereas you say that whole Christ is contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
each <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine, and under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the most <hi>minute</hi> part of either <hi>Species,</hi> as your
Council speaks, you make the body of Christ to be
whole in the whole, and whole in every part;
when the very nature of a body requires that it
have <hi>partes extra partes,</hi> its parts distinct from one
another, and those occupying their distinct parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
places. But you make the <hi>body of Christ</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be <hi>compassed</hi> in, nor to <hi>fill</hi> the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is, that is, to <hi>be in a place,</hi> and <hi>not to be in a
place.</hi> For if it be a <hi>body,</hi> and be under the <hi>Species</hi>
of bread and wine upon the <hi>Altar, it is in</hi> a place;
and if it be not comprehended in that <hi>space</hi> where
it is, and doth fill it, it is <hi>not in</hi> a place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is there, and is not there at the same time.</p>
               <p>4. And moreover we all know that the <hi>Consecrated
wafer</hi> bears no proportion to the true natural body
of Christ, and yet this is said to be <hi>contained</hi> under
that. So that the body <hi>contained</hi> is much greater
and farther extended, then <hi>the body that contains it,</hi>
or the space wherein it is; for it is so <hi>under the
Host</hi> as not to be elsewhere, unless in another
Host.</p>
               <p>5. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y it is in every <hi>minute part</hi> of the Host, which
multiplies contradictions in your Assertion.</p>
               <p>6. Of the same nature is it that you are forced to
<hi>feign</hi> the same body in 10000. <hi>distant places</hi> at the
same time, and that with all <hi>contradictory adjuncts</hi>
and affections. Now your <hi>Countreymen</hi> think that
these and innumerable other consequences of your

Sacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:50044:214"/>
are such as overthrow the whole <hi>order of nature,</hi> and
being of things, and leave nothing certain among
the Sons of men.</p>
               <p>III. Their <hi>sense</hi> is equally engaged against you
with their <hi>Reason.</hi> Your <hi>Host</hi> is <hi>visible, tangible,
gustible;</hi> when they <hi>see</hi> it, they see <hi>bread;</hi> when they
<hi>feel</hi> it, they feel bread; when they <hi>taste</hi> it, they
taste bread; and yet you tell them it is not bread:
whom shall they believe? if things be not as they
see them, feel them, taste them, it may be they are
not men, nor do go on their feet, but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in all these things, and suppose they see, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and understand what they do not. You tell
them indeed that the <hi>bread</hi> is changed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the body
of Christ, that body that was born of the <hi>blessed

that upon the suppositions you proceed on, you
have not any just grounds to conclude your selves
to be <hi>living men.</hi> For you teach men to deny and
question all that from Reason or Sense you can insist
upon to prove that so you are. Ou these and the
like accounts the <hi>Encomiums</hi> you give of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

find daily comfort and advantage to their souls for
the embracement of it.</p>

               <p>UNto the sixteenth Chapter of the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
directed to your Paragraph of the <hi>Blessed
Virgin,</hi> you can find it seems nothing to say, and
therefore betake your self to clamorous revilings.
All that you say in your <hi>Fiat</hi> on this head, is but
an heap of <hi>false accusations</hi> against Protestants
for dishonouring her; and all that you say in
in your <hi>Epistle</hi> in its Vindication is railing at me
for minding you of your miscarriage. My whole
Book you say is nothing but <hi>calumnies, a bundle of
slanders, a meer quiver of sharp arrows of desolation.</hi>
I am not sorry that you are sensible that it hath <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi>
in it, tending to the desolation of your Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.
But I challenge you to give an instance
of any <hi>one calumny or slander in it,</hi> from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the end. If you do not do so, I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
you to be really and highly guilty of that
which you would <hi>falsly</hi> impose upon another. <hi>Free
your self</hi> by some one instance if you can: if you
cannot, your <hi>reputation</hi> will follow your <hi>Conscience</hi>
whether it will be hard for you to find them again.
The substance of that Chapter is this, which is all
that I shall now say to your nothing against it. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
yield to the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> all the honour
that the Scripture allows them, or direct them unto,
or that the Primitive Church did ascribe unto her,
and the <hi>Papists</hi> give her the honour due to God
alone, whereby they horribly dishonour God and
her.</p>

               <p>YOur next procedure is to your Discourse of
<hi>Figures</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> and my Animadversions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. And here you say, <hi>you will come up close un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me;</hi> you mean in replying unto what I delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
about it; But Sir, I thought this had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your design; You professed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of your <hi>Epistle</hi> that it was so, and have
made good use of that declaration of your self, by
avoiding every thing in my discourse that you
found your self pressed with, and too <hi>difficult a
task</hi> for you to deal withal. Why do you now
begin to <hi>forget</hi> your self and to cast off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
you have hitherto shaddowed your self under,
and excused your self by from tergiversation?
Surely you think you are upon <hi>this head</hi> able to
say <hi>somewhat to the purpose,</hi> which you despaired of
doing upon others of as great importance, and
therefore now you may argue and dispute, which
before the <hi>design of your Fiat</hi> would not permit
you to do. As far as I can observe, you speak
nothing at any time but what you think is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
for your turn. But whether it have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with that which elsewhere you have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
you make it not much your concernment to
enquire. But we shall quickly see whether you had


<pb n="478" facs="tcp:50044:216"/>
any just ground of encouragement to <hi>harness</hi> your
self, and to come up, as you speak, <hi>close to me</hi> in
this business or no. It may be before the close of
our Discourse you will begin to think it had been
as well for you to have persisted in your former
avoidance, as to make this profession of a <hi>close di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute;</hi>
and whatever you pretend to the contrary,
really you have done so. You <hi>hide</hi> the opinion and
practice of your Church about the <hi>Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
which you seem to be ashamed of, instead of
defending them; and <hi>except</hi> against some passages in
my <hi>Animadversions</hi> instead of <hi>answering</hi> the whole,
which you seem to pretend unto. I shall therefore
declare what is the <hi>true judgement</hi> of your Church
in this matter, and then vindicate the <hi>passages</hi> of
my Discourse which you take notice of in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
and under both heads declare the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your faith and practice in your Doctrine
about Images and Worship of them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctrine of your Church</hi> in this matter I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
we may be acquainted with from the <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of your Councils,</hi> the <hi>explication</hi> of your
most famous Doctors, the <hi>Practice</hi> of your people,
and the <hi>distinctions</hi> used by you to quit your selves
from Idolatry in your Doctrine and Practice. And
you will thereby learn, or may at lest to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it is for you to seek to palliate and <hi>hide</hi> the
deformity of that which your Mother and her
wise men have made naked to all the world.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Council of Trent</hi> is very wary in this matter,
as it was in most of its other affairs: and indeed
seeing it was resolved not to give place to the Truth,
it became it so to be, that it might keep any <hi>footing</hi>
in the minds of men, and not tumble headlong into
contempt and reproach. Many difficulties it had to


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:50044:216"/>
wrestle withal. It saw the <hi>practice</hi> of their Church
which was not totally to be deserted, least the great
mysterie of its <hi>Infallibility</hi> should be impaired, and
its nakedness laid open: the general complaint on
the other side of learned and sober men, that under
a pretence of <hi>Image Worship</hi> as horrible <hi>Idolatry</hi>
was brought into the Church of God, as ever was
practiced amongh the Heathen, did not a little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
it. It had also the <hi>various and contradictory
opinions</hi> of the great Doctors of your Church, and
Masters of your Faith about the <hi>kind of Worship</hi>
which is due to Images, all which had great follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ready to dispute endlesly in the maintenance of
their several conceits. Amidst these rocks and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
the <hi>Fathers</hi> found no way to sail safely,
but by the help of <hi>general and ambiguous words;</hi> a
course which in the like difficulties had frequently
before stood them in good stead. Wherefore they
so expressed themselves, that no <hi>party</hi> at variance
among them might think their opinions condemned,
that the general <hi>practice</hi> of their Church might be
countenanced, and yet no particular asserted that
was most obnoxious to the exceptions of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>
Thus then they speak, <hi>Imagines porro Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti,
Deiparae Virginis &amp; aliorum Sanctorum in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis
praeertim habendas &amp; retinendas; eis<expan>

honorem &amp; venerationem impertiendam, non quod
credatur—quoniam honos qui eis exhibetur refertur
ad Prototypa, quae illae representant;</hi> with much more
to that purpose. And we may observe, That the
<hi>Decree</hi> speaks only of the <hi>Images of Christ,</hi> the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin,</hi> and <hi>other Saints,</hi> not expresly mentioning
the <hi>Images of God the Father,</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of
the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> nor of <hi>Angels,</hi> which they knew to
be made, and to be had in veneration in their


<pb n="480" facs="tcp:50044:217"/>
Church, nor do they anywhere reject the use, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or worshipping of them. Yea in their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words they do plainly allow of the <hi>figuring of
the Deity. Quod,</hi> say they, <hi>si aliquando historias &amp;

cannot be denyed to be in them however, That <hi>the
unlearned people are to be taught, that the Deity is not
painted or figured, as though it could be seen or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by colours, but for some other end,</hi> as it seems
for their instruction; which indeed is honest and
fair dealing; for they plainly tell them that by their
<hi>pictures they teach them lyes;</hi> the <hi>language</hi> of the
Picture being, that God may be so pictured, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all your <hi>pictures</hi> and Images of God the Father as
an <hi>old man,</hi> of the Trinity as <hi>one person with three
faces,</hi> and the Holy Ghost as a <hi>Dove,</hi> are approved.
2. Religious Worship of Images is confirmed, <hi>due
honour and veneration or worship</hi> is to be given unto
them, saith the Council. Now it is not <hi>mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
they are discoursing about. There is no
such intercourse between their Images and them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
though sometimes civil salutations have
passed between them; Nor is it any token of <hi>Civil
Subjection,</hi> for Images have no eminency or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that kind; but it is <hi>divine or religious vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and worship which they affirm is to be assigned
unto them. 3. They say that <hi>due honour and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
that is religious, is to be assigned unto them;
but what in especial that honour and worship is, they
do not determine; whither it be the same that is


<pb n="481" facs="tcp:50044:217"/>
due to the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

think, or whether it be an honour of <hi>some
inferiour nature</hi> as others contend, <hi>pugnant ipsi ne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesq,</hi>
the <hi>Synod</hi> leaves them where it found them,
sufficiently at variance among themselves. 4. They
further assert the worship that is given by them to
Images to be <hi>religious</hi> or <hi>divine;</hi> in that they affirm
the honour done to the Image, is refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this be Jesus Christ himself; I suppose that they will
grant that all the <hi>honour</hi> we yield to him by any way
or means is <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>religious,</hi> and therefore so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that which they would have to be given
unto his <hi>Image,</hi> (that is a stock or stone which they
fancy so to be) must be so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>so. Now Sir, you may see
from hence, what it is that you are to speak unto and
to defend, or else to hold your peace in this matter.
And I shall yet make it a little more plain unto you.
Your <hi>Trent Council</hi> approves and commends the
<hi>second Council of Nice</hi> as that which taught and
confirmed that <hi>Doctrine and practice about Images,</hi>
and their Worship which your Church allows. I
shall therefore briefly let you know what was the
judgement of that Council, and what was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Practice confirmed in it, under many
<hi>dreadful Anathematisms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Second of Nice,</hi> or <hi>Pseudo-Synod of the Greeks,</hi>
as it is called by the <hi>Council of Frankford,</hi> whereunto
we are sent by the <hi>Tridentine Fathers</hi> to be instructed
in the <hi>due Worship of Images,</hi> was assembled by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Irene</hi> the Empress, a proud imperious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
&amp; her Son <hi>Constantine,</hi> whose eys she afterwards
put out, and thrust him into a Monastery in the year,
490. <hi>Tharasius</hi> was then <hi>Patriarch of Constantinoples</hi>
and <hi>Hadrian</hi> the first <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This


<pb n="482" facs="tcp:50044:218"/>
man most zealously or superstitiously addicted unto
the worship of Images, and that contrary to the
judgement of most of the <hi>Western Churches,</hi> as soon
afterwards appeared in the Council holden at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
by the Authority of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, had a
particular advantage both over the <hi>Empress</hi> and
the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Eastern Empire
being then greatly weakened by its own <hi>intestine
divisions,</hi> and pressed on all sides by the <hi>Saracens,</hi>
the Empress began to entertain some hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
from the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> whose power was
then grown very great: and to that end sollicited
a marriage for her Son with the daughter of <hi>Charls</hi>
the great; and supposed that she might be helped
therein by the mediation of <hi>Hadrian:</hi> the Bishops
of <hi>Rome</hi> having no small hand in the promotion of
the attempt of <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> the Great for the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards for the conquest
of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> And besides, she was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
her self <hi>zealously</hi> addicted to that kind of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
which <hi>Hadrian</hi> had espoused, as having in
the time of <hi>Leo</hi> her Husband kept her <hi>Images</hi> in
private, contrary unto what she had solemnly sworn
unto her Father, as <hi>Credenus</hi> relates in his Annals.
As for <hi>Tarasius,</hi> he was contrary to all <hi>Ecclesiastical
Canons,</hi> of a meer Lay-man at once <hi>per saltum</hi> made
<hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which <hi>Hadrian</hi> upon his
first hearing of, greatly exclaimed against, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to receive him into the society of <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
upon his sending of his significatory Epistle. This is
fully declared in the <hi>Epistle of Hadrian</hi> extant in the
<hi>Acts</hi> of the Council. But yet afterwards bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself how usefull this man might be unto his
design in getting the <hi>worship of Images</hi> established
in the <hi>East,</hi> he declares that if he will use means to


<pb n="483" facs="tcp:50044:218"/>
get the <hi>Heresie</hi> as he called it of the <hi>Image-opposers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated,
and their <hi>veneration</hi> established, he would
consent to his <hi>Election</hi> and Consecration, or else
not. Finding how the matter was like to go with
him, this <hi>Lay-Patriarch</hi> undertakes the work and
effectually prosecutes it in this Synod assembled at
<hi>Nice</hi> by the Authority of <hi>Irence</hi> the Empress and her
Son <hi>Constantine.</hi> But by the way, when the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
was assembled, he omitted not the opportunity
of improving his own interest, getting himself stiled
<hi>Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>Vniversal Patriarch,</hi> which <hi>Anastasius
Bibliothecarius</hi> in his dedication of his <hi>Translation</hi>
of the Acts of this Convention unto <hi>John</hi> the eighth,
bewayles, and ascribes it unto the <hi>flattery of the
Greeks.</hi> The frauds, forgeries and follies of this
Council, and ignorance and dotage of the Fathers
of it, have been sufficiently by others discovered.
Our present concernment is only to enquire,
First, <hi>What they taught</hi> concerning Image Worship:
and Secondly, <hi>How they proved</hi> what they taught,
seeing unto them we are sent by the <hi>Tridentine</hi>
Decree to be instructed in <hi>your faith</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>First,
They make the <hi>having</hi> and <hi>use of Images</hi> in
the Worship of God of indispensible necessity, so
that they <hi>anathematize</hi> and cast out of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, all that refuse to receive and
use them according to their prescript. Yea, they
proceed so far as in their approbation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of <hi>Theodosius the Bishop of Ammoria,</hi> as to
denounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against them that do but
doubt of their reception: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
so he closeth his Confession which
they all approve as Orthodox, <hi>Anathema to them


<pb n="484" facs="tcp:50044:219"/>
that are ambiguous or doubtful in their minds, and
do not confess with their hearts</hi> (ex animo) <hi>that
Sacred Images are to be worshipped;</hi> wherein they and
and you with them add <hi>Schism</hi> to their <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
casting out of the Churches those who offend nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor the determination of
any <hi>General Council</hi> of old; making the Rule of
your Communion to consist in a sorry piece of
Will-worship of your own invention; which dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the crime of your <hi>Superstition,</hi> and layes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
intanglement upon the Consciences of
men, which are perswaded from the Scripture,
that they shall be <hi>accursed</hi> of God if they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Images into his Worship, after the manner
of your prescription.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They affirm an hundred times over,
that <hi>Images are religiously to be adored and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi>
that is, with Divine Worship. So in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the same <hi>Theodosius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and so of the rest: <hi>I confess, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto, receive, embrace or salute, I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
or adore the Image of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
of the Blessed Virgin, and of the Apostles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres.</hi>
The same is affirmed in the Epistle of <hi>Hadrian</hi>
recited in the <hi>second Act</hi> of the Synod, which they
all approve; and afresh <hi>curse</hi> all them that <hi>dogmatize</hi>
or teach any thing against that worship of Images.
And <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> no small man amongst them,
affirms that he hoped by his Confession of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
he believed, he <hi>should obtain the forgiveness
of his sins,</hi> Act. 2. And <hi>John</hi> who falsly pretended
himself to be delegated from the <hi>Oriental Patriarchs,</hi>
when he was sent only by a few ignorant Monks
of <hi>Palestine,</hi> prefers Images above the Word its


<pb n="485" facs="tcp:50044:219"/>
self, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>an Image
is greater then the word;</hi> and again <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>honourable Images are
equivalent to the Gospel.</hi> And they prove the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they intend to be divine by their wise explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Text, <hi>The Lord thy God shalt thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and him only shalt thou serve,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>Vnto the
Word Thou shalt serve, only is subjoyned, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the word Worship; so that it is lawfull to worship
(Images) but not to serve them.</hi> A wise business!
but it discovers sufficiently what is the worship
which they ascribe unto Images, even <hi>the same that
is given unto God;</hi> for if we may believe them,
<hi>other things</hi> are not excluded from Communion
with God in this matter of worship and adoration.
Whence the <hi>Council of Frankeford</hi> doth expresly
charge them, that they taught that <hi>Images were to
be adored with the honour due to God, Act.</hi> 4. And
so much weight do they lay upon this <hi>devotion</hi> that
they approve the Councel given by <hi>Theodorus the
Abbot</hi> unto the <hi>Monk</hi> whom the Devil vexed with
temptations for worshipping the Image of Christ,
who told him that <hi>he had better resort to all the
Stews in the Town, then cease worshipping of Christ

<hi>it seems it was
uncleaness</hi> that the Devil tempted him unto, as well
knowing that Spiritual and Corporal fornication
commonly go together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In every <hi>Session</hi> they instance in some
particulars wherein the Adoration of Images which
they professed did consist; as in particular in <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
saluting</hi> of them, <hi>kissing of them, bowing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="486" facs="tcp:50044:220"/>
them,</hi> and so adoring of them. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their words are very express. Now all these
were ever esteemed <hi>tokens,</hi> pledges and expressions
of <hi>Religious or Divine Worship,</hi> and were the very
wayes whereby the <hi>Heathen of old</hi> expressed their
veneration of their Images and Idols. <hi>Job</hi> intimating
the way whereby they worshipped the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi>
and <hi>host of Heaven,</hi> which crimes he denyes himself
to be guilty of, tells us, <hi>that when he considered the
Sun and the Moon, his heart did not seduce him that
he should put his hand to his mouth,</hi> that is to salute
them; for this, saith he, <hi>had been to deny God above,</hi>
Job 31. 26, 27. As <hi>Catullus,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Constiteram Solem exorientem sorte salutans,</l>
                     <l>Cum subito à laeva Roscius exoritur.</l>
                  </q>
He stood <hi>saluting,</hi> or worshipping the rising Sun.
And that also was their meaning in <hi>kissing</hi> of them,
or <hi>kissing</hi> their hands in saluting of them, Hos. 13. 2.
<hi>Let them kiss the Calves,</hi> that is worship them; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their religious adoration of them by that
outward sign. As <hi>Cicero</hi> in Ver. 4. <hi>Herculis simulacrum
non solum venerari, sed etiam osculari soliti fuerunt.</hi>
So <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> tells us, that his companion
<hi>Caecilius</hi> coming where the Image of <hi>Serapis</hi> was set
up, <hi>admovit manum ori &amp; osculum labris pressit,
put his hand to his mouth and kissed it,</hi> as worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of it. And for <hi>creeping, kneeling,</hi> or <hi>bowing,</hi>
it is so certain an evidence of Divine Worship,
that all Worship both false and Idolatrous or true,
is oftentimes expressed thereby. So the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of <hi>Baal,</hi> is called <hi>bowing the knee to Baal.</hi> They
that bowed the knee unto him or his Image, in their
so doing worshipped him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4.
And where God promiseth to bring all Nations to


<pb n="487" facs="tcp:50044:220"/>
the worship of himself he sayes, <hi>they shall bow the
knee to him,</hi> Rom. 14. 11. So that these are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> and they are all <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed</hi>
over and over by the <hi>Council,</hi> who do not by
these means express their worship of Images. This
is the Doctrine, this is the practice which the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine</hi>
decree aprroves of, and sends us to learn of
the <hi>second Synod of Nice.</hi> And this they express in
most places, in those very termes, that were used by
the <hi>Pagans</hi> in the worship of their <hi>Idols,</hi> making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no distinction, but that whereas the <hi>Pagans</hi>
worshipped the images of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> and
the like, they in the like manner worshipped the
<hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles. And therefore
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Catholick Spaniards took away
the <hi>Zemes</hi> or Images of their Idols, that the poor
natives had before, and gave them the Images of
Christ and his Mother in their stead.</p>
               <p>This being the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> it may not
be amiss to consider a little how they <hi>proved</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it. Two things they principally insisted on.
1. <hi>Testimonies of Scripture.</hi> 2. <hi>Miracles.</hi> Some
sayings also they produced out of some antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Church, but all of them either perverted
or forged. The Scriptures they insisted on were all
of them gathered togethered in the <hi>Epistle of Pope
Hadrian,</hi> which was solemnly assented unto by the
whole Council. And they were they these. <hi>God made man
of the dust of the Earth after his own Image,</hi> Gen. 1.
Abel <hi>by his own choise offered a Sacrifice unto God of
the first lings of his flock,</hi> Gen. 4. Adam <hi>of his own
mind called all the beasts of the field by their proper
names,</hi> Gen. 2. Noah <hi>of his own accord built an altar
unto the Lord,</hi> Gen. 8. Abraham <hi>of his own free will
erected an altar to the Glory of God,</hi> Gen. 11. Jacob


<pb n="488" facs="tcp:50044:221"/>
                  <hi>having seen in his sleep seen the Angels of God ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and descending by the ladder, set up the stone on
which his head lay for a pillar,</hi> Gen. 28. And again, <hi>he
worshipped on the top of his staffe,</hi> Gen. 29. Moses <hi>made
the brasen Serpent, and the Cherubims;</hi> Esaiah, saith
<hi>in those dayes there shall be an Altar unto the Lord, and
it shall be for a sign and a Testimony,</hi> Chap. 19. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<hi>the Psalmist</hi> sayes, <hi>Confession and beauty are before
him; and again, Lord I have loved the beauty of thine
house. And again, Thy face Lord will I seek,</hi> Psal. 26,
<hi>And again, The rich among the people shall bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before thy face,</hi> Psal. 44. <hi>And again, The light
of thy Countenance is signed or lifted up upon us,</hi>
Psal. 4. <hi>Si hoc non sit testimoniorum satis, ego nescio
quid sit satis:</hi> he must be very refractory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a world of <hi>Anathematismes</hi> that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by all these testimonies, that <hi>Images ought</hi> to
be worshiped. But, <hi>quod non dant proceres, dabit
Histrio;</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi> will not do it, <hi>Miracles</hi>
shall: Of these we have an endless number heaped up
by the good fathers to prove their Doctrine, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their practice. The worst is that <hi>Tharasius</hi> almost
spoiles the <hi>market,</hi> by acknowledging that the <hi>images
in their dayes</hi> would work none of the miracles they
talked of, so that they had them all upon hearesay,
Act. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<hi>But if any should say, Why do our images work no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
to them we answer, because as the Apostles saith
Signes are for unbelievers, not for them that believe.</hi>
And yet the misadventure of it is, that the most of the
<hi>Miracles</hi> which they report and build their faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were wrought as by so amongst their chiefest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
And what were the Miracles themselves


<pb n="489" facs="tcp:50044:221"/>
they boasted of? such a heap of trash, such a fardle
of lyes, as the like were scarce ever heaped together,
unless it were in the <hi>Golden Legend. Hadrian</hi> insists
on the <hi>leprosie</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> as loud a
lye as any in the <hi>Talmud</hi> or <hi>Alcoran, Theodorus</hi> of
<hi>Myra,</hi> tells us of a Deacon that <hi>dreamed he saw one
in his sleep whom he took to be St.</hi> Nicholas, Ac. 4.
Another tells us a tale of one that <hi>strock a nail in
the forehead of an image, and was troubled with a pain
in his head untill it was pulled out.</hi> Another dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>that the blessed Virgin, brought</hi> Cosma <hi>and</hi> Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
<hi>to him and commanded them to cure him of his
distemper;</hi> One mans <hi>daughter,</hi> anothers <hi>wife,</hi> is
helped by those images. And they all consent in
the story of the image of Christ made without
hands, or humane help by God alone, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
that he sent to <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of the <hi>Edessenes;</hi> as
bellowing a lye as any in the heard. So true was it,
that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Franckeford</hi> affirmed of this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Conventicle, that they endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their <hi>superstition</hi> by feigned wonders and <hi>old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives</hi>
tales.</p>
               <p>Sir, This is the Doctrine, this the Confirmation
of it, which we are directed unto, and enjoyned to
embrace by your <hi>Tridentine decree.</hi> This is that,
yea and more also, as you will hear by and by, that
you are bound to <hi>maintain</hi> and make good, if you
intend to say any thing to the purpose about <hi>figures</hi>
or Images; For you must not think by your <hi>sleight
florishes</hi> to blind the eyes of men in these dayes as
you have done formerly. Own your Doctrine and
practice, or renounce it; This Tergiversation is
shameful; and you will yet find your self farther
pressed with the doctrine of Chiefest pallars of your
Church, and the publick practice of it. For though


<pb n="490" facs="tcp:50044:222"/>
this <hi>superstitious Conventicle</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> departed from
the faith of the antient Church, and was quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
and convinced of folly by persons of more
<hi>learning, sobriety</hi> and modesty then themselves in the
very age wherein they lived, yet it rose not up unto
the <hi>half</hi> of the Abominations, in the filth and guilt
whereof your Church hath since rolled it self. And
yet because I presume you are well pleased with these
<hi>Nicenians,</hi> who gave so great a list to the setting up of
your <hi>Idols,</hi> I shall give you a brief account, both what
was the judgement and practice of them that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in this matter, as also of some that followed
after them, with joynt consent detesting your folly
and superstition. You tell us somewhere in your
<hi>Fiat,</hi> that the Primitive Christians had the <hi>picture</hi> or
half portraiture of Christ upon their Altars. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you did not invent it your self; I wish you had
told us of the Legend that suggested it unto you.
For you seem in point of story to be conversant in
such <hi>learned Authors,</hi> as few can trace you in. If you
please to have a little patience, I shall mind you of
some that give us another account of things in those
dayes.</p>
               <p>1. Some there are, of the first Christians, who
give us an account of the <hi>whole worship of God</hi> with
the manner and form of it, which was observed in
their Assemblies in their dayes. So doth <hi>Justin
Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Apologies, Tertullian</hi> in his, <hi>Origen</hi>
against <hi>Celsus</hi> with some others. Now in none of
these, is there any one word concerning <hi>Images,</hi>
their use, or their <hi>worship</hi> in the service of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they descend to describe very <hi>minute particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
and circumstances of their way and proceeding.</p>
               <p>2. Some there are, who give an account of the
persecutious of <hi>several Churches,</hi> with the out-rages of


<pb n="491" facs="tcp:50044:222"/>
the <hi>Pagans</hi> against their Assemblies, the Scriptures,
all the ordinances and worship, as do those <hi>golden
fragments</hi> of the first and best Antiquity, the <hi>Epistles</hi>
of the Churches of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Lions,</hi> to the parishes
of <hi>Asia,</hi> of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> about the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome
of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> preserved and recorded by
<hi>Eusebius;</hi> and yet make no mention of any <hi>figures,</hi>
pictures, or Images of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> or
his Apostles, or of any <hi>rage</hi> of their adversaries against
them, or of any <hi>spite</hi> done unto them, which they
would not have omitted, had there been any such in
use amongst them.</p>
               <p>3. There are besides these some unquestionable
remnants of the conceptions that the <hi>Wisest</hi> and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berest
of the <hi>heathen</hi> had concerning the Christians
and their worship: as in the Epistle of <hi>Pliny</hi> about
their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and the rescript of <hi>Trajan,</hi> as also
in <hi>Lucian Philopatris;</hi> in none of which is any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Nicene Images or their Adoration.
It may be you will undervalue this consideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
built upon testimony <hi>negatively,</hi> when it doth
not follow, that because such and such mentioned
them not, therefore they were not then in use or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But Sir, an Argument taken from the <hi>absolute
silence</hi> of all approved Authors, concerning any
thing of importance, supposed to be or happen
in their dayes, and who would have had just occasion
to make mention of it, had any such thing then been
in <hi>rerum naturâ,</hi> is as great an evidence, and of as
full a certainty, as the <hi>monuments</hi> of times are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of. Is it possible for any <hi>rational man</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that if there had been such an <hi>use</hi> and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Images in the primitive Churches as is now
in the <hi>Roman,</hi> or that the reception and veneration
of them was made the <hi>tessara</hi> of Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="492" facs="tcp:50044:223"/>
as it is by the (<hi>Nicene Conventicle,</hi> that all the
first Writers of Christianity treating expresly and
purposely of the <hi>Assemblies of the Christians</hi> and the
worship of God in them, with the manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
thereof, would have been <hi>utterly silent</hi>
of them; or that those who set down and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to record all the particularities of the <hi>Pagans
rage</hi> in scattering their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> would not drop
one word of any indignity shewed to any of their
<hi>sacred images,</hi> when they pass not by their wrath
against their <hi>houses,</hi> goods and cattel? Such things
are fond to imagine.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Many</hi> of the Antients, do note it as an <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
in some of the <hi>first Hereticks,</hi> that they had
introduced the <hi>use of Images</hi> into their worship,
with the adoration of them. <hi>Theodoret. haeret. sub.
lib.</hi> 1. tells us, that <hi>Simon Magus gave his own image
and that of</hi> Selene to be worshistped by his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
And <hi>Iraeneus, Lib. 1. cap.</hi> 23. that the followers
of <hi>Basilides</hi> used images and invocations: and
<hi>cap.</hi> 24. that the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> had images both painted
ones and carved, and that of Christ, which they said
was made originally by <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and this
they adored. And so doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> also, <hi>Tom. 2.
lib. 1. Haer. 27. Carpocrates</hi> procured the images of
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to be made and adored them: and
the like is recorded of others. Now do you think
they would have observed and reproved this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
as an <hi>abomination</hi> in the <hi>haereticks,</hi> if there had
been any thing in the <hi>Churches usage</hi> that might
give countenance thereunto? or at least that they
would not have distinguished between <hi>that abuse of
images,</hi> which they condemned in the hereticks, and
that <hi>use</hi> which was retained and approved among
themselves. But they are <hi>utterly silent,</hi> as unto any


<pb n="493" facs="tcp:50044:223"/>
such matter, contenting themselves to report and
reprove the superstition and idolatry of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
in their <hi>Adoration</hi> of them. But this is
not all.</p>
               <p>3. They positively deny that they had <hi>any images</hi>
or made any use of them, and defend themselves
against the <hi>charge of the Pagans</hi> against them for
professing an <hi>imageless</hi> Religion. <hi>Clemen. Alexand.
Strom, Lib.</hi> 6. plainly and openly confesseth and
testifieth, that <hi>Christians had no Images in the world.</hi>
And in his <hi>Adhortat. ad Gent. he positively asserts</hi> that
the arts of Painting and Carving as to any <hi>religious</hi>
use were forbidden to Christians, and that in the
worship of God they had no <hi>sensible image</hi> made of
any sensible matter, because they worshipped God
with understanding. What was the judgement of
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> is known from his book <hi>de Idololatria,</hi> from
whence if we should transcribe what is <hi>argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
against image worship,</hi> very little would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.
But of all the Antients <hi>Origen</hi> doth most
clearly manifest what was the <hi>doctrine</hi> and practice of
the Church of God in his dayes; as in other places,
so in his seventh book against <hi>Celsus</hi> he directly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
this matter: <hi>Celsus</hi> charged the Christians, that
they made use of no <hi>images in the worship of God,</hi>
telling them that therein they were like the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Scythians, Numidans</hi> and <hi>Seres,</hi> all which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
nations hated all images, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do at
this day. To which discourse of his, <hi>Origen</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
answer, grants that the Christians <hi>had no images</hi>
in their sacred worship, no more then had the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi>
nations mentioned by <hi>Celsus;</hi> but withall
adds the difference that was between those and these;
and tells you, that their <hi>abstinence</hi> from <hi>Image worship</hi>
was on various accounts. And after he hath shewed


<pb n="494" facs="tcp:50044:224"/>
wherefore those Nations received them not, he adds
<hi>that Christians and Jews abstained from all sacred use
of Images because of Gods command. Thou shalt fear</hi>
(as he reads the text) <hi>the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve;</hi> and thou <hi>shalt not make to thy self
any graven image, nor the likeness of any thing that is
in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, and adds,</hi> that
they were so far from praying to the images as the
Pagans did, that saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a
thing expresly commanded in the <hi>Nicene Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
we do not give any honour at all to Images,</hi> least
<hi>we should give countenance to the error of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that there were somewhat of Divinity in them;</hi>
with very much more to the same purpose, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
condemning all the use of Images in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, and openly testifying that there was
no such usage among the Christians in those dayes
heard of in the world. <hi>Arnobius</hi> or <hi>Minutius Faelix</hi>
acknowledgeth the same; <hi>Cruces nec colimus nec
optamus, we do no more worship Crosses then desire them,</hi>
and grants that Christians had <hi>nulla note simulachra,</hi>
because no image could be made to or of him whom
alone they worshipped. What was the judgement
of the <hi>Elibertine Council</hi> I have before told you.
<hi>Lactantius</hi> in his <hi>Institut. ad Constant. lib.</hi> 2. by an
happy anticipation, answers <hi>all the arguments</hi> that
you <hi>use to</hi> this day, in defence of your image wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and concludes peremptorily, that <hi>where there
are any Images, there is no Religion;</hi> shewing how
perverse a thing it is that the image of <hi>a dead man</hi>
should be worshipped by a <hi>living image</hi> of God.
The time would fail me to relate the words of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
Athanasius, Hilarius, Ambrosius, Cyrillus,
Chrysostome, Epiphanius, Hierom, Austin,</hi> and
others to the same purpose. I cannot but think that


<pb n="495" facs="tcp:50044:224"/>
it is fully evident to any one that consults <hi>antiquity,</hi>
that the image use and worship, which is become the
<hi>Tessera</hi> of your Church Communion, by your
espousing the <hi>Canons</hi> and Determinations of the
<hi>second Nycene Synod,</hi> was in part utterly unknown
unto, and in part expresly condemned by the whole
Primitive Church for 600. <hi>years</hi> after Christ; and
that you have plainly by your <hi>Tridentine decree</hi> and
<hi>Nicene Anathematismes</hi> cut off your selves from the
Communion of the Catholick Church of Christ,
and all particular Assemblies that worship him in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
for the space of some hundreds of years in
the world.</p>
               <p>Thus things went in the Church of God before
your <hi>Nicene Convention.</hi> How did they succeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards?
did image worship presently <hi>prevail</hi> upon
their determinations? or was that then the faith of
the generality of the Church of Christ, which was
declared by the <hi>fathers</hi> of that Convention? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less; no sooner was the rumor of this <hi>horrible
innovation</hi> in Christian Religion spread abroad in the
world, but that upon it there was a full assembly of
300. <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Western Provinces assembled at
<hi>Franckeford</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein the <hi>superstition</hi>
and folly of the <hi>Nicene Assembly</hi> was layed open,
their Arguments confuted, their determinations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and image worship absolutely condemned,
as forbidden by the word of God, and contrary to
the Antient constant known practice of the whole
Church of God.</p>
               <p>And now Sir as I said you may begin to see what
you have to do, if you intend to speak any thing to
the purpose concerning your <hi>figures</hi> and Images.
You must take the Decree of your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi>
and the <hi>Nicene Canons</hi> therein confirmed, and


<pb n="496" facs="tcp:50044:225"/>
prove, confirm, and vindicate them from the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
made to them by <hi>Tertullian, Arnobius, Origen,
Lactantius,</hi> the <hi>Synod of Franckeford</hi> and others of
the Antients innumerable by whom they are rejected
and condemned; and yet when you have done so, if
you are able so to do, your work is not one quarter
at an end. You can make nothing of this <hi>business</hi>
untill you have confuted or burned the <hi>Scripture</hi> it
self, wherein your <hi>Images making</hi> and <hi>Image worship</hi>
is as fully condemned as it is possible any superstition
or Idolatry should be. Your present <hi>loose discourses,</hi>
whereby you endeavour to possess the minds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
men, that you do not do that which indeed
you do every day, and which almost all the world
know that you do, and which you curse others for
not doing, will not with considering persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
at all unto your advantage.</p>
               <p>2. That you may the better also discern what is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent</hi>
on you, and expected from you the next time
you talk of <hi>figures,</hi> I shall make bold to mind you
of what is the Doctrine of the chief <hi>Masters</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors
of your Church, from whence certainly we
may better learn what the Doctrine and practice of
it is, then from <hi>one</hi> who discovers enough in what he
sayes and writes, to keep us from laying any great
weight on his authority. Now I confess that you
do in this, as in sundry other points of your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
give us an egregious <hi>specimen</hi> of that <hi>consent</hi>
and unity among your selves which you so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

own imaginations, agree well enough, that <hi>Images
are religiously to be worshipped.</hi> Worshipped religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
they are to be, but whither <hi>per se</hi> and <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
directly</hi> and <hi>ultimately,</hi> whither with the <hi>same
kind</hi> of worship wherewith that is to be worshipped
which they represent, they are not so fully agreed as
might be desired in a matter of this importance.
For it is justly to be feared that whilest your <hi>Doctors</hi>
are wrangling, your people are committing as gross
Idolatry as any of the Heathen were guilty of. In
the mean time, the most prevalent Opinion of your
Doctors is that of <hi>Thomas</hi> and his followers, that
<hi>images are to be adored with the same kind of
worship wherewith that which they represent is to be
worshipped.</hi> And therefore whereas the Lord Christ
is to be worshipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> that which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
in your judgement to <hi>God</hi> alone, it follows saith
he, that his <hi>image</hi> is to be worshipped with the same
worship also. And as some of your learned men
do boast, that this indeed is the only approved opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in this matter in your Church; so the truth is, if
you will speak <hi>congruously</hi> and at any <hi>consistency</hi> with
your selves it must be so. For whereas you lay the
foundation of all your worship of them, be it of
what fort it will, in that <hi>figment,</hi> that the honour
which is done to the image redounds unto him
whose image it is, if the honour done to the <hi>image</hi>


                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:50044:226"/>
be of an inferior sort and kind unto that which is
due unto the <hi>exemplar</hi> of it by referring that honour
thereunto, you debase and dishonour it, by ascribing
<hi>less</hi> unto it then is its due. If then you intend to
answer just expectation in this matter, the next
time you speak of <hi>figures</hi> pray consider what your
<hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth as the Doctrine of your Church,
3. <hi>p. q. 25. ae.</hi> 3. which <hi>Azorius</hi> sayes is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
judgement of Divines, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. As also
the exposition of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Decree by <hi>Suarez
Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>d.</hi> 54. §. 4. <hi>Vasquez, Costerus, Bellarmine</hi>
and others. And</p>
               <p>3. You may do well to consider the practice and
usage of your <hi>Catholick people</hi> all the world over,
especially in those places where you have preserved
them from being <hi>disturbed</hi> in their Devotion, by
the Arguments and exceptions of Protestants, as also
the direction that is given them for the exercise of
their Devotion in that prescription of <hi>Rites</hi> and
<hi>prayers</hi> which is afforded unto them. Is not your
<hi>bowing, kneeling, creeping, kissing, offering, singing,
praying</hi> to the Cross and images notorious? yea
your placing your trust and confidence in them;
Yea, have you omitted any of the abominations of
the heathen, that you have not acted over again to
provoke the Lord to anger? And</p>
               <p>4. Do you think to relieve them from the guilt
of <hi>Idolatry</hi> by a company of distinctions, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they nor you understand? The next time you
see one of your <hi>Catholicks</hi> worshipping an image
upon his knees, I pray go to him and tell him that
he must worship the Image with <hi>dulia,</hi> or <hi>superdulia,</hi>
but not with <hi>latria,</hi> or if with <hi>latria,</hi> yet not by
<hi>its self</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> but after <hi>a sort, analogically</hi> and
<hi>reductively,</hi> or that he is about a double worship;


<pb n="499" facs="tcp:50044:226"/>
one terminated in the image, and the other passing
by it unto the examplar of it, and you will find
what thanks he will give you for your good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And how small a portion are these of that <hi>Mass</hi>
of distinctions which you have coyned to free them
from Idolatry who worship Images, who all the while
understand not one word of what you intend by
them, nor can any rational man reduce them unto
any thing intelligible!</p>
               <p>Sir, In this matter of <hi>images</hi> you talk of <hi>coming
up close to your business,</hi> and I was willing to take a
little pains with you to direct you in your way, that
having a mind to your work as you seem to pretend,
you may not mistake and wander away from your
duty, but address your self unto that which you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
and which is expected from you. You are
to prove that there is <hi>a necessity of receiving the use of
images</hi> in the worship of the Church, so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth not admit them, is to be cast out of the
Communion thereof; and 2. That these Images so
received are to <hi>be worshipped and adored</hi> with religious
veneration, if not with the very same worship that
is due to the Persons represented by them, yet with
that which redounds unto them; and that not only
by the <hi>outward gesture</hi> of the body but the inward
motions of the mind. And when you shall have
proved that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and practice of your
Church in this matter of <hi>making</hi> and <hi>worshipping
Images</hi> is not contrary to the Scripture, or was ever
received or approved by the primitive Church for
six hundred years, I will promise you setting aside
all other Considerations, immediately to become a
<hi>Papist:</hi> for the present I see no cause so to do, and
shall therefore return to consider what you here say
for the further <hi>adorning</hi> of your pictures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:50044:227"/>
The first thing you reflect upon is my censure of
that passage in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> that <hi>the sight of Images in
the Church is apt to cast the minds of men on that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Apostle,</hi> Heb. 12. <hi>You are come to mount
Sion, to the City of the living God, to the Heavenly</hi>
Hierusalem, <hi>the Society of Angels, and Church of the
first born written in heaven, to God the judge of all, to
the spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of the new Covenant.</hi> These, I tell you, upon
the sight of an <hi>House full of Images</hi> may be the
thoughts of a man distracted of his wits, not of any
that are sober and wise. To which you reply, <hi>mad
men it seems can tell what figures represent, sober
and wise men cannot.</hi> But who told you that your
images <hi>represent</hi> the things mentioned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle?
for instance, <hi>God the Judge of all, the spirits of
just men, Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Church of the first born;</hi> or
can any man unless he be greatly distempered in his
imagination, fancy any such thing. The <hi>house of
Micah,</hi> Judg. 18. was notably furnished with <hi>Images</hi>
of all sorts. Judg. 17. he had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>an house
full of Gods,</hi> or a Chappel adorned with Images,
for there was in it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>

                  </gap>

                  </gap> a <hi>molten statue,</hi> Judg. 18. would
it not think you, notwithstanding the <hi>gaiety</hi> of all
this provision, have bee a <hi>mad thought</hi> in the <hi>Danites</hi>
if upon their entrance into this house, they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
themselves to be come to the <hi>Communion
of the Catholick Church,</hi> and therein to the <hi>invisible
God,</hi> to <hi>Angels and Saints departed?</hi> The truth is,
there is <hi>aliquid dementiae,</hi> a tincture of madness in
all <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whence the Scripture testifies that men
are <hi>mad upon their Idols,</hi> but yet we do not find that
these <hi>Danites</hi> though resolved upon false worship,


<pb n="501" facs="tcp:50044:227"/>
were so <hi>mad</hi> as to entertain such vain thoughts as
you imagine the <hi>Chappel full of images</hi> might have
suggested unto them. Or do you think <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had
any such thoughts, when God shewed him in vision
the <hi>imagery</hi> of the house of <hi>Israel</hi> with all the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
portrayed on the wall, and the elders worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
before them? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. God and the Prophet
discover other thoughts in reference unto them.
Besides Sir, the Holy Ghost tells us that a <hi>graven
image is a teacher of Lyes,</hi> Hab. 2. 18. and how like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is, that a man should learn any <hi>truth</hi> from that
whose work it is only to <hi>teach lyes,</hi> I do not as yet
understand.</p>
               <p>You proceed to another exception; <hi>the violation
of an image</hi> say you, <hi>redounds to the Prototype if it be
rightly and duely represented, not else.</hi> To which you
reply, and, <hi>when then for example is Christ crucified
rightly and duly represented? are you one of those that
can tell what figures represent or not?</hi> 1. You do
not rightly report my words, though you might as
easily have done it as set down those you have made
use of. My words were, <hi>that the violation of an
Image redounds to the Prototype, provided it be an
Image rightly and duely destined to represent him, that
is intended to be injured;</hi> which is so cleared by an
instance there expressed, as turns your exception out
of doors as altogether useless. For first, I require
that the <hi>Image be rightly and duly destined to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the Prototype;</hi> that is, by him or by
them who have power so to do, and by the express
consent and will of <hi>him</hi> whose image it is, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is not concerned in it. Now nothing of all
this can you affirm concerning your <hi>Images.</hi> 2. I
require an <hi>intention</hi> of <hi>doing injury</hi> or contumely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Person represented by the image, without


<pb n="502" facs="tcp:50044:228"/>
which whatever is done to the <hi>image</hi> reflects not at
all upon him; And so a man may <hi>break an Image</hi> of
a King which he finds formed <hi>against his will</hi> in some
<hi>ugly shape</hi> to expose him to contempt and scorn, as
I suppose out of <hi>Loyalty</hi> unto him, without the least
violation of his honour, which is the very condition
of your Images and those that reject them. And
this also may suffice to what you add about hanging
of <hi>Traitors in Effigie,</hi> which is a particular instance
of your general Assertion that the violation of an
Image redounds to the Prototype; which we grant
it doth when the Image is rightly designed to that
purpose by them who have just authority so to do,
and when there is an <hi>intention</hi> of casting contempt
upon it; the first whereof is not found amongst
your Images, nor the latter among them who reject
them.</p>
               <p>Besides if all that were granted you which you
express, yet what you aime at would not ensue. For
though it should be supposed that the <hi>violation</hi> of an
Image would redound unto the injury of the <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi>
upon a meer intention of reflecting upon him,
without which it is a foolish conceit to apprehend
any such thing, yet it doth not thence follow that the
<hi>honour</hi> done to an Image redounds unto him that is
represented by it, provided that the intention of
them that give the honour be so to do: For besides
our <hi>intention</hi> in the worship of God, we have a <hi>rule</hi>
to attend unto, without the observation whereof
the other will stand us in little stead. And if this
might be admitted, the <hi>grossest Idolatry</hi> that ever was
in the world might easily be excused. That for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the <hi>Israelites</hi> setting up a golden Calf,
and worshipping it, must needs be esteemed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
seeing they thought to give honour to <hi>Jehovah</hi>


                  <pb n="503" facs="tcp:50044:228"/>
thereby. When the things mentioned then are
wanting, <hi>Images</hi> may be dealt withal as false money,
which his Majesty causeth every day to be <hi>broken,</hi>
though it have his own Image and superscription up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, because <hi>stamped</hi> without his warrant.</p>
               <p>You proceed and add as my words, <hi>where the
Psalmist complains of Gods enemies breaking down
his Sculptures, he means not thereby any Images or
figures, but only wainscot or carved Ceilings.</hi> Would
you could find in your heart <hi>rightly</hi> to report my
words. The reason is evident why you do not,
namely because then you had not been able to make
any pretence of a <hi>reply</hi> unto them; But yet this ought
not to have <hi>prevailed</hi> with you to persist in such
unhandsome dealing. My words are, <hi>The Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
indeed complains that they broke down the
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or carved works in the Walls and Ceilings
of the Temple</hi> (though the Greeks render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>her doors,</hi> the Verb signifying prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to open) <hi>but that those</hi> apertiones <hi>or</hi> inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surae
<hi>were not Pictures and Images for the people to
adore and venerate, or appointed for their instruction you
may learn.</hi> You see Sir, I grant that the Word
<hi>may denote carved works:</hi> and if so, I think
they must be either in the <hi>walls</hi> or <hi>ceiling;</hi> that
which only I deny was, that these <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or
<hi>carved works</hi> were proposed to the people to be
<hi>adored</hi> or <hi>venerated.</hi> This you should have confuted,
or held your peace. But you take another course;
having <hi>misreported</hi> my words to gain some counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
thereby unto what you had to except against
them, you add, <hi>Surely the Prophet wanted a word
then to express himself, or Translators to express the
Prophet: If we must guess at his meaning without
heeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is words, one might think it as probable that


<pb n="504" facs="tcp:50044:229"/>
the House of God was adorned with Sculptures of
Cherubims and other Angels to represent his true house
that is above, as with the Circles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of wainscot.</hi>
Sir, the Prophet wanted not a word rightly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his meaning and intention; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is originally
<hi>aperire,</hi> to <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>solvere</hi> to <hi>loose,</hi> and because <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings</hi>
are made by opening the matter <hi>engraved</hi>

engraving,</hi> the word here used by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the effect of what is affirmed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 7.
and elsewhere. And this is well enough expressed
by <hi>sundry Translators;</hi> and you speak very faintly
when you talk of the <hi>guessing at the Psalmists</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the Temples being adorned with <hi>engraven
Cherubims,</hi> as though you knew not certainly that
it was so, or as though it were a thing at all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable.
Sir, the Text is express for it, both in
the <hi>Kings, Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel;</hi> neither was it
ever called in question; but withall the same places
inform us that there was as many <hi>Palm trees</hi> as
<hi>Cherubims,</hi> and those attended with <hi>flowers</hi> and
<hi>Pomegranats;</hi> And the <hi>Cherubims</hi> in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> vision
had each one <hi>two faces,</hi> the one of a <hi>man,</hi> the other
of a <hi>young Lion,</hi> the one face looking towards <hi>one
Palm tree,</hi> the <hi>other towards another;</hi> all which we
grant were used for ornament in that wonderfull
and magnificent Structure; but so to imagine that
they were proposed to the people to adore and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
is a little <hi>flowing,</hi> if not <hi>foaming</hi> of the <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
we lately discoursed of. That <hi>Cherubims</hi> were
not Images, I shall shew you by and by. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be informed of you, what <hi>Palm tree</hi> and <hi>flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
or <hi>Angels</hi> with two faces, one of a man, another


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:50044:229"/>
of a Lyon, you think there are in heaven, that you
should suppose them represented by these <hi>below?</hi>
you may easily discern how well you have evinced
the conclusion manifested before, to expect some
proof at your hands, by faintly intimating that the
<hi>walls</hi> of the Temple were engraven with <hi>Cherubims,
Palm trees and flowers,</hi> and therefore doubtless
he that will not <hi>worship Images</hi> deserves to be <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You
add nextly as my words, <hi>The eye may not
have her species as well as the ear, because God hath
commanded the one, and not the other.</hi> You know
full well that you do not express my words, nor
meaning as you ought. But I shall now cease to
expect <hi>better dealing</hi> from you, and make the best
that I may of what you are pleased to set down.
Speaking in general, I do not, nor did deny that the
<hi>eye</hi> might have its <hi>use</hi> and the <hi>species</hi> of it to help
and further our <hi>faith</hi> and devotion in the worship of
God. It hath so in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> by him insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted;
but I tell you it can have no use to these ends
in things which God hath <hi>forbidden,</hi> as he hath
done <hi>the making of Images</hi> for religious adoration.
But you say, <hi>Fiat Lux makes it appear that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
both, and the natue of man requireth both, nor
can I give any reason why I may not look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon him
who was crucified, as well as hear him.</hi> Pray Sir
talk not of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> making it appear. The design
of <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> is rather to <hi>hide</hi> then to make any thing
<hi>appear;</hi> and you might have done well to direct us
unto that place in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> where you fancied that
you had made it <hi>appear</hi> that God commands that <hi>use
of Images</hi> in his worship which you plead for; and as
for what the <hi>nature of man requireth</hi> we suppose
God knows as well at least as the Pope, and is as


<pb n="506" facs="tcp:50044:230"/>
careful to make <hi>suitable provision</hi> for its relief and
help in the duties he calls us to the performance of.
And it is an easie thing to give you a <hi>reason</hi> why you
may not <hi>look</hi> on him that was crucified, that is with
your <hi>bodily eyes,</hi> as well as hear him by the preaching
of the word, and it is because you cannot. You
your self tell us, when you think it for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that <hi>Christ as to his humane nature is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi>
and <hi>that</hi> is it I think you intend. Now how
you will <hi>look</hi> with your <hi>bodily eyes</hi> on that which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you and us is at present invisible, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
I know that one of the <hi>great Fathers</hi> of
your <hi>second Nicene</hi> faith, publickly affirmed in the
Council with the approbation of his Associates, that
<hi>Christ</hi> is so present with, or related unto his <hi>Image,</hi>
that he should speak of it and should say, <hi>this
is Christ,</hi> should not err. But I know also he did it
with as much <hi>wisdom</hi> as he whom the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides
for carving a stock into the likeness of a man,
and then saying unto it, <hi>Thou art my God.</hi> So Sir
you <hi>may not</hi> with <hi>your bodily</hi> eyes look on him that
was crucified because you cannot; and as looking
on the <hi>picture</hi> of him, which you mean, is nothing
of that which we contend about: so I fear it is
unto you only a <hi>means</hi> of taking you from looking
after his <hi>Person</hi> in a way of <hi>believing</hi> which he so
earnestly calls us unto.</p>
               <p>Your next progress is to some words of mine
about the <hi>end of preaching,</hi> which you set down:
<hi>Nor is the sole end of preaching as</hi> Fiat Lux <hi>would
have it, only to move the mind of hearers unto corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding
affections; whereas</hi> indeed they are; <hi>he is
mistaken if he think the sole end of preaching the
Cross and death of Christ, is to work out such repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
to the mind, as Oratory may affect for the


<pb n="507" facs="tcp:50044:230"/>
moving of Corresponding affections:</hi> which if you
know not to differ very much from what you have
expressed, I wish you would let these matters
alone, and talk of what you understand. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
your <hi>reply</hi> unto what you are pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
is such a piece of <hi>ridiculous Scurrility,</hi> as I
shall not stain paper with a recital of. In <hi>summ,</hi>
you deny there is any other <hi>end of preaching,</hi> and
excuse your self that you thought not of those
other ends, which you suppose I might have in my
heart, but yet conceal; and then instance in such a
<hi>rabblement</hi> of foolish wicked fancies, as I wonder
how your thoughts came to be conversant about.
As to the thing its self I must tell you Sir, whither you
are willing to hear it or no, that if you know no
other <hi>end of preaching</hi> the Cross and death of Christ,
but meerly to work upon the minds of men, so as
to <hi>stir</hi> up their Affections, that you are a <hi>Person bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skilled</hi> in the <hi>Mass book</hi> then the Gospel, and
much fitter to be employed <hi>in sacrificing</hi> according
to the Order of that, then in <hi>preaching</hi> of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
and Doctrine of this. Did never any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, that <hi>one end</hi> of preaching the word was
to <hi>regenerate the whole souls of men,</hi> and to beget
them anew unto God? that it was also <hi>to open their
eyes,</hi> and to illuminate them with the saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in Christ, that it was to <hi>beget and
encrease faith in them;</hi> that it was to be a means
of their <hi>growth</hi> in Grace, and in the knowledge of
God; that the Word preached is <hi>profitable</hi> for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
Correction, Dotrine</hi> and <hi>instruction in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi>
that it is appointed as the great means of
working the souls of men into a <hi>likeness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
unto the Lord Jesus, or the changing of
them into his Image; that it is appointed for the


<pb n="508" facs="tcp:50044:231"/>
                  <hi>refreshment of the weary,</hi> and consolation of the
sorrowful, and making wise of the simple? Did
you never hear that the word <hi>preached</hi> hath its
effect upon the <hi>understanding</hi> and <hi>will</hi> as well as
upon the <hi>Affections,</hi> and upon these <hi>consequentially</hi>
only unto its efficacy on them, if they are not
deluded? Is <hi>growth</hi> in knowledge, faith, grace,
holiness, conformity unto Christ, Communion with
God, for which end the word is commanded to be
preached, nothing at all with you? is being <hi>made
wise</hi> in the mysterie of the Love of God in Christ,
to have <hi>an insight</hi> into, and some understanding
of the unsearchable treasures of his Grace, and
by all this the <hi>building up of souls</hi> in their most
holy faith, of no value with you? Are you a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
unto these things, and yet think your self a
<hi>meet person</hi> to perswade your <hi>Countreymen</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Religion they have long professed, and to
follow you they know not whither? Or do you
know them, and yet dare to thrust in your <hi>scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility</hi>
to their exclusion? Plainly Sir, the most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
judgement that I can make of this Discourse
of yours, is that it proceeds from <hi>ignorance</hi> of the
most important truths and most necessary works of
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>You next proceed to your plea from the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi>
set up by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Holy place over the Ark;
and thence you will needs wrest an argument for
your <hi>Images</hi> and the worship of them. Although
your <hi>Vasquez</hi> is ashamed of it, and hath cashiered
it long ago, and that worthily, as not at all belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto thus matter: For 1. The <hi>Cherubims</hi> were
not <hi>Images,</hi> to which you say, <hi>since the real Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims
are not made of beaten Gold, those set up by</hi>
Moses <hi>must be only figures;</hi> but it is of <hi>Images</hi> that


<pb n="509" facs="tcp:50044:231"/>
we are speaking precisely, and not in general of
<hi>figures; figures</hi> may include <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi>
and any representation of things. <hi>Images</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Persons,</hi> and such alone are those about which
we treat. And if a <hi>Person</hi> be not presented by an
<hi>Image,</hi> it is not his Image. Now I pray tell me
what <hi>personal subsistences</hi> these Cherubims with
their various wings and faces did represent? Do
you believe that they give you the <hi>shape</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Angels? It is true, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bishop of Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica</hi>
in your <hi>Synod of Nice</hi> with the approbation
of the rest of his company, affirms that it was the
opinion of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> that Angels and
Archangels were not altogether <hi>incorporeal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
but to have a slender body, of ayre or fire,
Act.</hi> 5. But are you of the same mind? or do you
not rather think that the Catholick Church was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
and abused by the Synod? And if they are
absolutely <hi>incorporeal</hi> and invisible, how can an
Image be made of them? Should a man look on the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> as <hi>Images</hi> of Angels, would not the first
thing they would teach him be a <hi>ley?</hi> namely that
Angels are like unto them, which is the first lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of any Image whatever. The truth is, the
<hi>Mosaical Cherubims</hi> were meer <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> to
represent the constant tender love and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God over the <hi>Ark</hi> of his Covenant, and the
people that kept it, and had nothing of the nature
of Images in them. 2. I say, suppose of them what
you please, yet they were not set up to be <hi>adored,</hi> as
your Images are; To which you reply, <hi>It is not to
my purpose or yours that they were not set up to be
adored; for Images in Catholick Churches are not
set up for any such purpose, nor do I anywhere say
so. No man alive hath any such thought, no Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="510" facs="tcp:50044:232"/>
no Council hath delivered it, no practice infers
it.</hi> And do you think meet to talk at this rate?
have you no <hi>Tradition</hi> amongst you that you plead
for the <hi>Adoration of Images?</hi> hath no Council amongst
you determined it? doth not your practice speak it?
were you awake when you wrote these things? did
you never read your <hi>Tridentine Decree,</hi> or the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Canons</hi> commended by them? is not the <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Images asserted an hundred times expresly in
it? hath no man alive such thoughts? are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> but <hi>Bellarmine, Gregory
de Valentia, Baronius, Suarez, Vasquez, Azorius,</hi> with
all the rest of your great Champions now utterly
defeated, and have not one man left to be of their
judgement? I would be glad to hear more of this
matter. Speak plainly, do you renounce all <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and worship of Images? is that the Doctrine of
your Church? prove it so, and I shall publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my self to have been a long time in a
very great mistake. But it was for this cause that
I gave you a <hi>little Image</hi> of the Doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of your Church in this matter, at the entrance
of our discourse, foreseeing how you would preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
in our progress. Come Sir, if <hi>Image Worship</hi>
be such a shameful thing that you dare not avow it,
deal ingenuously and acknowledge the failings of
your Church in this matter, and labour to bring
her to amendment. If you think otherwise, and in
truth yet <hi>like it well enough,</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> can look for at your hands. You
mention somewhat of the different opinions of
your <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in this matter, which you sleight.
But Sir, I tell you again, that you and all your Masters
are agreed that Images are to be <hi>adored</hi> and <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>


                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:50044:233"/>
that is, worshipped; and their disputes about
that <hi>honour</hi> that rests <hi>absolutely</hi> on the Image, and
that which passeth on to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> with the kind
of the one and the other, are such as neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor any other do understand. You tell us
indeed, <hi>All Catholick Councils and practice, declare
such sacred figures to be expedient assistants to our
thoughts in our divine meditations and prayers, and
that is all you know of it.</hi> But if you intend Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and practice truly Catholick or Primitive, you
can give no instance of allowing so much to <hi>Images</hi>
as here you ascribe unto them; no <hi>not one</hi> Council
can you produce to that purpose for some hundreds
of years, but a constant current of Testimonies for
the rejection of such pretend expediencies and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances.
The first beginning of their use arising
from Heathens, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> declares <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 18.
But if you intend your <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Councils
and Practice, your Assertion is as devoid of Truth
as any thing you can possibly utter. What kind of
<hi>Assistance</hi> in devotion these your sacred <hi>Figures</hi> do
yield, we shall anon consider.</p>
               <p>It is added in the <hi>Animadversions</hi> that it was <hi>God
who appointed these Cherubims to be made, and placed
where they were never seen of the people, and that his
special dispensation of a Law constitutes no general rule;
so he commanded his people to spoil the Aegyptians,
though he forbid all men to steal.</hi> This was said on
<hi>supposition</hi> that they were Images or adored, both
which I shewed to be false. And it is the answer
given by <hi>Tertullian;</hi> When he was pleading against
all <hi>making up of pictures</hi> which we do not. Now
do you produce Gods special command for the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
use and <hi>veneration</hi> of your Images, and this
contest will soon be at an end. But whereas God


<pb n="512" facs="tcp:50044:234"/>
who commanded these <hi>Cherubims</hi> to be made, hath
severely <hi>interdicted the making of Images,</hi> as to any
use in his worship unto us, what conclusion you can
hence draw I see not. To this you reply in a large
discourse wherein are many things <hi>Atheological.</hi> I
shall briefly pass through what you say. Thus then
you begin, <hi>We must know, you as well as I, that God
who forbids men to steal, did not then command to steal
as you say he did, when he bad his People spoil the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians
under the species of a loan. Malum omen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
You stumble at the threshold. Did I say that God
<hi>commanded men to steal? porrige frontem;</hi> the words
of the <hi>Animadversions</hi> lay before you when you
wrote this, and you could not but know that you
wrote that which was not <hi>true.</hi> This <hi>immorality</hi>
doth not become any man of what Religion soever
he be. <hi>Stealing</hi> denotes the <hi>pravity</hi> of taking that
which is another mans. This God neither doth
nor can command; for the taking of that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
belonged unto another, is not <hi>stealing</hi> if God
command it; for the reason which your self have
stumbled on, as we shall see afterwards. The <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi>
were <hi>spoyled</hi> by Gods Command, but the
<hi>People</hi> did not steal; for his Command who is the
Soveraign Lord of all things the great possessor of
Heaven and earth, <hi>dispenced</hi> with his Law of one
mans taking that which before belonged unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to that particular whereunto his Command
extended, in reference whereunto <hi>stealing</hi> or the
pravity of that act of alienation consists, and so it is
in other Cases. It is <hi>murder</hi> for a Father to slay his
Son. Neither can God command a man to <hi>murder</hi>
his Son: and yet he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to slay
his. To so little purpose is your following attempt
to prove that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did not <hi>steal,</hi> and that


<pb n="513" facs="tcp:50044:234"/>
God did not command them to steal, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou
<hi>fancied</hi> or rather <hi>feigned</hi> to be asserted in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions,
that you might make a pretence of
saying something; so that it had been much better
to have passed over this whole matter with your
<hi>wonted silence,</hi> which relieves you against the things
which you despair of returning a <hi>reply</hi> unto. You
say, the <hi>Hebrews might have right to those few goods
they took in satisfaction for their long oppression, and
it may be their own allowance was not paid them.</hi> But
this right whatever it may be pretended, was only
<hi>ad rem,</hi> a general equity, which they had no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to put in execution by any particular instance:
And therefore you add Secondly, <hi>Because it is a
thing of danger that any servant should be allowed
to right himself by putting his hand to his Masters
Goods, though his Case of wrong be never so clear;
therefore did the Command of God intervene to justifie
their action.</hi> But why do you call this a thing of
<hi>danger only?</hi> is it not of more then <hi>danger,</hi> even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<hi>sinfull?</hi> Then is a thing morally <hi>dangerous</hi>
when there <hi>may</hi> be sin in it, not when unavoidably
there <hi>is;</hi> then indeed there is danger of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or rather certainty of it without repentance;
but we do not say then there is danger of sinning.
It may be you do it to comply with your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists,</hi>
who have determined that in some Cases it
is lawful for a servant himself to make up his
wrongs out of his Masters Goods, which caused
your friends some trouble as you know in the Case
of <hi>John de Alva.</hi> You proceed and insist upon the
Command of God proceeding from his <hi>Soveraignty
and Lordship over all, warranting the Hebrews to take
the Aegyptians goods and so spoil them, and that
rightly.</hi> But this say you, <hi>can no way be applyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="514" facs="tcp:50044:235"/>
Images: nor could God command the Hebrews to
make any Images, if he bad absolutely forbidden to
have any at all made.</hi> Sir, This is not our Case,
God forbad the Hebrews to make any images, so
as to <hi>bow down</hi> to them, in a way of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and yet might command them to make <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical
representations</hi> of his care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to set them up where they might not be
worshipped. But let us suppose that you speak

what you say: <hi>For this,</hi> say you, <hi>concerns not any

which had its foundation in the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:</hi>
and yet I suppose you will grant that
God hath altered it, changed it, and taken it away.
So excellent is your Rule as to <hi>all</hi> the precepts of
the first Table, which indeed holds only in the <hi>first</hi>
Command. Things that <hi>naturally</hi> and necessarily
belong to the dependance of the rational creature on
God as the first Cause, last End, and Supreme Lord
of all, are absolutely indispensable, which are in
general all comprized as to their nature in the first
precept, wherein we are commanded to receive him
alone as our God, and consequently to yield him
that obedience of <hi>faith, love, honour,</hi> which is due to
him as God: but the outward <hi>modes</hi> and wayes of
expressing and testifying that subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="516" facs="tcp:50044:236"/>
which we owe unto him, depending on his <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
institution,</hi> are changeable, dispensable and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be varied at his pleasure, which they were
at several seasons, before the last hand was put to
the Revelation of his will by his Son. And then
though God did absolutely <hi>forbid</hi> his <hi>people</hi> the
making of images as to any use of them in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Service, he might by particular exception
have made some himself; or appointed them to be
made, and have designed them to what use he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
from whence it would not follow in the least,
that they who were to <hi>regulate</hi> their obedience by his
command, and not by that instance of his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
exception unto his institution, might set up any
<hi>other</hi> images for the same end and purpose, no more
then they might set up other Altars for Sacrifice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that appointed by him, when he had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they should not do so. Supposing then that
which is not true, and which you can give no colour
of proof to, namely that the <hi>Cherubims were Images
properly so called,</hi> and set up by Gods command to
be adored, Yet they were no less still under the force
of his prohibition against the <hi>making of Images,</hi> then
if he had never appointed any to be made at all. It
was no more <hi>free</hi> for them to do so, then it is for you
now under the New Testament to make <hi>five</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
more of your own heads, because he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>two.</hi> So unhappy are you in the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your own supposition, which yet as I have
shewed you, is by no means to be granted. And this
is the substance of your plea for this practice and
usage of your Church, which whether it will justifie
you in your <hi>open transgression</hi> of so many express
Commands that lye against you in this matter, the
day that shall discover all things will manifest.</p>

You proceed to the vindication of another pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> from the <hi>Animadversions</hi> upon it,
with as little success as the former you have attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.
<hi>Fiat Lux</hi> sayes, <hi>God forbad forreign Images,
such as</hi> Moloch, Dagon, <hi>and</hi> Astaroth, <hi>but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his own</hi> (Sir, <hi>Moloch</hi> and <hi>Astaroth</hi> were not
Images properly so called, whatever may be said of
<hi>Dagon;</hi> the one was the <hi>Sun,</hi> the other the <hi>hoast of
Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi>) but the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
say that God forbad any likeness of himself
to be made; they do so, and what say you to the
contrary! why, <hi>You may know and consider, that the
Statues and graven Images of the Heathen, towards
whose land Israel then in the wilderness was journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were ever made by the Pagans to represent God
and not any devils, although they were deluded in it.</hi>
But 1. Your good friends will give you little
thanks for this concession, whose strongest plea to
vindicate themselves and you from Idolatry in your
image worship is, that the Images of the Heathen
were not made to represent <hi>God,</hi> but that an <hi>Idol</hi>
was really and absolutely nothing. 2. God did not
forbid the people in particular the making Images
unto <hi>Molock, Dagon</hi> or <hi>Astaroth,</hi> but prohibits the
worshipping of the <hi>Idols</hi> themselves in any way;
but he forbids the making of any <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of himself</hi> in the first place, and of all other
things to worship them. But what of all this?
why then say you, <hi>there was good reason that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews
who should be cautioned from such snares, should
be forbidden to make to themselves any similitude or
likeness of God.</hi> Well then they were so forbidden,
this is that which the <hi>Animadversions</hi> affirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> denyed, affirming that they

grant that God forbad the making of any similitude
or likeness of himself; the reason of it we shall
not much dispute, whilest the thing is confessed;
though I must inform you, that himself insists upon
another, and not that which you suggest, which you
will find if you will but peruse the places I formerly
directed you unto. But say you, <hi>what figure or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
the true God had allowed his people, that let
them hold and use untill the fulness of time should
come, when the figure of his substance, the splendor of
his glory and only image of his nature should appear;
and now since God hath been pleased to shew us his face,
pray give Christians leave to keep and honour it.</hi> I
presume you know not, that your discourse is <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical</hi>
and <hi>Atheological,</hi> and I shall therefore give
you a little light into your mistakes. 1. What do
you mean by <hi>figure or similitude</hi> that the true God
had allowed his people? Was it any figure or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of himself, not of <hi>Moloch</hi> which you were
speaking of immediately before, and which your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words interpret your meaning of, where you
affirm that in the <hi>fulness of time</hi> he hath given us the
<hi>image of himself?</hi> have you not <hi>denyed</hi> it in the
words last mentioned? have you no regard how
you jumble <hi>contradictions</hi> together, so you may make
a shew of saying something? Do you intend <hi>any
other</hi> likeness or similitude? why then do you deal
<hi>sophistically</hi> in using the same expression to denote
diverse things? 2. It is <hi>Atheological</hi> that you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<hi>Inartificial</hi> argument or Testimony you use none in

                  </gap>. And hereby you may
also discern what is to be judged of your defence of
what you had affirmed in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> namely <hi>that
we had a command, that we should have Images, and a
command that we should not have Images;</hi> which I
never imagined that you would put upon a various
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ection of the Text, and thought it sufficient to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
your failing, to intimate unto you the express
preciseness of the prohibition, with which your <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
command</hi> for Images is wholly inconsistent. God
hath strictly forbidden us to make <hi>any Image</hi> either
of himself or of any other person or thing to <hi>adore</hi>


                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:50044:238"/>
or <hi>worship</hi> it, or to put it unto any use purely religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
This is an everlasting Rule of our Obedience.
His <hi>own making of Cherubims</hi> and placing them in the
most holy place whilest the <hi>Judaical Oeconomy</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
gives us no dispensation as to the obedience
which we owe to that Command and rule, whereby
we must be judged at the last day.</p>
               <p>Your last exception is layed against what I affirmed
concerning the <hi>Relation</hi> you fancy between the
<hi>Image</hi> and its <hi>prototype,</hi> whereby you would excuse
the honour and worship which you give unto it,
which I said is a meer <hi>effect of your own imagination.</hi>
To which you reply, <hi>that speaking of a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
or relation and not of the efficient cause of
it, you cannot but wander at this illogical Assertion.</hi>
But sir, this your <hi>formal representation</hi> or relation
which you fancy, must have an <hi>efficient cause,</hi> and
hath so; a <hi>real</hi> one, if it be <hi>real;</hi> an <hi>imaginary</hi> one
if it be <hi>fictitious,</hi> and this I enquired after; and I
think it is not <hi>illogical</hi> to affirm that the relation you
pretend is <hi>fictitious</hi> because it hath no cause but
your <hi>own imagination</hi> on which alone it depends. A
divine institution constituting such a <hi>relation</hi> you
have none, nor doth it ensue on the nature of the
thing it self. For the <hi>carving of a stock</hi> into the
likeness of a man, gives it no such relation to this
or that individual man, as that which is done unto
the one should have any respect unto the other.
But you add; <hi>Is the picture made by the spectators
imagination to represent this or that thing, or the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
rather guided to it by the picture? By this
Rule of yours the image of</hi> Caesar, <hi>did not my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
help it, would no more represent a man then a mouse.</hi>
But you quite mistake the matter; the <hi>relation</hi> you
fancy includes two things; first that this <hi>Image</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents


<pb n="521" facs="tcp:50044:238"/>
not a man in general, but <hi>this</hi> or that <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual</hi>
man in particular, and that exclusively to all
others; for instance; <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and not <hi>Simon
Magus,</hi> who was a man no less then he or any other
man whatever. Now though herein the <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
may be assisted when it hath any certain grounds
of discerning a particular likeness in an image unto
<hi>one man</hi> when he was living more then to another,
yet you in most of your <hi>images</hi> are destitute of any
such assistance. You know not at all that your
images represent any <hi>thing peculiar</hi> in the persons
whereof you pretend them to be the images, which
sufficiently appears by the varity that is in the images
whereby you represent the same Person, even Christ
himself in several places. So that though <hi>every man
in his right wits</hi> may conceive, that an Image is the
<hi>image of a man and not of a mouse,</hi> yet that it should
be the image of this or that man, of Christ himself;
or <hi>Peter,</hi> he hath no ground to imagine, but what is
suggested unto him by his <hi>imagination,</hi> directed by
the circumstances of its place and Title. When <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
had thrust <hi>Cicero</hi> into banishment to do him the
greater spite, he demolished his house, and dedicated
it as a <hi>devoted</hi> place to their Gods, setting up in it
the image of the Goddess <hi>Libertas.</hi> The <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his return in his <hi>Oration ad Pontifices</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his house to overthrow this pretended
<hi>dedication</hi> and devotion of it, pleads two things,
first that the Image pretended by <hi>Clodius</hi> to be the
Image of <hi>Libertas,</hi> was indeed the Image of a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>
or rather <hi>infamous whore</hi> that lived at <hi>Tanager;</hi>
had this dedication passed, I wonder how this Image
could have any relation unto <hi>Libertas,</hi> but by vertue
of the <hi>imagination</hi> of its worshippers when in very
deed it was the Image of a <hi>Tangraean whore;</hi> And


<pb n="522" facs="tcp:50044:239"/>
the <hi>same Orator</hi> tells us of a <hi>famous Painter</hi> who
making the picture of <hi>Venus</hi> and her Companions for
their Temples; still drew them by <hi>some Strumpet</hi> or
other that he kept company withall. And whither
you have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> been so imposed upon sometimes or no,
I very much question. In which <hi>Case</hi> nothing but
your <hi>imagination</hi> can free you from the worship of
a <hi>quean,</hi> when you aime your devotion another way;
Again he pleads, that the <hi>dedication of that Image</hi>
was not regularly religious, nor according to that
institution which they esteemed <hi>Divine;</hi> whence
no sacredness in it could ensue; and want of <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which may be so esteemed, is that also which
we object against your <hi>dedication</hi> of Images. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a relation to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Individual person,
which as I have shewed, the most of <hi>your Images</hi> have
not, but what in <hi>your fancy</hi> you give unto them,
which is natural or Civil; you fancy also <hi>a religious
relation,</hi> a sacred conjuction between the Image and
Prototype, so that the worship yielded to the one
should redound to the other in a religious way. And
this, I say, is also the product of your own fancy. If
it be not, I pray, will you assign some other cause of
it: for to tell you the truth, excluding <hi>divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
which you have not, other I can think or none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And if you could pretend <hi>Divine Institution</hi> consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
a sacred relation, between Images and their
prototypes, yet it would not presently follow, that
they were to be worshipped, no not supposing the
<hi>Prototypes</hi> themselves to be the proper objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
adoration, which as to the most of them you
know we deny, unless you have also a <hi>Command</hi> to
warrant you. For there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

was not to be represented with <hi>images</hi> of Gold and
Silver, or carved stones. Neither doth God leave us
under this <hi>interdiction</hi> as proceeding from his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority, but frequently also shews the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness</hi>
of his will, by asserting the <hi>Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
of his nature, and minding us that in the
great manifestation of his glory unto the people,
they saw <hi>no manner of likeness or similitude,</hi> which
should have been shewed unto them had he been by
any <hi>sensible means</hi> or matter to be represented. And
yet, Sir, all this will not deter you from making
<hi>Images</hi> and various <hi>Pictures</hi> of God himself and the
blessed Trinity. Indeed you say you do not do it
to represent the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of the Invisible
God, but only some <hi>divine manifestations of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
or presence,</hi> so that those images are only
<hi>metaphorical.</hi> But you venture too boldly on the
Commands of God with your <hi>cobweb distinctions;</hi>
nor do you difference your selves hereby from
the more <hi>sober Heathen,</hi> who openly professed that
in their many names and <hi>images</hi> of God they had no

Of this you say, that it hath <hi>some colour of Plausibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but because I neither do nor will understand the
Customes of that Church which I am so eager to oppose,
all my words are but wind. Answ.</hi> No such thing as
<hi>plausibility</hi> was aimed at in any part of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
It was the <hi>Promotion</hi> or defence of <hi>Truth</hi>
which was designed throughout the whole, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else. For <hi>that,</hi> are all things to be done, and
nothing against it. What you are able to <hi>except</hi>
against in that discourse, will speedily appear. In the

to oppose</hi> either you or your Church; so you will


<pb n="527" facs="tcp:50044:241"/>
let the <hi>Truth</hi> alone, I shall for ever let you alone,
without opposition. It was the defence of <hi>that,</hi>
and not an opposition to <hi>you</hi> that I was engaged in.
In the same design do I still persist, in the <hi>vindication</hi>
of what I had formerly written, and shall assure you
that you shall never be <hi>opposed</hi> by me, but only so far,
and <hi>wherein</hi> I am fully convinced that you oppose the
Truth. Manifest that to be on your side, and I shall
be ready to embrace both you and it. For I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<hi>free</hi> from all respects unto things in this
world, that should or might retard me in so doing.
But that I may hereafter speak somewhat more to
the purpose in <hi>opposition</hi> unto you, or else give my
<hi>consent</hi> with understanding unto what you teach,
pray inform me how I may come to the knowledge
of the <hi>customs of your Church,</hi> which you say, <hi>I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

coming unto any acquaintance with them. For I

For the present, I shall declare you my apprehension
as to that <hi>Custome</hi> of your Church as you call it,
which we have now under consideration, and desire
your <hi>charity</hi> in my direction, if I understand it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
aright. It is your <hi>Custome</hi> to keep the Scriptures
from the people in an <hi>unknown tongue;</hi> somewhat
contrary to this your former custome, in this last age
you have made some <hi>Translations</hi> out of a <hi>Translation</hi>


                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:50044:242"/>
and that none of the best, the use whereof you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to very few, by virtue of <hi>special dispensation,</hi>
pleading that the use of it in the Church among the
body of its members is useless and dangerous. Again
it is the <hi>Custome</hi> of your Church to celebrate all its
publick worship in <hi>Latine,</hi> whereof the generality of
your people understand nothing at all, and you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the exercise of your Church worship in a <hi>vulgar
tongue</hi> understood by the Community of your Church
or people. These I apprehend to be the Customes of
your Church, and to the best of my understanding
they are directly contrary, (1.) To the <hi>End of God</hi>
in granting unto his Church the inestimable benefit
of his Work and worship; and (2.) To the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
of God given unto all to read, meditate and

who inforceth his prohibition with many cogent
reasons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. And (6.) <hi>Contrary to the express
practice</hi> of the primitive Church both Judaical and
Christian, all whose worship was performed in the
same language wherein the People were instructed by
preaching and exhortations which I presume you will
think it necessary they should well understand; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(7.) <hi>Brought into use gradually and occasionally</hi>

<hi>Languages</hi> wherein the Scripture was first written


<pb n="529" facs="tcp:50044:242"/>
and whereinto for the use of the whole Church it
had been of old translated, as the Old Testament
into <hi>Greek,</hi> and the whole into <hi>Latine,</hi> through the
Tumults and Wars that fell out in the world, became
corrupted, or were extirpated. And (8) <hi>A means
of turning the worship of Christ</hi> from a rational way
of strengthening faith and increasing Holiness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a dumb <hi>histrionical</hi> shew exciting brutish and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
affections; and (9) Were the great cause
of that <hi>darkness and ignorance</hi> which spread its self
in former dayes over the whole face of your Church,
and yet continueth in a great measure so to do.
And in summ are as great an Instance of the power
of <hi>inveterate prejudices</hi> and carnal interests against
the light of the Truth as I think was ever given in
the world.</p>
               <p>These are my apprehensions concerning the
<hi>Customs of your Church</hi> in this matter, with their
nature and tendency. I shall now try whither you
who blame my <hi>misunderstanding</hi> of them, can give
me any better information, or Reason for the change
of my thoughts concerning them. But <hi>Carbones

               <p>You are accused to have <hi>robbed</hi> the Church of the

in the worship of God, and when you should
produce your defensitive, you make a fine Discourse


<pb n="530" facs="tcp:50044:243"/>
quite to other purposes. Such as it is, we must pass
through it.</p>
               <p>First you say, <hi>I have heard many grave Protestant
Divines ingenuously acknowledge that divine Comfort
and Sanctity of life requisite unto Salvation, which
Religion aymes at, may with more perfection and less
inconvenience be attained by the Customs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church then that of ours. For Religion is not to
fit perching upon the lips, but to be got by heart, it
consists not in reading but doing, and in this, not in that,
lives the substance of it, which is soon and easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed.
Christ our Lord drew a Compendium of all
divine Truths in two words, which our great Apostle
again abridged into one.</hi> Ans. (1.) I hope you will
give me leave a little to suspend my <hi>assent</hi> unto what
you affirm. Not that I question your <hi>veracity</hi> as to
the matter of fact related by you, that <hi>some Persons</hi>
have told you what you say, but I suppose you are
mistaken in them. For whereas the Gospel is the
<hi>Doctrine of Truth according unto Godliness,</hi> and the
<hi>promotion</hi> of Holiness and Consolation (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at all be promoted but in wayes and by means
of Gods appointment) is the next end of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
they can be no <hi>Protestant Divines</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this end to be better attainable in <hi>your way,</hi>
then their <hi>own;</hi> because such an acknowledgement
would be a <hi>vertual renunciation</hi> of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
The <hi>judgement</hi> of this Church, and all the
reall <hi>grave Divines</hi> of it, is perfectly against you,
and should you condescend unto them in other
things, would not <hi>embrace your communion,</hi> whilest
you impose upon them a necessity of Celebrating
the worship of God in a <hi>tongue unknown</hi> unto them,
amongst whom and for whose s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke, it is publickly
celebrated. The reasons you subjoyn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession


<pb n="531" facs="tcp:50044:243"/>
you mention, I presume are your own, they
are like to many others that you make use of. The
best sense of the entrance of your words that I can
make, is in that description they afford us of the
worship of your Church as to the peoples concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it. The <hi>words</hi> of it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it <hi>perching upon
your lips,</hi> as on the tongue of a Parrot, or it may be,
may be <hi>got by heart,</hi> or as we say <hi>without Book,</hi> when
the sense of them affects not your minds nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
at all. If in these vain loose expressions
you design any thing else, it seems to be an oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between reading and studying the Scriptures, or
<hi>joyning with understanding</hi> in the prayers of the
Church, the things under Consideration, and
the getting of the <hi>power of the word</hi> of God to <hi>dwell
in the heart;</hi> which is <hi>skilfully</hi> to oppose the means
and the end, and those placed in that relation not
only by their <hi>natural aptitude,</hi> but also by Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
appointment and command. So wisely also
do you oppose <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> in general; as
though <hi>reading</hi> were not <hi>doing,</hi> and a part of that
obedience which God requires at our hands, and a
blessed means of helping and furthering us in the
remainder of it. For certainly that we may <hi>do the
will of God,</hi> it is required that we <hi>know</hi> it. And
what better way there is to come to the knowledge
of the will of God then by <hi>reading</hi> and me litating
in and upon the word of Truth wherein he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
it, with the advantage of the other means of
his appointment for the same end in the publick
preaching or proposition of it, I am not as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
And I wish you had acquainted us with
those <hi>two words</hi> of our Saviour, and that <hi>one</hi> of the
Apostle, wherein they give us a <hi>Compendius of all
Divine Truths.</hi> For if it be so, I am perswaded


<pb n="532" facs="tcp:50044:244"/>
you will be to seek for your warrant in imposing
your <hi>long Creeds,</hi> and almost <hi>Volumes</hi> of Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be believed as such. But you cannot avoid
mistakes in things that you might <hi>omit</hi> as not at all
to your purpose. Our Saviour indeed gives us the
<hi>two general heads</hi> of those duties of Obedience
which are required at our hands towards God and
our Neighbours; and the Apostle shews the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it to consist in Love, with its due exercise;
but where in <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three words</hi> they give us the
<hi>Compendium of all Divine Truths</hi> which we are to
believe, that we may acceptably perform the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
that in general they describe, we are yet to
seek, and shall be so, for any information you are
able to give us.</p>
               <p>In your following Discourse you make a <hi>florish</hi>
with what your Church hath in <hi>Gospels, Epistles,
Good books, Anniversary observations,</hi> and I know
not what besides. But Sir, we discourse not about
what you <hi>have,</hi> but what you <hi>have not,</hi> nor will have
though God <hi>command</hi> you to have it, and threaten
you for not having it. You <hi>have not the Scripture</hi>
ordinarily in a language that they can understand,
who if they are the <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> are bound to
read, study, and meditate in it continually; which
are therefore hindred by you in the discharge of
their duty, whilest you <hi>neither enter into the Kingdom
of heaven your selves, nor suffer them that would.</hi>

things done or to be done in publick Assemblies)
but are left to have their <hi>brutish</hi> affections led

entreated by God and man to make use of them;
yea where great and populous nations under your
power, have <hi>humbly petitioned</hi> you that by your
leave and permission they might enjoy the Bible, and
that Service of God which they could understand,
you have chosen rather to run all things into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion

Questions, and Cases, and Theological discourses are
treated, that vulgar people can neither understand, nor
are at all concerned to know. And I pray you tell me
ingenuously and without heat, what more of Good could
acrew to any by the translated letter of a book, whereof
I will be bold to say that nine parts in ten concern not
my particular either to know or practice, then by the
conceived substance of Gods will unto me, and my own
duty towards him.</hi> Sir, I shall deal with you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

and practice? If you know not of any thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to <hi>promote Salvation,</hi> but what you reckon up in
the usage of your Church, hinder not them that do.
It is not so much your own practice, as your <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

Is it possible that a man professing himself a <hi>Divine,</hi> a

to relinquish the way of Religion wherein they are

<hi>received it,</hi> and the greatest number of them

<hi>make</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> them such, by detaining from them
the means of knowledge, and who perish for the

are excepted from his dispensations of Light and
Grace. 3. To whom, and for whose instruction
were those <hi>Epistles of Paul written?</hi> Were they
not to the Churches of those dayes? to all <hi>that were
at</hi> Rome <hi>called to be holy. ch.</hi> 1. 7. and <hi>to the Church
of God that was at</hi> Corinth <hi>sanctified in Christ Jesus,</hi>
1 Cor. 1. 2. with all <hi>that everywhere call on his name.</hi>
And why I pray may not the <hi>Churches of these dayes</hi>
be concerned to know the things that the Spirit of
God thought meet to instruct the former Churches
in? Are Believers now grown unconcerned in the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> in the law and Gospel, of Sin and Grace,
of Justification, Sanctification, Adoption, the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Faith, and duties of Holiness, which S. <hi>Paul</hi>
reveals and declares in his Epistles? What would
you make of them? or what would you make of
the <hi>Apostle</hi> to write things for the standing use of
the Church, wherein so few were like to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?
Or do you think that there are but <hi>few
things</hi> in the Scripture wherein the souls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are concerned, and that all the rest are left for
<hi>learned</hi> men to dispute and wrangle about?</p>
               <p>But you say, there are <hi>particular Cases in them,
that belonged it may be only to them unto whom their
resolution was directed.</hi> But are you such a stranger
in the <hi>Israel of the Church,</hi> as not to know that in the
same Cases, or others of a very neer allyance unto
them determinable by the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Rules delivered
in them, the Consciences of your <hi>vulgar people</hi> are still
concerned? 4. Those <hi>Epistles of Paul</hi> wherein you
instance, were written by <hi>divine Inspiration,</hi> and given
out by the direction of the Holy Ghost for the use
of the Church of God in all Ages; This I suppose
you will not deny. If so, why do you set up your


<pb n="537" facs="tcp:50044:246"/>
                  <hi>wisdom</hi> built on frivolous Cavils, against the Will,
Wisdom, Love and Care of God? I fear you are a
<hi>stranger</hi> unto that Benefit, Strength, Supportment,
Light, Knowledge, Grace, Wisdom and Consolation,
which true believers, the <hi>Disciples of Christ</hi> do every
day receive by reading, studying and meditating on
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. I wish you would mind some of old
<hi>Chrysostoms</hi> Exhortations unto all sorts of persons
to the reading and study of them; they are so
interwoven in all his <hi>Expositions and Sermons</hi> on
them, that it were lost labour to direct you unto
any place in particular. 5. The latter part of your
Discourse would make me suspect that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the <hi>Quakers</hi> that you talked of in your
<hi>Fiat,</hi> had a little tainted your judgement, but that
I can ascribe the rise of it unto another Cause.
Your preferring the <hi>conceived substance of Gods Will
before the letter of the Scripture,</hi> is their very Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But what do you mean by the <hi>conceived sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Gods Will?</hi> Is it the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctrine concerning
the Will of God delivered in the Scripture, or is it
somewhat else? If some <hi>other thing,</hi> why do you
not declare it? If it be no other, why do you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
it from its self, and prefer it above it self?
or do you conceive, there is a <hi>conceived substance
of Gods Will</hi> that is taught, or may be by men, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then by God himself? 6. Somewhat you inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
it may be to this purpose, in the close of this
Discourse, <hi>p.</hi> 96. where you say, <hi>the Question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us is not, whether the people are to have Gods
Word or no, but whether that Word consist in the letter
left to the Peoples disposal, or in the substance ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
imposed upon the people for their practice. And
this because you understand not, but mistake the whole
business, all your talk in this your eighteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="538" facs="tcp:50044:247"/>
vades into nothing.</hi> Truly Sir, I never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this was the <hi>state of the Controversie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, nor do I now believe it so to be. For
(1.) We say not that the letter of the Scripture is
to be left unto the <hi>Peoples disposal,</hi> but that the
Scripture is to be commended unto their <hi>reverend
use</hi> and meditation, which we think cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
denyed by any man that hath read the
Scripture, or knows ought of the Duty of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Christ. (2.) The <hi>Conceived substance of the
Word of God,</hi> as by any man conceived and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
is no otherwise the Word of God, but as it
answers <hi>what is written in the Scripture,</hi> and by
virtue of its <hi>analogy</hi> therewith. (3.) If by <hi>urging
the substance of the Word of God</hi> on the People, you
understand their <hi>instruction</hi> in their Duty out of the
Word of God, by <hi>Catechizing,</hi> Preaching, Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Exhortations, as you must if you speak
intelligibly, why do you oppose these things as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent?
May not the people have the <hi>use of the
Scripture,</hi> and yet have the Word preached unto
them by their Teachers? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> preach the
<hi>substance of the Word</hi> unto the <hi>Bereans,</hi> and yet they
are commended that they <hi>tryed</hi> what he delivered
unto them by the Scripture its self which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed?
And (4.) Why do you appropriate this
<hi>urging of the substance of the Word of God</hi> unto your
usage and practice, giving out as <hi>ours,</hi> the leaving of
the letter of the Scripture to the Peoples disposal,
when we know the former to be done <hi>far more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually</hi>
among Protestants, then among you, and
your self cannot deny it to be done more <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi>
(5.) You reproach the Scripture by calling it
<hi>the Letter</hi> in opposition to your <hi>conceived substance
of the Word of God.</hi> For though the <hi>Literal sense</hi>


                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:50044:247"/>
of <hi>Metaphorical</hi> expressions (by you yet adhered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to)
be sometimes called the <hi>Flesh,</hi> John 6. 33. and
the <hi>carnal sense</hi> of the Institutions of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be termed <hi>the Letter,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6. Rom. 2. 2.
yet the Covenant of God is, that his <hi>Spirit and Word</hi>
shall ever accompany one another, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 21. and
our Saviour tells us, that <hi>his Words are Spirit and life,
John</hi> 6. 63. and the Apostle, <hi>that the Word of God is
living and powerful, and sharper then any two-edged
sword,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. There is in the <hi>written Word</hi> a
living and life-giving power and efficacy, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have experience of, and which I should be
sorry to conclude you to be unacquainted withal.
It is the <hi>power of God</hi> unto salvation, the <hi>immortal
seed</hi> whereby we are begotten unto God, and the
<hi>food</hi> whereby our souls are nourished. And all this, is
to not only as to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that which is <hi>written,</hi>
but the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>writing,</hi> or Scripture it self,
which is given by <hi>Inspiration</hi> from God. For though
the things themselves <hi>written</hi> are the <hi>Will of God,</hi>
and intended in the writing; yet the <hi>Writing</hi> its self
being given out by inspiration, is the <hi>Word of God,</hi>
and only original means of Communicating the
other unto us: or the Word of God wherein his
will is contained; formally so, as the other is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially.
(6.) I find you are not well pleased when
you are minded of the <hi>contemptuous</hi> expressions
which some of your friends have used concerning
the Holy Scripture; but I am now enforced to tell
you that you your self have <hi>equalled</hi> in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
the very worst of them, in affirming that
<hi>nine parts in ten of it concerns not your particular
either to know or practice.</hi> For I presume you make
the instance only in <hi>your self,</hi> intending all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Persons no less then your self. The Apostle


<pb n="540" facs="tcp:50044:248"/>
tells us, that all <hi>Scripture is given by Inspiration of
God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for
correction, for instruction in righteousness.</hi> You, that
<hi>nine</hi> parts in <hi>ten</hi> of it do not concern us to know or
practice; that is, not at all. He informs us, that <hi>what
ever things were written afore time, were writttn for
our learning,</hi> that we through patience and comfort
of the Scripture might have hope; not above <hi>one
part of ten</hi> of what is so written, if you may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
is useful to any such purpose. Do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you say? God hath given us his <hi>whole
Word</hi> for our use and benefit. <hi>Nine parts in ten of
it,</hi> say you, do <hi>not concern</hi> us. Can possibly any man
break forth into an higher reflection upon the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
and Love of the Holy God? Or do you think
you could have made a more woful discovery of
your unacquaintedness with your own duty, the
nature of faith and Obedience Evangelical, then
you have done in these words? You will not make
thus bold with the Books that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath left us
in Philosophy, or <hi>Galen</hi> in <hi>Medicine.</hi> But the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in that writing which he hath given us
for the Revelation of his will, it seems may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.
Such fruit in the depraved nature of man
will <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> produce. The <hi>practice</hi> we
blame in you, is not worse then the <hi>reasonings</hi> you
use in its confirmation. I pray God neither of them
may be ever laid unto your charge.</p>
               <p>Your following words are a Commendation of
the zeal and <hi>piety of the dayes and times before the
Reformation,</hi> with reflections upon all things amongst
us since, and this I shall pass by, so to avoid the
occasion of representing unto you the <hi>true state</hi> of
things both here and elsewhere in the Ages you so
much extoll. Neither indeed is it to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose


<pb n="541" facs="tcp:50044:248"/>
to lay open anew that darkness and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which the world groaned under, and all sober
men complained of. You proceed to other Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and say:</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Fiat Lux</hi> sayes, That the Pentateuch, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giography
was never by any High Priest among the Jews
put into a Vulgar Tongue, nor the Gospel or Lyturgie
out of the Greek in the Eastern part of the Christian
Church, or Latin in the Western, you sleight this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of mine, because Hebrew, Greek and Latin
were Vulgar Tongues themselves: I know this well
enough: but when, and how long ago were they so? Not
for some thousand years to my knowledge. And was
the Bible, Psalms, or Christian Lyturgie then put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Vulgar Tongues, when those they were first written
in, ceased to be Vulgar? This you should have spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
if you had meant to say any thing, or gainsay
me. Nor is it to purpose to tell me that St. Jerom
translated the Bible into Dalmatian. I know well
enough it hath been translated by some special per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
into Gothish, Armenian, Aethiopian and other
particular Dialects. But did the Church either of the
Hebrews, or the Christians either Greeks or Latin ever
deliver it so to translated to the generality of People,
or use it in their Service, or command it so to be done
as a thing of general Concernment and necessity? so
far is it from that, that they would never permit
it.</p>
               <p>I thought you would as little have medled with
this matter again, as you have done with other
things of the like disadvantage unto you. For
(1.) I told you sufficiently before what a <hi>vanity</hi>
it was to enquire after a <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Old
Testament</hi> out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> before the <hi>Babylonish</hi>
Captivity, there being no other language but <hi>that</hi>


                  <pb n="542" facs="tcp:50044:249"/>
understood amongst the Generality of the <hi>Jewish</hi>
People. And I then manisested unto you, and shall
do so further immediately, that the Translation of
the Scripture into <hi>Syriak</hi> which you enquire after,
could have had no other design amongst the <hi>Jews</hi>
in those dayes, then your keeping of it in <hi>Latin</hi>
hath; namely that the People might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it. For if you shall persist to think that the
<hi>Jews</hi> before the <hi>Babylonish Captivity</hi> at least, had
any other <hi>vulgar language</hi> but the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> you will
make all men of understanding <hi>smile</hi> at you at an
extraordinary rate. Some while after the return
of the people from their <hi>Captivity,</hi> they began to
lose the <hi>purity</hi> of their own tongue, and most of
them understood the <hi>Syrochaldaean,</hi> wherein about
that time some small parts of the Scripture also
were written, In no long process of time a great
portion of them living scattered in the Provinces
of the <hi>Macedonian Empire,</hi> and therefore called
<hi>Hellenists,</hi> used and spake the <hi>Greek tongue,</hi> their
own ceasing to be vulgar unto them. All these
both in private, and in their <hi>publick Synagogne</hi>
Worship made use of a Translation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
into Greek, which was now become their
vulgar tongue, and that made either by the <hi>LXXII.</hi>
Elders sent from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus,</hi>
or which is more probable by the <hi>Jews of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
unto which City multitudes of them repaired,
the Nation being made free of it by its founder; or
it may be some while after by the <hi>Priest Onias,</hi> who
lead a great Colony of them into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there
built them a Temple for their Worship. So did
these <hi>Hebrews</hi> make use of a Translation, when
their own tongue ceased to be vulgar unto them.
The monster of serving God by rational men with a


<pb n="543" facs="tcp:50044:249"/>
                  <hi>tongue</hi> whereof they understand never a word, was
not yet hatched. The other portion of the people,
who either lived in <hi>Palestina,</hi> or those parts of the
East where the <hi>Greck tongue</hi> never prevailed into
common use, so soon as their language began to be
mixed with the <hi>Syrochaldean,</hi> and the purity of it
to grow into disuse, made use constantly of their
<hi>Targums,</hi> or Translations into that tongue. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be proved, but that the <hi>Jerusalem Jews</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> well enough until the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the City and Temple by <hi>Titus.</hi> So that
from the Church of the Jews you cannot obtain the
least countenance to your practice. And there lyes
in <hi>Gods dealing with them</hi> a strong Argument and
Testimony against it. For if God himself thought
meet to intrust his <hi>Oracles</hi> unto his People, in that
language which was <hi>common</hi> unto them all, hath he
not tanght us that it is his Will they should still be
so continued? And is there not still the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it as there was at first? (2.) Farther, the
practice of <hi>the Latin Church</hi> is unavoidably against
you. For whereas the Scripture was no part of it
written in <hi>Latin</hi> which was their <hi>vulgar tongue,</hi> it
it was immediately both Old Testament and New
turned thereinto: and therein used, as in their
<hi>publick Worship,</hi> so by private Persons of all sorts,
upon the encouragement of the Rulers of it. And
no reason of their <hi>translation</hi> of it, which they made
and had from time immemorial, can possibly be
imagined, but only the indispensible necessity which
they apprehended of having the Scripture in <hi>a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi>
which the People did <hi>generally speak</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.
(3.) The case was the same in the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Greek Church.</hi> The New Testament was <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi>
written in their own <hi>vulgar tongue,</hi> which


<pb n="544" facs="tcp:50044:250"/>
they made use of accordingly. And as for the <hi>old,</hi>
they constantly used a <hi>Translation</hi> of it into the same
dialect. So that it is impossible that we can obtain a
clearer <hi>suffrage</hi> from the Antient Churches, both
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and these both of <hi>Latins</hi> and
<hi>Greeks</hi> in any thing, then we have against this custom
of your Church. <hi>But these languages you say have
ceased to be vulgar for some thousand years to your
knowleage. Bona verba!</hi> You know much I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
yet not so much, but that it is possible you
may sometimes fail in your <hi>Chronological faculty.</hi>
Pray <hi>how many thousand years</hi> is it think you since
Christs birth, now this year 1663.? or since the
ruine of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin Empire,</hi> and therein the
Corruption of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Languages. I believe you will
not find it above three or four thousand at the most,
upon your next Calculation: though I can assure
you an <hi>ingenuous Person</hi> told me, he thought from
the manner of your speaking <hi>you might guess at
some nine or ten.</hi> What then? <hi>Was the Bible say you
put into other vulgar tongues when they ceased to be
vulgar?</hi> Yes by some they were: <hi>Hierom</hi> translated
it into the <hi>Dalmatian</hi> tongue: <hi>Vlphilus</hi> into the
<hi>Gotish: Beda</hi> a great part of it into the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and
the like no doubt was done by others. The <hi>Eastern</hi>
Countreys also, to whom the <hi>Greek</hi> was not so well
known, had Translations of their own from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beginning of their Christianity. And for the
rest, shall the <hi>wretched negligence</hi> of men in times
of confusion and ignorance, such as those were
wherein the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues ceased to be
vulgar, prescribe a Rule and Law unto us of practice
in the worship of God, contrary to his <hi>own direction,</hi>
the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing its self, and the <hi>example</hi> of
all the Churches of Christ for five hundred years?


<pb n="545" facs="tcp:50044:250"/>
For besides that in the <hi>Empire</hi> it was alwayes <hi>used,</hi>
and read in the vulgar tongues, those Nations that
knew not the <hi>two great Languages</hi> that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
spoken therein, from the time that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Christian faith, took care to have the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
translated into their Own mother tongue.
So <hi>Chrysostom</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Gospel of John,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
occasionally he especially instanceth, was in his
dayes translated into the <hi>Syrian, Egyptian, Indian,
Persian</hi> and <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Languages. <hi>Hom.</hi> 1. in <hi>John.</hi>
But you say, <hi>Did the Church either of the Hebrews or
Christians, Greek or Latin, ever deliver it transtlated
to the generality of the People, or use it in their Ser|
vice, or command it so to be done, as a thing of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
concernment; so far is it from that, that they
would never permit it.</hi> But you do not sufficiently
consider what you say. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Church had no
need so to do. God gave the Scripture unto it in
their own <hi>mother tongue,</hi> and that only. And they
had no reason to translate it out of their knowledge
and understanding. The <hi>Greek Church</hi> had the
<hi>New Testament</hi> in the same manner, and the <hi>Old</hi>
they translated or delivered it so translated by
others unto the <hi>generality</hi> of the people, and used
it in their Service. The <hi>Latin</hi> Church did so also.
The Scriptures both of the Old and New Testament
also being <hi>originally</hi> written in Languages unknown
vulgarly unto them; they had them <hi>translated</hi> into
their own common tongue for the <hi>generality</hi> of the
People, and used that Translation in their Publick
Service. The same was the practice of the <hi>Syrians</hi>
and all other Nations of old, that had a language in
common use peculiar to themselves All your Plea
ariseth from the practice of <hi>some</hi> who through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or negligence provided not for the good


<pb n="546" facs="tcp:50044:251"/>
and necessity of the Churches of Christ, when
through the <hi>changes</hi> and confusions that happened
in the world, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues ceased to
be vulgar, which how many <hi>thousand years</hi> ago it
was, you may calculate at your next leisure. This
is that, which in <hi>them</hi> we blame, and in <hi>you</hi> much
more because you will follow them after you have
been so frequently <hi>admonished</hi> of your miscarriage
therein; for you add to your sin by making, that
which was <hi>neglect</hi> in them, <hi>wilful choice</hi> in you, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
that <hi>not</hi> to be done, which they only omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will not leave this matter; you told us
in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> that <hi>neither</hi> Moses, <hi>nor any after him did
take care to have the Scripture turned into Syriack.</hi>
I desired to know why they should, seeing <hi>Hebrew</hi>
was their <hi>vulgar tongue,</hi> and the <hi>Syriak</hi> unknown
unto them, which I proved from the saying of the
<hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when they desired <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>
to <hi>speak unto them in Syriak which they understood,
and not in the Jews Language in the hearing of the
people</hi> to affright and trouble them. This I did for
your satisfaction, the thing its self being absolutely
out of question, and not in the least needing any
proof amongst those who understand any thing of
this business. But you yet attempt to revive your
first <hi>mistake,</hi> and to say somewhat unto the instance
whereby it was rectified, but with your usual suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
Will you therefore be pleased to hear your
self talk <hi>you know not what</hi> in this matter once more?
Thus then you proceed, <hi>Sir you are mistaken, for the
longue the Princes perswaded</hi> Rabshakeh <hi>to speak was
the Assyrian, his own language which was learned by
the Gentry in</hi> Palestine, <hi>as we in</hi> England <hi>learn the
French; which although by abbreviation it be called


<pb n="547" facs="tcp:50044:251"/>
Syriack, yet is differed as much from the Jews
Language which was spoken by Christ and his Apostles
(whereof</hi> Eli Eli lama Sabacthani <hi>is a part) and was
over since that time called Syrian or Syriack, as French
differs from English. And if you would read atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
you may suspect by the very words of the Text,
that the Jews Language even then was not the Hebrew.
For it had been a shorter and plainer expression, and
more answerable to their custom so to call it if it had
been so, then by a paraphrase to name it the Jews
Language: which if then it was called Syrian, as
afterwards it was, then had the Princes reason to call
it rather the Jews Language then Syrian, because that
and the Assyrian differed more in nature then appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
though some difference doubtless there was in
the very word and name, although Translators have
not heeded to deliver it.</hi> Shibbolet <hi>and</hi> Sibbolet <hi>may
differ more in signification then sound: nor is Brittish
and brutish so neer in nature as they are in name. And
who knows not that</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi> Assyria <hi>were several
Kingdoms, as likewise were the Languages?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had much ado at first to <hi>understand</hi> what it is
that you would have in this discourse; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for I am sure <hi>you do not understand</hi> your self.
And I am perswaded that if you knew how many
<hi>prodigies</hi> you have poured out in these <hi>few lines,</hi>
you would be amazed at the product of your own
imagination. For (1.) You yet again suppose
<hi>Syriack</hi> to have been the <hi>vulgar language</hi> of the
Jews in the dayes of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> a thing that never
fell upon the <hi>fancy</hi> of any man before you, being
contrary to <hi>express Scripture</hi> in the Testimony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recited, and all the <hi>monuments</hi> of those dayes,
wherein the <hi>Sermons</hi> of the Prophets unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are recorded in the <hi>purest Hebrew;</hi> neither had


<pb n="548" facs="tcp:50044:252"/>
the people as yet been carried <hi>captive</hi> out of their
own land, or been <hi>mixed</hi> with strangers, so as to
have lost their language as you imagine, unless you
think that indeed the Hebrew was never their
vulgar tongue. 2. You suppose, the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian</hi>
at that time to have been <hi>different Languages,</hi>
whereof those who understood the one understood
not the other: when they were but one and the
same called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>tongue of Aram,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there ever any other difference between
the Language of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> or <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> and that
which was afterwards peculiarly called <hi>Syriack,</hi> but
in some <hi>few words</hi> and various terminations, and
how far this differed from the <hi>Jews Language</hi> you
have an instance in the names given by <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Laben</hi> to the same heap of witness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 47. the
one calling it <gap reason="foreign">

by the <hi>common people</hi> of the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 15. (3.) You
suppose that in the <hi>Language</hi> wherein <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> and
the Princes conferred, their <hi>Syriack</hi> was an abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
of <hi>Assyriack,</hi> because in sound it was so near
the other, that they would have him speak in. So
that the Jews speaking <hi>Syriack,</hi> when the Princes
desired <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> to speak <hi>Syriack,</hi> they meant ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Language,</hi> as much differing from that, as <hi>French</hi>
from <hi>English.</hi> But you are in the dark, and know
not how you wander up and down to no purpose.
There is nothing of the words that you pretend
to be an <hi>abbreviation</hi> the one of the other in the
Text, nor is there any such <hi>relation</hi> between them
as you imagine, that they should be near in <hi>sound,</hi>
though not in nature. <hi>Eliakim</hi> entreats <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>
that he would speak <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

the language of <hi>Aram:</hi> which Language was spoken
also by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the King and People of <hi>Assyria.</hi> And

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Ashur,</hi>
as I suppose. (4.) You talk of the lenghth of that
expression, <hi>in the Jews Language,</hi> when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Text but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Jehudith Judaice,</hi>
that is, in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> (5.) Some difference you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there was between the <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Syrian</hi> in
<hi>sound and name, though Translators have not heeded
to deliver it;</hi> When there is no agreement at all
between them: but you say there was more in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
when there was none at all. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>Lashon
Arami,</hi> the tongue of <hi>Aram</hi> was the Language of
<hi>Assyria, Ashur</hi> being but a Colony of <hi>Aram.</hi> (6,) So
you think that <hi>Shibboleth</hi> and <hi>Sibboleth</hi> may differ
more in <hi>signification then sound.</hi> But pray what do
you think is the signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as the <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
pronounced <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, just as much as a word
<hi>falsly pronounced</hi> signifieth, and no more; that is,
of its self just nothing at all: For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Sibboleth</hi>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Shibboleth</hi>
falsly pronounced. 7. You imagine that the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
spoken by Christ, and his Apostles was the
<hi>same</hi> that was spoken in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and
this you would prove from those words <hi>Eli Eli
lama Sabacthani,</hi> to be that which is now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>Syriack,</hi> and fancy an <hi>Assyrian</hi> tongue, as
much differing from it, as <hi>French</hi> differs from <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
which manifests your skill in the Oriental
Languages, for want whereof I do not blame you;
for what is that to me? but I cannot take it well
that you should <hi>choose</hi> me out to trouble me with
talking about that which you do not understand.
For here you give us <hi>two Languages,</hi> the <hi>Syriack,</hi>


                  <pb n="550" facs="tcp:50044:253"/>
and <hi>Assyriack,</hi> which names in the Original <hi>differed
but little in sound,</hi> but the languages themselves <hi>did
as much in nature as French and English.</hi> And the
<hi>Syriack</hi> you tell us, was that which is now so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
called, but what the <hi>Assyriack</hi> was you tell us
not, but only that when the Princes perswade <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shakeh</hi>
to speak <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Aramith,</hi> he intended an
<hi>Assyrian</hi> language that was not <hi>Syrian.</hi> The boys
that grind colours in our <hi>Grammer Schools,</hi> laugh at
these <hi>Mormoes.</hi> (8.) Neither do you know well what
you say when you affirm that the <hi>Language of
Christ,</hi> and his Apostles was the same that was ever
since called the <hi>Syriack:</hi> for the very instance you
give, manifests it to have been a different <hi>dialect</hi>
from it; the words as recorded by the <hi>Evangelists</hi>
being absolutely the same neither with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
nor <hi>Targum,</hi> nor <hi>Syriack</hi> Translation of the Old
Testament: That wherein we have the Translation
of the Scripture, and which prevailed in the <hi>Eastern
Church,</hi> being a peculiar <hi>Antiochian dialect</hi> of the
old <hi>Aramaean Tongue.</hi> And that whole language
called the Syriack peculiarly now, and whereof there
were various <hi>dialects</hi> of old, seems to have had its
beginning after the Jews return from their captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
being but a degenerate mixture of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
and <hi>Chaldee;</hi> whereunto also after the prevalency
of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire many <hi>Greek</hi> word were
admitted, and some Latine ones also afterwards.
(9.) You advantage not your self by affirming
that <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> were several Kingdoms. For
as <hi>Strabo</hi> will inform you, they were both originally
called <hi>Syrian,</hi> and indeed were one and the same, until
the more <hi>Eastern Provinces</hi> about <hi>Babylon</hi> obtaining
their peculiar denominations, that part of <hi>Asia,</hi>
which contains <hi>Comogena, Phaenicia, Palestina</hi> and


<pb n="551" facs="tcp:50044:253"/>
                  <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> became to be especially called <hi>Syria.</hi>
Originally they were all <hi>Aramites</hi> as every one
knows that can but read the Scripture in its Original
Language.</p>
               <p>And now I suppose you may see how little you
have advantaged your self; or your cause by this
<hi>maze of mistakes</hi> and contradictions. For no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
can be so thick covered with others, but that
it will rain through. The Jews you suppose to have
<hi>lost their own language</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and
to have spoken <hi>Syriack;</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Assyrian</hi> to
have been languages as far distant as <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>English;</hi> that when the Princes entreated <hi>Rabsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh</hi>
to speak the <hi>Syrian</hi> language <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not the <hi>Syrian</hi> Language which was indeed
the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Assyrian</hi> quite differing from it;
and so when they desired him not to speak <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> you suppose them to have desired him
not to speak in the <hi>Jews language,</hi> but to speak in
the <hi>Jews language</hi> which you say was the <hi>Syriack.</hi>
And sundry other no less unhappy absurdities have
you amassed together.</p>
               <p>But you will retrive us out of this Labyrinth, by a
Story of what a <hi>Greek Biship</hi> did and said at <hi>Paris</hi>
in the presence of <hi>Doctor</hi> Cousins <hi>now bishop of</hi> Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>how he refused the Articles of the English
Church, and did all things according to the Roman
mode,</hi> asserting the use of <hi>Liturgies in the vulgar
Greek.</hi> Unto which I shall say no more, but that it
was at <hi>Paris</hi> and not at <hi>Durham;</hi>
                  <q>Graeculus esuriens in caelum jusseris, ibit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have my self known some eminent members of
that Church in <hi>England,</hi> two especially; one many
years ago called <hi>Conopius,</hi> who if I mistake not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="552" facs="tcp:50044:254"/>
his return obtained the honour of a <hi>Patriarchate,</hi>
being sent hither by the then <hi>Patriarch of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi>
the other not many years ago, called <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statius
Comnenus Archimandrite</hi> as his Testimonials
be spake him, of a <hi>Monastry</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Both
these I am sure made it their business to inveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>your Church</hi> &amp; practices, having the Arguments
of <hi>Nilus</hi> against your Supremacy at their fingers ends.
And if the <hi>Greek Chruch</hi> and you are so well agreed
as you pretend, why do you censure them as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and receive only some few
of them who are runnagates from their own Tents?
What may those whom you proclaim to be your
enemies expect from you, when you deal thus severely
with those whom you give out to be your friends?
But as for this matter, of the Scripture, and prayers
in an <hi>unknown tongue,</hi> though they transgress not
with so high an hand as you do, the <hi>old Greeks</hi> being
not so absolutely remote from the present <hi>vulgar,</hi> as
the <hi>Latine</hi> is from our English, and the Languages
of diverse other Nations whom you compell to your
Church Service in that toague, and besides they
have the <hi>Scripture translated</hi> into their present vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongue, for the use of private persons; yet we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
not <hi>their practice,</hi> but look upon it as a great
means of continuing, that <hi>ignorance and darkness</hi>
which is unquestionably spread over the major part
of that Church: which in some places as in <hi>Russia</hi>
is to such a degree, as to dispose the people unto
<hi>Barbarism.</hi> We know also that herein they are
gone off from the constant and Catholick usage of
their forefathers, who for some <hi>Centuries</hi> of years
from the dayes of the Apostles themselves, who
planted Churches amongst them, both had the <hi>Bible</hi>
in their own <hi>vulgar Tongue,</hi> and made no use of any


<pb n="553" facs="tcp:50044:254"/>
other in the <hi>publick Service</hi> of their Assemblies.
And that their example in your present degenerate
condition, which in some things you as little approve
of as we do in others, should have any great power
upon us, I know as yet little reason to judge.</p>
               <p>Your last attempt in this matter is to vindicate what
you have said in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> as you now affirm, <hi>That
the Bible was kept in an Ark or Tabernncle, not touched
by the people, but brought ont at times to the Priest that
he might instruct the people out of it.</hi> To which you
say, I answer, <hi>That the Ark was placed in the</hi> Sanctum
Sanctorum <hi>which was not entred into but by the Priest
and that only once a year;</hi> And Reply, <hi>But Sir I
speake not there of any</hi> Sanctum Sanctorum, <hi>or of any
Ark in that place; was there or could there be no more
Arks but one? If you had been only in these latter days
in any Synagogue or Convention of the Jews, you might
have seen even now how the Bible is still kept with
them in an Ark or Tabernacle, in imitation of their
forefathers, when they have no</hi> Sanctum Sanctorum
<hi>amongst them. You may also discern how according
to your custome, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ringe and prostrate at the bringing
out of the Biblt, which is the only solemn adoration
left amongst them; there be more Arks then that in the</hi>
Sanctum Sanctorum; <hi>if I had called it a Box or a
Chest, or a Cupboard you had let it pass; but I used
that word as more sacred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The oftener that you touch upon this string, the
<hi>harsher</hi> is the found that it yields. I would desire
you to free your self from the unhappiness of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that it tends unto your disreputation to be
esteemed unacquainted with the <hi>Jews</hi> language and
customes. If you cannot do so, you will not be able
to avoid suffering from your own thoughts, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if you cannot for bear talking al out them. This


<pb n="554" facs="tcp:50044:255"/>
was all that in your <hi>former</hi> discourse you were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
unto, but this <hi>renewal</hi> of it hath rendred your
condition somewhat worse then it was. For failures
in Skill and Science, are not in <hi>demerit</hi> to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with those in Morality, which are voluntary
and of choice. Your words in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> after you
had <hi>learnedly</hi> observed that the Bible was never in
<hi>Moses</hi> time nor afterwards by any high Priest tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
into Syriack for the use of the People, are,
<hi>Nay it was so far from that, that it was not touched nor
looked upon by the people, but kept privately in the Ark
or Tabernacle, and brought for that times by the Priest
who might upon the Sabboth day read some part of it to
the people.</hi> I confess your expression in <hi>the Ark or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi>
was somewhat uncouth, and discovered that
you did but obscurely guess at the thing you ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to discourse about. But I took your words in
that only sense they were capable of; namely that
the Bible was kept in <hi>the Ark,</hi> or at least in <hi>the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi>
that is some part of it, whereunto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had no access. And he must be a man devoid of
reason and common sense, who could imagine that
you intended any thing but <hi>the sacred Ark</hi> and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
when you said that it was kept in the Ark
or Tabernacle. For not only by all rules of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is the word used indefinitely to be taken
<hi>in sensu famosiori,</hi> but also your manner of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will admit of no other sense or intention. Now
herein in the <hi>Animadversions</hi> I minded you of your
failure, and told you that not the <hi>whole Bible</hi> as you
imagined, but only the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was placed, not
<hi>in,</hi> but <hi>at the sides</hi> of the Ark. That the Ark was
kept in the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> that no Priest went in thither,
but only the <hi>High Priest</hi> and that but once a year,
that the book of the Law was never brought forth


<pb n="555" facs="tcp:50044:255"/>
from thence to be read to the people; and lastly
that whatever of this kind you might fancy, yet it
would not in the least conduce to your purpose, it
being openly evident that besides the Publick <hi>lections</hi>
out of the Law, that People had all of them the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
in their houses, and were bound by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to read and meditate in them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.
What say you now to these things?
(1.) You change your words and affirm that you
said it was kept <hi>in an Ark or Tabernacle,</hi> as though
you meant any <hi>Ark or Chest.</hi> But you too much wrong
your self; your words are as before represented, in
<hi>the Ark or Tabernacle,</hi> and you remembred them
well enough to be so, which so perplexeth you in
your attempt to rectifie what you said. For after
you have changed the <hi>first word,</hi> the addition of the
next leaves you in the <hi>briars</hi> of nonsense; <hi>in an
Ark or Tabernacle,</hi> as though they were terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible;
a <hi>Chest</hi> or a <hi>Tent.</hi> I wish you would make
an end of this fond shooting at rovers. (2.) You
apply that to the practice of the <hi>present Jews</hi> in their
Synagogues, which you plainly spake of the <hi>antient
Jews,</hi> whilest their Temple and Church state continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
wherein again you intrench upon <hi>morality</hi> for an
Evasion. And besides you cast your self upon new mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.
For (1.) The Book kept in a Chest by them,
and brought forth with the veneration you speak of,
is not the <hi>whole Bible</hi> as you imagine but only the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> which was read in their Synagogues on
the Sabbath dayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>James</hi> tells us,
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. Only whereas their Law was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
sought after to be destroyed by <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi>
they supplyed the room of it with the other
parts of the Scripture divided into <hi>Haphters</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
unto the <hi>Sections of the Law.</hi> Nor (2.) Is


<pb n="556" facs="tcp:50044:256"/>
that brought out <hi>to,</hi> or by a <hi>Priest,</hi> but to any <hi>Rabbi</hi>
that precides in their Synagogue worship; for they
have <hi>no Priest</hi> amongst them, nor certain distinction
of Tribes; so that if you your self have been in any
<hi>Synagogue</hi> or Convention of the Jews, it is evident
that you understood little of what you <hi>saw</hi> them do,
(3.) For their <hi>Prostration</hi> at the bringing out of the
Book which you seem to commend as a solemn Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it is down right <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> for in it they
openly worship the <hi>material roll</hi> or book that they
keep.</p>
               <p>But what is it that you would from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude?
Is it that which you attempted in yout <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi>
namely that the People amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> had not
the Bible in their <hi>own language,</hi> and in common use
among them? You may as easily prove that the Sun
shines not at noon day. The Scripture was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them in <hi>their own mother</hi> tongue, and
they were commanded of God to <hi>read</hi> and <hi>study</hi> it
continually, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> pronouncing them blessed
who did accordingly. And the present <hi>Jews</hi> make
the same duty of indispensable necessity unto every
one amongst them, after he comes to be <hi>filius prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi>
or lyable to the keeping of any command of
God. The Rules they give for all sorts of Persons,
<hi>high</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> rich and poor, young and old, sick and
in health, for the performance of this duty, are known
to all, who have any acquaintance with their present
Principles, Practices, State and Condition. And
you shall scarcely meet with <hi>a child</hi> amongst them of
<hi>nine ytars old</hi> who is not exercised to the reading of
the <hi>Bible in Hebrew.</hi> And yet though they all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
learn the <hi>Hebrew tongue</hi> for this purpose in
their Infancy, yet least they should <hi>neglect</hi> it, or
through <hi>trouble</hi> be kept from it, they have translated


<pb n="557" facs="tcp:50044:256"/>
the whole Old Testament into all the <hi>Languages</hi> of
the Nations amongst whom in any nambers they are
scattered. The <hi>Arabick Translation</hi> of the Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanian
Jews, the <hi>Spanish</hi> of the Spaniards and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
I can shew you it you please. Upon the whole
matter, I wish you knew how <hi>great</hi> the work is,
wherein you are engaged, and how <hi>contemptible</hi> the
engines are whereby you hope to effect it. But
such Positions, and such Confirmations are very
well suited. And this is the summ of what you

               <p>You tell us in your <hi>Fiat,</hi> that the <hi>Pagans defamed
the Christians for the worship of an Asses head, and
you give this reason of it because the Jews had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
our Lord Jesus Christ whose head and half Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture
Christians used upon their Altars, even as
they do at this day, of his great simplicity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
Two things you suppose, (1.) <hi>That the
Christians placed the Head and half Portraicture of
our Saviour in those dayes on their Altars;</hi> which is
alone to your purpose. (2.) <hi>That this gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Pagans to defame them with the worship
of an Asses head,</hi> because the Jews had so blasphemed
the Lord Christ as you say. These things I told
you are <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> and destitute of all colour of
Testimony from Antiquity. That the <hi>worship of an

it was, and that in the very same manner and on

an Asses head is our God,</hi> presently declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this imputation was derived on them from
the <hi>Jews,</hi> who first suffered under that Fable. And
if any thing gave new occasion unto it among the
Christians, it was not the <hi>Picture of Christ despised
by the Jews</hi> as you imagine, but the report of <hi>his
riding on an Ass;</hi> which <hi>Athanasius</hi> takes notice

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>that the God of
the Christians, who is called Christ, sate on an Ass.</hi>
But you will prove what you say out of <hi>Tertullian;</hi>
say you, <hi>the same</hi> Tertullian <hi>in his Apologeticks
adds these words, The Calumnies,</hi> saith he, <hi>invented
to cry down our Religion grew to such an excess of
impiety that not long ago in this very City, a picture
of our God was shewn by a certain infamous Person,
with the ears of an Ass, and a hoof on one foot, cloathed
with a gown, and a book in his hand with this inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi>
Onochoetes <hi>the God of the Christians; And he
adds that the Christians in the City as they were much
offended with the impiety, so did they not a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at the strange uncouth name the villain had put
upon our Lord and Master.</hi> Onochoetes, <hi>forsooth he
must be called</hi> Onochoctes. In this Testimony of
you know not what, you triumph and conclude, <hi>are
you not a strange man to tell me that what I speak of
this business is notoriously false; nay and that I
know it is false, and that I cannot produce one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick

but this is your Ordinary Confidence.</hi> Seriously Sir,

of <hi>Authors</hi> that you want the Confidence to venture
upon your self. The words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which
your <hi>Translator</hi> hath abused you in, are these: <hi>Sed
nova jam Dei nostri in ista Civitate proxime editio
publicata est, ex quo quidam in frustrandis bestiis
mercenarius noxius picturam proposuit cum ejusmodi
inscriptione, Deus Christianorum</hi> Ononychites; <hi>is erat
auribus Asininis, altero pede ungulatus, librum gestans
&amp; togatus; risimus &amp; nomen &amp; formam. Sed illi
debebant adorare statim biforme numen qui canino &amp;
leonino capite commistos Deos receperunt. Lately in
that City</hi> (that is Rome) <hi>there was a publick shew
made of our God; wherein a guilty Person hired to
fight with wild beasts, and to cousin their rage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
a Picture with this Inscription</hi> Ononychites <hi>the
God of the Christians: he had Asses ears, hoofed on one
foot, carrying a Book and in a gown: we laughed at
the name and shape; but they ought immediately to
have adored this double shaped Deity, who have received
Gods mingled with Doggs and Lyons heads.</hi> You see
how well you have given us the <hi>words of Tertullian,</hi>
which you pretend to do, saying, <hi>he adds these words.</hi>
But I confess though he sayes no such matter, it is
like enough he would have <hi>wondred</hi> at the name of
<hi>Onochoetes,</hi> had the villain given it unto his picture:
For neither he, nor any man else knows what it
should mean. He knew well enough what <hi>Onony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites</hi>
signified, and laughed at it. It is but <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nungulus,</hi>
which it may be comes neerer their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
I confess some would read it <hi>Onochoerites,</hi>
as if it were compounded of <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Some say their Sabaoth had the form of an Ass,
seme of a Hogg.</hi> But <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the description


<pb n="563" facs="tcp:50044:260"/>
of the Picture mentions no part of a <hi>Hogg,</hi> nor
rejects the abomination <hi>of the Gnosticks,</hi> as was the
manner of the Christians when charged with their
silliness and folly, as may be seen abundantly in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
against <hi>Celsus.</hi> But who, or what your <hi>Onocho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etes</hi>
should be, no man knows. But see your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unhappiness. You prove not by your <hi>Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
that which no man denyes, namely that the
<hi>Christians also</hi> were charged with the <hi>worship of an
Asses head,</hi> which if you had but looked into <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
himself, you must have found him expresly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it in the <hi>beginning</hi> of that Chapter, from
whence your story is taken. Much less do you
prove any thing of the <hi>Christians placing the head and
half Portraicture of our Saviour upon their Altars,</hi>
before or in the dayes of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which was that
alone that was incumbent on you to have done. And
now to give a brief view of that <hi>whole Portraicture</hi>
that you have drawn of your self in your Epistle, I
shall only mind you of those <hi>words of mine, that your
Assertions were notoriously false, and that you could
not produce so much as one Testimony of any such
thing,</hi> were not by me used at all in reference unto
the <hi>Pagans</hi> charge upon the Christians for <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
an Asses head,</hi> but unto what you said about
the use of the <hi>Picture of Christ on the Altars of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
with the rise of the charge mentioned from
thence. This you <hi>know</hi> to be so; for my words
must needs <hi>lye before you</hi> in your attempt for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unto them, and finding them to be true, and
that you were not able to produce <hi>one</hi> Testimony,
no <hi>not one</hi> in the confirmation of what you had
written; you pretend them now to be spoken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
unto that whereunto you know they did not
at all relate, the thing it self being acknowledged


<pb n="564" facs="tcp:50044:261"/>
by me. This dealing becomes not any man pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ingenuity, or professing Christianity.</p>
               <p>What remains of your Epistle, is <hi>Personal;</hi> Men
are busie; and not so far concerned, I am <hi>sure in me,</hi>
nor (I am almost perswaded) in <hi>you</hi> as to trouble
themselves with the perusal of what belongs unto
us personally. For my part I know it is my duty
in <hi>all things,</hi> especially in those that are of such
<hi>near concernment</hi> unto his Glory, as are all his
Truths, and Worship, to commend my conscience
unto God, and to be conversant in them in <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and godly sincerity, and not in <hi>fleshly wisdom,</hi> not
corrupting the word of Truth, nor lying in wait with
any <hi>subtile sleights</hi> to deceive. And this through
his Grace I shall attend unto, whatever <hi>reward</hi> I
may meet withal in this world. For I know <hi>in whom
I have believed, who is able to keep that which I desire
to commit unto him.</hi> And for your part, I desire
your prosperity as my own. I rejoyce in your quiet,
and shall never envy you your liberty, and do pray
that you may receive <hi>Grace, Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> from
him, who alone is able to bestow them on you.</p>
