            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Thought fit by this <hi>Preface</hi>to prevent thy Offence at the Title of this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which I call the <hi>Arraignment of Worldly Philoſophy;</hi> as if thereby thou might ſuppoſe I did intend any true and real knowledge of things either Divine or Natural, that any of theſe call'd <hi>Ancient Philoſophers</hi> had, or the real and ſincere ſtudy, enquiry and ſearch into them, that any of the children of men have had, whether in former Ages, from the beginning of the World, or now have in this preſent Age, ſo as to condemn the ſame. But this is far from my Intention; for on the contrary, I do judge, that the ſincere ſtudy, enquiry and ſearch after Truth, and the true knowledge of God, and of his Creatures, is moſt commendable and praiſe worthy: and they are the most Noble Souls, who in all Ages of the world have given and applied themſelves unto the ſame; for true Knowledg is of more value than all worldly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, being that which truly adorns the Mind and Soul of Man, and is a perfection to it; yea, what eyes and ſight is to the Body, that true Knowledg is to the Soul; and as we cannot love an outward and viſible Object, unleſs we ſee it, or have ſome knowledg of it by ſome of our outward ſenſes, ſo we cannot love God our Creator, unleſs we have the true knowledge of him; And tho the highest and moſt excellent degree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, is to know him in a nearor and more immediate way than by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creatures, yet God hath ſet his Creatures, and the glorious Fabrick of the viſible Creation before us, as a book in a large Volume, whereby we may read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not only that God is, but alſo whereby we may know in ſome ſort his manifold divine perfections, even his exceeding great Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Purity, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Juſtice. But as no man can read a book that is blind, or if he have eyes, without light, ſo none can truly and rightly read and underſtand the great book of God's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as the eyes of his underſtanding are opened, and as his eyes when opened, are enlightned with a divine Light that cometh from God himſelf; for let it be granted that mens rational faculties are as the eyes of their minds, yet they can never ſee into the great wonders of the Creation of God, without he, the great Creator, doth enlighten them, as our natural and bodily eyes cannot ſee bodily Objects without a natural and bodily light; for ſeeing God made all the Creatures by his eternal Wiſdom, nothing can give to man the true knowledge of them, but the ſame Wiſdom by which he made them; and this is man's dignity and excellency above the Beaſts of the field, that he is capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this eternal divine Wiſdom, and be taught by it; and as the Rivers that come from the Sea lead to the Sea, ſo the Creatures, in a ſecondary and ſubordinate way, lead the Mind and Soul of Man to God that made them, as the divine Light of the eternal VViſdom that ſhines in his heart is eyed and regarded, that ſhews him how, and after what manner this Current and Stream of the Creatures that come from God, lead to him, that ſo man may reſt in him, and not in them. But if a man think by the bare ſearch of his natural underſtanding, and meer human Reaſon, to know either God or the Creation, without the divine Light, he greatly erreth; and this hath been the great Error of moſt of them called <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that by the bare ſearch of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral underſtanding, and meer human Reaſon, without the divine Light, they were buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:52479:3"/>
to make their ſearch into the wonderful works of God in his Creatures, which they not being able to do, they fell into many Errors, which do contradict the true Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine delivered by the Prophets, and by Chriſt, and the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, as the deſign of the following Treatiſe is to ſhew; and therefore this is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader, in the entrance, it is not any good thing, or any matter of Truth, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true diſcovery of knowledge in things either divine or natural, that this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe points at, and blames, but the groſs Errors in thoſe called Philoſophers, which I have found too many at this to day be deeply tinctured and leavened with; and theſe not only ſome that profeſs to be Students of Philoſophy, and Proficients in the ſame, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other perſons either wholly, or in great part illiterate, and who neither esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor are eſteemed by others, ſtudious in Philoſophy, I have found deeply ſo tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, and moſt tenariouſly adhering to theſe groſs and pernicious Errors; and when I have warn'd them of theſe Errors, telling them, that they were the noted Errors of them call'd <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> who did long ago, in Ages paſt, oppugn and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay the True Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine in many things, and the Errors of the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its Philoſophy, and of ſome other Schoolmen in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtiffly maintained by them, to defend the falſe Antichriſtian Doctrine that that Papal Society is guilty of; They have reply'd to me, They know neither the Philoſophy of the Old <hi>Heathens,</hi> nor of the late Schoolmen and Jeſuits, being ſimple unletter'd men. But to this I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd them, That tho they know not that ſuch Errors held by them, are the Errors of the Old <hi>Heathens,</hi> and of the late Schoolmen, ſuch as Jeſuits and others, yet they are theſe very Errors; for even as in another caſe, a man may have in his Houſe ſome things that he may not know to whom they do properly belong, ſo in this caſe men may hold er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious Opinions, invented by others long ago, and yet not know the Authors of them; and they might have come by them without any curious ſearch, ſtudy or enquiry into the Writings or Books of the firſt Authors or Inventers of them, either by having them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally mention'd to them, or finding them by ſome accident in ſome one or other late VVriter, that writ in their Mothers Tongue; and the mind of man, while it is more ſway'd with Darkneſs than Light, and with the ſpirit of Error than with the ſpirit of Truth, beſide the many diſadvantages it hath by wrong Education, and drinking in bad Principles from his childiſh years, which are not eaſily drove out, after they have once got entrance, will no doubt be more eaſily and readily inclined to embrace Error than Truth, tho no mans mind or underſtanding embraceth any Error as Error, but under a notion, or ſuppoſition that it is Truth, even as the VVill embraceth no evil as evil, but as having ſome ſeeming appearance of good; beſide that the mind of man, unleſs it be govern'd by the divine principle of Truth, within it ſelf, is but too fruitful to bring forth the like Errors as others have formerly done, as the Earth it ſelf, that is not well and carefully cultivated bp the Husbandman, will be fruitful enough to bring forth Bryars and Thorns, and hurtful Weeds. And notwithſtanding that ſome have objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, That the Human Learning I received at the Univerſity in Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Languages, and that called Philoſophy, hath enabled me to diſpute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, and otherways to hold forth both by word of mouth and by writing, certain principles of Chriſtian Doctrine, as ſo believed by me, and as if I gloried in my Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:52479:3"/>
and furniſhing, of human Learning, of ſuch Arts, Sciences, Languages, and that all d Philoſophy, as I had acquir'd in my younger years, and truſted greatly or chiefly to that, ſeeking to get a Name, or Applauſe thereby among men, I can, and do with great freedom and clearneſs of mind, declare, That ſuch who ſo judge of me, do greatly judg amiſs; my Truſt is in the Lord alone, and my dependance is wholly and only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and hath been, to receive of his Divine Wiſdom and Power from day to day, to ſtrengthen and enable me in that work and ſervice he hath called me unto, even to bear Teſtimony to the great Truths of the Christian Faith and Doctrine; and my knowledg and underſtanding I have in Chriſtian Doctrine and Principles, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the spirit of Truth, that hath opened my understanding, to understand them, and not from Natural Arts and Sciences, and Languages, and that called Philoſophy, which ſince ever I knew the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, I never have magnified, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed, nor valued my ſelf upon that ſort of Learning; for I have abundantly ſeen to the Inſufficiency of it, to qualifie any man to be a true Preacher or Teacher of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, or to be a true Minister of Christ Jeſus, whatever ſubſervient uſe the True and Genuine part of human Learning may have to a Miniſter of Chriſt, in ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the divine grace and gift of God, the ſpurious and adulterate part of it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long ſince been rejected by me, ſo far as it hath beeh diſcovered unto me; And for ſuch who through a prejudice in them, againſt the many precious Things of the Truth of Chriſt, that his divine light and spirit hath opened unto me, and continueth ſtill more and more to open unto me, and enable me to bring forth either by word or writing, are realy in their Ignorance to ſay, (as ſome have ſaid) <hi>Theſe things are but the effects and product of Arts and Sciences, human Learning and Philoſophy;</hi> They but too much manifeſt their want of a True ſavour and ſpiritual diſcerning (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever high pretences they make of it) who thus unjuſtly and unchristianly judg of me, and are of the Number of them <hi>(Iſa. 5.) that call light darkneſs, good evil, and ſweet bitter;</hi> while they are but too ready to call that which is <hi>darkneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves light,</hi> and <hi>evil good,</hi> and <hi>bitter ſweet,</hi> and ſo they have need to fear the woe that is pronounc'd againſt ſuch as ſo do; yet many have a better ſenſe and ſavour of my Christian Teſtimony. But to convince ſuch, if there be any room left for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, That the manner of Doctrine and Principles held forth by me, is not from, nor after the worldly Philoſophy, which is but worldly Rudimentss and human Traditions, but from and after Chriſt, as his holy spirit hath taught me, and enlightned me, and hath opened the holy Scriptures unto me, is the deſign of this ſmall Treatiſe, whereby they may perceive that I am ſo far from deriving my Ability from that called the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of either <hi>Platoniſts, Stoicks,</hi> or <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> or any others, Ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, of worldly minded Profeſſors and Students, that I have very plainly contradicted them, and ſhowed, wherein many of their great Principles and Concluſions in that called their Philoſophy, do contradict the holy Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine; and upon a due examination, they who ſeek to brand me with dangerous and hurtful Opinions of Philoſophy, will rather be found guilty themſelves in that particular.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is very evident out of theſe Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> what that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is that he cautioneth the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> againſt, to wit, that which is after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments and Elements of the World, and not after Chriſt, and which in the following words of this ſame Chapter, he calleth the <hi>Commandments and Doctrines of Men,</hi> and <hi>having a ſhew of Wiſdom in will-worſhip, and voluntary humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and worſhipping of Angels,</hi> v. 18. 23. and in v. 20. he calleth it <hi>a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſing;</hi> the words in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>why are ye ſubject to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> are more duly tranſlated; why <hi>dogmatize ye,</hi> or <hi>why are ye dogmatized?</hi> That is, ſubjected to mens Opinions and Doctrines, that tend to overthrow and deſtroy your Faith; ſuch as many of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Doctrines of them were that profeſſed themſelves to be Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers at that time. Some of the particular Errors, and hurtful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of theſe Philoſophers he doth particularly mention, as 1. the worſhipping of Angels: 2. a ſelf-will'd Humility: 3. the neglecting the body: 4. abſtaining from meats, ſo as neither to touch, taſte nor handle them; for ſome of the Philoſophers of that time did forbid the uſe of certain meats, and particularly of fleſh, as being hurtful to the ſtudy of Philoſophy. But the true Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine taught by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, alloweth the ſober and moderate uſe of all meats that are not in themſelves unwholeſome to the body, as ſome are. Alſo he deſcribeth the Effects of this vain and hurtful Philoſophy of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> 1. It made them intrude into things not ſeen: 2. It made them vain, and puffed up the fleſhly mind: 3. It led from the Head Chriſt, and from Faith in him.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Paul</hi> here cautioneth, and giveth warning againſt the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Philoſophy, or wiſdom of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philoſophers, ſo he exalteth and commandeth the true Wiſdom that is after Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſetteth the one in oppoſition to the other, the one being after the Traditions of

Men, and Rudiments or Elements of the World; the other being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, in whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, v. 3. as if he had ſaid to them, Why ſhould ye look after that which is rather falſly called <hi>Philoſophy</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than that which is true Philoſophy or Wiſdom; for granting that they may have ſome ſcraps and Fragments of ſome true Knowledge, yet it being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and mixed with many hurtful Errors, contrary to the Doctrine and Faith of Chriſt, it is better to ſhun it than to look after it. But if ye deſire or love true Wiſdom and Knowledg, ſeek after it in Chriſt, learn it of him; for in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg; for who would go and eat ſcraps of Food mixed with Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they can have a plentiful Table, well furniſh'd with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of wholeſome meats, without any mixture of any hurtful thing?</p>
            <p>It is convenient in this place to take notice, that it is only the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and falſe Opinions of theſe called <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth chiefly caution them againſt, and becauſe what things of Truth, or true Knowledg they had, or taught either by word of mouth, or by their books and writings, was ſo greatly mixed with many hurtful Errors, it was more adviſable for them that were weak, to let the whole alone, becauſe not only all things of Truth, or true Knowledge, that the beſt of them had, were not only to be learned from Chriſt, without them, but much more, even all that was requiſite or conducing to true happineſs or ſatisfaction. And as things receive their Name and Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from their greater part, ſo the Philoſophy of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining for the moſt part more Errors than Truth, might well be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hurtful and erroneous. Yet ſtrictly ſpeaking, it was not what they had of Truth, or true Knowledg, either of things divine or natural that the Apoſtle cautioned them againſt, as fit to be rejected or diſowned; for whatever is of Truth to be found in any men, is to be owned and acknowledged in its place, and a good uſe and improvement may be made of it to convince them of the Errors that they hold; for as all the parts of Truth are well coherent and conſiſting, and ſtand in moſt excellent Harmony one with another, ſo Truth and Error are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent, and break the Harmony and beautiful conſiſtency of things; Therefore by what a man holds of Truth in ſome ſmall meaſure, he may be convinced of his Errors when it is ſhewed to him in the clear light of divine illumination, or even of the true Reaſon of Man, that what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52479:5"/>
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or Perſwaſions he judgeth to be true, are inconſiſtent with the Truths he doth hold, that therefore they muſt needs be Errors, and falſe and unſound Notions. And after this manner <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with theſe called Philoſophers at <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17. citing a moſt true and excellent ſaying out of one of their own Authors, That men, or mankind, is the Offspring of God; and from this he took occaſion, whereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their Idolatry and Superſtition, and ſuch a method did the Ancient Fathers, ſo called, and Primitive Teachers in the Church, after the Apoſtles days, make uſe of in diſputing againſt the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in theſe times, who were commonly the greateſt Enemies and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Chriſtian Faith, by which they did mightily confound them, and put them to ſilence, and gain'd upon divers of them, ſo that they received the Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing it was not any thing of Truth, or true knowledg that <hi>Paul</hi> did caution men againſt in them called <hi>Gentile Philoſophers,</hi> whether they had it by vertue of that common divine illumination given to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or by the uſe of their true Reaſon, as men in ſubordination to that more excellent principle, jointly working together, both which are the good gifts of God, and are not to be diſregarded, but duly eſteemed and valued in their ſeveral places; the one, to wit, the divine illumination, as the Maſter or Miſtreſs; the other as the Servant or Handmaid, to wit, the true Reaſon or reaſonable underſtanding of man: but it was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or rather indeed only their groſs Errors that did oppoſe and impugn the true Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine that theſe called Philoſophers did hold and which made them ſo great Enemies to the Chriſtian Faith, tha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

part contrary to the wiſdom which Chriſt teacheth. And that he ſaith, <hi>beware,</hi> or ſee <hi>lest any ſpoil you,</hi> or make a prey of you, or rob you, <hi>through philoſophy and vain deceit.</hi> The latter words are explanatory, as to ſay, the Philoſophy I caution you againſt, it is not the true Philoſophy, or wiſdom; but vain deceit; and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as he calleth it; a ſhew or talk of wiſdom; but not the true divine wiſdom.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth not enumerate all, nor moſt of their Errors in this place, nor any where elſe, but only mentioneth a few in particular, and giveth them a warning againſt the Philoſophy profeſt at that time among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in general, as being hurtful, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the wiſdom of the world to the wiſdom of God; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that believe;</hi> and ſo doth <hi>James</hi> ſet in oppoſition <hi>the wiſdom from above</hi> and <hi>the wiſdom from below,</hi> with the qualities and properties of each, calling that from below, <hi>earthly, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh;</hi> as indeed the greateſt part of the Learning or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of them called <hi>Greeks</hi> at that time, was no other. It is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the Apoſtle did reject, or condemn the true exerciſe, uſe and improvement of mens rational faculties, either in the invention, or cultivation of ſuch uſeful Arts and Sciences as were really uſeful for the life of man, as the skill of <hi>Husbandry, Navigation, Arithmetick,</hi> or the knowledg of Numbers, and uſe of them, in Accounting, Geometry, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, and other the like uſeful Arts, which were for moſt part the reſult and improvement of Mans Nature, Reaſon and Underſtanding, as a Man, however it may be allowed, that in ſome caſes and things God did teach ſome men theſe or the like things by a divine illumination, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their rational underſtandings, as men: For tho there is nothing that is ſupernatural in all theſe Arts and Sciences commonly taught in Schools, or which ſurpaſſeth the common capacity of mens reaſon to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, yet the invention, or firſt diſcovery of them might have had a more immediately divine original; as when Chriſt opened the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eyes of the blind to ſee, their ſeeing was natural, after their eyes were open'd; but <hi>the opening of them</hi> was ſupernatural and miraculous. It being therefore the groſs and hurtful Errors that did abound in the <hi>Gentile Philoſophy,</hi> that made <hi>Paul</hi> give ſuch caution againſt it; And the ſame Errors continuing among many called <hi>Christians</hi> at this day, that ſpoil them, by hurting yea, deſtroying the Faith of ſome, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52479:6"/>
the Faith of others, which were among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in that day, I have found a Zeal raiſed in my heart, and a weighty concern upon me to point at divers groſs Errors held profeſſed, and taught in this day, by ſome called <hi>Christians,</hi> as Doctrines and Principles of true Philoſophy, moſt of which were the very Errors of the old <hi>Heathen Philoſophers;</hi> and they are ſuch as follow, particularly the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> taught,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Body is no part of a Man, but a Priſon and Grave to the Soul. Hence they could not but deny the Reſurrection of the Body after Death; for no man after he is ſet free out of Priſon, has any deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it again; and alſo from this Error, no doubt, came that neglecting of the Body that <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. which makes me the more think ſtrange of ſome at this day, who tho they plainly profeſs, they believe nothing of the Reſurrection of this body, or any part or parts of it, yet they are but overmuch addicted highly to nouriſh and cloath it, and that in a very high degree, and have an extraordinary love to it, and care of it, as if it were their only immortal part. But ſuch who are of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Body is as a Priſon and Grave to the Soul, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expects no Reſurrection to it, more than to the body of a beaſt, do not underſtand how the body, by ſin, is changed, to be liker to a Priſon, or Grave, than to a Palace, ſuch as it was before the Fall, even as a moſt fair and ſtately Palace; and ſuch it will become again at the Reſurrection of the Dead. Again, many of old taught, and now teach,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Matter or Body has no life or perception, ſenſe or feeling of pleaſure or pain, even when the Soul is in it, and united to it; but that the Soul or Spirit of a man, is the alone ſubject of all ſenſation and percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And becauſe ſome late Philoſophers, ſo called, do not own Beaſts, Fiſhes and Fowls to have any principle in 'em, but meer body or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they deny that they have any ſenſe or perception; but ſay, they are moved by ſprings, and Mechanick motions, like to Watches or Clocks: Hence ſuch cannot but conſequentially deny the Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for if the body be wholly without all ſenſe or perception, either of pleaſure or pain, to what purpoſe ſhould it be raiſed, ſeeing its inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility makes it uncapable either of future felicity or miſery; or any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubject of reward or puniſhment: But this is plain contrary to Chriſts Doctrine, who ſaid, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body; but fear him that can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell-Fire.</hi> Where note theſe 2 things: 1. If the Body can be killed, that has a Life: 2. That it is capable of future
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52479:6"/>
puniſhment as well as the Soul; and conſequently the body of a Saint is capable of a future reward, together with the Soul: and the Scripture teacheth us, that not only the Soul of a true believer, but the Body is for the Lord, and the Lord for it; to wit, that it may be a Temple for the Lord to dwell in, in the future ſtate and world to come; and therefore he who <hi>raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, will alſo raiſe us up by Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. And it is great ignorance in ſuch, and a ſinful excuſe of their great error and unbelief, who ſo frequently ſay, <hi>Let us not be concerned about the manner of the Reſurrection of the Body, ſince it is not diſcovered, nor told us in Scripture what manner of body it ſhall be; but let us live well, and we need not take thought about the Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> For the Scripture doth <hi>plainly tell us</hi> what manner of body it <hi>ſhall be</hi> when <hi>raiſed,</hi> as well as what manner of body it is that is <hi>ſown,</hi> or <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;</hi> It <hi>is ſown natural, it is raiſed ſpiritual,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43. And men cannot live well unleſs they have the true Faith of the Reſurrection of the body; for the unbelief of it leads us to all looſeneſs and <hi>Epicuriſm,</hi> by the plain teſtimony of the Scripture in the foremention'd <hi>Chap.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. <hi>If the dead riſe not</hi> (the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it in the Plural Number, <hi>if dead men riſe not) let us eat and drink for to morrow we die.</hi> And here the Apoſtle is not diſcourſing of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> or riſing of the ſoul out of the death of ſin, as ſome moſt groſly and perverſly think; but of the Reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: alſo the Apoſtle doth moſt excellently argue, <hi>That not to believe the Reſurrection of the dead, is not to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt; and not to believe the Reſurrection of Chriſt, maketh faith vain, and preaching vain: and if faith be vain, they arë yet in their ſins who profeſs faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot live well.</hi> Lo! how the Apoſtle inſeparably linketh all theſe things together; ſo that to break one Link, is to break the whole Chain: See v. 13, 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho both <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> taught many true things of God, and ſome did profeſs to own Gods inbeing in them, and his divine teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, comforts and refreſhments, yet as they taught nothing of that great myſtery of our ſalvation; <hi>Viz.</hi> the Son of God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his coming in the fleſh, his dying for our ſins to reconcile us unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that great propitiatory ſacrifice for all mankind, ſo much of their Doctrine did contradict it. Hence many of the ancient Philoſophers, not underſtanding the ſpiritual ſignification of the <hi>Jews</hi> Sacrifices, as they were Types of Chriſt, that was to be offered up for the ſins of the world
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52479:7"/>
in his body of fleſh, upon the Tree of the Croſs, as accordingly was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, did deride the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Sacrifices, according to that ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Diſtick of <hi>Cato:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Cum tu ſis nocens, cur moritur Victima prote;</l>
               <l>Stultitia eſt morte alterius ſperare ſalutem.</l>
               <l>When thou haſt ſinn'd, why ſhould for thee a Sacrifice be ſlain?</l>
               <l>By another's Death, Life to expect, it fooliſh is, and vain.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And therefore it was that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt crucified was fooliſhneſs to the</hi> Greeks, <hi>that ſought after wiſdom;</hi> To wit, <hi>The Worldly Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;</hi> as well as <hi>a ſtumbling block to the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Both <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Stoicks placed all</hi> their happineſs in an <hi>inward</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple lodged within themſelves, which tho ſome owned to be God, yet they greatly erred in not underſtanding, in acknowledging, <hi>That all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences and communications flow from God into men through the Man Chriſt Jeſus, our alone Mediator:</hi> and therefore any Religion they had was mixt with great ignorance and error, or not underſtanding the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the One Mediator, in whom God has placed <hi>all fullneſs of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influences and communications of Grace and Truth, Light and Life, out of whom we are to receive our ſeveral meaſures,</hi> as our Faith is exerciſed on him, and as our dependance is upon him; even as the Members depend upon the Head, and the Branches on the Root for life and nouriſhment. But they placing <hi>all within themſelves,</hi> even of what they did or could enjoy of God, were in a great error; even as much as who ſhould ſay, <hi>The Branch has all within it that makes it fruitful; or the members of the body have all within them that makes them live and move: ſo no dependance upon the Head, Christ, the Mediator betwixt God and men:</hi> yea this error is ſo great that whoever holds it, as too many do at this day (as well as formerly) they make themſelves as God, or equal to him; for it is the alone perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and dignity of God to have <hi>all within himſelf,</hi> and needing nothing without himſelf; for even the Man Chriſt had not <hi>all from within himſelf;</hi> but hath God to be his Head, as God hath given him to be our Head; as he taught concerning himſelf, <hi>My Father is greater than I:</hi> and as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo he hath given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, that he may quicken whomſoever he <hi>will;</hi> therefore we read that in his prayer to the Father <hi>he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, Joh.</hi> 17. 1. expecting to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52479:7"/>
be heard from thence; yea in his comparing his Diſciples to the <hi>Branches,</hi> and <hi>himſelf</hi> to the <hi>Vine,</hi> and his Father to the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> this great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is held forth, how as our dependance is on the Man Chriſt, ſo his dependance is on the Father; for as the Vine giveth ſap and nouriſhment to the Branches, ſo the Husbandman giveth earth and ſoil to the Vine; it being a great part of the Husbandmans work to put fat or good earth to the root of the Tree, as well as to prune and dreſs the Branches of it: And he did receive of the Father theſe Divine Gifts that he gave and ſtill giveth to his Church.</p>
            <p n="5">5. None of <hi>all the Philoſophers</hi> taught <hi>remiſſion of ſin,</hi> and <hi>juſtificasion by the blood of Christ,</hi> and Faith in it; or underſtood that <hi>Evangelical myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> how Chriſt <hi>was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, and was bruiſed for our Iniquities;</hi> and that <hi>by his ſtripes we are healed;</hi> and how he did bear our ſins in his body on the Tree, and made peace for us by the <hi>blood</hi> of his Croſs. But they placed their whole Acceptance upon their Vertues and good Works, tho divers of them profeſſed <hi>(Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> as well as <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> and particularly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks) That what Vertues and good Works they did bring forth, was from</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſome Divine Thing or Principle within them. But that this was a great Error in them <hi>Paul</hi> doth abundantly prove both out of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> That as the <hi>Jews</hi> were not juſtified before <hi>God</hi> by any Works of the Law, ſo neither were the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but <hi>all were guilty before God:</hi> For <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law; that every mouth may be ſtopt, and the whole world become guilty before God.</hi> Now this that makes the whole world guilty, and ſtops every mouth is the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is <hi>from the divine principle,</hi> ſeeing the greateſt part of the world have no Law without. And therefore he concludes, <hi>That no man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Chriſt; All</hi> are juſtified who have that Faith; which Faith is the gift of God, and is wrought in every one that has it by the mighty power of God; which Faith is a Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith, and is always accompanied with good works.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Tho many of the ancient Philoſophers profeſs'd to believe the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of Souls, and future Rewards and Puniſhments to mens ſouls; yet they had no belief of the Reſurrection of the Body; as is clear not only no from their own books, but alſo from the Teſtimony of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For when <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them at <hi>Athens, Jeſus and the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> certain Philoſophers of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> mocked him, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52479:8"/>
called him <hi>Babler.</hi> Now as this their Denial of the Reſurrection of the Dead, did proceed from the two aforementioned Errors held by many both then and at this day; <hi>viz.</hi> that the body of man was no part of him, but the ſoul's priſon and grave; and that the body has no Life, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, when united to the ſoul: ſo it did proceed from a <hi>3d</hi> groſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as abſurd as any of the 2 former; <hi>viz. That the ſubſtance, or firſt matter of earthly bodies, differ in kind from heavenly bodies; and conſequently that no earthly body is convertible into an heavenly body, and no animal body is convertible into a ſpiritual body:</hi> And from ſuch a great Error the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and unbelier of thoſe floweth, that do not believe that Chriſt's Animal and viſible body, of fleſh and blood, is converted and changed to be now in Heaven a ſpiritual and heavenly body; And as they do not believe this change of Chriſt's body (the ſubſtance remaining the ſame) ſo nor do they believe that the bodies of the Saints ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from animal to ſpiritual, and from Terreſtrial to Coeleſtial and Heavenly, tho the Scripture-teſtimony is plain and expreſs for ſuch a change, the ſubſtance of the body remaining the ſame; For if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance did not remain the ſame, the change would not be a converſion or tranſmutation, but an exchange or permutation; as when one chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Copper for Gold, by ſelling Copper for Gold; this is quite another thing than when Copper is tranſmuted and converted into Gold.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The ancient Philoſophers did not believe any general Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or end of this world; but moſtly they did conceit, That as it was from Eternity in the manner and condition as it is now in, rouling and revolving in a continual ſphere of generation and corruption, even Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables and Animals, as well as Men, ſo it would continue to Eternity in the like manner and condition as it is now in, ſtill running round in a continual ſphere of generation and corruption, and of Living and Dying, and Dying and Living again (but as to this they were divided in Opinions, ſome holding, <hi>That the Souls of Men that were throughly purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Sins and Vices, attained to a ſtate of bleſſedneſs, joy and rest with God, and did never return to live again in the body:</hi> Others holding, <hi>That after ſome long Tracts of Time, Souls might decline from their state of</hi> Felicity, <hi>in</hi> the Divine Fruition, <hi>and ſo deſcend into humane bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.)</hi> But theſe Opinions are contrary to the holy Scriptures, which plainly inform us, That this viſible world had a beginning, and that mankind had a beginning in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> and that the Years of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52479:8"/>
World, <hi>from</hi> Adam <hi>to Christ's coming in the fleſh, are about</hi> 4000 <hi>years,</hi> by <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piure Chronology:</hi> And <hi>as this viſible world had a beginning, ſo it will have an end,</hi> as <hi>the Scripture doth plainly inform us.</hi> But it is <hi>not to be judg'd, That the end of this world will be an anmhilation, or reducing of it to nothing,</hi> as <hi>ſome</hi> imagin, but <hi>only a change,</hi> as the Scripture calleth it. Nor can it be proved either <hi>from Scripture or Reaſon, That this viſible world had its beginning from nothing, or of nothing,</hi> but <hi>ſince</hi> about 5000 years, and ſome odd hundreds; For it is evident from Scripture, that this viſible world did not take its riſe or beginning from meer <hi>nothing,</hi> but from that which <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth, <hi>Gen,</hi> 1. 2. <hi>tohu va bohu,</hi> which the <hi>Septuagint Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> rendereth <gap reason="foreign">

Beſide, that the Worldly Philoſophy for the moſt part is rather a skill to talk of things with a multitude of words, without any true knowledg, than a real ſolid knowledg of them.

            </p>
            <p>And as many of them called Old Philoſophers, held many falſe and abſurd Opinions directly contrary to the Chriſtian Faith, ſo do many of late pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly to Philoſophy among thoſe called Chriſtians, eſpecially the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Profeſſors (ſo called) of Philoſophy in Univerſities and publick Schools of Learning in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> tom whom too many Proteſtant Profeſſors have borrowed ſome of their corrupt Leaven of falſe Philoſophy, which they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52479:10"/>
have mingled with that they call Divinity or Theology, but is not pure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or Theology, not being the Truth as it is in Jeſus, which is free from all mixtures of Error and Falſhood whatſoever. And of ſuch Errors held by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Profeſſors of Philoſophy, I ſhall firſt inſtance ſome concerning body or bodily ſubſtance and matter.</p>
            <p n="1">I. One groſs Error held by them is, <hi>That the quantity, and other accidents of a Body, can ſubſiſt or remain without the ſubſtance.</hi> And on this abſurd Error in that called <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> they build their falſe Faith, that after the <hi>words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,</hi> the quantity of the Bread and Wine, and other accidents of Colour, Smell, Taſte and Feeling, in that called the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> remain in the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wafer or Cake, while the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is gone, and ceaſeth any more to be.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A ſecond groſs Error in their <hi>Philoſophy</hi> is, <hi>That there can be a penetration of bodies and bodily parts?</hi> ſo that one whole body remaing a body ſtill, can be in the ſame place with another body of the ſame quantity, <hi>occupying</hi> the ſame room and ſpace at one and the ſame time, and conſequently that the whole ſubſtance of a man's body may occupy no more room or ſpace than the leaſt grain or atome of bread; and on this abſurd Error they build their falſe Faith, <hi>That the ſame Body of Chriſt that was crucified, and raiſed again, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, is in every grain or atome of the Euchariſtical Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. A third groſs error concerning bodies, they teach, is, <hi>That one and the ſame body in all its parts, undivided one from another, can be in many places at once.</hi> And on this abſurd error they build their falſe faith, <hi>That the viſible Body of Chriſt is in many thouſand places at once, to wit, not only in every conſecrated Cake or Wafer, but in every grain thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. A fourth groſs error they teach, is, <hi>That one body can be tranſubſtantiated into another body;</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>That the ſubſtance or eſſence of the body is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into another ſubſtance or eſſence.</hi> And on this abſurd error <hi>they</hi> build their abſurd Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> affirming, <hi>That the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, or Supper, after Conſecration, is tranſubſtantiated;</hi> that is, changed into the <hi>ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body.</hi> But as the Popiſh error of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> is exceeding groſs and hurtful, ſo is the error of ſome no leſs groſs, but rather much more both groſs and hurtful, who feign, <hi>That the glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt is Omnipreſent,</hi> ſo <hi>not only</hi> attributing to it above what a <hi>Body</hi> is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of in its higheſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exaltation, but what is a proper and peculiar Attribute of God Almighty, and eſſential to him. Into which groſs error having fallen by their great ignorance, they ſeek to defend it, by <hi>groſly</hi> pervetting that place of Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 10. <hi>He that deſcended, is the ſame alſo that aſcended up far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all heavens, that he might fill all things.</hi> But it is not ſaid here, nor any where elſe in Scripture, That his <hi>Body</hi> that was raiſed from the dead filleth all things; but it is <hi>expreſly</hi> ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. <hi>That the heavens muſt receive him, until the time of the reſtitution of all things:</hi> which muſt needs be underſtood of his <hi>Body,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52479:10"/>
or <hi>bodily preſence;</hi> concerning which Chriſt ſaid himſelf, <hi>The poor you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with you, but me ye have not always,</hi> viz. <hi>bodily,</hi> though <hi>ſpiritually preſent.</hi> But I would not have any to think, that I deny, that Chriſt's glorified <hi>Body</hi> can extend its Vertue to men here on earth, as he pleaſeth; for that I readily grant and believe, that both his <hi>Soul and Body</hi> can extend their Vertue, as by <hi>Rays and Beams</hi> to the Saints upon Earth; and no doubt but his Mediatory Spirit and Life doth extend it ſelf into our ſouls. But this is no proof, that Chriſt's <hi>Body</hi> is every where where God is; for ſo to affirm is a groſſer error than that of the <hi>Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> for the Popiſh Doctrine only teacheth a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation of one <hi>body into another,</hi> viz. of the <hi>body and ſubſtance of bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ's Body;</hi> but this teacheth the Tranſubſtantiation of <hi>Chriſt's body into the Godhead;</hi> which is moſt unreaſonable, as well as moſt contrary to Scripture, and is a reviving of the Old <hi>Eutychian Hereſie,</hi> condemned, and that moſt juſtly, by ancient Chriſtians, many Hundred Years ago.</p>
            <p n="5">V. A <hi>5th</hi> groſs error held in common both by Papiſts and many call'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is, <hi>That in the daily generation and corruption of bodies, as when fleſh or wood is conſumed with fire, the body of fleſh or wood is ſubſtantially changed, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſubſtantial form</hi> (ſo called by them) <hi>ceaſing to be, that was formerly in the fleſh or wood, and a new ſubstantial form in the Fire, or ſmoak and aſhes, being newly produced.</hi> And accordingly they moſt falſly teach, That the elements of fire, air, water and earth, differ ſubſtantially in their ſubſtantial and eſſential forms, and that a groſs body cannot be changed into a ſpiritual and ſubtile body, but that there muſt be a change of the ſubſtance. Whence it is that Papiſts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and too many call'd Proteſtants, have ſuch groſs and carnal conceptions of the Resurrection-bodies of the Saints that ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining they muſt be raiſed with groſs fleſh, blood and bones, as they now have, otherwiſe they ſhould not be the ſame bodies in ſubſtance as now they are. Whereas the plain truth is, that bodies can undergo great changes, even the greateſt that are poſſible, from groſs to be exceeding ſpiritual and ſubtile, without any ſubſtantial change, being only changed in accidental forms and modes, but remaining the ſame in ſubſtance; as when the Water was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly changed by Chriſt into Wine; here was no Tranſubſtantiation, or change of the bodily ſubſtance, but only a Transformation, or change of the accidental forms and modes of the Water, into new accidental forms and modes of Wine.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. A <hi>6th</hi> groſs error, common generally both to Papiſts and many called Proteſtants, in that called by them <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> is, that many things which are real ſubſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they hold them to be but accidents, or accidental qualities, as the light or influence of the Sun, or of common fire, they hold to be nothing but accidental qualities; alſo the Emanations that commonly flow from Stones, Minerals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Metals, Herbs and Animals, cauſing <hi>ſympathy and antipathy,</hi> ſome whereof are more manifeſt, that affect our groſs ſenſes of ſmelling, taſting and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52479:11"/>
feeling; others more hidden and occult, as that of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> that draweth Iron to it: they hold them to be accidental qualities, having no real ſubſtance. Whereas the more true and ſincere Philoſophy teacheth, that theſe things are real ſubſtances, being either the Emiſſion or Outflowings (commonly called <hi>effluvia)</hi> of the more ſubtile and ſpiritual parts of theſe bodies, whence they come forth, and proceed from, or the Rays and Beams of ſome Spirits that may be lodged in them. And on this error they build divers abſurd errors in that called their Divinity, both in relation to the bodies and ſouls of men; as firſt in relation to the body: The vertue that went forth from our bleſſed Lord's Perſon, that healed the woman of her <hi>bloody Iſſue,</hi> they hold not to be any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but only an accident or quality. And next in relation to the ſouls of men, that divine vertue of grace, light and life that cometh from Chriſt into the ſouls of men, the Schoolmen commonly both among Papiſts and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants (ſome excepted of Proteſtants, who are more underſtanding) hold, <hi>That it is no ſubſtance, but an accident or quality,</hi> which otherways they call <hi>Habit:</hi> and they commonly define the Grace of God in the ſouls of the Saints to be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but an infuſed ſupernatural habit: and the vertues and fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as Faith, Hope, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they call ſupernatural and infuſed habits and qualities, that are in themſelves of a periſhing Nature; And the ſeed of God in the Saints, they do not hold to be any ſubſtance, but a quality, or infuſed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. And the great occaſion of this their Error, <hi>That Grace is no ſubstance, but an accident</hi> (viz. <hi>habit or quality,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placeth among the Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Accidents) proceedeth from this, That whereas they obſerve the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture diſtinguiſheth betwixt Chriſt and the Grace of Chriſt, as alſo betwixt God and the Grace of God, and betwixt the Holy Ghoſt and that Divine influence that cometh from him into mens ſouls; from thence they infer, That ſeeing that ſeed or influence of God's Grace, is not the Godhead, it muſt be ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, habit or quality infuſed in the ſoul by God, there being, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>no middle being,</hi> of a middle Nature betwixt God and the ſouls of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in this they are greatly miſtaken for there is a <hi>middle being</hi> betwixt the Godhead and the ſouls of men, which is that <hi>Mediatory Spirit, and Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt,</hi> as he was the Heavenly Man, Mediator, Head and High Prieſt and Husband of his Church from the beginning of the World: the which Mediatory Spirit of Chriſt dwells in all fulneſs in the Perſon of our bleſſed Lord, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſuffered death for our ſins, and roſe again, and is aſcended into Heaven, and ſtill dwelleth in him, and of his fulneſs we all receive our ſeveral meaſures, as <hi>John</hi> hath declared, <hi>John</hi> 1. and as <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe hath ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>To every one of us is given grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> And tho the various meaſures of this Mediatory Spirit of Chriſt are not dividable, nor ſeparable one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but moſt inſeparably united, yet a real diſtinction may and ought to be allowed, as betwixt the <hi>Rays and beams of the Sun,</hi> that are inſeparably united
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52479:11"/>
one with another, and all with the Body of the Sun, yet one Ray is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but have a real diſtinction, ſo the particular meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt, called by ſeveral Names and Denominations, as Grace, Truth, Light and Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is in one of the Saints is not the ſame particular and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical meaſure that is in another: And as we are taught not only by expreſs words of Scripture, but by the Saints experience, that there are greater and leſſer, higher and lower meaſures of this Divine Mediatory Spirit, Life and Nature, and Divine Light, this doth ſufficiently prove, <hi>that it is not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or Supream Infinite Being,</hi> called in <hi>Hebrew Enſoph;</hi> for there is nothing in the Supreme Being that can be called <hi>greater or leſſer, higher or lower,</hi> ſeeing every thing in God is moſt infinitely and ſupreamly High and Great; and ſeeing alſo, according to Scripture, <hi>the Father, the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> are this <hi>One only</hi> moſt High and Supream Infinite Being, or Godhead: It muſt needs be confeſſed, <hi>That this Divine Spirit in the Saints, that hath its meaſures higher and lower, is not the Godhead of either the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Son or the Holy Spirit, but the Mediatory Spirit of the Son,</hi> as above-mentioned, in which <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit dwelleth,</hi> as in a moſt glorious Temple, or place of Habitation, called in <hi>Hebrew, Schechina,</hi> i. e. <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Godhead of Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt</hi> dwelleth in the ſame, whoſe Godhead is the ſame with the Godhead of the Father, <hi>moſt immediately,</hi> therefore it is that it receiveth and beareth frequently the Name of the Son, and alſo of <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and is called <hi>the Spirit of the Father,</hi> and alſo <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son.</hi> But it is not to be ſuppoſed, or thought, that this Middle Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more <hi>immediately</hi> near to us than the Godhead, as with reſpect to God's Eſſence or Being, for that doth moſt <hi>intimately,</hi> or <hi>immediately</hi> penetrate all things, and is moſt immediately preſent in all things, but with reſpect of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and Revelation, that infinite Being of the Godhead is ſuch, that <hi>no created underſtanding, or mind of Men or Angels can ſee, or behold his glory:</hi> therefore He is ſaid to be <hi>ſuch</hi> in Scripture, <hi>whom no eye hath ſeen or can ſee,</hi> and <hi>dwelling in the Light which none can approach unto;</hi> for <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi> to wit, as He is in Himſelf, <hi>but the only begotten Son of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who dwelleth in his boſome, hath declared him, who is the Image of the inviſible God, the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs Image or Character of his Substance.</hi> And ſeeing both the Scriptures Teſtimony, and the Saints experience doth prove, that ſomewhat really divine, by way of influence and emanation, doth come into the Souls and Hearts of the Saints from above, even from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Man Chriſt Jeſus, that is glorified in Heaven, called in Scripture, <hi>Grace, Life, Light, Spirit, Power, Vertue,</hi> and is compared to <hi>Rain, Dew, Water, Wine, Oyl, Milk, Honey,</hi> and is called <hi>Metaphorically</hi> by theſe Names. It is certain this Divine Being and Subſtance, that doth ſo deſcend from Chriſt in Heaven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſouls of men here on earth, muſt needs be ſome Middle Nature betwixt God and us, for <hi>the Godhead of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is <hi>one</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52479:12"/>
               <hi>and the ſame Godhead with the Father,</hi> filleth all places, and is in all places, and ſo cannot aſcend, or deſcend, or move from one place to another; therefore that divine vertue and influence of Light, Life and Grace, that deſcendeth and floweth down from above, out of the fullneſs that dwelleth in the glorified Man Chriſt Jeſus, is not <hi>the Godhead,</hi> but ſome Middle Being, called by ſome <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Vehicle, or Chariot of God;</hi> that is a real ſubſtance, and no accident or bare quality, ſeeing, according to the beſt and trueſt Rules of <hi>Philoſophy, Accidens non migrat de ſubjecto in ſubjectum,</hi> Accidents do not move from one ſubject to another. And if Grace were a ſpiritual Accident or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it could not be taken from one and given to another, as the ſlothful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Talent was taken from <hi>him, and given to him that had ten Talents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. There is another great error held by many called <hi>Profeſſors of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> both among Papiſts and Proteſtants, viz. <hi>That the Souls of pious and holy men, have no higher Faculties or Powers but ſuch as are Rational, or diſcurſive,</hi> whereby the Reaſon, or rational Faculty of man's Soul draweth concluſions from certain Premiſſes, the which Premiſſes are either the concluſions of other Premiſſes, hanging together like the Links of a Chain, or ſome Maxims or firſt Principles of the Humane Underſtanding. But many ſuch Maxims call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt Principles, are falſe and unſound Notions, from which muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed falſe and unſound Concluſions, and with ſuch <hi>that called Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy doth abound.</hi> But ſome of <hi>the Antient Philoſophers, as the Platoniſts,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Plotinus,</hi> did hold, <hi>That there was in the ſoul of man a power or faculty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that which is diſcurſive, whereby being aſſiſted by the Divine Light, it could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or elevate it ſelf into God, and be joyned to him, he appearing to the Soul, having neither</hi> Form, <hi>nor any</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> ſimilitude, as <hi>Porphirius</hi> relateth of <hi>Plotinus, that ſo it happened frequently to him, and once ſo to</hi> Porphirius <hi>himſelf:</hi> the <hi>which high attainment and experience</hi> they declared <hi>came to be witneſſed by the Souls paſſing through certain degrees of purification, illumination, and abſtraction from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and fleſhly deſires and affections, yea and by the Souls being raiſed above all its natural powers and faculties of Imagination or Ratiocination, and the actings thereof, to contemplate God alone, and be joyned to him by this one higher power of the Soul,</hi> which <hi>Plotinus,</hi> the <hi>Platonick Philoſopher,</hi> doth ſo diſtinguiſh from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that he calleth it, <gap reason="foreign">

The which divine enjoyment he calleth <hi>a ſilent touch of the Soul whereby it toucheth God,</hi> cap 9. and <hi>whereby the Soul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring it ſelf from all multiplicity (as if a large circle did contract its Rays and Circumference to a ſmall Point or center) into unity, <hi>becometh one, and joyneth Center to Center,</hi> viz. <hi>the Soul's Center to God, its Center,</hi> and this he calleth, <hi>the fleet, or flight, of the one to the one,</hi> cap. 11. By which it appeareth how <hi>much more dark and ignorant the late Schoolmen and</hi> Profeſſors of Philoſophy <hi>are, than theſe ancient</hi> Plaronick Philoſophers were, who profeſſed <hi>ſuch</hi> a divine attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fruition and enjoyment of God, not only without all Words, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52479:12"/>
Objects, but even without all internal <hi>Form, Idea</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing: which ſo <hi>high attainment</hi> of divine knowledge muſt needs be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all intelligent men to have proceeded from ſome real degree of internal divine revelation and inſpiration, a thing ſo much generally now oppoſed, and by none more than by them that are reputed great Scholars and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. But whether theſe above mentioned <hi>Platonick</hi> Philoſophers (who did ſoar more aloft in an High Profeſſion of divine knowledge than all other Sects of them called Philoſophers, did really experience and enjoy <hi>what they did profeſs,</hi> I think it not propor in <hi>this place</hi> much to diſpute; I ſhall only at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent freely declare my Judgment, <hi>That I think it is very probable, that at times, when it was beſt with them, they might have had ſome divine touch, taſte and reliſh of a real divine enjoyment.</hi> But it was not <hi>permanent,</hi> nor abiding <hi>with them;</hi> for had it been ſo, it would no doubt <hi>have brought them further than they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and would have cleared and freed their Minds of thoſe groſs errors that generally they were clouded and entangled with, even <hi>the beſt of them;</hi> for the beſt of them held ſome groſs errors, and had very dark and Obſcure Notions and Conceptions about God and Divine Things, and ſpoke not very certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly of the Felicity of ſouls of Good Men after Death, altho they did generally profeſs to believe the ſouls immortality, and future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not one of them believed the Reſurrection of the Body, as the Scriptures hold it forth; for they generally believed the body was the ſoul's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or grave, and ſo it would be no Felicity to the ſoul to be re-united to it, not underſtanding how the body at the Reſurrection is ſo refined and dignified, yea, glorified, that it ſhall be no <hi>Priſon nor Grave to the Soul,</hi> but a moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Palace and Throne, ſuch as it was to <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Soul,</hi> before he ſinned, and which at the Reſurrection ſhall be enriched with greater Beauty and Glory than it then had. Alſo both <hi>Plotinus</hi> and <hi>Porphirius</hi> were great Enemies to the Chriſtians, and wrote againſt them which plainly enough ſhews they were but dark men, and had at beſt at that time but little acquaintance with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine illumination in their <hi>experience,</hi> notwithſtanding their high <hi>profeſſion of it,</hi> as it is with <hi>too many at this day,</hi> who profeſs the divine Light, and talk much more of it than they walk in it: for if either <hi>Plotinus</hi> or <hi>Porphirius</hi> had been <hi>faithful to that divine illumination</hi> given to them in <hi>common with all mankind,</hi> it would have led them to befriend, and not <hi>to oppoſe the Christians in that time,</hi> when <hi>Christianity</hi> did flouriſh a great deal more in the Purity and true life and power of it, than it did in after-ages.</p>
            <p>And thus I have in 20 divers inſtances, diſcovered the great hurt of the Worldly Philoſophy, its being a great hinderance to the Chriſtian Faith, and a great enemy to the Divine Wiſdom and true divine Philoſophy: by which <hi>Worldly Philoſophy</hi> I underſtand not only that taught by theſe called <hi>ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> but even that lately and at preſent taught by many called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that containeth more hurtful errors than any thing which may happen to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52479:13"/>
taught by them of truth, do profit. So that to paſs a free and impartial Judgment upon all that called commonly <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> both <hi>ancient and modern,</hi> of all the ſorts and ſects of them called <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> it conſiſteth of a <hi>great mixture of error and falſhood, containing many dangerous and hurtful Opinions, but mingled with ſome true Notions of things, that lie ſo obſcure and veiled under the clouds of their many great and dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that until it be better reſined, reformed and purged from the great droſs, filth and poyſon of theſe many hurtful errors wherewithal it doth abound, it ſeemeth to me as well as to many more, that are impartial Judges in the caſe, that the ſtudy of it in this state of ſo great mixture, is rather hurtful than really profitable:</hi> And to ſpend time in turning over the many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of that called <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> to find the pure Truth, either of Things Natural or Divine, is not only to loſe time, but to expoſe the mind to the great danger of being leavened and corrupted with groſs and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful errors tending to overthrow the Chriſtian Faith and to beget in the mind of him that is ſtudious in it, a deep prejudice and enmity againſt the True Divine Philoſophy, and the Truth as it is in Jeſus. But the pious endeavour of ſome late Writers is greatly to be commended, who have attempted to correct and reform the vulgar errors in that called <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> as the Author of the book called <hi>Enchiridion Phyſicae reſtitutae,</hi> and the lately deceaſed, and worthily eſteemed <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Boyl,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And here, before I come to a concluſion of my intended matter, I think to anſwer 2 weighty queſtions, and that very briefly.</p>
            <div type="question">
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>What is the chief cauſe or reaſon, that men generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to ſeek after the True Philoſophy, Wiſdom or Knowledge of Things both Divine and Natural, have ſo greatly miſs'd it, and inſtead of the pure Truth, have embraced Error, for the greateſt part.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The chief cauſe or reaſon is, their too much relying upon their Humane Underſtanding, and the bare exerciſe of Human Reaſon, which they generally made the Rule and meaſuring Line to find out all Truth or True Knowledg in natural things, even as Chriſtians, ſo called, too generally do the ſame at this day; and I wiſh they did not ſo do in the ſearch of Divine Truth alſo, and in the enquiry after the Knowledg of Divine Things. Hence it is that ſome derive the Etymology of the word <hi>mens</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> that ſignifieth the <hi>Mind</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>metiri, to meaſure,</hi> as if the bare mind or humane underſtanding of man, were the meaſure of all truth, at leaſt in the knowledg of natural things.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52479:13"/>
And becauſe they did either wholly, or for moſt part rely upon their humane underſtanding, and bare exerciſe of humane Reaſon, thence it came to paſs, that the divine gift of God, even that divine principle of Light wherewithal Chriſt the eternal word had enlightned them, was neglected, and like the unfaithful and ſlothful ſervant, this divine Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wherewithal they ought to have occupied and traded, they buried in the earth; and thus profeſſing themſelves wiſe, they became Fools: And tho what was to be known of God, had been in ſome meaſure made manifeſt in them, God having ſhewed it unto them by the divine illumination of the eternal word; yet, as <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God;</hi> nor were they thankful: And becauſe they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, but held the Truth in unrighteouſneſs, therefore their fooliſh hearts were darkened and they were given up to vile affections; and this was the more general ſtate of them call'd <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Gentile Philoſophers;</hi> yet I will not judg ſo hardly or uncharitably of them univerſally, becauſe the more ſober and humble minded <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did not profeſs ſo much, but practiſed more and better, and might be, and I believe were in a better ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards God: And tho I ſhall be far from concluding, that they are periſhed, yet whoever of them are ſaved with eternal ſalvation, it is not by any works of Righteouſneſs which they had done, in their meer <hi>Gentile</hi> ſtate, or by any Obedience to any Law or Light whatſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; but by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, all who ever have been or ſhall be ſaved from the beginning of the world to the end of it, have and ſhall obtain eternal Life and Salvation, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath largely declared and proved in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians;</hi> and in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he telleth them, <hi>That by grace they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, through faith, and not by any works they had performed before faith was given them, and wrought in them.</hi> But how the true Faith of Chriſt was wrought in them, in thoſe days, when it was not outwardly preached to them by the Miniſtry of Men, nor by the holy Scriptures, is beſt to leave among the ſecrets of God, till he be pleaſed further to reveal it, ſeeing it is confeſſed generally on all hands, that the Spirit of God was ſufficient to work the true Faith in them, without an Outward Miniſtry; who worketh when, where and how he pleaſeth, who can and doth (no doubt) preach to them born deaf and dumb, whoſe ways are above our ways, and his thoughts above ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The true Divine Philoſophy is a meaſure of the Divine Wiſdom and Knowledg, whether of things Divine or Natural: which the <hi>Mind of Man</hi> receiveth by Divine Illumination, Revelation and Inſpiration, that cometh from the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, the which Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, as it is a ſanctifying Spirit, ſealing to Men their <hi>Adoption;</hi> and is therefore called the <hi>Spirit of Adoption,</hi> all true and ſincere believers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Man Chriſt Jeſus, through true Faith in him, and from God the Father through Chriſt; and this was that Spirit in the Prophets and Apoſtles, that taught them their knowledge of God, and of things both Divine and Natural, and which not only revealed to them, and in them the glorious Attributes and Perfections of the Great Creator, and the great myſteries of his Divine Wiſdom, Counſel and Will, but alſo ſhewed and taught them many things of the Creation, and opened unto them the book of the Creatures, as is largely to be ſeen by ſuch as are <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally minded,</hi> in the holy Scriptures, how excellently the Prophets, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, David, Iſaiah,</hi> and many others were taught in the knowledge of the Creation, as well as of the Creator, by <hi>his Divine Spirit and Light in them.</hi> And this Divine Philoſophy and Wiſdom is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>worldly Philoſophy,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> bid the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> beware of, chiefly and principally in this, that the <hi>Divine Philoſophy</hi> is after Chriſt; that is to ſay, the Spirit of Chriſt doth teach it to all the ſincere Lovers and Profeſſors thereof. But <hi>the worldly Philoſophy</hi> (excepting ſome Fragments of Truth that ſome of theſe called <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi> had, from the common <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination</hi> which was in them, and in all men, but which they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heeded or regarded) did proceed from the <hi>ſpirit of the world,</hi> which is a <hi>ſpirit of error,</hi> and leadeth its followers into all error, as the <hi>ſpirit of Truth leadeth into all Truth;</hi> and therefore <hi>the worldly Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> is called in Scripture, <hi>the fleſhly Wiſdom that is enmity to God.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> called the Doctrines of ſome <hi>falſe Teachers,</hi> that profeſſed <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> in his Day, <hi>the Doctrines of Devils;</hi> ſo well may the falſe Doctrines of them called <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> be called the <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo directly oppoſite to the true Chriſtian Doctrine and Faith taught by Chriſt and the holy Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, recorded in

the holy Scriptures; for indeed moſt, or rather <hi>all the Hereſies,</hi> and <hi>groſs Errors</hi> of the falſe Teachers, pretending to Chriſtianity, ſince the days of the Apoſtles, had their Riſe and Original from the Errors of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers</hi> that went before them, as the Hereſies of the <hi>Arians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Sabellians, Macedonians, Pelagians,</hi> the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and many others, as might be at large demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if it were neceſſary. And as the <hi>Divine Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the <hi>worldly Philoſophy,</hi> in their Riſe and Original, as is above ſaid, ſo in their greatly differing effects; The Divine Wiſdom and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy teacheth the pure Truth, without any mixture of Error or <hi>Falſhood;</hi> the Worldly Philoſophy or Wiſdom, teacheth nothing but Error, Untruth and Falſhood; for what things were or are true that are found in the Sayings or Writings of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> do not properly belong to the <hi>worldly Philoſophy,</hi> but to that <hi>little Seed</hi> of Truth and Light which did at times ſhine in them, but very obſcurely or glimmeringly, becauſe of the great Darkneſs that did for moſt part prevail in them, the which Truth they did generally hold in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared.
