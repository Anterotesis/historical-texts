         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE are taught by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Example, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their Doctrine, and Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread, and Prayer: <hi>As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as you do this, you ſhew forth the Lords Death till he come,</hi> as he hath appointed us, in the firſt to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> Chap. 11. from <hi>ver. 23,</hi> to <hi>ver. 30. For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come. Wherefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and drinketh damnation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body. This is very uſeful for all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Proteſtants, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts or Nonconformiſts, to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on, and keep in their Houſes and Hearts, and to increaſe our Faith, and Repentance and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and other Graces, as Self-denyal and godly Fear, and great hatred of all Sin, that cauſed the Lord Chriſt thus greatly to ſuffer and die for us: We can never love Jeſus Chriſt enough, that ſo Loved us, as to become</hi> a Curſe <hi>for us, to be</hi> made Sin <hi>for us, and</hi> a Surety <hi>and Sacrifice for us; to</hi> pacifie his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wrath <hi>for us, to be our</hi> Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker <hi>and</hi> Mediator<hi>: Oh let theſe great Sufferings of his be a means to Inflame our Love to Chriſt, that we may love him with an enflamed Love, a moſt Superlative and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Love: Can we deny to give up our whole Hearts to him, that was ſo willing to part with his Blood and Life for us, that by Nature were Enemies to him ? yet now he hath Reconciled us by the Death of his Croſs.</hi>
