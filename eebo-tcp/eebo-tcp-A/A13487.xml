            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue heere made bold to present to your illiterate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, a beggerly Pamphlet of my threed-bare inuention: I doe assure you that I was more troubled in studying where to finde a fit Patron, then I was in writing the Booke; I thought to haue dedicated it to Beggers Bush neere <hi>Andeuer,</hi> or to his Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne brother within a mile of <hi>Huntington:</hi> but I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at last, that the laps of your long Coate could shelter me as well <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

my loue and paines with as much more. It may be that your high affaires (wherein you are continually pestred with needlesse imployments) rubs your minde quite from the Ryas, that you doe not see in what declining predicament your owne sometimes esteemed quality is: for the dayes hath beene that many men kept Fooles, but now (to saue that charge) the most part of such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors performe the function themselues: So that if you take not a speedy order, fooling will bee as common as begging or whore-maisters, and the sight or presence either of your worthy selfe, or any of your long-taild tribe (which was wont to be seene and heard with admiration) will be no more regarded. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent which, I would counsell you to make a Corporation of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that none shall intrude into the society hereafter, but such as shall be Apprentizes to the quality, of which those that are now liuing, to contribute toward the building or purchasing of a Hall, your selfe (during your life) to be perpetuall Maister of the Company.

But for aught I see, you neede not feare that he will preuent you in this Monopoly, hee being so farre from the sufficiencie of a generall super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, that he is esteemed unworthy to be a setter vp of the trade: for mine owne part, a Beadles place is onely my ambition, to whip those out of the Society that are malapert fooles, surcie fooles, prodigall fooles, courteous fooles, proud fooles, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fait fooles, or any one that is more Knaue than Foole. Apart of <hi>Bridewell</hi> would serue silly for a Hall, and the Armes of the brotherhood shall be an Asses head Dormant, in a field Gules, with a Bable and three Coxcombs rampant, and two morice-bels pendant, with a Whip passant lashant for the Crest, the Esouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mantled with powdred Vermine.

            <l>A Prince (amidst his cares) may merry be,</l>

            <l>At last, vpon a time the Lord and's Foole,</l>
            <l>Walk'd after Dinner their hot bloods to coole,</l>

            <l>Since (quoth the Foole) you for my Iudgement call,</l>
            <l>I thinke it best we straight wayes hang them all.</l>
            <l>That were great pitty, then the Lord reply'd</l>

            <l>Th' are Christians (although beggers) therefore yet</l>
            <l>Hanging's vncharitable, and vnsit.</l>
            <l>Tush (said the Foole) they are but beggers thoe,</l>
            <l>And thou canst spare them, therefore let them goe:</l>
            <l>If thou wilt doe, as thou hast done before,</l>

leg or eye, or some such maim; then imagine that there passeth by him some Lord, Knigt, or scarce a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it makes no matter which, then his Honour or his Worship shall be affronted in this manner:</p>
            <p>Braue man of Honour, cast a fauourable looke vpon the wounded estate of a distressed Gentleman, that hath borne Armes for his Countrey in the hottest broyles of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds,</hi> with the losse of his members; <hi>Cleueland</hi> hath felt my strength; I haue bickered with the French, at <hi>Brest</hi> &amp; <hi>Deep</hi>; I haue past the Straights, the dangerous Gulph: the Groyne can speake my seruice (Right Honorable) with no lesse then two dangerous hurts hardly brought off from <hi>Bummil</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, which I would vnwillinly discouer to your manliness, whose beliefe shall be therein as much auailable as eye sight. Fortune hath onely left me a tongue to bemone my losses, and one eye to be witnesse of your noble bountie; I would be loth to weary your Lordship with the relations of my trauels, to whom the storie of these warres are as familiar as to my self; your worthy liberalitie is the spurre to valour, and the saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his country; and in your honorable memorie my tong shall supplys the defects of my limbes, and proclaime your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through the 17 Prouinces, whither your bountie shall beare this witherd bodie, to interre it with the bloud which I left there as a pledge of my returne.</p>
            <p>This is the martiall or decaied military kind of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; which if he speed, then he can fit himselfe with a prayer accordingly, for the prosperitie of his liberall benefactor, as thus:</p>
            <p>Peace be to thy loines (Right honourable) and plentie at thy board, oppression in the country, and extortion in the citie, embroder thy carkas, and keepe thy Concubine constant, that Taylers may sue to thee for worke, more then for pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:18857:13"/>
and Sericants may stand and gaze at thy faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse by the Compters, whist thy coach mares shall whurrie thee free from Attachments.</p>
            <p>Then (after a scrub or shrug) you must conceiue that he meetes with a Lawyer, and fitting his phrase to his language, he assaults him thus, and ioynes issue.</p>
            <p>Humbly sheweth to your good Worship, your poore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant hauing aduanced his bill in the late warres of Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Copenhage, and Stock Holland; after Replications in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and Reiovnders drawne, with bloudy pens and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full characters, your petitioner ioyned issue in that fearfull day of hearing, at the grand castle of Smolesco, where he came off with the losse of his inheritance, hauing the euidence of his limbes violently rent from him, to make open passage to the beneuolent charitie of such of such pious persons as is your good worship; for you are the true souldiers of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whose warres concerne the domestique peace of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as such as my selfe doth the forreine. My breeding was Gentle, Sir, and my birth English, a younger brother, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to my shifts, to auoide the soule accidents of home-bred miseries; I measured forrein paces, and was deliuerd abroad of my breeding at home, in which estate the hand of your bountie must support me, or else calamitie will crawle euer me, which hath no Surgeon but the gallowes, to which I hope the Law will not deliuer me, seeing it carries so faire a face as the reuerend aspect of your maisterships countenance.</p>
            <p>By this time you must suppose that his bount be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awak'd he giues him somewhat; when with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent prayer he thus takes his <hi>benevale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May the Termes be euerlasting to thee, thou man of tong, and may contentions grow and multiply, may Actions beget Actions, and Cases engender Cases as thicke as hops, may
<pb facs="tcp:18857:13"/>
euery day of the yeare be a Shroue tuesday; let Proclamations forbid fighting, to increase actions of battry, that thy Cassock may be three pilde, and the welts of thy gowne may not grow thread bare.</p>
            <p>Perhaps he meetes with some countrey Farmer, or some honest Russet home-spun plaine-dealing plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iogger, whom he assaults with a volley of lyes and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadoes, in maner and forme following.</p>
            <p>You shall do well to take notice (countryman and friend) that I am a souldier and a gentleman, who hauing bin made Fortunes tennis ball, was lately cast vpon these coasts of my country by the mercilesse crueltie of the raging tempestuous seas, where I haue bin in that distresse that the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world durst not so much as looke on: mine Armes hath bin feared by all the enemies that euer beheld them aduanc'd, and my command hath bin dreadfull through Europe, Asia, Africa and America, from the Suns Easterne rising to his Westerne declination. I was the first man that entred (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight the mouth of the cannon) into the famous city of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trega, a citie fiue times greater then Constantinople, where the great Turke then kept his Seraglio, Basha Caphy, Basha Indae, and Mustapha Despot of Seruia being my prisoners, whose ransomes yeelded my sword three millions of Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian duckets; with which returning, thinking to make thee and the rest of my nation rich, the ship which transported me (being ouerladen) tooke such a leake that she sunke, not a mortall eye being able to see one pennie of that vncountable treasure, my selfe (as you see preserued) a miserable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of vnfortunate chance, for getting astride vpon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myculuering of brasse, I was weather-beaten three leagues; on shore, as you see, an ominous map of manquelling calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the reliefe whereof, my fellow and friend, (for so my
<pb facs="tcp:18857:14"/>
now pouertie makes me vouchsafe to call thee) I must intreat thy manhood, by offering a parcell of thy substance; make no delayes, Sir, for I would be loth to exercise my valour on thee, and make thee the first Christian that should feele the impregnable strength and vigour of my victorious arm, which hath done to death so many Turkes, Pagans and Infidels as cannot truly be numbred.</p>
            <p>After all this superfluous fustian, the poore man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly drawes and giues him some small mite, more for feare or lying, then either for loue or charitie. His fury being abated, he takes his leaue thus:</p>
            <p>Faire be thy Haruest, and foule thy winter, that plentie may fil thy barnes, and feare of scarcitie raise thy price, may thy Landlord liue vnmarried, that thy fine may not be raisde, to buy thy new Landladie a French petlicoate or a new Blocke Beauer, nor thy rents raisde to keepe her tire in fashion.</p>
            <l>INuention many thousand waies could go,</l>
            <l>To shew their variations to and fro:</l>
            <l>
               <note place="margin">A Iustice of peace is as the world to a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a Beadle as the flesh, and a Constable as the diveil.</note>For as vpon the soule of man attends,</l>
            <l>The world, the flesh, the diuell, (three wicked friends)</l>
            <l>So likewise hath a begger other three,</l>
            <l>With whom his humour neuer could agree.</l>
            <l>A Iustice, to the world he doth compare,</l>
            <l>
               <note place="margin">A Iustice will wink or conniue at a beggers faults often, partly for pity, &amp; partly to a cold trouble</note>And for his flesh, a Beadle is a snare:</l>
            <l>But he that he of all accounts most euill,</l>
            <l>He thinks a Constable to be the deuill.</l>
            <l>And 'tis as easie for him as to drinke,</l>
            <l>To blind the world, and make a Iustice winke:</l>
            <l>The Beadle (for the flesh) 'is little paine,</l>
            <l>
               <note place="margin">A whipping wil be looue cured.</note>Which smart he can recouer soone againe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18857:14"/>But yet the Diuells (the Constable) a spirit,</l>
            <l>From hole to hole that hunts him like a ferrit,</l>
            <l>Both day and night he haunts him as a ghost,<note place="margin">A Constable in a Bugbeare to a begger.</note>
            </l>
            <l>And of all furies he torments him most.</l>
            <l>All's one for that, though some things fa'l out ill,</l>
            <l>A begger seldome rides vp Holborne hill:</l>
            <l>Nor is he taken with a theeuish trap,</l>
            <l>And made dispute with Doctors <hi>Stories</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sybutae</note> cap.</l>
            <l>A common theefe, for euery groute he gaines,</l>
            <l>His life doth venture, besides all his paines:</l>
            <l>For euery thing he eates, or drinkes, or weares,</l>
            <l>To lose his eares, or gaine a rope he feares.</l>
            <l>But for a begger, be it hee or shee,</l>
            <l>They are from all these choaking dangers free.</l>
            <l>And though (for sinne) when mankind first began,</l>
            <l>A curse was laid on all the race of man,</l>
            <l>That of his labours he should liue and eate,</l>
            <l>And get his bread by trauell and by sweate:</l>
            <l>But if that any from this curse be free,</l>
            <l>A begger must he be, and none but he.</l>
            <l>For euery foole most certainly doth know,</l>
            <l>A begger doth not dig, delue, plow, or sow:</l>
            <l>He neither harrowes, plants, lops, fels, nor rakes,</l>
            <l>Nor any way he paines or labour takes.</l>
            <l>Let swine be meazeld, let sheepe die and rot,</l>
            <l>Let moraine kill the cattell, he cares not:</l>
            <l>He will not worke and sweat, and yet hee'l feed,</l>
            <l>And each mans labour must supply his need.</l>
            <l>Thus without paines of care, his life hee'l spend,</l>
            <l>And liues vntill he dies, and there's an end.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:18857:15"/>But I this reekning do of beggry make,</l>
            <l>That it much better is to giue then take:</l>
            <l>Yet if my substance will not serue to giue,</l>
            <l>Lie (of my betters) take, with thankes, and liue.</l>
