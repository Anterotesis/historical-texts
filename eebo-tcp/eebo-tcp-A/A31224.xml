            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The last Piece, which came abroad under my obſcure name, was <hi>The Travels of the Embaſſy from the Duke of Holſtein, into Muſcovy, and Perſia.</hi> The excellent Perſon who was the original Author of it, <hi>Olearius,</hi> oblig'd, with us, most of the Neighbouring Nations, who alſo rendred his work into their ſeveral Languages. I am told it was not unkindly receiv'd here; onely the occaſion I have to ſpeak of it now, is, that the coming forth of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, with greater luſtre, than haply it had done otherwiſe, is, among thoſe of ſome others, due to your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
            <p>But I am not to date your notice of me from that; I must deſcend much lower, to a Time wherein you thought it dangerous to know, or be known to, many. Be not ſtartled; when dangers are over, there remains onely a pleaſing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them. It was, long before the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> at <hi>Derby-Houſe,</hi> was advanc'd into a <hi>Councel of State,</hi> an Age ſince, conſidering the ſubſequent reign of Tyranny and Barbariſm, and the perpetual alarms and frights, whereto worry'd Loyalty was every where expos'd. Theſe you have happily weather'd out, and ſeen the contrivers thereof at last overtaken by the ſlow pace of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, an advertiſement to All <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58823:3"/>
and <hi>Lay-Elders,</hi> who either gratulate or envy you the favours of a Prince, for whom you would have run yet greater hazards.</p>
            <p>As to the Piece I now preſent you with, I have onely this to ſay. It is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Relation, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>D. Alonſo de Caſtillo Savorſano,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author of that Nation. One of the most refin'd Wits of <hi>France</hi> thought it worth his pains, to render it into the Language of his Country, with all the graces and advantages it might derive from either. I have done it out of the latter, with a freedome of alteration and addition, as my fancy led me, to make it the most divertive I could in ours, which is the onely recommendation of all things of this nature. My Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes his Readers a continuation of the Story, if what is already publiſh'd be kindly entertain'd: I do mine, the like, upon the ſame precaution; but with this particular inducement, That it will give me further occaſion to aſſure the world how much I am,</p>

            <head>The Firſt Book.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is a Treatiſe in the Spaniſh Tongue, entituled IL PICARO, which being rendred into Engliſh, under the Title of THE ROGUE, or, <hi>The Life of Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> the humour took ſo well in this Nation, that He and his Rogueries were ſeveral times committed to the Preſs. The Deſign of that Work was to repreſent a Perſon, on whom either Nature, or a ſtrange aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>Mercury</hi> had beſtowed ſo liberal a Talent of cheating, thieving, and circumvention, that he not onely trapan'd all he dealt with, but alſo became a Precedent and Pattern to all thoſe, who, out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or inclination, have been forc'd to live by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58823:6"/>
their ſhifts, or, as ſome would have it, by their wits. The preſent Tract hath ſome reſemblance to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Piece before mentioned, inaſmuch as it brings in a Woman, engag'd in as great deſigns as thoſe of her Predeceſſor <hi>Guzman,</hi> but with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that the weakneſs of her Sex obliges her to make uſe of the aſſiſtances of Men for the better proſecution thereof. Both Treatiſes were originally written in the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> a Language we are oblig'd to for moſt pieces of this nature: and as, in the former, the Relation is pleaſantly interrupted by certain merry tales and ſtories; ſo in ours, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of Novels, to heighten the Reader's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and divertiſement.</p>
            <p>The draught I am to give of this Miracle of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſubtilty may be of very great advantage to three ſorts of perſons. Thoſe who feel in themſelves a certain diſpoſition to be wicked, may be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and reform, before they have occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; they, who, defying all advertiſement, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be miſchievous, may, out of an apprehenſion of the enſuing puniſhment, be deterr'd into cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the innocent and vertuous may learn a leſſon of prudence and circumſpection, to avoid thoſe ſnares that are laid for them. The things I write are not ſuppoſititious, or fram'd in my own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſuch as really happened in one of the moſt eminent Cities of <hi>Spain;</hi> which yet if any man have not faith enough to believe, I have no other advice to give him, but that he would travel to thoſe places, where our Scene lies, to diſprove me.</p>
            <p>As to her Perſon, She was young, ſprightly, and very beautiful; three dangerous advantages, when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58823:6"/>
they are attended by thoſe endowments for which ſhe was no leſs famous, to wit, Craft, Impudence, Hypocriſie, and an inſatiable longing for the goods of other people; and all theſe ſtrengthned by a bent of nature, as being the iſſue of Parents, who, inſtead of giving a timely check to theſe vicious inclinations, rather incourag'd her in them by their example, as being addicted to the ſame themſelves.</p>
            <p>Seignor <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> Father to this excellent perſon whoſe atchievments we intend to deſcribe, had been condemn'd to the Galleys, for having aſſum'd to himſelf the Order of the Knighthood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had made the neceſſary trials, upon which his Majeſty beſtows that honour, by the judgment of his Soveraign Council of <hi>Portugal.</hi> His deſign in doing it, was that he might more conveniently follow his profeſſion of ſtealing about the Court, where he was reſpected as a Knight, and the better, under that cloak, to play thoſe pranks of villany, wherein he was ſuch a Profeſſor, that the moſt expert might have heard his Lectures. A certain Woman, whom he us'd to trade withall, incens'd againſt him upon the account of ſome jealouſie, that he reſerv'd not all his kindneſs for her, put in a charge againſt him, the iſſue whereof was, That he got the ſaid preferment in the Galleys; where he paſs'd over the term of his condemnation, and ſomewhat more. He was diſpos'd into that Squadron, which is called the Squadron of <hi>Spain,</hi> and tranſlated from <hi>Toledo</hi> to S. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Port, with the reſt who were in the ſame Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Slavery. He had made an attempt to recover his liberty, but the plot being diſcover'd, he was put to greater hardſhip than he had otherwiſe been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58823:7"/>
As ſoon as the Lady <hi>Eſtephania</hi> (ſo was called the jealous Woman, who had ſhewn him that trick) underſtood that he was gone to exerciſe that painful employment, though ſhe were not of an over-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate nature, very ſeriouſly repented her, that ſhe had been the cauſe of his miſery, and conſider'd that ſhe could not make a better ſatisfaction for that injury, than by proffering her ſelf to him in marriage as ſoon as the time of his penance were expir'd. What inclin'd her the more to this kind of reparation, was, that ſhe had already had a Daughter by him, which Daughter is the ſubject of the preſent Treatiſe. With this reſolution, ſhe left the Court, and went to <hi>Sevil,</hi> hoping, in that great and famous City, ſhe might the ſooner hear ſome news of him, whom ſhe had reduc'd to ſo great miſery, and whom ſhe would gladly once more ſee at liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſtephania</hi> had a houſe very well furniſh'd, being a <hi>Genoeſe</hi>'s Widow, who had left her very well to paſs. That, and the care ſhe took to go ſomewhat high in cloaths, gain'd her ſuch a repute at <hi>Madrid,</hi> that ſhe was look'd on as a perſon of ſome quality: but ſhe ſoon loſt that, when the hiſtory of her life came to be known, eſpecially this particular of it, that, out of an exceſs of jealouſie, ſhe had preferr'd to the Galleys a young Gallant, whom ſhe had often entertain'd in a feather-bed. That imprudent ſally made her abhominable in the ſight of her moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintances of her own ſex, whoſe indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhe allow'd to be the more juſt againſt her, when ſhe conſider'd, that ſhe had caſt away her ſelf on an impoſtor and a raſcal fit onely for the Galleys.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons and reproaches oblig'd her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58823:7"/>
from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Sevil,</hi> taking all ſhe could conveniently carry along with her, and ſelling the reſt, which brought her in a conſiderable ſumme of mony. Having thus order'd her affairs, ſhe went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sevil</hi> by Coach, with two Maids to wait on on her, intending to continue there, till the time of <hi>Trapaſſa</hi>'s ſerving in the Galleys were expir'd; which being near out, (for ſhe kept an exact account of it) ſhe underſtood that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Galleys were arrived at S. <hi>Mary's Port.</hi> She immediately went thither, not ſo highly clad as ſhe was wont to go at <hi>Sevil,</hi> but in a more modeſt habit, that it might not be afterwards caſt into her diſh, that ſhe had been the wife of a Galley-ſlave, and withal one ſhe had courted out of his chains into her embraces.</p>
            <p>She immediately underſtood that her Gallant was in the Captain's own Galley, very jocund, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the office of a Fore-man, a preeminence among the Slaves which exempts them from rowing, and he had acquir'd it of the General by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of his converſation; nay, had he not had that charge, he was by this time grown ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Galleys, that he minded not much whether ever he got out of them. But the arrival of <hi>Eſtephania</hi> remedi'd all. Her firſt buſineſs was to treat about his liberty, ſpeaking to thoſe perſons on whom the buſineſs depended, and preſenting them with certain ſumms of mony, before <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> had any knowledge of her deſign, whom he could not have ſeen, as having not yet ſtirr'd out of the Galley. So that he was extremely aſtoniſh'd, when he came to underſtand, that ſome perſons did not onely uſe bare ſolicitations in order to his liberty, but were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58823:8"/>
alſo liberal of their mony to procure it, yet could it never come into his thoughts, that his old Love <hi>Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phania</hi> ſhould have chang'd the cruel humour, he had left her in, into one ſo mild and obliging.</p>
            <p>All things being concluded and agreed upon for <hi>Trapaſſa</hi>'s liberty, his chains were knock'd off, and he was told, that he might go whether he would. In the mean time he could not imagine who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd him that happineſs, which was no ſmall one, inaſmuch as though the poor Slaves have ſerv'd out the time of their condemnation, yet are there ſome cauſes found that hinder their being ſet at liberty, nay ſome are ſo unhappy, that having been condemn'd for four years, are forc'd to ſtay there five, or ſix.</p>
            <p>Seignor <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> was extremely aſtoniſh'd, when he found himſelf in the preſence of his <hi>Eſtephania,</hi> and underſtood, that it was onely by her means he had recover'd his liberty; ſhe receiv'd him into her arms, and he, to expreſs his gratitude, return'd ſo obliging a reception with the like careſſes; ſo that the kindneſs he then receiv'd of her, made him forget the reſentment he might have of the miſeries ſhe had occaſion'd him. He was troubled to find her in a much different habit from that he had left her in at <hi>Madrid,</hi> for he knew not that it was out of deſign ſhe had ſo diſguis'd her ſelf, nor could ſhe at that time give him an account of it, by reaſon of the Captain and others being preſent, who had conducted him, and whom ſhe was oblig'd to entertain at dinner. Having treated them as well as ſhe could, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, ſave onely <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who continu'd ſtill in the Inne with his Miſtreſs. Finding themſelves alone, they reiterated their careſſes, and outvy'd one the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58823:8"/>
other in aſſurances of the ſatisfaction they conceiv'd at that interview. <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> render'd her his thanks with all the grateful acknowledgments imaginable, for the pains ſhe had taken, and the goodneſs ſhe had had to deliver him out of the cruel torments he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. On the other ſide, <hi>Eſtephania</hi> begg'd his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the miſchief ſhe had done him, and all the miſeries her malice had caus'd him, telling him withall, that ſhe could not imagine any other way to repair the injury ſhe had done him, than by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands with him in matrimony, if he lik'd the propoſal, ſince ſhe already had a daughter by him, and wealth enough for both of them to live at their eaſe.</p>
            <p>I leave you to judge whether this motion were not pleaſing to <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> one that would have ſnapp'd at the leaſt proffer of good fortune, upon his coming out of ſo ſevere a School of penance. As if he had forgot the former, his Anſwer was in renew'd em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, thereby ſatisfying her with what joy he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the advantageous offer ſhe made him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her to give him an account of his Daughter, whom he was paſſionately deſirous to ſee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſtephania</hi> over-joy'd to find his ſentiments ſo conſonant to her expectation, preſented him with a noble riding-ſuit, which ſhe had purpoſely caus'd to be made for him, and the next morning betimes they took their journey towards <hi>Sevil,</hi> where <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> finding his Daughter (who might then be about eight years of age) he acted a part he never had done before, that is, was ſolemnly married to the Lady <hi>Eſtephania, in facie Eccleſiae.</hi> They chang'd their lodgings, and indeed the quarter of the City where
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58823:9"/>
they had liv'd, being reſolv'd to lead another kind of life than they had done before. For <hi>Eſtephania</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that the hardſhip which her dear Love had endur'd in the Galleys, had abated ſomewhat of his former extravagancies, and that the grey hairs he had brought thence would reclaim him from his debauches, endeavour'd to get him ſome creditable employment in <hi>Sevil,</hi> as well to keep him out of idleneſs, as out of a conſideration that he ſhould bring in ſomething towards the houſe. But an untoward diſpoſition, ſuch as was that of <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> is not ſo eaſily brought into diſcipline, and if he had as yet behav'd himſelf with ſome reſerv'dneſs, it proceeded from the influence, which the perpetual admonitions and rebukes of his wife had over him, and not out of any bent to vertue in his nature; ſo that, through his own neglect, he could find himſelf no other employment, than that of frequenting Gaming-houſes, and Plays, and thoſe other places, where thoſe, who are naturally inclin'd to ſloth, think fit to ſpend the greateſt part of their time. This carriage of his extremely troubled his wife, who yet willing to avoid all matrimonial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, wink'd at his diſorders, and endeavour'd to find ſome comfort in the converſation of her Daughter, whoſe beauty was already become the common diſcourſe of the City.</p>
            <p>Idleneſs, the ſeminary of all ſorts of vices, by degrees brought <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> into his former cuſtom of Gaming (the Sea wherein ſo many Eſtates are wrack'd) ſo that beginning at firſt to play for little (as if it had been rather for Recreation than otherwiſe) but afterwards venturing more and more, he in a ſhort time made a ſhift to lavander whatever he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58823:9"/>
could lay hands on of his wife's. She was ſenſible enough, that many of her things were wanting, and doubted not but her Husband was the conveyer of them; but all ſhe could do was to weep, and bemoan her ſelf, charging none with her misfortune, but her ſelf. <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> perceiving her ſo much troubled, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reformation; but the damn'd lechery of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevailing more and more upon him, his luck was ſuch, that in four years he either ſold or pawn'd whatever was worth it in his houſe. Finding himſelf at laſt reduc'd to very great neceſſities, he began to caſt about how he might recover himſelf a little: he would have been content his wife (who was as yet handſome enough) ſhould have condeſcended to lewdneſſes unworthy her recover'd reputation, but he perceiv'd ſhe was grown ſo honeſt, and ſo alter'd from what ſhe had been before, that he had not the confidence to ſpeak to her of any ſuch thing. For ſhe was ſo extremely troubled at the diſorder'd demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her husband, that ſhe grew in a manner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of all things; nay ſhe little minded the education of her daughter, who was by this time come into the—<hi>teens,</hi> and, by reaſon of theſe diſtractions in the family, liv'd as ſhe pleas'd her ſelf, appearing every day at her window, and that not with little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</p>
            <p>The grief and regrets which poor <hi>Estephania</hi> conceiv'd at her being reduc'd to neceſſity, heightned by the diſcontent caus'd her by her husband, brought her into a ſickneſs, whereof ſhe died about a year after, with a perfect repentance for her paſt miſ-carriages, reinforcing at that extremity all her ſpirits, that ſhe might die as happy a death, as her husband
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58823:10"/>
had occaſion'd her living an unhappy life. She was very poorly buried, <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> having not the means to beſtow any more coſt upon her than he did. He was in his turn troubled, at her death, and acknowledg'd, but too late, his great overſight in that he had ſo long continu'd his debauches, and that if he had follow'd her good advice, he might have liv'd handſomely all the reſt of his days. All the comfort he had now left, and all the hope on which he grounded his happineſs, was the beauty of his Daughter, which he thought ſuch, as would bring him a Son-in-law, that might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his neceſſities; never conſidering that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Age conſiſts in wealth, and that all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and graces have no charm in them, if depriv'd of the attractions of riches.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> as cruſh'd as he was with miſeries, continu'd ſtill a conſtant frequenter of the Gaming-houſes, not indeed to play himſelf, for he had not wherewith, but to receive what he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given, to wit, the <hi>Barats,</hi> a little preſent the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are wont to beſtow on thoſe, who look on them while they are playing, when they have had a good hand, and this is commonly the ſureſt revenue of thoſe who have ruin'd themſelves by Gaming.</p>
            <p>The little aboad which <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> made at his own houſe gave his daughter the greater freedom to follow her own inclinations. She would be perpetually at the window, which induc'd abundance of young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantillos to make their appearances in the ſtreet ſhe liv'd in. The Father, who was not ignorant of what paſs'd, though he might have prevented, yet wink'd at it, out of the deſire he had to ſee his daughter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly match'd, that ſhe might afterwards help
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58823:10"/>
him out of his neceſſities. This indeed was the moſt likely means he had to recover himſelf. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon left the little <hi>Rufina</hi> (ſo was his daughter called) to her own liberty, hoping, that, by her inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, ſhe would in time have the diſpoſal of their hearts and purſes who courted her. His deſign prov'd more fortunate than he had imagin'd, inaſmuch as among the many, who languiſh'd for her, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be one very rich, who was over head and ears in love with <hi>Rufina.</hi> She aſſum'd the title of <hi>Donna,</hi> a title belongs onely to women of noble extraction, becauſe her Mother had taken it before her, which if ſhe had not, her Daughter would not have balk'd it, as being an honour which coſts little or nothing.</p>
            <p>The perſon who was ſo remarkably her Suitor had the Agency of ſome affairs of <hi>Peru,</hi> one whoſe credit much exceeded his eſtate, was accounted very rich in the enſuring Office belonging to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and about fifty years of age. Though he knew well enough that his Miſtreſs had no fortune, and that he muſt withall be charg'd with the ruin'd perſon her Father, yet was he reſolv'd to take her, <hi>for better, for worſe;</hi> whence may be deduc'd this obſervation, That when Love becomes Maſter of an aged perſon, it is a very hard matter to diſpoſſeſs him. <hi>Laurentio de Saravia</hi> (ſo was this amorous Elder called) was ſo beſotted with the beauties of <hi>Rufina,</hi> that the Treaty of Marriage was concluded in leſs than eight daies, and he had the earneſt of a happineſs, which he thought would have laſted as long as he liv'd. He took his Father-in-law into his houſe, though he knew him to be a great Gameſter. The firſt days of the Nuptials were ſpent as they are wont to be in ſuch Solemnities; he gave
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58823:11"/>
his wife new cloaths, rings, and jewels, yet ſuitably to her condition; for being a perſon pretty well ſtricken in years, he was no lover of exceſs, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which pleas'd not <hi>Rufina,</hi> who minded nothing ſo much as gaudy cloaths, and long'd for whatever ſhe ſaw worn by women of a quality much above hers; and this abated not a little of the love ſhe bore her husband, who was of an <hi>Indian</hi> diſpoſition, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and careful to preſerve his eſtate. Knowing, as I told you, that his Father was a great Gameſter, and a perſon run out of all he had, he truſted not his wife with the keeping of his Caſh, no not with the management of what was ſpent in the houſe; which quite defeated the hopes of <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who imagin'd, that, upon the marriage or his daughter, he ſhould command what were in her power; ſo ſtrangely was he poſſeſt with the reſtleſs ſpirit of gaming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina,</hi> perceiving her husband was taken up with his affairs, took occaſion to go abroad every morning, upon pretence of a certain devotion ſhe had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, that it might pleaſe God to make her a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. With this excuſe ſhe blinded her husband, but the true motive of her ſallies, was to ſhew her ſelf in the Streets and at Church. The firſt of thoſe who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſight of her, fell in love with her, was a Citizen's ſon of <hi>Sevil,</hi> one of the moſt debauch'd young men of his time, one, to ſay all of him in a word, who had brought himſelf almoſt to the ſame condition as <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſa:</hi> he was deſcended of vertuous Parents, but his diſorders had drown'd their good reputation. His name was <hi>Ruperio,</hi> a Spark of a goodly preſence, and one who prov'd ſo fortunate in the courting of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> that ſhe was wholly at his devotion, hoping to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58823:11"/>
receive ſuch great preſents from him, as might put her into cloaths ſutable to her beauty, which was more than ſhe could have expected from the Miſer her husband.</p>
            <p>The firſt demand ſhe made to him, was very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, conſidering it came from a Merchant's wife, to wit, that he would beſtow on her a Gown of the ſame Stuff and Faſhion as a Neighbour of hers had, whom ſhe named, and withall a gold-watch to hang by her ſide, promiſing him in requital of that favour that ſhe would not deny him any that lay in her power. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> who by his inſolent boaſtings had raiſed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perſuaſion of his being a perſon that had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at his command, promis'd to do what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd; but being not able to perform, he ſet his wits to ſhew that trick, which his purſe could not. He happened to be well acquainted with her whoſe Gown was to be his pattern, he went to her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to lend it him, pretending it was onely for the repreſentation of a Comedy, which was to be acted in a Nunnery. It could not be deni'd on ſuch an account; ſo that at the end of three days, which time he told <hi>Rufina</hi> that it would be making, he ſent it to her houſe, while her husband was abroad in the City about his buſineſs. The Watch he told her was not yet finiſh'd, but that as ſoon as it were, it ſhould be brought her, intreating her in the mean time to accept of another of leſſer value, as a hoſtage for the appearance of the other. She return'd him her hearty thanks, was extremely pleas'd to ſee that he had been ſo punctual, and to ſhew her ſelf grateful, ſhe gave him all the ſatisfaction he could expect from her.</p>
            <p>He took leave of <hi>Rufina,</hi> who reſolv'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58823:12"/>
her husband, that a certain Kinſman of hers had ſent her that Gown from <hi>Madrid,</hi> that ſo he might not be jealous of her. On the other ſide, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio</hi> was contriving how to get it return'd to her, of whom it had been borrowed. <hi>Saravia</hi> not knowing him, he effected his buſineſs by this cheat. About three or four days after the delivery of the Gown to <hi>Rufina,</hi> he puts himſelf into the habit of a Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and juſt at dinner time comes to <hi>Saravia</hi>'s houſe, ſaying that he was Servant to the Lady to whom that Gown belonged. <hi>Saravia</hi> order'd him to be brought in, which being done he told him that he was ſent by his Miſtreſs for the Gown ſhe had lent Madam <hi>Rufina,</hi> onely to ſee the faſhion of it. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravia</hi> turning towards his wife, ask'd her what Gown the fellow would have? She preſently know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Gallant, <q>Friend, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to morrow morning, and you ſhall have it. </q>
               <q>But my Miſtreſs, <hi>replies Ruperio,</hi> hath commanded me not to come back without it; for this afternoon ſhe is to go a Chriſtning, at which ſhe is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and ſhe muſt needs have it. </q>
               <q>How ſhall I know, <hi>replies Rufina,</hi> that you have any relation to that Lady, and that you now come from her?</q> The crafty Companion perceiving what ſhe would be at, and that ſhe had no mind to return it, <q>The Gown, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is of ſuch a colour, the Trimming ſuch and ſuch, and it was ſent you in a green cloth, done about with a ſilk fringe. </q>
               <hi>Saravia</hi> hearing him give ſuch particular marks, <q>Sweet-heart, <hi>ſaid he to his wife,</hi> you have nothing to reply, for ſince he demands it with ſo much earneſtneſs, it muſt needs be his Miſtreſs ſtands in need of it, and if you are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58823:12"/>
unwilling to riſe out of your place, give me the key of your Trunk where it is, and I will go and fetch it. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> upon this had not a word to ſay, and at laſt ready to burſt with indignation, ſhe roſe from the Table, took the Gown out of the Trunk, and delivering it to <hi>Ruperio,</hi> 
               <q>Preſent my humble ſervice, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to Madam <hi>Leonora,</hi> and tell her, I beg her pardon, that I ſent it not home ſooner, which I could not, in regard ſhe hath not been here ſince who borrow'd it for me to have another made by it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The diſguis'd Gallant receiv'd the Gown, and left <hi>Rufina,</hi> her eyes all on fire, and vext to the ſoul, to find her ſelf ſo impudently affronted. <hi>Saravia</hi> ask'd her upon what account ſhe had borrow'd that Gown; ſhe made anſwer, That ſhe had done it at the intreaty of an acquaintance of hers, who was deſirous to have ſuch another, as being extremely taken with the faſhion of it. She perſuaded her husband to any thing, who, poor man, underſtood little of the world beſides his trading. In the mean time, ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely incens'd againſt <hi>Ruperio</hi> for the ſlovenly trick he had put upon her, in depriving her of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe was much taken with, and whereof ſhe thought her ſelf indiſputably poſſeſs'd. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon reſolv'd to be reveng'd on him, what ever it coſt her; but thinking to communicate her deſign to her Maid, who was privy to all her ſecret deſigns, <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who over-heard them, came to know the whole ſtory; and being acquainted with the Gallant, as being one who hanted the Gaming-houſes, and conceiving himſelf oblig'd to revenge the affront done his daughter, he meets him in the ſtreet one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58823:13"/>
day, and tells him, he deſir'd to meaſure the length of his Sword, upon what account he ſhould know, when they were come to the place. <hi>Ruperio</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him out of the City, and being out of Peoples ſight, <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> told him what had occaſion'd his giving him that challenge. They preſently drew, and made ſeveral paſſes, but at laſt <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> prov'd the more unfortunate, for he was run through the heart, ſo that he died immediately, having not the time to make the leaſt act of contrition; a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commonly happens to thoſe who lead ſuch Lives as he had done. <hi>Ruperio</hi> took Sanctuary, and <hi>Trapaſſa</hi>'s Body was brought to his Son-in-law's, where it was receiv'd, with a mixture of joy and grief; joy, that the Houſe was disburthen'd of one of the moſt humourſome and inſupportable perſons in the world; and grief for the future charges of his enterrment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Rufina</hi> made it appear by her lamentations and tears, that his death caus'd her as much affliction as it brought her husband joy. She would not hear of any conſolation, pretending ſhe had loſt all her ſupport in this world, for all the kinred and friends ſhe had were now exchang'd for a husband, whom ſhe could not affect. On the other ſide <hi>Saravia</hi> thought himſelf the happieſt man in the world, to have a wife handſome and young as his was. But ſhe was indeed a little too handſome and too young for him; that proportion of Age, which Parents ought chiefly to mind in the diſpoſal of their Children, was not obſerv'd in this. 'Tis not to be expected an old Man can pleaſe a young Girl. When a woman comes once to ſlight her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58823:13"/>
ſhe is in the way to fancy any body. But for <hi>Rufina,</hi> the paſſion ſhe had withall of going highly in cloaths, and to be reveng'd of <hi>Ruperio,</hi> made her break forth into all the exceſſes, that exaſperated Woman-kind can fall into, defile the Marriage-bed, and implicitely give her ſelf over to all thoſe things, whence ſhe might derive either ſatisfaction or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Nothing ran ſo much in her head as the injury ſhe had receiv'd from <hi>Ruperio,</hi> which ſhe thought ſuch, that ſhe would not have Liv'd, but out of a hope to be reveng'd of him. But in regard ſhe muſt have other hands than her own to do that, ſhe ſought out all opportunities imaginable to aſſure her ſelf of a Gallant, who would vigorouſly execute her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>One of thoſe Fridays, which are ſolemnized with a great concourſe of people from Eaſter to Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntide, in <hi>Triana</hi> part of the Suburbs of <hi>Sevil,</hi> through which paſſes the <hi>Quadalquivir,</hi> the famous River of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> and the Looking-glaſs of that wealthy City; <hi>Rufina</hi> went into a Boat cover'd with branches, to go and ſee that Feſtival, to which ſhe was carried, by the expreſs order of her husband, by a Neighbour of his, whom he thought one of the moſt diſcreet and virtuous Women in the world. But he was not the firſt Man that was deceiv'd in a Woman; for, on the contrary, ſhe was one of the wantoneſt and withall the ſimpleſt of the whole Sex. She therefore took up a Boat for her ſelf, <hi>Rufina,</hi> and two other Women of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but though ſhe had given the Water-man his full fare; yet was ſhe eaſily perſwaded by him to take in other perſons into the Boat, and among thoſe, a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58823:14"/>
young Man, who had his Sentinels at the Water-ſide to give him notice of ſuch an opportunity. As ſoon as they were got into the Boat, <hi>Rufina</hi> unveil'd, and the Gallant (whom we will call <hi>Felician)</hi> had no ſooner ſeen, but he was ſurpriz'd with her Beauty. He thought her ſo handſome, that he perſuaded ſome of his friends, who ſtood on the River-ſide, to come into the Boat, and to effect that, greas'd the fiſt of the Water-man. Being all got in, <hi>Felician</hi> took his place next to <hi>Rufina,</hi> into whoſe favour it was his deſign to inſinuate himſelf. He was Son to a perſon of Quality, who had rais'd himſelf to a vaſt fortune in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and had no Children but only this, who diſpoſing of his wealth, as he pleas'd, it was conceiv'd it would not be long ere he ſcatter'd abroad what his Father had not in ſo ſhort a time raked together. For he was a conſtant Gameſter, a perpetual Courter of Ladies, and he maintain'd a conſiderable crew of Hangers-on, who did him no other ſervice than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company, and encourage him in his debauches. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe noble qualities, he was extreamly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant in point of cloaths, a vice not extraordinary in thoſe young men of <hi>Sevil,</hi> who have all things at their own diſpoſal, as he we ſpeak of had.</p>
            <p>Having, as was ſaid, ſeated himſelf next to <hi>Rufina,</hi> and his Camerades next to her friends, the Boat put off, and went very leiſurely down the River, for which the Water-man was ſo much the better paid. <hi>Felician</hi> thought this time ſo precious that he loſt very little of it; he diſcover'd his Love to <hi>Rufina</hi> in ſuch obliging expreſſions, that ſhe gave abſolute credit to his words, and, by her attention, ſatisfy'd him, that ſhe was not diſpleas'd with his company.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58823:14"/>
               <hi>Felician</hi> was a very ingenious perſon, and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good humour, upon ſuch occaſions as thoſe; he deliver'd himſelf with ſuch a ſmartneſs and grace, that the Ladies were extreamly well ſatisfy'd, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Rufina,</hi> who thought nothing comparable to his converſation. She gave him her name, told him where ſhe liv'd, and what profeſſion her husband was of, and in a word made him a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of her more ſecret affairs. <hi>Felician</hi> was as open to her, concluding his diſcourſe with a thouſand proteſtations of ſervice and obedience. The after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was ſpent in complements and courtſhip, and to the great ſatisfaction of <hi>Rufina,</hi> who had two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to carry on at the ſame time; one, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of <hi>Ruperio,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Felician;</hi> the other, to cajol the latter out of ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cloaths and her extravagant expences. Nor did the buſineſs happen otherwiſe than ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd it.</p>
            <p>From that day <hi>Felician</hi> began to frequent the ſtreet where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, eſpecially when he had intelligence that her husband was abroad about his affairs. <hi>Rufina,</hi> on the other ſide, reſolv'd not to be over-eaſily conquer'd; for when ſhe remembred how ſhe had been ſerv'd by <hi>Ruperio,</hi> it rais'd in her a certain fear of receiving the like affront from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Before ſhe admitted his entrance into the Houſe, ſhe thought fit to make trial of his liberality. Of this ſhe was in a ſhort time pretty well ſatisfy'd, for <hi>Felician</hi> had been a prodigal all his Life, but upon this occaſion exceeded all he had done before, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her preſents of cloaths, jewels, and other things, beſides the expences he was at in treatments and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58823:15"/>
collations: So that <hi>Rúfina</hi> was the moſt ſatisfy'd Woman in the world. 'Tis commonly ſaid, that the higher a Man's enjoyments are, the ſooner he is cloy'd, but it happen'd otherwiſe with <hi>Felician,</hi> for his affection to <hi>Rufina</hi> encreas'd daily, and came up to that height it could not well be greater.</p>
            <p>It happen'd about this time, that <hi>Ruperio</hi> got at one time above ſix hundred Crowns at play. He went always very high in cloaths; but this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good fortune made him ſomewhat exceed his former gawdineſs. But with that good, he had this ill fortune, to find out, that <hi>Felician</hi> was ſeen very often in the ſtreet where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, and to infer thence, that he made ſome addreſſes to her. This jealouſie awoke the love he had ſometimes had for her; it troubled him that he ſhould have any Rival, and thereupon he reſolv'd to retrive himſelf into her favour, and repair the injury, he was now ſenſible, that he had done her. Upon this account, he paſs'd ſeveral times through her ſtreet, which caus'd not a little perplexity to <hi>Felician. Rufina</hi> was enrag'd to ſee that the Impoſtor had the impudence to make any pretence to her favour, after the notorious affront ſhe had receiv'd at his hands. She conſider'd there was no way to be rid of his importunities, but to engage her beloved Gallant <hi>Felician</hi> in her quarrel, by perſuading him, that <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s deſign was to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him out of her affection, which if he valued, he would find ſome means to check the inſolence of his Rival, and deliver her from his odious Courtſhip. See what employments Women do many times put on their Gallants! ſetting them on, like Cocks, to fight, till they have deſtroy'd one the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:58823:15"/>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> thought it not prudence to acquaint <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lician</hi> with what had paſs'd between her and <hi>Ruperio.</hi> No, ſhe took a ſafer courſe: She told him, that <hi>Ruperio</hi> was continually importuning her with very advantageous proffers, which yet, for his ſake, ſhe ſlighted. <hi>Felician</hi> believ'd her, and that the rather, in regard he met him every day, and many times in the night, walking the rounds about his Miſtreſs's houſe. To incenſe him the more, ſhe added, that were it not for that troubleſome perſon, ſhe would ſee him oftner than ſhe did. There needed no more; <hi>Felician</hi> being thus enflam'd into jealouſie, met with <hi>Ruperio</hi> one night in his Miſtreſs's ſtreet, when he knew <hi>Rufina</hi> was a-bed, and her husband looking over ſome Accounts, which concern'd his Agency. As ſoon as <hi>Felician</hi> had perceiv'd <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> he call'd him by his name, and having talk'd a little while together, to avoid the diſcovery of any quarrel in the Streets, he conducted to a little by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, which happen'd to be over againſt the room where <hi>Saravia</hi> kept all his papers, and where he then was, very buſie looking over them. The two Rivals being come to the place, <hi>Felician</hi> addreſs'd himſelf thus to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Signor <hi>Ruperio,</hi> I have for ſome days paſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that you have frequented this ſtreet more than you ſhould have done, and I was ſomewhat at a loſs to know, what might occaſion your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither, in regard there are ſeveral Ladies of worth, which might oblige you thereto. But I have at laſt diſcover'd, that Madam <hi>Rufina</hi> is the cauſe of your diurnal and nocturnal haunts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; and this I am aſſur'd of, not only by what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58823:16"/>
I have ſeen my ſelf, but alſo by the relation of her ſervants, to whom you ſpeak, and whom you would corrupt by preſents to introduce you into their Miſtreſs's favour. I have been her Servant a good while, and the ſervices I have done her have gain'd me her affection, ſo far that I have receiv'd the greateſt favours from her that I could expect. I am not a perſon much given to boaſt of my good fortunes; but to prevent your further progreſs in this affair, I am forc'd to make you this particular diſcovery, which I doubt not but you will enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as a great ſecret, as every perſon of honour ought to do. I have acquainted you with my love, and the advantages I have made of it, to oblige you to forbear all applications to this Lady for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Which if you do, you will exempt your ſelf from many inconveniences, and eaſe me of thoſe reſentments, which I am now full of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ruperio</hi> hearkned very attentively to the diſcourſe of <hi>Felician,</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi>'s husband no leſs, hearing things that concern'd him ſo nearly. And yet though the ſtory he had heard was extreamly prejudicial to him, and could not but add very much to his diſquiet, yet muſt he needs ſtay to take <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s Anſwer; which was to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Signor <hi>Felician,</hi> I cannot wonder at all, that you ſhould be ſo careful to obſerve, with what devotion I courted Madam <hi>Rufina,</hi> ſince you were ſo much concern'd in it as you tell me; and I believe you will be as little ſurpriz'd at my being engag'd in the ſame deſign, being, as I find you, ignorant what are the grounds of my Love, and the reaſons I have to proſecute it. I am as backward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58823:16"/>
as your ſelf to proclaim the favours I receive from Ladies; but ſince you expreſs your ſelf ſo freely to me, I conceive my ſelf oblig'd to do the like to you, that you may think my procedure the leſs ſtrange. I was in this Lady's favour before you were, and I obtain'd of her the ſame thing you boaſt ſo much of: by ſome misfortune or other, I have loſt it, yet not ſo, as but that I hope, in time, I re-inſtate my ſelf into it again, which to do, aſſure your ſelf I ſhall do whatever lies in my power. If I prevail, and that ſhe will admit the continuance of my ſervices, as I hope ſhe may, your onely remedy is patience; for I am ſo far from quitting this pretenſion, that I ſhall do my utmoſt to prevent her giving any entertainment to yours, and bring her to ſuch a paſs, as not ſo much as remember, that you ever thought of her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With that they both drew, <hi>Felician</hi> maintaining, that he onely ought to pretend to her, and <hi>Ruperio</hi> ſtanding upon the ſame tearms. The diſpute was ſoon ended, his Sword, who was in preſent poſſeſſion prov'd the more fortunate, <hi>Ruperio,</hi> by a thruſt through the heart, falling upon the place. The noiſe of the Swords was not very great, for <hi>Felician</hi> had done his work ſo ſuddenly, that none heard any thing of the quarrel, but onely <hi>Saravia,</hi> who, for his own reputation, would have kept it ſecret. That the Body might not lye in that place, <hi>Felician</hi> took it on his Shoulders, and laid it before a Monaſtery, and went for refuge into another, till he found what would be done in the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saravia,</hi> aſtoniſh'd at what he had ſeen and heard, began to be enrag'd againſt his wife, contriving how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58823:17"/>
to be reveng'd of a Woman, whoſe perfidiouſneſs was the more notorious, the greater reaſons ſhe had to be grateſul and loyal. She was faſt aſleep in her bed, never dreaming what had hapned in the ſtreets upon her account. The firſt thing came into <hi>Saravia</hi>'s imagination, was altogether for revenge, to effect which his courſe would be, to go up ſtreight into her chamber, and to diſpatch her, in bed, with a dagger. But he conſider'd with himſelf, that the Murtherer having carried away the dead body from his door, he might be charg'd with killing her without any cauſe, and that he would want proof, as having for witneſs but two ſervant-maids, who were more likely to depoſe againſt him. He therefore reſolv'd, as the ſureſt way to diſpatch her, to give her a ſecret doſe of poiſon, ſuch as might remove her after a certain time: but he thought withal, that he ſhould not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his own juſt reſentment, if he any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd a vengeance which requir'd immediate exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. He propos'd to himſelf another expedient, which was, to leave both City and Wife, and to go to ſome other place: but that deſign was ſoon over with him, he having many affairs undetermin'd, and fearing the ſiniſter judgments might have been paſs'd upon ſuch a reſolution, to the ſhame and confuſion of a man of his age and reputation. This reflection brought him to his firſt deſign of ſending her going with the ponyard. But before he executed that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty (which yet rightly taken was not any, but a juſt puniſhment for her offence) he thought it requiſite, ſor his own vindication, to leave, in writing, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which had induc'd him to commit that murther. He took pen and ink, and began to ſet down the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58823:17"/>
he had receiv'd from his wife, and the revenge he had taken: but upon ſecond thoughts, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining he had not ſufficiently expreſs'd the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her crime, he tore what he had written; and this he did to the third time, ſo great were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſturbance of his thoughts. He ſet himſelf down to write the fourth time; but remembring that he was to begin his revenge with adulteries, and could not do it becauſe he knew not the ſeveral ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations thereof, he was at laſt ſatisfi'd, that he ſhould be ſufficiently reveng'd if he had but once diſpatch'd his wife. A good part of the night ſlipp'd away in theſe diſquiets, <hi>viz.</hi> in writing, correcting, blotting out again, and tearing all he had written. At laſt, being abſolutely reſolv'd in that rage to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his deſign, he made another writing, without any blot, having before-hand well conſider'd what he ſhould ſet down; and when he had expreſs'd, the beſt he could, the injury he had receiv'd, he was o're-come by ſo preſſing a grief that he fell down and dy'd ſuddenly.</p>
            <p>All this paſt, while <hi>Rufina</hi> flept. Awaking of a ſudden and not finding her husband in bed with her, ſhe call'd him, and ſeeing he made no Anſwer, ſhe put on her petticoat, and went into his cloſet, where ſhe found a candle lighted, and <hi>Saravia</hi> lying on the floor, dead. She was aſtoniſh'd, as well ſhe might; all ſhe could do was to call up her Maids, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately came to the ſight of this ſtrange ſpectacle. They were no leſs ſurpriz'd than their Miſtreſs at the ſtrangeneſs of the accident. As they were going to convey the Corps to one of the beſt rooms in the houſe (before the neighbours had any notice of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58823:18"/>
adventure) <hi>Rufina</hi> met with a paper, which ſeem'd to be not quite finiſh'd, wherein ſhe found theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That my juſtification may be the better known to all thoſe who ſhall read this paper, I declare, that all my unhappineſs proceeds from the lightneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of my infamous wife, who, profaning the holy Sacrament of Marriage, by the ſacred Tie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we were join'd together in the face of the Church, without any conſideration of the great affection I bore her, hath proſtituted her ſelf to two Gallants at the ſame time, whe having quarrel'd for the precedence, which either of them pretended to over his adverſary, the more unfortunate of the two was kill'd by the other, before the window of my houſe. Having thus been witneſs oſ my own diſgrace, and heard the whole ſtory of my diſhonour, it was but juſt I ſhould revenge my infamy, thus</hi>—Then ended the writing, for death ſurpriſing him at that word he immediately expir'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely diſtracted at both what ſhe ſaw and what ſhe had read, ſo that, for half an hour, ſhe knew not in a manner where ſhe was, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her ſelf, that the greateſt ſecrets in the world will be diſcover'd at laſt, and that it is Heaven's pleaſure they ſhould be ſo, either for our reformation or our puniſhment. The death of her husband rais'd in her a certain mixture of fear and affliction: a fear, to ſee how ſudden it had been, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the reſentment of an injury which ſhe had done him; the affliction, to ſee her husband deprived of life, and her ſelf ignorant how to diſguiſe ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58823:18"/>
an accident. A little remorſe of conſcience, like a qualm over her ſtomach, troubled her, that ſhe had been ſo perfidious to a man, who had lov'd her ſo well, and, by marrying her, had rais'd her from beggery to plenty. The great affection which the Neighbours knew that he had always born her, gave her a little confidence, and induc'd her to take the advice of one of her Maids, which was to carry her husband's body into his bed, and to cry out the next morning ſo loud, that the Neighbours might here it, whom ſhe might, by her exceſſive lamentations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, that ſhe had found him dead by her ſide when ſhe awoke; and that her two Maids, to carry on the cheat, ſhould give out that their Maſter had taken a ſurfeit, and died ſuddenly of it.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid their deſign, day came, <hi>Rufina</hi> cried out, and lamented with all her might, and the next Neighbours came in, who found her half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd, weeping, and tearing her hair through mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhe had loſt ſo good a husband. Her two Maids acted their parts very well, by relating the cauſe of their good Maſter's death, and ſaying, that they advis'd him not to eat ſo much, or that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt expect to repent it. All were ſatisfi'd with theſe reaſons, and ſome of <hi>Rufina</hi>'s friends were buſie about her, out of a fear ſhe ſhould have ſwounded, ſo well did ſhe perſonate the afflicted Lady. They did all lay in their power to comfort her, who, amidſt all her grief, had not forgotten to burn the paper ſhe had found, leſt it might have prov'd a teſtimony of her miſcarriages. Some Officers from the Magiſtrate, who are never wanting upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, came in ſoon after, and upon the allegations

of the Neighbours, that the deceas'd had ever liv'd very lovingly with his wife, went their ways, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd that ſhe had not any way contributed to his death. <hi>Saravia</hi> was buried, and <hi>Rufina</hi> was ſo put to it to act the part ſhe was then engag'd in, that ſhe thought not of doing what Widows commonly do upon ſuch occaſions, that is, to make the beſt proviſion they can for themſelves, out of what their husbands have left. So that one of his Nephews, as ſoon as the Uncle was buried, ſeiz'd on all in the houſe, and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi> was forc'd to go to Law with him, to recover what ſhe might lawfully lay claim to.</p>
            <p>Let us return to ſee what became of <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s body. Being found in the morning by the religious Inhabitants of the Monaſtery, and not known by any of them, they were going, <hi>without ſans cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> to burie it, had they not been prevented by a Citizen, who advis'd them to expoſe it in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place, that it might be known, and that if he were one that had father or mother, or friends in the City, that they might know the misfortune hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to him; that by that means, they would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to themſelves the charges of his interment, as alſo the fees due for other prayers and devotions, in order to the repoſe of his ſoul. This advice pleas'd the Superiour of the Monaſtery, who immediately ſent word to the Magiſtrate, that they had found in the morning a young man dead at their Chutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door. The body was diſpos'd into a little place near the Monaſtery, with two lighted wax-candles, by which place there paſs'd by not long after a man that knew him. He told them who he was, and then went and carried that ſad news to his Friends, who were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58823:19"/>
extremely troubled at his death, his Father having often foretold him, that he would come to ſuch an end; for, from the life he led, there could not any thing elſe be inferr'd. He was buried in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and a ſtrict ſearch was made for him who had committed the murther: but <hi>Sevil</hi> being a vaſt and populous City, no diſcovery could be made of him. Onely <hi>Rufina</hi> knew who it was, by the abſence of her Gallant, <hi>Ruperio</hi>'s death, and the paper ſhe found in her husband's cloſet. She was infinitely ſatisfi'd to ſee her ſelf reveng'd of a perſon, who had done her ſuch an affront; and it was a great happineſs to her, that no notice had been taken of the bloud, which the deceas'd had ſpilt at the place where he was kill'd. Had the Magiſtrate known of that, it would have brought her into ſome trouble, for the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours would have teſtifi'd, that they had often ſeen thoſe two Rivals in that little ſtreet.</p>
            <p>By this means <hi>Rufina</hi> is become a Widow, but withall poor and deſtitute of all accommodations, having onely the ſtock of her beauty to ſet her ſelf up again; and that, together with her honour (if it may be ſaid ſhe had any left) ſhe reſolv'd to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that ſhe might live in ſome meaſure ſutably to what ſhe had done before. <hi>Saravia</hi>'s Nephew, who had taken poſſeſſion of all his eſtate, was ſentenc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d to pay <hi>Rufina</hi> ſomewhat upon the account of dower; but it was ſo inconſiderable, in reſpect of the expence ſhe was wont to be at, that ſhe was forc'd to leave the houſe ſhe was in and take one of a lower rent. Nor had this Nephew what he expected by being heir to his Uncle, for the eſtate was extremely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, ſo that having even'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accounts with the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58823:20"/>
he had but little left for himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina,</hi> having remov'd into another Quarter of the City, and being young, ſumptuous in cloaths, and perfectly handſome, did not as many other Widows are wont to do, who, as ſoon as their husbands are march'd off, dreſs themſelves as fine as hands can make them, and deriving a little advantage from their mourning ſeek out opportunities to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Gallants purely out of a deſign to get other husbands. But ours, though young, had had ſo great experience, that ſhe reſolv'd to play another game, and that no ſmall one.</p>
            <p>There was come in the Fleet from <hi>Peru</hi> a man born amidſt the Mountains of <hi>Leon,</hi> who had begun his fortune by the relation of a Servant to a Merchant of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and one who, upon his Maſter's coſt, and ſome little trading into the <hi>Indies,</hi> was grown rich, inſomuch that within few years, he was accounted one of the ableſt Merchants that traded to <hi>Peru.</hi> He makes another voiage thither, being advanc'd to a certain publick employment, and having thereby added much to his wealth, he was return'd again to <hi>Sevil,</hi> in that years Fleet, where he ſold the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities he had brought over at double what they had coſt him; ſo fortunate was he in all his ventures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> (ſo was this lucky Merchant call'd) was a perſon of about fifty years of age; the moſt covetous and wretched'ſt natur'd fellow that ever was. He grudg'd himſelf what he eat and drunk, though even below moderation; nay he many times faſted pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſpare ſo much. He had no more ſervants than he needed; his whole Train conſiſted in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, a Lacquey, a Moor-ſlave, who look'd to his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58823:20"/>
Mule, and a Maid to dreſs his pitiful Commons. He kept his Family ſo ſhort in point of victuals, that it was wondred any one would ſerve him; his Miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition found the whole City diſcourſe; another would have been aſham'd of it, but he onely laugh'd at it, applauding himſelf, and making it his whole buſineſs to heap up wealth, whereof he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> hearing this account of him, began to conſider all the circumſtances, and after ſhe had a little reflected thereon, ſhe concluded, that he might be made an excellent Cully, whom if ſhe could ſmite, as ſhe expected, her condition would be better than ever it had been. <hi>Marquina</hi> liv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, in a little Tenement he had purchas'd of one who ought him ſome mony, which he knew not well how to get in otherwiſe; for he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo perfect a ſlave to his profit, that he little minded his pleaſures. So that he got that Tenement, with a neat houſe on it, very cheap, and in ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his debt; it ſtood near S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, in the midſt of a pleaſant valley. He liv'd here to ſpare the rent of a houſe in the City; he had ſo fortifi'd it, that no thieves, either by day or night, could make any breach into it; all the doors were of extraordinary thickneſs, the windows had bars and grates, the walls very high and very ſtrong. He had ſecur'd the place within with many fire-Arms, which he always kept charged, Halbards, and Partiſans, which were diſpos'd near the gate. He was forc'd to take one perſon more into his retinue, to wit, a fellow to order his Garden, and to make the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he could of it, a married man, who ſhould
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58823:21"/>
carry the fruits and other things to the market to make the beſt of them, ſo vigilant was his Avarice. His treaſure was diſpos'd into a ſecret place behind his bed where he lay himſelf, in ſtrong iron cheſts; and every night before he went to bed, he, like an over-doing Conſtable, ſearch'd all the rooms in the houſe. Thus did this wrerched fellow live, though he had no children to ſucceed him, for he had never been married, nor intended to be, though very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Matches were daily proffer'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> had laid her deſign to bring in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Merchant into the nooſe, and to effect it, ſhe communicated it to a perſon who was excellent at ſuch things, and an ancient acquaintance of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Signor <hi>Trapaſſa.</hi> This man had plaid ſome pranks at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which had occaſion'd his removal thence to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and his atchievments there, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture thence to <hi>Sevil,</hi> where he went lurking up and down, and ſpending ſome mony, which it had coſt him more hazard than pains to get. He was one of the moſt accompliſh'd men in point of Thievery of his time, but very fearful of falling into the hands of Juſtice, leſt there might riſe up in judgment againſt him ſome of his former offences; which were ſuch as had preferr'd him to the Galleys, where he had made acquaintance with <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> and had continu'd it at <hi>Sevil.</hi> This perſon (whoſe name was <hi>Garay), Rufina</hi> took to aſſiſt her in the compaſſing of her deſign. Having given him inſtructions what he was to do, and told him, that <hi>Marquina</hi> return'd not to his houſe, till about Sun-ſet, as he was wont to do, they both paſs'd by <hi>Marquina</hi>'s garden, he on a Mule, and ſhe on a good Horſe. She had put off her Mourning,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58823:21"/>
and put on another dreſs, with a hat and feather, as the <hi>Sevil-</hi>Ladies are wont to go, when they are in the Country.</p>
            <p>They paſs'd by the Garden, juſt as the Gardener was opening the door. <hi>Garay</hi> coming up to him, Friend, ſaid he, here is a Lady would not willingly go into the City to day, if you will afford her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment this night. I will ſatisfie you to your own deſires; beſides that you will do us an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>raordinary kindneſs, for you will thereby prevent a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which ſhe cannot otherwiſe avoid. The Gardener, who was afraid of his Maſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s diſpleaſure, told him that he durſt not be ſo bold, as to receive any perſon into his houſe, without his knowledge, though he had not expreſly forbidden him the doing of any ſuch thing. But <hi>Garay,</hi> who knew the vertue and power of mony, took a conſiderable ſum out of his pocket, and giving it to the Gardener, <q>Here, friend, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> take this in earneſt of more.</q> The Gardener's wife longing to know what buſineſs they might have with her husband, comes up to them, and ſeeing the proffers were made him, undertook to lodge the Gentlewoman in her own room, making it appear to her husband, that their Maſter ſhould never come to the knowledge of it, in regard their houſes were at a good diſtance one from the other, and that they ſhould not be ſo unhappy, as that he would that night ſearch the whole houſe, as many times a toy took him in the head to do.</p>
            <p>In fine the wife's arguments prevail'd, ſo that the Gardener was content the Gentlewoman ſhould lodge ſecretly that night at his houſe, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of ſix Ryals which <hi>Garay</hi> gave him as an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58823:22"/>
earneſt of a greater ſumme promis'd him. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon took down <hi>Rufina</hi> off the horſe, and brought her into the Garden, where ſhe took leave of <hi>Garay,</hi> who had already receiv'd the orders whereof we ſhall give an account hereafter.</p>
            <p>Being come into the Gardener's room, ſhe took off what cover'd her face, and aſtoniſh'd the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener and his wife at the ſight of her beauty, though ſhe ſeem'd to be very melancholy, as if ſome great misfortune had happened to her, to wit, that which ſhe had ready to relate to <hi>Marquina,</hi> in caſe ſhe might come to ſpeech with him. The Sun was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet, but he came into the Garden: the Negro en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring a little before to have the door opened, which he himſelf lock'd on the inſide, and carried the key along with him. He chanc'd to be that night a little more weary than he us'd, which occaſion'd his going to bed very betimes, after he had eaten a piece of bread, and ſome of his own Garden fruits, and waſh'd them down with a glaſs of ſpring-water. He onely viſited that part of the houſe where he lodg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and came not down to the Gardener's, which eſcap'd not his privy ſearch, when he thought of it. His family, who kept more faſting-days in the year, than the Church her ſelf had appointed, ſupp'd that night, in imitation of the Maſter, very ſoberly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> gets up the next morning betimes, and gives the Slave mony to go to the market, while he went about his affairs in the City, with order to have dinner ready againſt his return. <hi>Rufina</hi> was at a loſs how to compaſs her deſign, finding things fell not out according to her expectation: but ſtill waiting the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, ſhe told her entertainers that ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58823:22"/>
troubled at her Uncle's ſtay (ſo ſhe called <hi>Garay)</hi> and that all her ſadneſs proceeded thence. The Gardener's wife, who was a good hearty woman, found her all the diverſion ſhe could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> comes home at noon, with an intention to dine in his garden, and before he ſate down, he would needs take a turn about it, to ſee if any thing were wanting; and he obſerv'd that there wanted ſome pieces of wood for the more convenient wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the ſeveral Knots. As he was going to the Gardeners to ſee if he had any fit for that purpoſe, the wife perceiving him coming, very haſtily ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled <hi>Rufina</hi> into a little back-room, where ſhe was wont to lie: but in regard it could not be done ſo ſuddenly, but that <hi>Marquina</hi> coming in might hear the ruffling of the ſilks, and ſee <hi>Rufina</hi>'s ſhadow, he ſteps into the room where ſhe was retir'd, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found her, he led her out by the hand, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her into the light, he found her ſo beautiful, that he was aſtoniſh'd thereat. The Gardeners wife won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that her Maſter, inſtead of chiding her, as ſhe expected, onely ask'd her who the Lady was. She anſwer'd, that, the night before, paſſing by their door with an ancient Gentleman, who ſeem'd as ſad as her ſelf, they had very earneſtly intreated ſhe might be lodg'd there but that night, to avoid a great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, which would have hapned to them, if they had gone any further.</p>
            <p>While the Gardener's wife was giving <hi>Marquina</hi> this account, he very attentively conſider'd the ſtrange Lady, who ſeem'd to be extremely troubled in mind, which added to the attractions of her Beauty. <hi>Marquina</hi> was ſo taken therewith, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58823:23"/>
his unſociable and covetous humour, he told the Gardener's wife, that ſhe had done very well, in entertaining that Lady, though contrary to his orders, which in ſuch a caſe were not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, where compaſſion and charity plead for the relief of thoſe that are in trouble. <q>This Lady, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> deſerves a better reception than ſhe hath found in your poor lodgings, I heartily proffer her my houſe, if ſhe will but honour it with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> thank'd him very civilly for his oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proffers, and intreated him to allow her the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy of ſome other lodging, for the little time ſhe had to ſtay there, in regard ſhe expected an Uncle of hers to come and fetch her away that night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina,</hi> who began to be enflam'd, was ſorry to hear that her ſtay at his houſe would be ſo ſhort, but after a little pauſe, he told her, that though it were but for an hour, ſhe would infinitely oblige him, in the acceptation of the proffer he made her with ſo much affection. She, who expected that cue all the while, told him, that, to make ſome return to ſo great civilities, ſhe was ready to wait on him. With that ſhe went to <hi>Marquina</hi>'s apartment, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he led her by the hand, to the great ſatisfaction of the Gardener's wife, who extremely wondred to ſee her Maſter, contrary to his cuſtom, of a civil and obliging humour. As ſhe paſs'd through the rooms, ſhe took particular notice of all things; for though <hi>Marquina</hi> were naturally a very covetous perſon, yet, as to the furniture of his houſe, he was otherwiſe. He had very rich Tapeſtry, Chairs ſutable thereto, and Cabinets of Ivory and Ebony, nay indeed many things brought out of the <hi>Indics,</hi> which though they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58823:23"/>
coſt him not much there, are here of very great price. He immediately commanded his Slave to prepare an excellent dinner, an employment he undertook with great alacrity, as knowing he might make ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that extraordinary liberality of his Maſter. <hi>Rufina</hi> din'd with him, who treated her ſtill with the beſt the Table afforded, with importunate excuſes that there were no better for her.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had din'd, he conducted her into a chamber, ſet forth with a great number of excellent pictures, where there was alſo a ſumptuous bed, of <hi>China-</hi>work, and intreated her to repoſe her ſelf on it, a cuſtom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have in Summer, as ſoon as they have din'd, by reaſon of the ſultrineſs of the Country. He intreated alſo to give her diſquiet ſome remiſſion, out of an aſſurance, that ſhe ſhould be as ſafe in his houſe as in any Sanctuary, and that ſhe ſhould not want any thing lay in his power. She again return'd him her moſt affectionate thanks, and complying with his deſires, ſhe ſtaid alone in the room, which was the ſame where <hi>Marquina</hi> took his repoſe every day. He went into another, where he laid himſelf down, much troubled and diſquieted, as being fallen deeply in love with his fair Gueſt, and not knowing by what means he might induce her to favour him in what he deſir'd of her, which if he could effect, he concluded himſelf the happieſt man in the world. Before he acquainted her with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he was deſirous to know the cauſe of her grief, and what might occaſion her ſtopping at his Garden, and thereby find whether there were any obſtruction that might oppoſe his deſires to ſerve her. To be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd in this, it was requiſite he ſtaid till ſhe aw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58823:24"/>
but ſhe ſlept not at all, for ſhe ſpent the time in conſidering, what Anſwer ſhe ſhould make him, when he came to queſtion her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> thinking it now time to ſpeak to her, in order to the ſatisfaction of his curioſity, goes into her chamber, telling her it was a cloſe day, and that he was afraid ſhe might over-ſleep her ſelf, and crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pardon that he had taken the boldneſs to give her that caution. She thank'd him for the tenderneſs he had for her health, and aſſur'd him, that ſhe had not refreſh'd her ſelf at all, the trouble ſhe was in not permitting her to take any reſt. He begg'd of her that ſhe would no longer ſmother the cauſe of her diſquiet, and renew'd the proffers he had made to ſerve her to the utmoſt of his power. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd him her thanks, and thinking it now time to make ſome progreſs in her deſign, ſhe gave him this relation of her adventures.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Granada,</hi> one of the moſt famous and eminent Cities of <hi>Spain,</hi> is the place of my birth; my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (there's no neceſſity I ſhould name them) are of the moſt antient and moſt noble families of any in all the Mountains of old <hi>Caſteel,</hi> and the whole iſſue of their matrimony was onely a Brother of mine and my ſelf. My Brother ſpent the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of his age in courting Ladies, and, among other young perſons like himſelf, he plaid ſome mad pranks of youth, which oblig'd him, for fear of falling into the hands of Juſtice, to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>Granada;</hi> and for my part, I made it my onely buſineſs to ſerve and humour thoſe who had brought me into the world. I ſpent the days at my needle, not taking example from my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58823:24"/>
who onely minded their divertiſements; nay I was ſo ignorant what love meant, that I laugh'd at whatever related thereto, and thought thoſe, who ſpent their time in courtſhips and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining thoſe they call'd their Gallants, little better than ſo many diſtracted perſons. But Love it ſeems would puniſh this contempt of mine, and you ſhall ſee how he did it. My Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being one day gone to viſit a friend of theirs in the Country, who had buried his wife not long before, I heard in the ſtreet the claſhing of ſwords, as if ſome people had been fighting. I look'd out at the window to ſee what might be the matter. I had never been guilty of ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity before, and had it been God's pleaſure I ſhould have ſhunn'd it then, I ſhould not now be telling you my misfortunes, which are ſuch, that I ſhall never think on them without tears. I there ſaw, to my ſorrow, three men with their ſwords drawn, fighting againſt one, who defended himſelf with ſo great courage, that he not onely made his party good a long time againſt ſo many enemies, but alſo hurt two of them in the head, he himſelf having receiv'd onely a ſlight wound. Theſe three Hectors finding themſelves ſo worſted by one perſon, reſolv'd to do their utmoſt to take away his life; ſo that exaſperated by their wounds, they preſs'd upon him ſo much, that he was forc'd to retreat within our gate, where they gave him two ſeveral thruſts into the breaſt, upon which he fell, and was left for dead. Mov'd with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to ſee ſo proper a young man ſo diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly engag'd, I came down to the gate,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58823:25"/>
calling my Maids about me, to ſee what might be done for him, (our houſe being in a lone-ſtreet) for thoſe who were come upon the noiſe we made were ſo few, and thoſe unarm'd, that they were not able to part them. We lock'd the doors and brought him in, and a Chirurgeon was immediately ſent for. His wounds were ſo great, that we thought fit to diſpoſe him into a bed, in a ground-room, where my Brother was wont to lie. The young man thank'd me very civilly for the favour he receiv'd from me; but alas! that good office began with Compaſſion, but ended in Love. The Chirurgeon view'd his wounds, but could not preſently give any certain judgment of them, though he whiſper'd me in the ear, that he thought they might coſt him his life. That account of him ſtruck me to the heart, for having ſeen him fight ſo gallantly, I muſt needs acknowledge, that I had even then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an inclination for him. But his kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions afterwards, and his thanking me ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly for the obligations he ſaid I had put upon him, rais'd it into a perfect Love. My Father and Mother return'd from their viſit, and, ere they were got to our houſe, were told by one of the Neighbours, a perſon of ſome quality, what had happened in their abſence, and how that I had put a period to a quarrel, by entertaining the wounded party into their houſe, out of compaſſion and a fear that he might be kill'd; whereat they were well ſatisfi'd, and commended the charitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice I had done at ſuch an extremity; for they were perſons who gladly embrac'd any opportunity to exerciſe their charity. They viſited the wounded,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58823:25"/>
encourag'd him to take heart, aſſuring him he ſhould want nothing their Houſe could afford, and acknowledg'd it well done by me, that I had ſo reſcu'd him, upon which I took occaſion to ſpend moſt of my time in waiting on him; him, I ſay, who is the cauſe of all the troubles and afflictions which lye ſo heavy upon me. At the ſecond dreſſing, the Chirurgeon aſſur'd us that his wounds were not mortal, which caus'd much joy in our Houſe, particularly to me, who became every day more and more paſſionately in love with him. As often as I could get out of my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fight, I went to paſs away the time in his Chamber, for which kindneſs he made me extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>This young Cavalier was born at <hi>Pampeluna,</hi> and one of the moſt eminent in that City. His buſineſs at <hi>Granada</hi> was to proſecute a Law-ſuit, againſt a very powerful perſon, who finding but little juſtice of his ſide, that the cauſe was of great importance, and that notwithſtanding the favour he had in Court, the Judges muſt paſs ſentence againſt him, would put a period to the Suit by a ſhorter cut, and rid himſelf of his Adverſary, by employing three Men to murther him, who were his own menial Servants. A month ſlipp'd away, ere <hi>Leonardo</hi> (ſo was the wounded perſon named) got out of his Bed, having all that time been atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as much care as might be. The ſecond day after his getting up, he had the opportunity to ſee me, for my Mother was gone abroad upon a viſit, wherein I accompany'd her not, becauſe I had a greater mind to be alone with my young
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58823:26"/>
Gallant. He diſcover'd himſelf to me ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, and gave me ſuch ſenſible aſſurances of his affection, that it rais'd a no leſs in me towards him, inſomuch that there paſt mutual promiſes of fidelity between us. I knew nothing all this time that my Father was upon a treaty of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and a Gentleman of <hi>Granada,</hi> who was infinitely deſirous to enter into our alliance, while I was very well ſatisfy'd with the choice I had made my ſelf. <hi>Leonardo,</hi> coming to hear of the others pretenſions to me, was not a little troubled at it; but the onely remedy was patience, in regard he would make no diſcovery of his Eſtate, till his Law-ſuit were ended, which he hoped would be in a ſhort time, and I in the mean time kept my Father in play with perſuaſions, that he would not be over-haſty in concluding my Marriage with the <hi>Granadine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonardo</hi> being perfectly cur'd, and requiting the kindneſs and noble entertainment he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at our Houſe, with many conſiderable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, return'd to his own Quarters, to bring his buſineſs to a final end. For my part, my troubles increas'd more and more upon me; for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never giving me any notice of it, as if I had been a perſon not at all concern'd, concluded the contract with the <hi>Granadine,</hi> and paſs'd his word he ſhould have me; which when I came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, I was ſo ſtrucken, that I minded not what I did. This new Servant of mine, who expected ere long to be my Maſter, came to give me a viſit: but I ſoon ſatisfy'd him, that he had reckon'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Hoſteſs, for whereas he had flatter'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58823:26"/>
into a fooliſh imagination that he ſhould have found the kindeſt reception in the world from me, he met with ſuch a repulſe, as he himſelf conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, muſt rather proceed from the averſion, than any indifference I had for him. In a word, being not of thoſe Favourites of fortune, who promiſe themſelves the attainment of things impoſſible, he eaſily diſcover'd, that my refuſal was the effect of ſome other cauſe, than the modeſty, which a young Maid ought at leaſt pretend to upon ſuch occaſions: and knowing withall that the wounded <hi>Leonardo</hi> had lodg'd ſome time in our Houſe, he preſum'd, that my diſdain towards him was occaſion'd by the love I had for the other, and thence inferr'd, that having not been ſo happy as to prevent him in the acquiſition of my favour, he had, at beſt, but a hazardous after-game to recover it. The jealouſie he conceiv'd upon this preſumption oblig'd him to make trial of all the ways he could imagine, to be aſſur'd of it, ſo as that he might not do any thing, whereof it ſhould afterwards repent him. Should all do ſo, there would not be ſo many groundleſs quarrels. I was in an extraordinary confuſion during theſe overtures; I acquainted <hi>Leonardo</hi> with my condition; he came to ſee me that very night, and we agreed, the next, to leave my Father's houſe, and to go to ſome of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where we might be ſecretly Married. The expected hour being come (unhappy hour to me, conſidering the misfortunes I have run through ſince!) as my Deareſt and I were going out of the Houſe and croſſing into another Street, my jealous Servant (who ſpent the nights to be aſſur'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58823:27"/>
of his ſuſpition, which he now found to be too true) preſently knew us, and, attended by two Servants, he ſet upon <hi>Leonardo,</hi> never thinking of any ſuch ſurpriſe; ſo that ere he had the time to draw his Sword, he receiv'd three mortal wounds, and fell down dead, having not been able to ſpeak one word. The little noiſe which the murtherers had made, occaſion'd the Neighbours to come out with lights, upon the appearance whereof they ran away, fearing they might be diſcover'd. By this time there was a great ſtir at my Father's, that I could not be found, while I was in a manner dead, to ſee my Deareſt lying breathleſs at my feet. Having recover'd my ſelf, I conſider'd it was to little purpoſe for me to ſtay in the ſtreet, after ſuch an accident, ſo that putting off my Pattins, and tucking up my Coats, I ran away as faſt as I could, to a friend's houſe of my Father's, an aged perſon and very poor, whom I told what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me, and how much it concern'd me not to ſtay any longer at <hi>Granada.</hi> Whereupon taking a Horſe, he ſet me on him, and brought me to the next Village, where we took up another for him, and thence we are come hither, to avoid my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, accompany'd by Officers, makes a ſearch after me, as I have underſtood by the way. For that reaſon I thought it not ſafe, that we ſhould go into <hi>Sevil</hi> as ſoon as we came hither, but that it was better I conceal'd my ſelf in ſome place near it. It was the pleaſure of fortune to direct me to this Habitation of yours, into which, upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary intreaties your Gardener ventur'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me for this laſt night.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:58823:27"/>
Thus Sir, have you the ſtory of a wretched Maid (if there ever were any ſuch) whoſe onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now is in the good entertainment you are pleas'd to afford her. May Heaven requite your charity, ſince there cannot be a greater than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch as are afflicted and perſecuted to the extremity that I am.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The concluſion of this diſmal ſtory, which <hi>Rufina</hi> had had the time to invent and ſtudy ſo well, was a ſhower of Crocodile-tears, which rais'd ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he could not forbear them himſelf. The ſubtle Baggage, who notwithſtanding her counterfeit tears obſerv'd all the actions of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina,</hi> perceiv'd that he gave credit to her feign'd ſtory, and that Love began to enter at that breach which compaſſion had made in his heart. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to proſecute her impoſture, being now in a manner confident to bring it to ſome effect. They continu'd a good while together, ſhe weeping, as if ſhe had done it for a wager, and he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he could to comfort her: but that comfort came not up to the height of offering her the remedy ſhe could have wiſh'd, for he had not yet overcome his covetous humour.</p>
            <p>Having with great attention conſider'd the great beauty of <hi>Rufina,</hi> her affliction, and ſtrange adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that this happineſs was as it were fallen into his mouth, he inferr'd that Heaven, as a ſignal addition to his former happineſs, had directed her to his Houſe. This was the firſt love that had ever mov'd <hi>Marquina</hi>'s heart, and, in all ſorts of perſons that firſt paſſion ever acts violently. Is <hi>Marquina</hi> fallen in love? He muſt needs then be liberal. Hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58823:28"/>
he entertain'd <hi>Rufina</hi> into his Houſe? That kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be the deareſt to him that he ever did. O Love! O inſinuating Paſſion, who doſt bewitch the World, who doſt ruine and beſet Men! what Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes doſt thou not work in them? what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions doſt thou not change? what Reſolutions doſt thou not diſpence with? what Felicities doſt thou not diſturb? And what Hearts is it not in thy power to ſoften? That of this inſatiable Miſer, which had caſt off all ſenſe of humanity towards his neareſt Relations, love hath chang'd; ſo that he hath transform'd a covetous and ſordid Perſon into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and magnificent. He is extreamly taken with <hi>Rufina;</hi> he is paſſionately in love with her; ſhe will ere long be Miſtreſs of his heart and wealth. She ſaid many things in her relation, which might have betray'd her, had not the affection, wherewith <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> hearkened to her, clos'd both his Eyes and Ears: nay, he was ſo prepoſſeſs'd with his paſſion, that he would have believ'd many other things from her, though they had been more improbable than they were.</p>
            <p>The effect of this ſad narration of <hi>Rufina,</hi> was, that <hi>Marquina</hi> proffer'd her all the favour and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe could expect from him, his Eſtate, Life, Heart and Soul, giving her the title of abſolute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of all he was poſſeſs'd of, further entreating her, of all love, to give over thinking of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and aſſure her ſelf that ſhe was in a Houſe where ſhe might command, and that what ever ſhe deſir'd, her orders ſhould be obey'd, as far as it lay in his power. <hi>Rufina</hi> very kindly thank'd him for ſo many generous proffers, concluding her complement
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58823:28"/>
with a freſh ſhower of tears, a kind of tempeſt ſhe could raiſe, when ever ſhe either pleas'd, or ſtood in need thereof.</p>
            <p>With theſe artifices, ſhe became Miſtreſs of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> and all he had, ſo as that ſhe might diſpoſe of him and it, as ſhe pleas'd. Her beauty had given him a kind of Itch, and he was mighty deſirous to try whether ſhe would be as willing to cure him of it: but he knew not well how to acquaint her with his indiſpoſition; he reſolv'd at laſt, in caſe he could do no good upon her by his ſubmiſſions and preſents, to uſe the laſt remedy, which was to Marry her. This is a Bait that many times takes the ſhyeſt of that ſubtle Sex; but when they are ſo taken, he that does it is commonly ſnapp'd himſelf. I told you before, that <hi>Rufina</hi> had no other deſign than to examine the Cheſts of the greedy Merchant, and that ſhe would not be any way engag'd till ſhe were ſecure of her prize; for the raſcally trick ſhewn by <hi>Ruperio,</hi> had made her extreamly diſtruſtful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> ſtaid all that day in his Garden, and neglected his buſineſs in the City; but the next morning betimes, leaving his Gueſt aſleep, he takes his Mule, and goes about his ordinary occaſions, having charg'd the Gardener's Wife, to get a good breakfaſt for the Lady, as ſoon as ſhe were awake, and to have a care of the Houſe. He lock'd the Chamber-door where his Money was, and as he went out, charg'd the Gardener not to ſuffer any to come into his Garden, but the Old man who had brought <hi>Theodora</hi> thither, for that was the name the diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling <hi>Rufina</hi> had given her ſelf.</p>
            <p>That done, he went about his buſineſs, attended
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58823:29"/>
by the little Negro, whom he gave Money to buy Proviſions for a good Dinner. <hi>Rufina</hi> got up, and the Gardener's wife punctually obey'd the orders ſhe had receiv'd from her Maſter, treating her the beſt ſhe could, out of this reſpect, that all the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks made their advantage of thoſe magnificences. <hi>Rufina</hi> comes down into the Garden, where ſhe took occaſion to commend the walks, and contrivances of it, for the Gardener kept it in very good order, and well ſupply'd with herbs, fruits, and flowers. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun beginning to grow hot, ſhe went into the Houſe, where caſually meeting with a Lute, on which <hi>Marquina</hi>'s factor was wont to play, ſhe ſet it in Tune, and made that her entertainment, till ſuch time as <hi>Marquina</hi> return'd from the City, who hearing her at it, was not a little glad to find that perfection in her more than he knew before. Perceiving that <hi>Marquina</hi> hearkened to her Muſick, ſhe joyn'd her Voice to the Inſtrument, to breed one maggot more in his brain than he had already. She ſung ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that <hi>Marquina</hi> was raviſh'd at the melody, and acknowledg'd that it was not the Voice of a mortal Creature, but an Angel come down from Heaven. He continu'd his attention a while, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining ſhe would have begun another Song; but perceiving ſhe laid by the Lute, he comes into the Room, and, tranſported with joy, <q>How hath this poor Habitation been felicify'd, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> by your retirement into it, moſt adorable <hi>Theodora?</hi> What happineſs did the hour of your arrival here bring me who never had known any before? What honour have I receiv'd in beholding your tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Beauty, and to obſerve in you from time to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58823:29"/>
time a thouſand unknown excellencies which are not diſcover'd at the firſt ſight? This houſe may, no doubt, enter into competition with Heaven it ſelf, ſince ſuch an Angel honours it with her divine preſence. What I ſay, Madam, is but little, in compariſon of the paſſion I have for your worth, which were it to be commended proportionably to the apprehenſion I have of it, I think the moſt eloquent perſons that ever were, would be at a loſs for expreſſions ſuitable to ſo adorable a ſubject. You preſs too hard upon me, Dear Sir, replies the counterfeit <hi>Theodora,</hi> ſeeming to bluſh at thoſe exceſſive praiſes; I am not ſuch a ſtranger to my ſelf, but that I know it argues exceſs in the higheſt degree, to beſtow ſuch extraordinary commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on a perſon that deſerves ſo little. Had I miſtruſted your being within hearing, I would have put off my diverſion to another time, ſince 'tis not unlikely my Voice may ſeem harſh to you, compar'd to the excellent ones of this City, which you often hear, unleſs it be, that generous natures have an inclination to favour perſons of mean parts, by flattering them, by their praiſes, into an imagination, that their endowments are greater than indeed they are. No more complements, I beſeech you, <hi>replies Marquina, rais'd up to the higheſt pitch of beſotted Love,</hi> my words come ſhort of my faith, and I am to aſſure you withall, Madam, that though I have heard excellent Voices in <hi>Sevil,</hi> (for I muſt confeſs there are ſome ſuch) yet yours is infinitely beyond any of them. Your moſt humble Servant, Sir, <hi>ſays Rufina,</hi> your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are infinitely beyond my deſerts, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58823:30"/>
the honour you do me can do no leſs than raiſe in me a hearty wiſh, that my poor abilities might find you ſome further diverſion with this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince you are pleas'd to acknowledge your ſelf ſo much ſatisfy'd therewith: But my troubles are ſo great and preſſing, that in what I did, I minded onely my own. I muſt ſee them at an end, ere you leave this Houſe, <hi>ſays Marquina to her,</hi> and therefore let me intreat you, if you cannot conclude an abſolute peace with your afflictions, at leaſt condeſcend to a ſhort ceſſation of arms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe reiterations of your favours muſt needs extreamly oblige me, <hi>replies Rufina,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently force me to a greatful compliance with your commands, as far as lies in my power: but I cannot promiſe it you ſo fully as I wiſh, finding the perſon who brought me hither, hath forgotten he did it, otherwiſe he would have found ſome means to have given me a Viſit once in three days. Let not that create you any trouble, <hi>replies the amorous Merchant,</hi> but rather imagine there may be ſome juſt cauſe of his neglect. I have ſome apprehenſion, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that he may be return'd to <hi>Granada,</hi> out of a fear, that, being miſs'd there, he might be queſtion'd as a Complice of my eſcape; and this would prove the greateſt of all my misfortunes, for if he be gone, he hath carried all I had along with him. Never fear it, <hi>ſays Marquina,</hi> for he muſt have more compaſſion than to forſake you in ſo great an extremity; but though he and all elſe fail you, aſſure your ſelf, I ſhall not, whereof I cannot give you a greater aſſurance, than you may derive from this ſincere proteſtation, of my being ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58823:30"/>
your Servant, that I imagine not my ſelf to be the ſame perſon I was before I ſaw you. This transformation is wholly to be attributed to your Divinity, and thence you may inferr the influence you have over me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſo ſaid, <hi>Marquina</hi> made an abſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Love; the cunning Gypſie pretending ſhe underſtood not his meaning, return'd civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the proffers he made her, acknowledging her ſelf extreamly oblig'd to him for his kindneſs, and that ſhe doubted not of the performance of what he was pleas'd, out of his own good nature to promiſe. By this time, Dinner was ſet on the Table; they both ſat down, and the entertainment was very noble, ſuitable to the Love of the Founder; for where that little Deity comes once to reign, the firſt Act he makes, is for the baniſhment of all baſeneſs and avarice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had agreed together, that he ſhould come to her, when he were ſure the old Merchant was abroad, and that he ſhould diſguiſe himſelf like a Beggar, that he might not be known, nor any ſuſpition be conceiv'd of him. She had ſtudied ſeveral ways to chouſe the Merchant of ſome part of his Treaſure, but ſhe could not fix on any one ſhe thought might prove effectual, the Chamber where it was Lock'd being extreamly fortify'd. She had continu'd there three days ere ſhe had either ſeen or heard from <hi>Garay,</hi> and during the time, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd ſo great a diſcontent, as put <hi>Marquina</hi> to much trouble, in regard it kept him from making thoſe free diſcoveries of his Love, which he would otherwiſe have done. In the mean time <hi>Rufina,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58823:31"/>
who watch'd all occaſions, cunningly diſcover'd the place where the Old man hid the Keys of his Iron cheſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> went, according to his cuſtom, into the City, which being obſerv'd by <hi>Garay,</hi> he comes to his Houſe in Beggars weeds, as they had agreed together, with two Crutches. Being got under the Window, at which <hi>Rufina</hi> was looking out, he begg'd an alms of her. She threw him down ſomething, and ask'd him whence he came, whereto <hi>Garay</hi> anſwering that he was of <hi>Granada,</hi> ſhe ſeem'd to be extreamly glad, and thereupon turning to the Gardener's wife, <q>Let us go down a little into the Garden, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> this poor fellow is come out of my Country, I would fain have ſome diſcourſe with him, to know what news he hath brought thence.</q> The poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſuſpecting nothing, made no difficulty to let him into the Garden. <hi>Rufina</hi> ask'd him how long it was ſince he had left <hi>Granada;</hi> whereto he anſwering, about nine or ten days, ſhe continu'd her queſtions ſo long, that the Gardener's wife weary of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and having ſomething elſe to do, left them. Being rid of her, they conſider'd what was to be put in execution the night following, and agreed upon the courſe they were to take, to poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Marquina</hi>'s Treaſure.</p>
            <p>That done, <hi>Garay</hi> departed, and <hi>Rufina</hi> went up to her Chamber, telling the Gardener's wife, ſhe had underſtood ſo much from that poor fellow, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her affairs, that it would not be long ere ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into her Country. The Gardener's wife, and the Maid were little pleas'd to hear that news, as fearing their Maſter would, upon her departure, re-aſſume
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58823:31"/>
his niggardly humour, and keep as miſerable a a houſe as he had done before, nay haply put himſelf and all the ſervants to a greater penance in their diet, to get up what had been ſquander'd away, during her aboad there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> being come home found <hi>Rufina</hi> that night more cheerful than at any time before; which gave him the confidence to acquaint her more freely with his love then he had done, and to aſſure her of the diſquiet he was in upon her account. <hi>Rufina</hi> ſeem'd not to take it amiſs, nay by a greater famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity then ſhe had expreſs'd towards him before, ſhe rais'd in him ſome hopes of ſeeing his deſires ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd: whence the old dotard began to preſume, that the fort would in a ſhort time be taken in upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable tearms. Upon this preſumption, he beſtow'd on her a Ring, which he had purpoſely bought for her, wherein was a Diamond worth about an hundred crowns, ſet about with little Rubies. The Lady gave him many thanks for ſo noble a preſent, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital promis'd him a Leſſon on the Lute, to which ſhe ſung ſome new Aires, though ſhe quarrell'd at the dulneſs of the Inſtrument. <hi>Marquina</hi> promis'd her a better the next day. They parted for that time, but with different thoughts, <hi>Marquina</hi> deſirous to obtain thoſe favours he expected from <hi>Rufina,</hi> and to oblige her thereto by preſents, which overcome the greateſt difficulties; and <hi>Rufina</hi> contriving how to compaſs the robbery ſhe intended.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>Garay</hi> (a perſon of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in ſuch deſigns) got ſome others of the ſame profeſſion to carry on the work; and having obſerv'd <hi>Marquina</hi> going into his houſe, they ſtaid till he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58823:32"/>
were gone to bed, which was ſomewhat late, for <hi>Rufina,</hi> who held a correſpondence with them, had purpoſely kept him up. About midnight, <hi>Garay</hi> and his Camerades brought a thing that had the figure of a man, ſtuff'd with ſtraw, having about him a cloak, which caſt over his ſhoulder, cover'd his face, and pitch'd it over againſt the principal window towards the garden, which was that part of the houſe where <hi>Marquina</hi> lodg'd, and left it there faſtned to a ſtake they had thruſt into the ground. The night was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dark, and ſo more proper for their deſign. Having plac'd that figure, as I told you, they knock'd at the door ſo loud that it might have been heard from one end of the Garden to the other. <hi>Marquina</hi> awaken'd thereby leaps out of his bed, it being ſtrange to him to hear ſuch knocking at his garden door, at ſuch an unſeaſonable time, as being a thing had never happen'd to him before. He call'd up his ſervant, and bid him ſee who knock'd at the door. The ſervant went out between ſleeping and waking to ſee what the matter was, calling as loud as he could, Who knocks there? But no body anſwering, and he not minding the figure that ſtood in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, told his Maſter that there was not any body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> upon that got into bed again and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd himſelf to reſt, but it was ſoon interrupted, for <hi>Garay</hi> knock'd more violently than he had done before, which aſtoniſh'd him the more, and oblig'd him to ſend down his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a ſecond time, to ſee what the matter was. Bringing his Maſter the ſame account he had done before, he got up himſelf, puts his cloak about him, and calls at the window, Who knocks at my door thus unſeaſonably? Whereto no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58823:32"/>
Anſwer being made, he grew the more enrag'd; but looking a little more earneſtly about the houſe than his man had done, he perceiv'd the figure planted before his windows. <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely afraid, at the ſight of a perſon, who, as he thought, knock'd at his door, yet made him no anſwer, and aſſuming more courage than he was naturally Maſter of, he ſaid to him very loud, <q>'Tis baſely done of you, Sir, to abuſe me thus, you ſhall find I am not a perſon to ſuffer it; pray keep on your way, and diſturb not my reſt any more, if you think not your ſelf invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, and that a brace of good bullets will make no impreſſion in your inchanted skin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having made that bravado he ſhut to the window and went to bed; but he was hardly got warm in it, ere they began to knock more violently than they had done before; which oblig'd him to take a fire-lock, which he kept always ready charg'd for the ſecurity of his mony. Opening the window, he found ſtill in the ſame poſture, him, who would not have ſtirr'd out of it, had he not been forc'd by ſome other. What obſtinacy of impudence is it in you, ſaid he to him, very much incens'd, to do a miſchief, you are nothing the better for, in thus diſturbing my reſt? 'tis impardonable, and deſerves an exemplary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement; be you gone immediately from my door, or I ſhall ſend you going the next way. Whereupon cocking the fire-lock, and aiming at him, and the other never ſtirring, as it were out of a preſumption, that he had not any fire-arms, wherewith he might make good his threats, he gave him notice the third time, that he would not oblige him to do a violence which he was unwilling to do. At laſt perceiving he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58823:33"/>
minded not any thing he ſaid, but as 'twere defi'd him, he reſolv'd to give fire, not onely to frighten him, but, if he could, to hurt him. He ſhot, and the figure fell to the ground, upon which <hi>Garay,</hi> who was not far off, cries out with a doleful tone, <hi>O God, I am kill'd;</hi> and immediately he and his Camerades made a great noiſe at the ſight of a man ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately murther'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely troubled at what he had done, it being obſerv'd, that covetous perſons are for the moſt part cowardly, and extremely fear what-ever may cauſe them any loſs. He ſhut the window, and in a great fright awaking <hi>Rufina</hi> (who had greater things to mind than ſleeping) told her what he had done. She ſeem'd to be extremely troubled at it, and much blam'd him, that he had executed ſo cruel a reſolution. For since he knew himſelf to be ſafe enough in his own houſe, he might have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd them to knock at his door till they had been weary; that he had better endur'd that noiſe, and loſt a little of his reſt, than be in the trouble he was in, that he had been the cauſe of a man's death. She added ſeveral other reaſons, which ſo confounded poor <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he knew not what to do. She advis'd him for his ſafety, to go immediately and take refuge in the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that if the dead perſon were found there the next morning, he would be carried to priſon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murther'd ſo near his houſe. <hi>Marquina</hi> was ſo perplex'd, that he wiſh'd he had never come into the world; and it is to be imagin'd, that if <hi>Rufina</hi> had not been very highly concern'd to diſſemble upon this occaſion, she would have dy'd with laughing. He
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58823:33"/>
rais'd up all his people, and told them what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and all blam'd him, for his being ſo forward to commit ſuch an action, which made the poor old dotard almoſt mad. He imagin'd himſelf already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, his mony carri'd away, and but a ſmall matter between him and hanging, at leaſt if he were oblig'd by tortures to acknowledge his crime, never conſidering that it was pardonable for one man to kill another in his own defence. At laſt, he reſolv'd to go to S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s; but knew not how to diſpoſe of his mony. He thought it no prudence to leave it at the diſcretion of his Servants; to carry it to a friend's houſe (in caſe he had any, for perſons of his humour have very few) he had not time. In this diſtraction he deſir'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to adviſe him; ſhe ſeeming very much troubled, and no leſs fearful than he, pretended ſhe could not give him any; but after a little pauſe ſhe gave him that advice, which ſhe had prepar'd long before, and he follow'd it. She ask'd him what mony he might have in the houſe? He ingenuouſly confeſs'd that he had about four thouſand crowns in gold, and ſomewhat better than half the ſaid ſumme in ſilver. <q>I'l tell you what I would do, were I in your caſe, <hi>ſays the ſubtil Picara,</hi> (ſince it cannot be carried to a friend's houſe without being ſeen) I would burie it in the garden, in ſome place, where you may afterwards find it, by ſome mark you ſhall ſet to that purpoſe. This you muſt do your ſelf, ſo as that your very ſervants may not know any thing of it, leſt they might be tempted to prove falſe to you; for the times are ſuch now, that a man muſt have a care whom he truſts. I would aſſiſt you herein, and keep your counſel, were it not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58823:34"/>
that I am afraid, when the ſearch comes to be made, and I be left here, I ſhall be the firſt taken; and I would be loath to run my ſelf into that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, having but juſt eſcap'd thoſe I have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with.</q> In the midſt of his affliction, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> was troubled to perceive by his gueſt's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the diſturbance ſhe was in upon his account, and what ſtruck him moſt to the heart, was, that he ſaw himſelf upon the point of loſing her. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration forc'd from him not onely tears, but alſo bitter exclamations againſt the malicious croſsneſs of his fortune. <hi>Rufina</hi> deſir'd him to be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, perſuading him to do as ſhe advis'd him, and hope the beſt. So that having commanded all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to go to their ſeveral chambers, and not to ſtir thence, he and <hi>Rufina,</hi> whom onely he durſt truſt, went to the place where the mony was. It lay in a huge cheſt, cover'd all over with iron-bars, and the keys were ſo extraordinary, that it was impoſſible to counterfeit them, or to get a piece thence by any other wile than what was invented by our ſubtil Ferret.</p>
            <p>They firſt took out all the ſilver, and then put the gold into a little box, and, having brought all into the garden, they made two holes, at ſome diſtance one from the other, in one whereof they put the ſilver, and in the other, the gold, ſetting a mark that they might find the places again. <hi>Marquina</hi> took along with him two hundred crowns in gold, and gave <hi>Rufina</hi> fifty, to ſhift for her ſelf, till the buſineſs were accommodated.</p>
            <p>That done, they went up into the houſe, whence they might ſee ſeveral perſons walking with a light;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58823:34"/>
'twas <hi>Garay</hi> and his camerades, who repreſented the Magiſtrate, which <hi>Rufina</hi> ſhewing him, advis'd him to make all the haſte he could to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s. To do that, they got over the garden wall, as being afraid to open the door, for they perceiv'd the actors of this comedy kept a watch there, with ſuch authority, as if they had really been the Officers of Juſtice. All <hi>Marquina</hi>'s family follow'd him over the wall, fearing they might come into trouble for their Maſter's fault. <hi>Marquina</hi> and his Miſtreſs lurk'd ſomewhere thereabouts, till it was day, that they might have the Church-door open, to get into the Monaſtery. <hi>Garay</hi> was hard by, to ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of <hi>Marquina</hi> and his people. Finding he had left his houſe, and got into the Monaſtery with <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> he went about an hour after Sun-riſing to St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s, in the habit of a Secular Prieſt, that he might the better ſpeak to <hi>Rufina.</hi> She told him how things ſtood, and how they had buried the mony in the garden, and that it was all in ſilver, intending to reſerve all the gold for her ſelf.</p>
            <p>About mid-night <hi>Garay</hi> and one of his Camerades went along with <hi>Rufina,</hi> diſguiz'd in man's cloaths, to the garden. They help'd her over firſt, to go and ſee whether there might be any body in the houſe, but all were vaniſh'd as if the houſe had been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited. She thereupon call'd <hi>Garay</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and, having taken up the mony, they carri'd it away, and took up their quarters at one of the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Inns of the ſuburbs. Having been merry a while, and drunk their own healths, and to the good ſucceſs of their future deſigns, they went all to bed, the two men together, and <hi>Rufina</hi> by her ſelf. As ſoon as she
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58823:35"/>
found they were aſleep, ſhe puts on the ſame habit, and returns to the garden. She took up the little box of gold, and, without any diſaſter, got ſafe to the Inn before her companions awaked.</p>
            <p>The next day, having divided the ſilver, whereof ſhe and <hi>Garay</hi> had the beſt part, and ſew'd up the gold in her cloaths, ſhe left <hi>Sevit,</hi> taking <hi>Garay</hi> along with her, who, finding what advantages he might make of her company, reſolv'd to run fortunes with her. They took their way towards <hi>Madrid,</hi> to which place they will be got, by that time we ſhall ſee what is become of <hi>Marquina,</hi> whom we left in St. <hi>Bernard's</hi> Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>Having continu'd there four days after <hi>Rufina's</hi> departure from him, he knew not what to think of her that ſhe came not again, as ſhe had promis'd. He addreſs'd himſelf to one of the Monks, who had great acquaintances in the City, and intreated him to inquire what proceedings there might be againſt him, upon the murther he had committed. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man promis'd him an account of it; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enquir'd at thoſe places where he might moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hear thereof, no body could give him any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. He thereupon told <hi>Marquina,</hi> that he might ſafely go abroad and needed not to fear any thing. He went out one night to a friend's of his, whom he acquainted with all that had paſt, as alſo the great perplexity he was in, deſiring him to make a more particular enquiry into the buſineſs, than he thought the Religious man had done. He did ſo, and gave him the ſame account as the other. Yet would not that ſatisfie him, but he muſt deſire his friend to go to his houſe, whereof he gave him the Miſtris key.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58823:35"/>
He went, and found it without any body in it, and his Mule dead, for want of meat and tendance. He went with this news to his friend, adviſing him to come out of the Monaſtery, and go home, and thence about the City, as he was wont to do. The death of his Mule troubled him not much, ſo glad was he to find himſelf once more at liberty: the onely thing gave him any diſquiet, was, that his <hi>Theodora</hi> (under which name <hi>Rufina</hi> went) came not to ſee him. But he imagin'd the cauſe of it might be, that, being a young Maid, ſhe had ſhelter'd her ſelf ſome-where, to keep out of the hands of Juſtice, or that haply ſhe might have been met with by her Father, who, as ſhe had told him, ſought after her. He went to his houſe, whither came ſoon after the Gardener and his wife, and the other ſervants. He goes into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and, notwithſtanding all the fear and diſtraction he had been in, remembred the place where he had hid his mony, and was not a little glad to find the mark where he had ſet it; ſo that before he went to bed, he reſolv'd to ſecure his treaſure in its former gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. As ſoon as it was dark, he takes the Gardener with him, and a Lanthorn and Candle, and goes firſt to the place where the Silver was, and bids him digg. He did ſo, but there was nothing to be found, whereat <hi>Marquina</hi> was extremely ſurpriz'd. He went thence to the place where they had laid the gold, and there they found as little, onely <hi>Rufina</hi> knew what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all. He walk'd ſeveral turns about the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with much vexation, imagining the marks might be miſplac'd; but what in looking after the marks, and what in digging; the night ſlipp'd away, ſo that at laſt diſpairing to find any thing that night, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58823:36"/>
himſelf like a perſon diſtracted. The Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner knew not what he look'd for, nor for what reaſon he had brought him thither. The poor man reſolv'd to have a little patience till the next morning, being ſtill in ſome hope to find what he had hidden. He went to bed, or rather to ſpend the night in unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable torments: but as ſoon as it began to dawn, he got up, and having call'd up the Gardener, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the work they had been at the night before. Having digg'd again at thoſe places, where he was confident he had laid the mony, all they could find was, that there had been two holes made there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that mony or ſomething elſe had been hidden there, but all was remov'd. This aſſurance made him run ſtark mad, throwing himſelf on the ground, running his head againſt the wall, and doing ſuch things as rais'd a compaſſion in his ſervants, who thence concluded that he had loſt his mony, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the feign'd <hi>Theodora,</hi> to have robb'd him, by the orders he gave them to ſearch after her all over the City. But ſhe was far enough out of his reach, and had ſo wel ſecur'd his mony, that it was not likely it would come into his cheſts any more. He kept his bed a good while, our of a pure madneſs, that he had ſo ſoon loſt, what had coſt him many years trouble and pains to get together. The robbery was ſoon divulg'd all over the City; ſome, who knew not his humour, pitied his misfortune, but ſuch as had experience of his inſatiable avarice, were not a little pleas'd to find him ſo juſtly puniſh'd.</p>

She was gotten far enough out of the way, ere he was ſenſible of his loſs, for the next night after they had taken away the Money, ſhe and <hi>Garay</hi> hired two Mules, upon which they came to <hi>Carmona,</hi> which lies about half a days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Sevil.</hi> They had taken up two places in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58823:37"/>
the <hi>Madrid-</hi>coach, which was to paſs through that City, and take them up as it went. They lighted, at <hi>Carmona,</hi> at one of the beſt Inns, where <hi>Rufina,</hi> keeping out of ſight, was reſolv'd to expect the Coach, conſidering with her ſelf, what ſhe might come to in time, now that ſhe was already Miſtreſs of four thouſand Crowns in Gold, in good double Piſtols and Quadruples, which was all that penurious Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant had gotten together, during his whole Life, with much pains taking, and many a hazardous ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the moſt remote Climats. Behold here, the exemplary puniſhment, which many times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to thoſe miſerable wretches, who become the Slaves of their own wealth. And what infinitely adds to their misfortune, is, that people are more apt to congratulate than bemoan it: for how can they expect that others ſhould have any kindneſs for them, when they themſelves have not any but for what they lay up in their Cheſts?</p>
            <p>The Coach which our fortunate adventurers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to carry them to <hi>Madrid,</hi> came at its uſual time to <hi>Carmona.</hi> There were in it already ſix Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, a Gentleman, and his Lady, a Prieſt, two Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-Scholars, and a Servant belonging to the Prieſt, a young Lad about fifteen years of Age. They all knew, that there were two perſons to be taken in at <hi>Carmona,</hi> who had paid ſomewhat extraordinary, for the beſt places. They accordingly reſign'd them, as ſoon as they perceiv'd their coming towards the Coach: but <hi>Garay,</hi> who was a very civil and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging perſon, would needs recommend his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the place to the Gentleman's Lady, whom he ſeated on the left ſide of <hi>Rufina,</hi> and ſat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58823:37"/>
in the fore-part of the Coach, with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>All being plac'd to their content, they left <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> on the Munday morning, it being in <hi>September,</hi> when moſt Fruits are ripe. All thought it a great happineſs, that they had met ſo good Company; but <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had another ſecret ſatisfaction, ariſing from the thought of the good prize that had brought them into that good Company. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was a Perſon of excellent diſcourſe; the Prieſt, of a very ſociable and converſative humour, and the two young Scholars made it appear, that they had not miſ-pent their time at the Univerſity, every one being deſirous to make the beſt diſcovery he could of his abilities. The Prieſt took occaſion to tell them, that he was going to Court, to get a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, to put two little pieces of his into the Preſs, being ſuch as ſome Friends of his had aſſur'd him he ſhould oblige the World in the publication of them. The Gentleman, who ſate next him, was a perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Letters, and expreſs'd a great curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to know what they might treat of. Doctor <hi>Monſalvo</hi> (ſo was the Prieſt called) told him they were Books of Diſcourſes, and Divertiſements; repreſenting to him that things of that kind, were kindly receiv'd at Court: that one of them was entituled, <hi>The Staple of Diſcourſe and Complements;</hi> and the other, <hi>The Flowers of Helicon;</hi> that the former contained twelve <hi>Moral Novels,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of Verſes; and the <hi>Flowers of Helicon</hi> was a collection of <hi>Poems</hi> written by him, during his Reſidence at the Univerſity of <hi>Salamanca.</hi> He told them withall, that, if they thought it not tedious,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58823:38"/>
he would entertain them with ſomewhat out of the former, when ever they ſhould be at leiſure to give him attention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was a great lover and reader of ſuch Treatiſes, intreated the Doctor, if it were no trouble to him, to read one of his Novels, promiſing her ſelf, from the aſſurance ſhe had of his excellent parts, that the ſtile and conceptions would be anſwerable to the worthineſs of the Author. <q>I have endeavour'd, all I could, Madam, <hi>ſays the Doctor to her,</hi> to conform my ſelf to the ſtile now us'd at Court; my Proſe is free from affectation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not weary the Reader, nor are the conceipts ſo flat as to produce the ſame effect. I make it my buſineſs to give my Writings a little life and ſmartneſs, which may raiſe in the Reader an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to know the period of the adventures. I write as I ſpeak, becauſe I ſee Men love thoſe things that are natural, better than thoſe which ſmell of too much ſtudy and affectation; and take it from me as a thing very certain, that it requires a certain meaſure of confidence for any Man to write as the times go now; which proceeds hence, that ſo many excellent Wits buſie themſelves in writing, and publiſh things as admirable as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and not onely Men, who profeſs Letters, but alſo ſome Women. Among the latter, how are we to celebrate the ingenuity of <hi>Donna Maria de Zaras,</hi> and <hi>Soto Mayor,</hi> who hath worthily deſerv'd the title of the <hi>Sibyl of Madrid,</hi> as alſo the reputation ſhe hath acquir'd of an excellent Wit, and to do admirable things in Poetry, having lately put into the Preſs a piece containing ten <hi>Novels,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:58823:38"/>
which are look'd on as ſo many miracles, by thoſe who are Judges in that kind of writing? The excellency of her Proſe, and the ſubtilty of the deſigns, together with the inſinuating intertexture of the Verſes, have given mate to the beſt Pens of <hi>Spain. Donna Anna Caro de Malien,</hi> a Native of our City of <hi>Sevil,</hi> comes not much behind her, and may be allow'd near the ſame meaſure of praiſe. Her ſweet and harmonious Verſes ſuſpend the Spirits, and charm the Ears of all that hear them, as hath been ſeen, by thoſe publiſh'd by her the laſt Carnaval, at the new Palace, built by his Majeſty, near the <hi>Courſe,</hi> which may be called the eighth Wonder of the World, ſince ſhe ſpeaks of it, with an eloquence anſwerable to the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which had been there made, many days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the divertiſement of their Catholick Majeſties.</q> The Doctor having ended this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he took out his Book of <hi>Novels,</hi> and, the Company having compos'd themſelves to ſilence and attention, he entertain'd them with that which follows.</p>

                        <p>During that part of the year, which makes a kind of ceſſation of Arms in thoſe colder Countries, his aboad was in the City of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> where, by certain Letters from <hi>Valentia,</hi> he receiv'd the news of his Father's death, which made him, being the eldeſt, heir of a very conſiderable eſtate.

                        <p>Being come to <hi>Valentia,</hi> where his Relations and Friends kindly entertained him, he began to order the management of his affairs, not trifling away his time in unprofitable diverſions, whereto young Men are but too much addicted. For though he were a Souldier, yet was he no lover of Gaming, a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for which he was much to be commended, conſidering his Age and Quality: inaſmuch as Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming occaſions a thouſand misfortunes, and unhappy accidents, whereof there had happened not a few at <hi>Valentia.</hi> Nor was <hi>Don Alexander</hi> as yet any way inclin'd to Love, though he could not want occaſions to expreſs his Courtſhip, and how far he had ſtudied the Myſteries of Love and Eloquence, ſince what added much to the Luſtre of that City, was the great number of fair Ladies, ſhining in it like ſo many ſtars.

                        <p>'Tis a cuſtom in <hi>Valentia,</hi> that at the beginning of the Spring, for the ſpace of about fifteen days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt of the families of the City go about the Silk-husbandry, which they have in the adjacent Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.

He ſtopp'd his horſe, imagining the perſon playing on that Inſtrument ſo excellently might alſo ſing to it. He expected a while with much impatience; but the Muſician putting the Inſtrument into ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tunes, did not what he ſo much deſired, which was, to hear her voice. In the mean time night came on, and Don <hi>Alexander</hi> extremely delighted with the place he was in, gave his horſe to his Lacquey, and cauſing him to remove a little diſtance off, he ſtaid alone, under the green Balcony, whence the Muſick came, to find out who made it. But he had not waited long, ere he could perceive, by the light of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58823:41"/>
the Moon, that it was a Lady, who being got into that Balcony to take the advantage of a gentle wind then blowing, began afreſh her delightful Muſick on the Lute, whereto ſhe join'd that of an admirable voice, ſinging an Air, which made an abſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that Heart, wherein all the hardſhips of War had not made the leaſt breach. Whence we may deduce this Remark, That <hi>Cupid</hi> can do more in a minute, than <hi>Mars,</hi> in a <hi>Troy-</hi>ſiege.</p>
                        <p>To ſay the ſame thing again in other words, The excellency of the Voice, and the tranſcendent nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the hand, the compliance and competition between them, ſo raviſh'd our young Gallant, that he wiſh'd ſhe might never give over, at leaſt not till he were ſatiated with that pleaſure. But the Lady laid by her Inſtrument, and leaning her breaſt on the Balcony, though 'twere night, made a ſhift to ſee the young Gallant, whom her Muſick had ti'd ſo long by the ears; who alſo perceiving her, would needs make his advantage of ſo bleſt an opportunity. So that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as near her as he could, he broke forth into this Complement: <q>How infinitely happy muſt that abſent Gentleman be, Madam, (for in the Verſes ſhe had ſung, ſhe bemoan'd the abſence of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſon) who deſerves ſo excellent a voice to bemoan his abſence. I ſhould be extremely glad of his acquaintance, that I may give him that of this good news, that he is ſo obligingly bemoan'd by ſo deſerving a Lady as you ſeem to be.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Lady wondred to find her ſelf ſurpriz'd, but recovering out of her aſtoniſhment, though ſhe knew not the perſon who had ſpoken to her, ſhe gave him this Anſwer. <q>As to the Song you heard, Sir, you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58823:41"/>
are not to imagine it ſung out of any tenderneſs I have for ſome perſon now far from me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may ſpare your ſelf the trouble to learn who it may be, and conſequently to tell him how highly he is in my favour, as you imagine. What aſſurance can I have of that, <hi>ſays Alexander,</hi> knowing, by what I have heard from your own mouth, the predominant paſſion of your ſoul? How, I pray, Sir, may you be concern'd in that, ſaid ſhe to him? Very much, replies he; for the enchantment of your voice hath been ſo powerful over him who hath heard it, that it is not without reaſon he requires aſſurances of what he asks you, to prevent the diſquiet, which he muſt otherwiſe expect.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>She could not forbear laughing at this diſcourſe of <hi>Don Alexander</hi>'s, and telling him withall, that Women do prudently, when they are flattered, not to believe any thing that Men ſay to them, in regard they never ſpeak truth, repreſenting things, not as they really are, but as they appear to their beguil'd imaginations,. <q>Wherein, I pray, <hi>ſays Alexander,</hi> do you think, Madam, that I have told you any thing ſhort of truth? Miſtake me not, <hi>repli'd ſhe,</hi> I do not charge you with a coming ſhort, but going much beyond it, for you are ſo prodigal of your commendations of a perſon you are yet very little acquainted with, nay have not ſo much as well view'd, that, you muſt either laugh at my ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or think me a great admirer of my ſelf, if I ſhould credit what you ſay. To convince you of either your errour or palpable flattery, of many, I need onely give you this one inſtance, that, when
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58823:42"/>
I my ſelf, and others whoſe judgments I dare truſt, think I do not ſing tolerably well, you would make me believe, that my voice hath rais'd you into ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſies, when another would not have a minute's patience to hear me. Nay, Madam, <hi>replies he,</hi> take heed your reproaches rebound not upon your ſelf, diſparage not your ſelf ſo far, and ſlight not Truth ſo much as to call her by any other name than her own; you have an admirable voice, and the ſubject of the words you ſung muſt needs be ſuch, ſince it is not to be imagin'd you ſung them in vain. To make them perfect, there needs onely the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a little jealouſie, were it not that the happy man, upon whoſe account thoſe words were made, knowing your worth, cannot give you any.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon this the Lady remov'd from the place where ſhe was, that ſhe might more commodiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in her diſcourſe with <hi>Don Alexander,</hi> (though ſhe knew him not) for ſhe imagin'd he could not talk at that rate without ſome ground. Which made her ſay to him, <q>If you make any compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that enchantment you ſpeak of, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion you ſeem to have, I can aſſure you, that you are very well read in the art of Flattery, and therefore I beſeech you, attribute not a melancholy humour I am ſubject to, to any regret occaſion'd by the abſence of any perſon, for I was never yet troubled with any ſuch thing, and I think ſhall not as long as I live. I would give all I am worth in the world, <hi>ſays he,</hi> conditionally what you ſay were true. Would your hazard be very great in that, <hi>replied ſhe?</hi> Very little, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> conſidering the account upon which I proffer it; but I ſhould ſay
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58823:42"/>
no leſs were I poſſeſs'd of all the world, and think it well beſtow'd. I am extremely happy, <hi>anſwers the Lady,</hi> to hear things ſo highly ſpoken to my advantage; but I ſhould be tranſcendently vain, to imagine I ſhould raiſe love in any perſon before I am ſeen by him: nay, I dare promiſe you, that if you had ſeen my face, you would not haply be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. My hearing cannot deceive me, <hi>replies he,</hi> and I preſume, that the perſon, who is ſo excellent to ſatisfie that part, may be the like in other things, which the envious night permits me not a view of at preſent. And when you conſider, that in the diſcourſe I have had with you, I have not talk'd of beams, nor ſplendor, nor us'd thoſe expreſſions, which they ſeem to have ſtudied; who with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Hyperboles, make it their buſineſs to flatter and abuſe Ladies, you ſhould in ſome meaſure aſſure your ſelf, that I begin to conceive an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned paſſion for you. Well, to humour you a little, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> I have ſome inclination to believe you, which will be much confirm'd, if you tell me who you are. I have a deſire, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> firſt to deſerve it by my ſervices, that, in caſe there may be any thing wanting in me, as to Quality, thoſe I hope to render you may ſupply the defect. Nay then I am ſatisfi'd, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> that you are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Quality, when you have ſuch a diſtruſt of your ſelf. Pardon me that I am forc'd to leave you, for I hear my ſelf call'd to receive ſome company newly come into the houſe, and if I ſhould not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be gone, ſome would come and find me here. Do me the favour then, <hi>ſays Alexander,</hi> to give me leave to wait on you here to morrow at
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58823:43"/>
this time. I know not whether it may be in my power, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> however do you not fail to come hither; and though ſomething may prevent my giving you the meeting, yet ſhall I think my ſelf very much oblig'd to you. I ſhall infallibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you, <hi>replies the enamour'd Gallant,</hi> more fix'd in my reſolution than the Stars, you ſee, are in the firmament. Your laſt words, repli'd ſhe, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not-ſleep to night, will find my thoughts a diverſion to deceive the dull ſeaſon; but when you come next, I beſeech you, be not ſo liberal of your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles, me-thinks they grate the ear, and I think all that uſe them great Flatterers, and conſequently no great honourers of Truth, eſpecially conſidering how meanly I deſerve.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having ſaid thus, and given him a very obliging ſalute, ſhe got out of the Balcony, leaving <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in a little diſturbance, to ſee that ſhe left him ſo ſoon: for he was extremely taken as well with the excellency of her voice, as that of her diſcourſe. He had a great deſire to know who ſhe was, and ſhe had the ſame curioſity concerning him, for ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commanded a ſervant to follow him, and not to return till he had diſcover'd who he was: which he did without much trouble, inaſmuch as not far thence, he ſaw him get up on horſe-back, and knew him, and preſently return'd with the news to his Miſtris, who was over-joy'd to hear it was <hi>Don Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> of whom ſhe had heard ſuch noble things, and ſeen behave himſelf ſo galantly at the Hunting of the Bulls.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Alexander,</hi> being come home, enquir'd of a Neighbour of his, who that Lady might be to whom
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58823:43"/>
he had ſpoken; and deſcribing to him the place where ſhe Liv'd, he underſtood her name was <hi>Donna Iſabella,</hi> (the Sir-name, for ſome reaſon, I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear) a Lady of great repute in the City, and of extraordinary endowments, whoſe underſtanding was equal to her beauty, Daughter to one <hi>Don Berenguel Antonio,</hi> a perſon of great fame for his long ſervices in the Wars, who having quitted the Military life, and Married, well advanc'd in years, had left that fair Daughter, who was then Fatherleſs and Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, with a very inconſiderable fortune; in regard her Father's eſtate conſiſted moſt in Penſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on him by King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, in requital of his Services. This Lady liv'd with an Aunt of hers, an ancient Gentlewoman, who for the moſt part kept her Bed, and was then retir'd to that Country-houſe, to look after her Silk-husbandry.</p>
                        <p>Thus was <hi>Alexander</hi> fully inform'd of all he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to know, though he had already had a particular accompt of the perfections which made the City of <hi>Valentia</hi> full of diſcourſes of her Beauty and Wit, which was ſuch that ſhe had the reputation of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good Verſes, a quality very recommendable in a perſon of her Sex and Quality. <hi>Alexander</hi> had never ſeen her, and was very deſirous to do it, even before he had ſeen her; and underſtanding ſhe Liv'd at that Country-houſe, his deſire was the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd: which made him Ride abroad the oftner, hoping to be favour'd with ſuch another opportunity as he had met with before. But he had not that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs a good while, her Aunt being ſo ſick, that ſhe could not ſtir out of the room where ſhe lay. About fifteen days afterwards, the old Gentlewoman being
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58823:44"/>
a little recover'd, ſhe had the liberty to go and ſee the Profeſſion of a Nun, at the Royal Monaſtery of <hi>Zaida,</hi> which was not far from the Country-houſe: At which Ceremony all the Gallantry of <hi>Valentia,</hi> of both Sexes, was preſent. <hi>Donna Iſabella</hi> came thither alſo, but having her face cover'd with her Mantle, and attended onely by one of her Women, ſhe got into a little obſcure Chappel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the other ſide, who fail'd not to be there, hoping to meet her, on whom he had faſten'd his affections, wondred very much that he found her not among the other Ladies; and ſuſpecting ſhe might be one of thoſe who were retir'd into that Chappel, and had their faces cover'd with their Mantles, he went in to them, with two other friends, to whom he ſaid, (preſuming it was ſhe as ſoon as he ſaw her) <q>The new-made Nun is not much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to theſe Ladies, who retire to a place, whence they cannot ſee thoſe Ceremonies, which all the reſt are ſo deſirous to do: but I attribute this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to the little inclination they have to become Nuns.</q>
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> was not a little pleas'd to ſee <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom ſhe had before obſerv'd in the Church, and wiſh'd not ſo well attended as he then was. However, changing her Voice, ſhe return'd him this anſwer. <q>Being not invited to this Feaſt, we cannot expect the ſame welcome as thoſe that are: And for the little curioſity we diſcover to ſee the Ceremonies uſed, at the reception of a Nun, having ſeen the like ſeveral times before, we do not much mind this, in regard the ſeeing of it but once is enough to ſatisfie a perſon inclinable to be a Nun. </q>
                           <q>Nay then, I ſee, ſays one of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58823:44"/>
friends, that you are not of their number who have a deſire to enter into that Profeſſion. </q>
                           <q>I have no Anſwer to make you as to that, <hi>reply'd ſhe,</hi> ſave that a perſon cannot enter into this ſtate of Life, unleſs he be thereto called by God, a favour I do not yet find in my ſelf that ſhe hath done me. </q>
                           <q>We may then, <hi>replies Alexander,</hi> infer from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of yours, that you are not Married, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be ſo. </q>
                           <q>What my inclinations are, as to Marriage, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> I am not oblig'd to give you any accompt, who are very far from being related to me ſo nearly, as that I ſhould acquaint you with my reſolution in a buſineſs of that concernment. </q>
                           <q>However, you may ſatisfie us ſo far, Madam, <hi>ſays Alexander,</hi> as to let us know, which condition of Life you would rather chooſe. </q>
                           <q>Which I pray, Sir, would you adviſe me to, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him?</hi> 
                           </q>
                           <q>That of Matrimony, <hi>ſays Alexander.</hi> 
                           </q>
                           <q>What, whether I have the accommodations requiſite to enter into that ſtate, or not? <hi>reply'd ſhe.</hi> 
                           </q>
                           <q>If all be wanting, <hi>ſays he to her,</hi> you muſt endeavour to forget your ſelf, for ſhe who is not born to be a Nun, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Married, muſt remain Newter, as being uncapable of both. </q>
                           <q>I could very well follow that advice, <hi>ſaid ſhe.</hi> 
                           </q>
                           <q>But if you pleaſe, Madam, <hi>ſays Alexander,</hi> to diſcover, what your Mantle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us not to ſee, I will give you a better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Coming up nearer her, as if he were confident of that favour, ſhe met his deſires, and purpoſely gave him a full view of one of her fair Eyes, which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s two friends alſo took notice of. <q>If the advice you intend to give me, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58823:45"/>
prove to my diſadvantage, 'twere better, I ſhould ſtill continue undiſcover'd, though to hear your advice, I ſhould not think it much to anſwer your expectation. That can do you no prejudice, <hi>ſays Alexander to her,</hi> in regard we have obſerv'd ſome things which aſſure us, that you ought to chooſe the ſtate of Matrimony, in which you would make the perſon you ſhould think worthy your enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the happieſt Man in the world: Nay, ere I know any more of you than I do already, I wiſh my ſelf the perſon, for whom that felicity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. </q>His two friends affirm'd the ſame thing on their own behalf, being extreamly ſatisfy'd with her Wit, and the little they had ſeen of her Face, <q>Can there be any happineſs comparable to mine, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> who have three ſuch handſome Perſons at my Devotion, of whom it is in my power to make one the happieſt Man in the World? Well, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſince you cannot expect I ſhould make a ſudden choice in a buſineſs of this concern, you will give me leave to examine your ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that I may pitch upon him, who, in my judgement, may pretend to moſt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon that every one began to celebrate his own worth, and undervalue his Competitors. They paſs'd away ſome time in that pleaſant diſcourſe, without any offence taken, though the place they were in ſhould have minded them, that ſome other Converſation would have been more ſuitable: But now a-days, young people are grown to that height of Profaneneſs, that they make little difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Churches and Exchanges. But the Lady having had the patience to hear what every one had to ſay on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58823:45"/>
his own behalf, ſhe anſwer'd them altogether, thus; <q>I am fully inform'd of the qualities, and deſerts of Perſons every way ſo excellent; I am now to adviſe with my Pillow, to know which of the three I ſhould prefer, though to tell you the truth, I have in a manner reſolv'd upon my choice already, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my ſelf a ſtronger inclination for one of the three than for either of the other two. The perſon I mean hath many excellent qualities, but the particular inducement I have to think him worthy my approbation, is, that I know him to be a very great Wit; all I have to object againſt him, is, that he fears I am already engag'd to ſome other, whence I infer he is jealous, and conſequently of an ill nature.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> immediately apprehended ſhe ſpoke of him, reflecting on what had paſt in their diſcourſe the firſt time he had ſeen her. The time being come for people to go out of the Church, the three Lovers out-vy'd one the other to find out paſſionate comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take leave of the Lady, <hi>Alexander</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofely ſtaying to be the laſt, onely to whiſper theſe words to her. <q>'Tis too great a Tyranny, Madam, towards a Servant ſo paſſionately yours, in ſo long time not to vouchſafe him a full ſight of you: I beſeech you, be more kind to him hereafter, leaſt your further diſdain may have ſome fatal effects on him. The indiſpoſition of an Aunt, <hi>reply'd ſhe,</hi> whom I muſt conſtantly attend, I hope, you will think an allowable excuſe; and what I tell you is much more true, than the expreſſions you make to me of your Love. But I will endeavour your ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and put a period to your complaints,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58823:46"/>
when, poſſibly, you leaſt expect it.</q> 
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> had not the time to make her any Anſwer, and ſo he parted from her, leaving her deeply in Love, and extreamly deſirous to diſcourſe with him more at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                        <p>Some few days after, Fortune favour'd her with an opportunity to her own wiſhes, at the ſame Balcony where he had ſpoken to her the firſt time. As ſoon as ſhe perceiv'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhe came down, and they diſcours'd a long time together without any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The effect of this interview and long confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, upon <hi>Alexander,</hi> was, that his Love, before little better than kindled, now broke forth into a flame. <hi>Iſabella</hi> came not much behind him, yet had that command of her paſſion, as not to grant him the greateſt kindneſs that can happen between perſons of different Sexes, though it were out of this onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that to have done it, at the firſt interview, would have argu'd ſuch a compliance and eaſineſs of Nature, as no Violence of affection ſhould ever be able to excuſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> being now fully ſatisfy'd that <hi>Iſabella</hi> was both a great Wit, and a great Beauty, writ ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Love-letters to her, and the better to expreſs his paſſion, he alſo ſent her ſome Verſes of his own compoſure. <hi>Iſabella</hi> knew, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> among ſo many other qualities he had acquir'd, was alſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Poetry, and conſequently was the more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd and ſatisfy'd therewith. Some of his Miſſives ſhe very modeſtly anſwered in theſe tearms.</p>

                                 <hi>I</hi> See then, Madam, ſo that you procure your own ſatisfaction, you care not what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences I may run into; ſince that to be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in your praiſes (as you ſeem to deſire) cannot be without ſo much the greater prejudice to my reputation, in that I think my ſelf far ſhort of tranſcendency, in that particular, and I am forc'd to bring in the exceſs of my Love, to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of my Poetry. That I may therefore be no more guilty of ſuch a crime, I will henceforth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my ſelf in Proſe, and in ſome meaſure do what you command me in your Letter. You would find it no great difficulty to believe me, if you knew what I feel; nay though out of modeſty you pretend to be ignorant of it, I defie you to do it, unleſs withal you reſolve never to conſult your Glaſs any more. Well, Madam, it may be the time of your converſion is not yet come, when it ſhall, your eyes will be opened, and you ſhall find, that, of all the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58823:47"/>
hearts, ſubdu'd by the charms of your Beauty, mine may haply be the least, but withal the moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate captive. Time, which gives all things their birth, perfection, and period, ſhall be the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, to try whether this be Truth or Fiction; nay I leave it to the ſame old Gentleman to aſſure you of a thing, you yet pretend to be ignorant of, which is, that, while I live, you ſhall be ſole Sovereign Miſtreſs and Directreſs of my Inclinations. And then haply good nature, gratitude, and generoſity will rather adviſe you to acknowledgements of the love I bear you, than a reſentment of the injuries you charge me withal.</p>

                        <p>This Letter gave <hi>Iſabella</hi> that ſatisfaction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her new Gallant, which ſhe expected. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits were continu'd of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s ſide, and the Epiſtolary correſpondence on both ſides: ſo that the inclinations they had one to another were, by theſe degrees, heightned into a noble flame of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love. His Miſtreſs commanded him above all things to keep his pretenſions to her very ſecret, which he inviolably promis'd to do. Nay ſhe was ſo ſcrupulous as to that particular, that if in the Church, or ſome other publick place, her Gallant did ſo much as caſt his Eye on her, in the company of ſome friend, ſhe immediately imagin'd, that he acquainted him with his paſſion; and, as if ſhe had heard all their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe fail'd not to ſend him a Letter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, if ſhe could not ſee him time enough, that he might receive her reproaches himſelf. <hi>Alexander</hi>
                           <pb n="86" facs="tcp:58823:48"/>
clear'd himſelf the beſt he could, ſtill aſſuring her of the contrary; and enflam'd with love and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all he could do was to diſpel that diffidence, which troubled him extremely. But the ſame Love, which is wont to reconcile the leſſer differences and diſſatisfactions that happen between Lovers, helps them alſo out of the greateſt and moſt difficult. 'Twas <hi>Alexander</hi>'s deſign to marry this Lady, though her fortunes were very low: but he delay'd the doing of it, till he had effected a buſineſs he was then engag'd to proſecute. His Uncle and himſelf had done the King very conſiderable ſervices in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years together, and he was then making his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to his Majeſty for ſome Command in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation thereof. And the obſtructions and delays he met with in that affair contributed more to his after-happineſs, than the expedition could have done, as will appear anon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> had taken order that he ſhould not be ſeen in the ſtreet where ſhe liv'd, much leſs look up to her window to be ſeen by her, and it was punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obſerv'd by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was not known to have given her a meeting any where. But ſhe her ſelf was the firſt forgot what ſhe had enjoin'd; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd thus. During the time of the Carnaval, which, in <hi>Valentia,</hi> is celebrated with Maſcarades, Balls, Tiltings and Diſguizes, <hi>Alexander</hi> had in ſome of theſe met with his Miſtreſs, yet without diſcovery of more than ordinary kindneſs between them, though they had talk'd, and danc'd together. One evening, after the Ball, there was to be a meeting of certain Ladies, at the houſe of a Friend of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s, to which ſhe with ſome others had been
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58823:48"/>
invited. <hi>Alexander</hi> and ſome other friends of his were to be there, not in order to any Ball, but onely to diſcourſe. <hi>Iſabella</hi> came there betimes before any of the reſt, and ſoon after her a Woman, very ſumptuouſly attir'd, attended by two Gentlemen-Uſhers of her own retinue, whom her mother had ordered to wait on her to that Neighbour's houſe, who was very much her friend. <hi>Alexander</hi> coming into the Room, was very kindly receiv'd by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then preſent, whom he endeavour'd to entertain the moſt lovingly he could, till the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were come in. The Lady who came in laſt riſe from her ſeat to go and look upon a piece of Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that was in the room, wherein there were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented lighted Torches; the admiration ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd at the excellency of the workmanſhip, oblig'd <hi>Alexander</hi> to come alſo to ſee it. There was pen, ink and paper upon the Table; <hi>Laodamia</hi> (ſo was the Lady call'd) took the pen in her hand, and drew ſeveral ſtroaks upon the paper; <hi>Alexander</hi> took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to commend all ſhe did with ſuch high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, that his Miſtreſs, who was already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with a jealouſie, to ſee him ſo near her, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to burſt with indignation to hear them. He, minding onely his own diverſion in all he did, took no notice of it; nay on the contrary, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Laodamia,</hi> through her Brother's means, whom he often viſited, and a perſon of much freedom in his behaviour, he continu'd his game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome humour, and ſnatch'd out of her hand a pen ſhe was making to write withal. After which, having daſh'd a little ink upon her hand, he jeſtingly told her, that the blackneſs of the ink never appear'd leſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58823:49"/>
than it did then. She pretending to be diſpleas'd at that freedom, gave him a clap on the ſhoulder with her hand, to get off the ink; but perceiving he laugh'd at the revenge ſhe had taken, ſhe gave him another harder than the former. <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who minded their jeaſting more than what was ſaid to her by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs of the houſe, (with whom ſhe was then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing) ſtarts like a fury from her ſeat, and not conſidering what ſhe was doing, gave <hi>Alexander</hi> ſuch a blow over the face, that his noſe bled. The poor man was extremely ſtartled at it, and all he could do was to take a handkerchief out of his pocket, to receive the bloud; telling his Miſtreſs, very coldly, <q>Well, Madam, you ſee, I have kept the ſecret you committed to my truſt; you have firſt reveal'd it, and tranſgreſs'd the Law you had made your ſelf.</q> Concluding this reproach with a low Congy, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Room, and went home.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> had no ſooner given the blow, but ſhe was infinitely troubled at it, not ſo much out of the reſpect ſhe bore to the Miſtreſs of the houſe, who was her intimate friend, as for her, who had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd her jealouſie. In this Interval, her Siſters, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe accompt this meeting had been appointed, coming into the houſe, <hi>Iſabella</hi> had the opportunity to retire with her friends into another room.</p>
                        <p>Being got together, onely they two, <q>My deareſt <hi>Iſabella, ſays her friend to her,</hi> what do you think of? How are you grown another perſon than what I have ever known you? I have hitherto admir'd your modeſty and reſerv'dneſs; how you ſhould now be guilty of ſuch a miſcarriage in Behaviour, is the matter of my aſtoniſhment. The action you
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58823:49"/>
have done, aſſures me, without your ſpeaking, what, in many words, you ſhould hardly have perſuaded me to. I was ignorant of this Affection of yours, becauſe you ever kept it ſecret; and ſince I know it by this diſcovery, I am more oblig'd to your Jealouſie, than your Friendſhip. <hi>Alexander</hi> is a perſon of worth and quality; I am very glad he is your Servant. You may hence-forward publickly own him, for it is to no purpoſe to diſſemble.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> was at ſuch a loſs, that ſhe knew not what to anſwer: but having a little recover'd her ſelf, <q>I muſt acknowledge, my deareſt Acquaintance, <hi>repli'd ſhe,</hi> ſince this eruption of my jealouſie and indignation hath betrai'd me, that <hi>Alexander</hi> is my humble Servant; my inconſiderate paſſion, hath, to my ſhame, diſcover'd what I kept not onely from your knowledge, but that of all others. I muſt acknowledge, I ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ſerves me with a violent paſſion, which yet exceeds not the affection I have for him. I never ſaw him ſo indifferent, as he diſcover'd himſelf in this laſt action; his familiarity with <hi>Laodamia</hi> touch'd me to the quick. That ſhort fury, which we commonly call jealouſie, forc'd me to that extravagant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of my love. </q>
                           <q>Since what is paſt cannot be re-call'd, <hi>ſays her Friend to her,</hi> let us find out ſome remedy to alleviate the inconvenience, for it is not fit we ſhould be depriv'd of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s good company, nor he of the pleaſure of this meeting. Beſides, we ſhould not give <hi>Laodamia</hi> the time to make any reflection on this accident, or conceive apprehenſions which would be diſadvantageous to you. </q>

                           <q>The onely way I can think of, <hi>ſays her friend,</hi> is, immediately to write to him.</q> She follow'd her advice, and ſent him theſe Lines.</p>

                              <p>JEalouſies, when they are really the effects of Love, though expreſs'd with ſome harſhneſs, are rather to be accounted favours than affronts, by a Lover, whoſe ſoul exhales a ſincere paſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Miſtreſs. The injury I have done my ſelf in wounding my reſerv'dneſs, is greater than the violence you will do your ſelf in paſſing by what is now paſt. It much concerns my reputation, that you immediately return to the Meeting. But if you perſiſt in your reſentment, you will have further occaſion, if the loſs of my favour may give you any.</p>

                        <p>A Meſſenger was immediately ſent with this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who expreſs'd much gladneſs at the receipt of it, and, without any recollection, obey'd his Miſtreſs, as being ſatisfi'd in mind, that nothing diſcovers a real paſſion more than jealouſie. He comes very gaily into the room where the Ladies were, which <hi>Laodamia</hi> perceiving was not a little troubled, for ſhe doubted not of his being in love with <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> though ſhe thought ſo well of him as to wiſh he had rather addreſs'd his affections to her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander,</hi> finding himſelf in the preſence of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> thought it not fit to ſpeak to any other, ere
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58823:50"/>
he had firſt aſſur'd her of his compliance with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Approaching her with a graceful ſmile, he made her this complement. <q>I have conſider'd this room with as much reſpect as if it had been a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and your perſon no leſs, ſince it not onely kept me from profaning the one, and offering any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the other, but alſo from revenging my ſelf by that kind of Duel, which the Law permits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gallants and their Miſtreſſes. </q>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Iſabella re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd,</hi> Being ſo much, as I am, a Servant to Madam <hi>Laodamia,</hi> I have taken upon my account the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front you have done her, when ſhe would have ſhewn you a kindneſs, never thinking of any Law that permits a man to revenge himſelf of a Lady by way of Duelling.</q> 
                           <hi>Laodamia,</hi> knowing that that indiſcreet action of <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s proceeded meerly from her jealouſie, would not be engag'd in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, ſo that ſhe very confidently made anſwer thus. <q>There was never ſo great a familiarity between us, Madam, as might oblige you to take my part with ſo much paſſion, in an occaſion wherein I ſhould not have wanted confidence to revenge my ſelf: but not knowing any thing that ſhould oblige me to jealouſie, and thinking not the affront done to me ſo great as you would perſuade me it were, my precipitation was not accordingly ſo great as yours. I am very glad you make me the riddle of your interpretations; let them be thought ſuch by whom you pleaſe, but for my part, I have already given them a more eaſie ſolution, ſuch as none in the company can be ignorant of.</q> 
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mov'd at the freedom of that diſcourſe, would have repli'd; but the Miſtreſs of the houſe unwilling
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58823:51"/>
the difference ſhould go any further, interrupted them, and oblig'd them to ſit down, for ſeveral other Ladies were coming into the room.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> was, that night, not onely very ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous in his habiliments, but alſo full of excellent diſcourſes, inſomuch that there were few Ladies in the company, who were not much taken with him, among whom <hi>Laodamia</hi> was the moſt concern'd of any. Her thoughts were full of what had hapned between her and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and ſhew was now reſolv'd to uſe all the artifices ſhe could, to get away that Gallant from her: wherein at laſt ſhe had her deſire, as ſhall be ſeen anon.</p>
                        <p>All the favours which <hi>Alexander</hi> receiv'd of his Miſtreſs, were done by her with extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of affection, for indeed the Lady had a greater kindneſs for him than any other, though at that very time ſhe lov'd another abſent Gentleman, whom ſhe had granted more particular favours than ever ſhe had <hi>Alexander.</hi> For the Gallant then abſent had receiv'd of her by way kindneſs, what in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is called Benevolence, and conſequently had ſhe not been loſt to all modeſty, ſhe would have kept the promiſe ſhe had made him, ſince the breaking of that and her own Reputation were not diſtinct actions.</p>
                        <p>This Gallant of hers, whoſe name was <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Corella,</hi> had made a journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a Sute at Law againſt the Count of <hi>Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayna,</hi> his Uncle, for a conſiderable Eſtate in Lands, which at laſt was decided in the Sovereign Council of <hi>Arragon.</hi> He was return'd to <hi>Valentia,</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to put him into poſſeſſion of the ſaid Eſtate,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58823:51"/>
which amounted to two thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum. Iſabella</hi> was extremely put to her ſhifts, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ſhe ſhould keep in with both theſe Gallants, and ſatisfie them at the ſame time. She conſider'd that her Honour was engag'd with <hi>Don Fernand,</hi> and her Love with <hi>Alexander:</hi> her affection being ſo much the more heightned towards the latter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of his aſſiduous attendances, as it was remitted towards the former, by reaſon of his abſence. So that it is as much a miracle to ſee ſome Women for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their engagements, (when they to whom they are made are once out of ſight) and mind onely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyments, as to ſee Geeſe go barefoot.</p>
                        <p>But as drowning perſons will catch at any thing, and the diſtreſs'd are commonly glad of any advice. This Lady, whom we repreſented before one of the greateſt Wits of her Nation, reduc'd to this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, muſt needs adviſe with a Maid, whoſe fidelity and ſecrecie ſhe had great aſſurances of, reſolving in her ſelf to find out ſome expedient, whereby ſhe might make ſure of the one and not loſe the other. She receiv'd <hi>Don Fernand</hi> into the Houſe, in the night, thinking ſhe could not civilly deny him the reiteration of a kindneſs ſhe had once granted him; and ſhe kept the other in hand with Love-letters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him not to ſee her as often as he deſir'd, as well to add fuel to his love, as that the other, whom ſhe was more oblig'd to favour, might have the freer acceſs. Her excuſe to <hi>Alexander</hi> was, that ſhe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not over-ſeers, that her friends were very ſhie in point of Honour, that one of them watch'd her day and night, and that the greateſt pleaſure he could do her, was, to forbear paſſing through the ſtreet where
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58823:52"/>
ſhe liv'd, till ſhe had aſſur'd him that the coaſt were clear. <hi>Alexander</hi> who really lov'd her, and ſuſpected nothing of the impoſture, eaſily credited all ſhe ſaid, and punctually obey'd her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was willing to require the kindneſs he had receiv'd from her, by marrying her; but having a mother alive who would not have been well pleas'd with that marriage, he took occaſion to put it off, hoping it would not be long ere ſhe were remov'd out of the way, as being very ancient. So that he paſs'd away the time very jocundly with his Miſtreſs, while ſhe, by her cunning inſinuations and artifices, endeavour'd to bring <hi>Alexander</hi> into a fool's para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and make him believe all proceeded from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p>There hapned about this time a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Alexander</hi> and another Gentleman, of the moſt eminent about the City, whoſe name was <hi>Don Garceran,</hi> as they were playing at Tennis. Some Friends interpos'd between them, and 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd they were made friends; but the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prov'd ſuch as neither was ſatisfi'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> was a perſon of a generous open nature, grounding his gallantry on the emploiments he had had in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and imagining that no man, having any thing to ſay to him, would do it otherwiſe than by the ways of Honour. But his Adverſary, conceiving he had more reaſon to be offended than the other, who had not expreſs'd ſo much reſentment, ſmother'd his malice, in hopes of an opportunity, wherein he might revenge himſelf with advantage.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Fernand</hi> was gone to a certain place in the Country, where he ſtaid three or four days. <hi>Iſabella,</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:58823:52"/>
who had a great kindneſs for <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſent him word to come to her houſe in the night, but ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and with ſuch caution that none might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, inaſmuch as the freedom ſhe gave him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd her reputation in the higheſt degree. The Amorous Cavalier obey'd her in this, as he had done in many other things ſhe had commanded him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither at ſuch hours as it was not likely any ſhould ſee him. Thus, by his credulity he promoted the deſigns of the ſubtil woman, who would craftily make the moſt of both her Gallants, ſo that, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their being jealous of one another, nay, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were Rivals, ſhe gull'd them both. Had ſhe been free to make her own choice, no doubt, ſhe would have pitch'd upon <hi>Alexander</hi> for her Husband. But <hi>Fernand</hi> being aforehand with her, ſhe could do no leſs, though 'twere onely out of a fear to loſe him, and prevent the reproaches he might make her, than keep him ſtill in play, and expect the performance of the promiſe he had made to marry her, as ſoon as his Mother were march'd off. But out of an apprehenſion that even then he might poſſiblv break his word with her, ſhe thought it prudence, to give <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo a little more line. Upon theſe conſiderations, ſhe ſuffer'd her ſelf to be courted by both: but of this kind of demeanor this Age affords but too many examples, which have bred great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſturbances in the moſt conſiderable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> being now more kindly entertain'd by his Miſtreſs than he had been, began to conceive a hope to obtain of her, within a ſhort time, the Grand Favour can be expected from a Woman. But he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58823:53"/>
reckon'd without his Hoſteſs; for it was her fear, that, if ſhe oblig'd him in what he ſo much deſir'd, he might become abſolute Maſter of thoſe inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſhe had ſo dextrouſly divided between them both. However <hi>Alexander</hi> paſs'd away the time pleaſantly enough, during the abſence of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand;</hi> but as ſoon as he was return'd to <hi>Valentia, Iſabella</hi> began to put on a greater reſerv'dneſs, and would not be ſo much as ſeen by <hi>Alexander.</hi> She made him ſuch plauſible excuſes for it, that he, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her as he did, believ'd all ſhe ſaid, though not without ſome ſuſpicion, that there might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe in the wind: upon which account he often diſguis'd himſelf, that he might, undiſcover'd, viſit the ſtreet where ſhe liv'd in the night. But he never could meet with any perſon, of whom he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any jealouſie; yet that diſguiſe did him a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie; for by that means he eſcap'd being diſcover'd by the Cavalier who ſought to be reveng'd of him. That he met not with <hi>Fernand</hi> in that ſtreet, proceeded hence, that <hi>Iſabella,</hi> fore-ſeeing all inconveniences, had ordered, that <hi>Fernand</hi> ſhould come to her houſe, through that of a She-friend of hers, which was in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſtreet, and had a back-door, leading into a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den joining unto <hi>Iſabella's,</hi> in whoſe embraces he ſpent the whole night.</p>
                        <p>It hapned, one night, that <hi>Alexander</hi> being in the ſtreet where his Miſtreſs liv'd, his Adverſary, <hi>Don Garceran,</hi> attended by two of his ſervants, comes into it by another way. Being not well aſſur'd it was he, they follow'd him at a diſtance, being loath to do another that miſchief which they onely intended him. <hi>Alexander</hi> at laſt obſerv'd them, and finding
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58823:53"/>
himſelf unfurniſh'd with Piſtols, to deal with perſons who never went without them, as having onely his Sword to defend himſelf, he bethought him to make the ſignal he was wont at <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s door, who, as good luck would have it, was come down ſtairs, after ſhe had put <hi>Fernand</hi> into bed. She looks out at the window, to ſee what her ſecond Gallant would have, who, as ſoon as he perceiv'd her, deſir'd her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to open the door, otherwiſe he was a dead man, in regard <hi>Garceran,</hi> his enemy, follow'd him, and he was deſtitute of weapons to defend himſelf. The Lady imagin'd that <hi>Alexander</hi> would onely have put a trick upon her, and onely ſaid ſo, that he might come in the ſooner: but <hi>Alexander,</hi> with many oaths, affirm'd he ſaid nothing but the truth, and that <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceran,</hi> with two others, were coming upon him. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was extremely troubled at his diſcourſe, and for anſwer, told him, that a certain Gentlewoman of her acquaintance was come to ſee her, and to be her Bedfellow that night, and that ſhe durſt not open the door, leſt he might be ſeen by her. <hi>Alexander</hi> preſs'd her the more to do it, aggravating the danger he was in, and charging her that ſhe had little love for him, when ſhe deni'd him entrance into her houſe in ſo great an extremity, which the greateſt ſtranger in the world would not have deni'd him. <hi>Iſabella</hi> told him again, that ſhe could not do it without prejudice to her reputation; that as to the Love ſhe bore him, be needed not doubt of it, ſince it could not be greater than it was, and call'd Heaven to witneſs, that ſhe was extremely perplex'd, that ſhe could not ſatisfie his deſires. <hi>Alexander</hi> told her, that ſince her friend was in a room above-ſtairs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58823:54"/>
ſhe might without any ſcruple open the door, and let him ſtay below, till ſuch time as he might retire with ſafety.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſabella,</hi> ſeeing him ſo importunate, imagin'd it proceeded from ſome ſuſpition he had conceiv'd of her, and that he had ſeen <hi>Fernand</hi> coming into the Houſe. To be aſſur'd whether it were ſo or no, ſhe look'd into the Street, and ſaw the three Men who purſu'd him, and whiſpering one to another, as being in ſome uncertainty whether it were the Perſon they look'd for. Theſe circumſtances fully ſatisfy'd her, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was in very great danger; and to find ſome expedient to give him entrance, ſhe bid him expect a little and ſhe would ſee whether ſhe could open the door. She went up ſtairs to ſee <hi>Fernand,</hi> who, wondring at her ſtay, ask'd her what occaſion'd her going down. She told him her Aunt was not fallen aſleep, and that ſhe could not come to Bed, till ſhe were, deſiring him to have a little patience.</p>
                        <p>Having thus ſatisfy'd him, ſhe went into another room, to conſider with her ſelf what might be done in ſuch an extremity. On the one ſide, ſhe ſaw <hi>Fernand</hi> poſſeſs'd of her Bed, a perſon of a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick humour, yet one whom ſhe was engag'd to, and had made Maſter of the moſt precious thing ſhe had, and ſtill humour'd out of a hope to be one day his Wife; ſo that her Honour was on his part. On the other, the Love ſhe bore <hi>Alexander</hi> would have prevail'd with her, not to ſuffer him to be aſſaſſinated by his Enemies, which he muſt run the hazard of, if ſhe reliev'd him not, it being in her power to do it: So that ſhe was ſtrangely diſtracted, not knowing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58823:54"/>
whether ſhe ſhould follow the dictates of Honour, or thoſe of Love. At laſt, after divers conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that of Honour prevail'd with her, and oblig'd her not to receive <hi>Alexander</hi> into the houſe. For if ſhe did, ſhe reflected that her reputation would be endanger'd two ways; one, that it could not be done without <hi>Fernand</hi>'s hearing of it, who would thence take occaſion to break his promiſe; another, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> were purſu'd by his Enemy, and that he ſhould ſee him come into her houſe, he would be apt to make an ill conſtruction of it, and that might come to the ears of <hi>Fernand,</hi> even though he ſaw him not.</p>
                        <p>Having thus reſolv'd to ſtick to the ſurer ſide, ſhe went down ſtairs, and finding <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtill at the door, <q>My deareſt Love, ſaid ſhe to him, Heaven's my witneſs, how willing I am to ſatisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, by giving you entrance, not onely into my houſe, but even into my heart, which is abſolutely at your diſpoſal. I ſee you are purſu'd, as you told me, but it were too great an inconvenience to me, that you ſhould be ſeen coming into my houſe at ſuch an unſeaſonable hour, being a perſon yet ſo unblemiſh'd in my reputation as I am. I beſeech you conſider with your ſelf what diſcourſes it might occaſion. Beſides my Friend, who is my Bed-fellow this night, is awake, and, as Women are extreamly inquiſitive, ſhe will be deſirous to know the occaſion of my ſtay, and who hath kept me ſo long from her, for there is a very great familiarity between us. Pardon me therefore, that I cannot grant your deſire; it is the greateſt affliction ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to me, that I muſt leave you in ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58823:55"/>
but reflecting on that of my reputation, I know you would not have me to hazard it, ſince I doubt not but you are ſo generous, as to prefer my Honour before your own Life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This unworthy treatment of his Miſtreſs, in ſo preſſing an extremity, went to the very heart of <hi>Alexander,</hi> nay he was ſo ſtartled to find himſelf thus undeceiv'd, that it would not have troubled him much if <hi>Garceran</hi> had ſet upon him, that he might be reveng'd of the affront done him by <hi>Iſabella,</hi> by Dying before her Eyes. <q>I ſhould never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, <hi>ſaid he, parting from her,</hi> that you could have been ſo barbarous, as to put me off ſo poorly in ſo dangerous an exigency, or ſo inexorable, upon the entreaties of ſo faithful a Servant. You never had any real kindneſs for me; that reputation you ſtand ſo nicely upon, would have run no hazard, either as to your Friend, or my Enemy, by your receiving me as a Husband, upon which accompt only I made my addreſſes to you, upon which if you, ungrateful Woman, had entertain'd me, and not inſiſted on frivolous reſpects grounded on ſuch maxims as I cannot like, my heart had at this time been abſolutely at your diſpoſal. To make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly ſuch, hath been the main end of all my Courtſhips and Services, but Heaven would not permit it; and ſince I could find no compaſſion in your heart, I will go and try what I may expect from my Enemy, with a reſolution never to forget a procedure I am ſo much aſtoniſh'd at.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Iſabella</hi> would have made him ſome Anſwer, and, extreamly mov'd at his diſcourſe, was reſolv'd to hazard all, to aſſure him of her affection. But when
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58823:55"/>
ſhe went to call him, he was got a great way down the ſtreet, purſu'd by <hi>Garceran,</hi> who being aſſur'd he was the perſon he look'd for, was going to ſet upon him. His reſentment of her unkindneſs, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imminency of the danger, ſeem'd juſt to her, and being extreamly troubled thereat, after ſhe had blam'd her ſelf, ſhe quarrel'd at Heaven, which in the mean time ſecur'd her Lover from danger, and reſerv'd him for happier adventures. <hi>Garceran</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within Piſtol-ſhot of <hi>Alexander,</hi> perceiv'd that he had met with his Friend <hi>Don Jaymo,</hi> who, with his Servant, was going home to his Lodging, which prevented him from executing his deſign. For <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceran</hi> being, in appearance, and that before ſeveral perſons, reconcil'd with him, all would have blam'd him, had he aſſaulted him upon the old accompt, eſpecially at advantage, and with Fire-arms. So that ſeeing he had loſt ſuch a fair opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, he ſlipp'd aſide, to avoid being known, imagining he had not been diſcover'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> related the whole ſtory to his friend, and how he had been purſu'd thither; which he much wondred at, ſeeing <hi>Garceran</hi> ſo little minded the engagement he had made before ſo many perſons of quality, and that ſo ſlight a buſineſs ſhould ſtick ſo cloſe to his heart.</p>
                        <p>It was by this time very late, and as well for that reaſon, as to be ſatisfy'd of what he ſuſpected, <hi>Alexander</hi> being near <hi>Don Jaymo</hi>'s Lodging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to take part of it that night, which his friend was very glad of. They got in, and ere they lay down, they fell into diſcourſe about what had paſs'd. <hi>Alexander</hi> open'd himſelf to <hi>Don Jaymo,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58823:56"/>
him how things ſtood between him and <hi>Iſabella. Don Jaymo</hi> had heard ſomewhat of the mutual love there was between her and <hi>Fernand,</hi> and was vex'd to ſee his friend had ſo far miſ-plac'd his affections, and particularly at the reſolution he had made to Marry her; whereupon he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear telling him what he had heard of her and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> Which <hi>Alexander</hi> underſtanding, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſum'd, that the reaſon why ſhe opened not the door, muſt needs be, that her former Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant was with her. A thouſand paſſages came into his mind, but he particularly reflected on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, which the crafty Gentlewoman had made him, of ſpeaking to her in the night, and that it was onely ſince <hi>Fernand</hi>'s return from <hi>Madrid:</hi> Upon which communicating his thoughts to his friend, they joyntly concluded, that <hi>Fernand</hi> muſt needs be in the Houſe with her. To be fully aſſur'd of it, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Servant of <hi>Don Jaymo</hi>'s to examine the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and to continue in the Street, till it were Day: and for further certainty, another Servant was appointed to ſtand centry in the other Street, by which <hi>Fernand</hi> was wont to get in at a back-door. With this precaution, they went to Bed together; but <hi>Alexander</hi> was in ſuch a diſturbance, that he could not ſleep a wink. About half an hour before Day, one of the Servants brought intelligence, that he had ſeen <hi>Don Fernand</hi> going out of the Houſe belonging to <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s Friend, and that about the ſame time, he had ſeen <hi>Iſabella</hi> in one of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows that look'd into that Street, looking on him as he went out, and that he was ſure it was no other than ſhe her ſelf. This accompt ſatisfy'd <hi>Alexander</hi>
                           <pb n="103" facs="tcp:58823:56"/>
ſo fully, that all the Love he formerly bore that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Woman, immediately vaniſhed. 'Twas not imaginable, that <hi>Fernand</hi> frequented that Houſe, upon the accompt of the Miſtreſs of it, who being turn'd of fifty, could not be courted by any Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. Beſides, ſhe had the reputation of being a very charitable perſon in Love-affairs, and was wont to promote the enjoyments of younger people, and to give excellent directions how they might moſt cautiouſly accompliſh their deſires.</p>
                        <p>The night following, <hi>Alexander</hi> would himſelf, from the Houſe of a certain friend of his, ſee <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> getting into the Sanctuary of that charitable Sollicitreſs, and for his further aſſurance, he lay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due upon the Roof, whence he diſcover'd, that that favour'd Gallant continu'd there, till word was brought him that he might make his entrance into <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s. That very night, the diſſembling Goſſip, would needs endeavour to ſatisfie her Lover, as to the diſſatisfaction he might juſtly have conceiv'd of her. To leave nothing unattempted, and to keep in as near as might be with all, ſhe ſent <hi>Alexander</hi> a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by a Servant-maid, in whom ſhe repoſed great truſt, and who was not a ſtranger to the Loves of both the Gallants, and promoted the deſign of her Miſtreſs in abuſing them, for the advantage ſhe reaped thereby. Hearing ſhe ſtaid to ſpeak with him, he call'd her up, and receiv'd from her a Paper containing theſe words.</p>

That I have not been ſo compaſſionate as the exigency requir'd, be pleas'd to attribute to the tenderneſs I had for my own Honour, the conſideration whereof made me inexorable. I love you beyond my own Life; but one of my Birth and Sex may be pardon'd, if ſhe ſacrifice all things to the ſecurity of her Reputation, rather than expoſe her ſelf to the cenſures of ill Tongues. You may well imagine, when I deny'd you entrance into my Houſe, that my good Name must run a ſtrange hazard with that troubleſome Bed-fellow, whom, to my unhappineſs, I was then forc'd to entertain. Notwithstanding the reſentment wherewith you left me, you could not but obſerve the distraction I was in: whence you may infer, how thankfully I have ſince acknowledg'd the indulgence of thoſe higher powers, who reſcu'd you out of a danger, which I thought unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. You could not have lost your Life in that adventure, but mine must have run the ſame hazard, and I do not know any thing but Honour,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58823:57"/>
which I ſhould prefer before two things I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt ſo pretious. Let me therefore conjure you, to ſmother your reſentment of it, and to appeaſe your indignation: which if I may obtain of you, I ſhall think all the devoirs your Love may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire little enough to requite it. Your compliance with my deſires herein will inform me what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs you have for her ſatisfaction and Life, who prays Heaven to preſerve yours, as ſhe wiſhes it may her's, who loves you with all her ſoul.</hi>

                                 <hi>YOur ſatisfactions, hitherto, have ever heightned my Love, but this last hath wrought in me a quite contrary effect, for I know it to be as far from truth, as I am from diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I never thought my ſelf a perſon to be entertain'd onely to paſs away the tedious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of another Man's abſence, nor to act the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58823:58"/>
part you have put me upon, onely to come upon the Stage, between the ſeveral Acts of your ſecret prostitutions. If it be any ſatisfaction to you, know, I have diſengag'd all reſentments of your Hypocriſie, and ſhall never complain of the frivolous Eluſions, wherein you ſuffered my Love to Languiſh; no, I am more oblig'd to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, than ever I ſhould have been to your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. My Life indeed would have been ſecur'd, if you had receiv'd me into your Houſe; but my Honour would have been irrecoverably lost, if, without my diſcovery of it, you could have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd your Charity on two ſeveral perſons, the ſame night. 'Tis very probable you lov'd me beyond your own Life, when, being ſo cloſely engag'd to another, you thought me the fitteſt Perſon in the World to make your Diverſion. I am really ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to thoſe who intended to be my Murtherers, ſince by their means I came to diſcover your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture. Make ſure of that fortunate Gallant, whom your charitable Neighbour was uſhering to your Bed, while I was knocking at your Door. Make ſure of him, perfidious Woman, and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, keep all your Cares and all your Careſſes onely for him.

It was not long ere this Letter came to the hands of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> whom the Maid found in that Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Houſe of hers, through which <hi>Fernand</hi> had acceſs to her. She receiv'd it with ſome diſturbance, and asking the Maid, what humour ſhe found him in, ſhe told her, that he had made her a very cold Reception, and that he expreſs'd nothing of the Kindneſſes he was wont to do, at other times. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> a little caſt down at that diſcourſe, It ſeems then, ſaid ſhe, I am not to promiſe my ſelf any great ſatisfaction from this Letter. Having open'd and read it, ſhe was like one put into a fright, not able to ſpeak. Her Friend ask'd her what it contain'd? ſhe thinking it too great a burthen, to acquaint her by word of Mouth, gave her the Letter to peruſe. The old Croney, no leſs diſturb than the young Miſtreſs, found, that <hi>Fernand</hi>'s love was diſcover'd, to the great diſadvantage of her Reputation, in as much as it clearly expreſs'd, that it was through her Houſe, <hi>Fernand</hi> made his approaches to her Friend, whereat ſhe was extreamly afflicted. <hi>Iſabella</hi> was ſo troubled at the contents of that Letter, that ſhe curs'd the day and hour ſhe had ſuffered <hi>Alexander</hi> to court her: The onely comfort ſhe could raiſe to her ſelf, was, that ſhe knew him to be of ſo generous a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that, though he had a juſt occaſion to be incens'd againſt her, yet would he conceal her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not publiſh the correſpondence there had been between them. This kind of generoſity might haply be a little practis'd in the Golden Age, for the people living in this, have ſo far forgot the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they aggravate Truths deplorable enough, with affected Lies and Calumnies, for which we muſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58823:59"/>
ever acknowledge our ſelves oblig'd to the ruling Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts of the Times.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Iſabella</hi>'s unhappineſs was not yet come to its height, and the malice of her ill fortune thought not this affliction heavy enough. When the wheel of that vagabond-Goddeſs begins to turn, every ſpoke of it brings a new misfortune, one diſgrace coming ſtill in the neck of another. It happen'd then, that as the Maid was coming out of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s lodgings, to bring the Letter to her Miſtreſs, <hi>Fernand</hi> ſaw her with it in her hand, ſhe having been careleſs to hide it, becauſe ſhe was dis-ſatisfi'd with <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had onely that time omitted to make her ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Fernand</hi> immediately began to ſuſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, and, undiſcover'd, follow'd her to the houſe where <hi>Iſabella</hi> was, and got into one of the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms, without any bodie's taking notice of it. The Maid, by a ſecond overſight, having left the door open, he eaſily ſaw what paſs'd, he heard the Letter read from one end to the other, and withall, their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſcourſes and comments upon it; the afflicted Lady burſting forth into indignation at every word, and not imagining ſhe was over-heard, ſhe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſs'd her reſentment of ſo preſſing a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
                        <p>The Gentleman in the next room, who would have been glad of any occaſion to break the promiſe he had made to marry her (for a Lover once admitted to enjoyment hath other-guiſe thoughts than he who is ſtill kept in hope) hearing all theſe things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them a very fair pretence to diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He therefore goes very confidently into the room where they were, and addreſſing himſelf to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58823:59"/>
                           <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who was moſt ſtartled at his preſence, <q>I expected, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> conſidering the mutual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations between us, that you would have corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded thereto, with a ſincerity ſutable to my deſires, which aim'd onely at this, to ſee us one day made one by marriage, and to enjoy thoſe pleaſures lawfully, and without any ſting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, which we have, upon hopes of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that ſacred Tie, preſum'd to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate. But ſince, ungrateful creature, I find you loſt to all modeſty, and have entertain'd new Gallants, I am free, to diſpoſe of my ſelf as I ſhall think moſt convenient: ſince it were neither juſt, nor rational, I ſhould be inſeparably bound to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deſtitute of all conduct and honour, and ſo live the reſt of my days in perpetual jealouſies and diſtruſts.</q>Having ſo ſaid, he left the room, a little troubled at the diſtraction of the Women, but well ſatisfi'd in his own thoughts, that he had drawn his neck out of the collar, that is, ſhifted himſelf out of an affair, which bred him a great deal of trouble, ſince his proſecution of it to that point had been with the diſ-approbation of his Mother.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not to be imagin'd, that the conſtancy of any Woman, ſhould be able to endure ſo great a ſhock of misfortune. <hi>Iſabella</hi> fell into a ſwound between the arms of her Friend, and continu'd in it a long time; but at laſt being come to her ſelf again, ſhe ſpoke ſuch things as rais'd a great compaſſion in her who heard them. She ſought for remedies to her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and not finding any ſtrong enough to re-engage <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was acquainted with her former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, nor yet to bring back <hi>Fernand,</hi> whom ſhe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58823:60"/>
knew ſhe had offended, ſhe was not able to ſmother the grief ſhe conceiv'd to find her ſelf ſo juſtly ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both. She imputed all her misfortune to her own mis-government of her ſelf. Whereupon ſhe fell a tearing of her hair, and ſpoke what-ever rage could inſpire into a Woman exaſperated in the higheſt degree.</p>
                        <p>She paſs'd away the reſt of the afternoon in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual diſquiet, not finding any comfort in either her friend's diſcourſes, or her own. In the evening, ſhe went to her own houſe, but her diſtractions went along with her, ſo that it is not to be imagin'd but the night prov'd as reſtleſs, as the day had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. Let us a while leave her in her bed, now the ſecret Remembrancer of her former miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, in the midſt of her troubles and tranſportations, and give an account what became of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As ſoon as he had diſpatch'd away the Maid with his Letter to <hi>Iſabella,</hi> he ſate down a while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelf what courſe he ſhould take, for he ſaw there was nothing to be expected there, and that it was not for his reputation, to continue his viſits any longer. He had always had a great inclination for the fair <hi>Laodamia,</hi> ever ſince ſhe had occaſion'd <hi>Iſabella</hi> to break forth into that extravagant diſcovery of her jealouſie; He conſider'd ſhe was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman well deſcended, and of a great fortune; and thereupon he reſolv'd to make his addreſſes publickly to her, by demanding her in marriage of her Father and Brother, which they, upon the firſt motion, very willingly granted, even with great demonſtrations of gladneſs, inaſmuch as <hi>Alexander</hi> was a perſon ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally belov'd in his Country, as being endu'd with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58823:60"/>
thoſe qualities, which deſerv'd the reſpects and eſteem of all. The Contract of Marriage was ſoon drawn up, and the buſineſs immediately ſpread over the whole City of <hi>Valentia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But when this news came to the ears of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> imagine whether ſhe were not extremely troubled thereat, nay ſo much the more, in that he pitch'd on the perſon, whom of all the world ſhe had moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hate, ever ſince that fatal meeting, wherein ſhe had expreſs'd ſo much indiſcretion. She ſaid a thouſand things againſt her, and made many impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt him and her ſelf, charging Heaven with injuſtice, and ſometimes bemoaning her ſelf, and ſometimes curſing her misfortune. But it was not onely one ſhe had to curſe; for the very ſame day it was ſeconded by another, yet greater, inaſmuch as <hi>Fernand,</hi> having had a plauſible occaſion to break the promiſe he had made to her, treated about a marriage, with another fair and rich young Lady, whom his mother had long before recommended to him. The Contract was in a few days drawn up, and though done as ſecretly as could be, yet was it ſoon known all over the City, and it was not long ere the news came to the ears of <hi>Iſabella.</hi> She ſtill retain'd a ſlender ſhadow of confidence in the love of <hi>Fernand,</hi> which made her imagine he would not break the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he had made to her, conceiving ſhe had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently oblig'd him thereto by the higheſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of love and tenderneſs. Thus ſhe flatter'd her ſelf, till the very day that ſhe was clearly convinc'd of the contrary, ſaw his marriage concluded, and her ſelf abſolutely forſaken. But reflecting on the other ſide, what an unworthy breach of truſt ſhe was guilty
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58823:61"/>
of, towards him, to whom ſhe had devoted her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, how could ſhe imagine he ſhould not leave her in the lerch? How could ſhe expect, if they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, he ſhould be able to live with her in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſturbances and alarms? The very day that certain news was brought her of this Gentleman's being married, ſhe fell into ſuch extravagance, that ſhe would be reveng'd of her beautiful face; ſhe gave her ſelf ſeveral blows, tore her hair, and did all the actions, which could onely proceed from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſpair. Her fair eyes became two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, perpetually running; and when her ſighes and grief gave her a little freedom of ſpeech, <q>Wretched woman that I am, <hi>would ſhe ſay,</hi> of whom all good fortune hath taken its laſt leave; how deſerv'dly is thy ingratitude requited with ingratitude? How juſtly art thou puniſh'd, for having kept thy faith to a baſe, treacherous, and perfidious perſon, after thou hadſt entruſted him with the diſpoſal of the deareſt thing thou hadſt in the world? Thou ſee'ſt, he denies the debt; thou ſee'ſt, he paies it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and oblivion. Let all eaſie-natur'd, and inconſiderate women take example by me; let thoſe, who, deluded by flatteries and feigned ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, are drawn in to loſe what they ſhall never recover again, caſt their eyes on my miſery, and then conſider whether there be any other in the world, whoſe affliction may be compar'd to mine. I wiſh for what all others abhor, Death; but it is deaf and inexorable, nay ſlights me, and will not come and put a period to my troubles.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having thus bemoan'd her ſelf into ſome remiſſion of her grief, ſhe went to ſee her Friend, through
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58823:61"/>
whoſe houſe <hi>Fernand</hi> came into hers; who though ſhe endeavour'd all that lay in her power to comfort her, yet was her trouble ſo great, the cauſe of it ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſo little hope of any remedy, that all her remonſtrances prevail'd nothing. The onely expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that ſeem'd then to offer it ſelf, was, to forbid the Banes, ſince there was ſome ground to do it. But what proof could be made of ſo ſecret a Love, without any promiſe of marriage in writing, or any teſtimony, but that of a Servant-maid, who, belonging to her, would not have been ſo eaſily credited? A fair warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-piece, Ladies, for thoſe, who, at the ſame time, admit the Courtſhips of ſeveral Gallants, without making any reflection on their Honours, the loſs whereof they are not ſenſible of, till, by their ſubtil cajollings, they are brought to remedileſs extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The laſt and ſureſt expedient this unfortunate Woman could pitch upon, was to become a Nun, upon which account ſhe was receiv'd into the Royal Monaſtery of <hi>Zaida,</hi> three days after the Marriage of <hi>Fernand</hi> had been fully concluded.</p>
                        <p>This ſudden change occaſion'd a great deal of noiſe and diſcourſe in <hi>Valentia;</hi> all wondred at it, eſpecially thoſe who knew her to be one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt, and the moſt deſirous to be courted, of any Lady in <hi>Valentia.</hi> It was indeed a kind of miracle, to ſee a young Lady, who ſpent her time ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately at Balls, Plays, and other publick meetings, exchange all thoſe nobler enjoyments of life, for the imaginary felicity of mortification and retir'dneſs. This ſudden reſolution was attributed, at firſt, not to the true cauſe thereof, for things were carried ſo cloſely that very few knew it: but to the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58823:62"/>
of that wind, which bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and is pleas'd to amuſe mankind with the ſtrange ways it takes, to tranſplant the affections of ſuch as are ordain'd to eternal bliſs, from the tranſient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this world, to the conſtant purſuance of the perpetual joys of a better. Thus this Lady met with a kinder Spouſe than ſhe could have expected elſe-where, and ſpent the reſt of her time with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bleſſing her former afflictions, and the croſſes of her love, which had brought her to the tranquillity ſhe now enjoy'd. When ſhe ſeriouſly reflected on the gracious deſigns of divine Love upon her, ſhe thought it an act of gratitude, to acknowledge, to ſome friends, how it had made her miſcarriages the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its indulgence, and, inſtead of puniſhing, had rewarded her weakneſs; nay ſuch was her deſire to give God the glory of her converſion, that ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed this expreſſion, That in that Houſe, wherein there are many manſions, ſhe hop'd there was one for ſuch penitent <hi>Magdalens</hi> as ſhe, who, by timely repentance, expiate the follies of their greener years. Nor was this acknowledgment of hers unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded even in this life; for ſhe became the Oracle and ſpiritual Directreſs of all thoſe, whoſe Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misfortunes reduc'd them to any extremity, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe of her own ſex, of whom ſhe ſo effectually convinc'd many, that, diſguſting the world, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd a Religious life. After ſome years ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to the Government of the Monaſtery, after ſhe had put forth ſeveral little Tracts of Devotion, whereof one was in Verſe, entituled, <hi>A Basket of Spiritual Flowers,</hi> or a <hi>Collection of Divine Poems.</hi> Theſe ſpread her fame into divers parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58823:62"/>
at <hi>Valentia,</hi> the ſanctity of her life, and her charitable directions to ſuch as had occaſion to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her, were the admiration of all, inſomuch that ſhe was reputed a Saint, even while ſhe liv'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fernand</hi> had a wife, but God was pleas'd to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his perfidiouſneſs with her barrenneſs, for ſhe bore him no children; and inſtead of the great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes he expected with her, he had many bags, full of Law-ſutes, troubles, and differences with other people, and not a few diſcontents with his wife. He wiſh'd, but too late, that he had rather entred into a Monaſtery, than into Matrimony, the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences whereof ſufficiently convinc'd him, that <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> had made the better choice. He viſited her often, and was oblig'd to her for her prudent and pious admonitions. Nay to ſatisfie the world, that ſhe had left behind her in it all her reſentments of his demeanor towards her, there are in a volume of <hi>Spiritual Letters</hi> which ſhe put forth, ſeveral Letters ſhe had written to him, upon occaſion of ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he had propos'd to her.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, <hi>Alexander</hi> was the happieſt man in the world in his diſpoſal of himſelf; his <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia</hi> brought him many fine children, and, by the death of ſome friends, a far greater fortune than he could have expected. They alſo viſited their old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance <hi>Iſabella,</hi> who received them kindly, and gave them occaſion to admire the ſtrange attractions of Divine Love in that perſon, and the eſteem they had before for the excellency of her endowments, was now converted into a reverence of her ſanctity, and an admiration of her conduct.</p>

THis pleaſant Novel entertain'd the Company till they came to their Inn that night. Every one took occaſion to commend Doctor <hi>Monſalvo,</hi> as well for the ſmartneſs of his Invention, as for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Stile. The old Gentleman told him, that if the whole Piece were anſwerable to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern he had ſhewn them of it, no doubt but his Novels would be very well receiv'd in the World, and that he would gain as much Reputation by them, as they had had Pleaſure: and thereupon he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated him to communicate ſomewhat of the others to them, that ſo their Travelling might be the leſs tedious. The Doctor gave him and all the reſt of the Company his very hearty thanks for the good opinion they had of him, and proffer'd them, when they ſhould be weary of diſcourſing, to divert them with ſome of the other Novels, till they came to their Journey's end, provided they thought them not tedious. They all, with much gladneſs and thanks accepted of his proffer.</p>
            <p>Being come within a Musket-ſhot of the antient City of <hi>Corduba,</hi> heretofore the chiefeſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, while the Moors were poſſeſs'd of all <hi>Spain,</hi> after Sun-ſet, an unexpected accident caus'd them to make a little halt. Two Gentlemen being come out into the Fields, upon a challenge, which one had ſent to the other, and having fought, one of them was worſted, being run through the Body in two ſeveral places; which had oblig'd his adverſary to make his eſcape, to get into ſome place of ſanctuary. The wounded perſon cry'd out for ſome body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Confeſſion, juſt as the Coach paſs'd by: which being heard by the Company, Doctor <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvo,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:58823:63"/>
who was a Prieſt and Confeſſor, could do no leſs than get out, accompany'd by <hi>Garay,</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs <hi>Rufina,</hi> who had a great deſire to ſee the Wounded man. They came to him, and as ſoon as the Doctor had receiv'd his Confeſſion, and given him Abſolution, he loſt his Speech, being ſupported by <hi>Garay.</hi> The Doctor return'd to the Coach, and having called ſeveral times upon <hi>Rufina,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhe could not get away <hi>Garay,</hi> the Coach-man perceiving it began to grow dark, put on the Horſes, having ſent them word what Inn they ſhould take up. <hi>Rufina</hi> was much troubled to ſee the Coach gone, having left her and <hi>Garay</hi> behind, charitably exhorting the Dying perſon to recommend himſelf as much as he could to the mercy of God; but he was ſo far gone, that, to ſpare them further Exhortation, he gave up the Ghoſt. They were much troubled what they ſhould do with the Body, when certain Officers of Juſtice came in, who, having at a diſtance ſeen the Dead perſon in the Arms of <hi>Garay,</hi> and a Woman ſtanding by, and had notice before that two Men were ſeen going out of the City, with a deſign to fight a Duel, preſently imagin'd, that <hi>Garay</hi> was one of them, and conſequently the Murtherer of the other; upon which preſumption, he was ſent to Priſon, and order given the Jaylor to put him faſt enough. <hi>Rufina</hi> had more favour, being confin'd in the Houſe of one of the Officers, who was to have a care to her forth-coming. They both us'd all the arguments they could to clear themſelves, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing to do with the Murther, alledging upon what occaſion they came to the Body. But their own words would not be taken, and it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58823:64"/>
the Duel had been upon the accompt of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi> The Judge order'd her to be brought to his own Houſe to be further examin'd, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done. When ſhe came thither, there were in the Room ſeveral Gentlemen, and among others a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> a very rich Merchant, whom ſome buſineſs of his own had brought thither. They had no ſooner ſeen <hi>Rufina,</hi> but they all admir'd her Beauty and the Majeſty of her Air, but the moſt ſatisfy'd of any was the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who, to give him his due, was of a very amorous conſtitution. <hi>Rufina</hi> was extreamly troubled that ſuch an affront ſhould be done her by the way, as perceiving that if they were ſtaid the next day, they ſhould loſe the opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their journey. The Judge put ſeveral Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to her, concerning the Duel, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Death; whereto ſhe anſwered, that ſhe knew nothing of it, that ſhe was coming in the <hi>Sevil-</hi>Coach, to go for <hi>Madrid,</hi> accompany'd by ſome other Perſons then in the Inn, whom ſhe named; That as the Coach paſs'd by, a certain Perſon, who had been Wounded upon the High-way, not far from them, call'd out for ſome body to receive his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and that a Prieſt who was with them in the Coach, went out to do it, with whom alſo ſhe went out of curioſity, accompany'd by an Uncle of hers, who came along with her. They ordered, in regard it was grown late, to adjourn the buſineſs till the next day, that a more exact enquiry might be made into it, and, in the mean time, that all who came along with the Coach, ſhould not ſtir from <hi>Corduba,</hi> without permiſſion. This done, <hi>Rufina</hi> was brought back to the Officer's Houſe, where ſhe was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58823:64"/>
that night. The <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> who liv'd not far from it, accompany'd her; but though he had liv'd at a far greater diſtance, he would have thought it no great way to wait on a Lady, with whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready over head and ears in Love. Taking leave of her at the Officer's houſe, he proffer'd her all the Services lay in his power, for which ſhe thanked him, yet taking it for no more than a Complement. The Vexation ſhe conceiv'd at her being thus unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſtaid, brought her into ſome fits of a Feaver, the firſt, of a Tertian, which ſhe afterwards fell into.</p>
            <p>The next day, all the perſons, who came in the Coach, being examin'd, gave the ſame account as <hi>Rufina</hi> had done before, whereupon <hi>Garay</hi> was ſet at Liberty. Other witneſſes alſo who knew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what concerning the Duel, were heard, and gave the Judges a perfect knowledge of the Murther. <hi>Garay</hi> went immediately to viſit <hi>Rufina,</hi> expreſſing himſelf extreamly troubled at her indiſpoſition; he did all he could to cheer her up, that they might proſecure their Journey: but the Phyſitian, who had viſited her, advis'd her not to remove thence, till ſhe had recover'd her Feaver, and told her, that ſhe could not travel any further, without hazard of her Life; which being ſo, the Coach-man was forc'd to leave them behind, but they were adjudg'd to defray the charges of their ſtay, and he to deliver up what they had in the Coach. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> came often to ſee the fair Traveller, at the Officer's houſe, and began to treat her very nobly, an humour the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in him, who, for ſordid niggardlineſs might be compared to the covetous <hi>Marquina;</hi> but Love,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58823:65"/>

               </gap>rdice into Courage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> kept her Bed fifteen days, during which time, ſhe was conſtantly viſited by Signor <hi>Octavio,</hi> (ſo was called the amorous <hi>Genoeſe)</hi> and after the Viſit, came in a Servant with a treat of Sweet-meats, and Wild-fowl, which the Officer and his Wife were glad to ſee, for the beſt ſhare fell to them. At laſt, the Lady, with her Health, recover'd alſo her good Complexion, and her Beauty, and the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his civilities, proffer'd her a Houſe with a fair Garden, which he had on the ſide of the pleaſant River <hi>Quadalguemir. Garay,</hi> whom ſhe called her Uncle, advis'd her not to refuſe that proffer, for he had diſcover'd the Man to be extreamly in Love with her, that he was very Rich, and that they might get as much out of the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> as they had out of the covetous <hi>Marquina. Rufina</hi> accepted the proffer, and ſet things in order to go to the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>'s, and to continue there till ſhe had recover'd her ſelf ſo well, as that ſhe might proſecute her Journey. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> would not have it known at <hi>Corduba,</hi> that he had brought her to his Country-houſe, to prevent peoples talk, and other inconveniences that might have enſu'd. So that, with the conſent of <hi>Rufina,</hi> he gave out, that ſhe had left the City in order to the proſecution of her Voyage. Accordingly, there were two Mules brought for her and <hi>Garay,</hi> and two others to carry their Luggage, and having left <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi> towards the Evening, to blind the eyes of the inquiſitive, they kept on their way towards <hi>Madrid:</hi> but having Rid out about half a League, they turn'd
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58823:65"/>
back again, and took up their quarters at Signor <hi>Octavio</hi>'s, which was not above two flight ſhots from the City. There he expected her, with a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Supper, which he had provided. Here the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> diſcover'd his Love to her more freely than he had done before. He was a perſon of about forty years of Age, of a good Manly countenance, having buried his Wife ſome two years before, by whom he had had no Children. He was a whole-ſale Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and traded in all ſorts of Commodities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that all the other Merchants, not onely of the City, but alſo of other places thereabouts came to him, for he held correſpondences in all parts. He was a very thrifty perſon, nay, to give him his due character, I ſhould uſe other expreſſions. He had ſome yearly Revenue, beſides twenty thouſand Crowns in ready Money, and ſixty thouſand in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and his own Trading, which was very great. He was a great Student, and had ſtudied at <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> before he became Heir to his Brother, who Dy'd a very Rich man in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Inheritance it was, that occaſion'd his Marriage at <hi>Corduba.</hi> He had ſo paſſionate an affection for <hi>Rufina,</hi> that he uſed all the ways he could imagine to inſinuate himſelf into her favour. Upon that accompt it was that he proffer'd her the uſe of his Country-houſe, to take the Air, and recover her Indiſpoſition, conceiving, that, being at his own Houſe, it would be the more eaſie for him to compaſs his deſires. She had been told by <hi>Garay,</hi> that this Merchant was a well-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Fowl, and might be eaſily pluck'd, and ſince this good Luck had fallen to them by chance, they ſhould make the beſt advantage they could of it.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58823:66"/>
That night, they onely Supp'd, and every one went to his reſt, for it was very late. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> made as if he would have returned to the City, and lye there; but his Servants, whom he had before inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, perſuaded him not to go abroad at that unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time of the Night, for fear of meeting with any Thieves: beſides, there being a Preſs in the City, many young Men preſum'd to do miſchief in the Night, and robbed all they met. At laſt, being perſuaded not to ſtir out, he was glad to paſs away ſome part of the Night in diſcourſing with <hi>Rufina,</hi> and being got to Bed, his buſineſs was to conſider, by what means, and with leaſt charge, he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his deſires of her. Several things came into his mind, but the eaſieſt he could find, ſuitably to his humour, was to forget her, and never think of her any more; for he knew the Age we live in to be ſuch, that it is a miracle to get any kindneſs in Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Liberality.</p>
            <p>The next morning he commanded ſomewhat ſhould be made for her break-faſt, not imagining ſhe was up: But when word was brought him that ſhe was out of Bed, the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> would needs go into her Chamber, to chide her for riſing ſo ſoon, and by that means to ſee whether <hi>Rufina</hi>'s beauty were any way oblig'd to artifice. He found her kembing her head, and ſo he had a full ſight of her hair, which was of a great length, and of a Cheſtnut colour. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> gave God thanks, who, with ſo many other perfections, had beſtow'd on her ſuch an excellent Head of hair: but he was much more aſtoniſh'd, when, upon her dividing them into two parts, to make him an anſwer, he ſaw her Face, as beautiful as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58823:66"/>
it had appear'd to him when ſhe went to bed; a thing able to enflame a perſon leſs enclin'd to Love and more to Avarice than he was, inaſmuch as there is not a greater charm, to ſecure a Lover's heart, than to ſee that the beauty of his Miſtreſs is natural, and ſcorns to borrow any thing of Art. <hi>Rufina</hi> indeed was not much troubled to look after waters, paints, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matums, unguents, and ſuch things, wherewith ſuch women, who ſtand in need of them, haſten on their age with their wrinkles, and loſe their youth ere they are aware. She onely waſh'd her ſelf in fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and needed no other vermilion to heighten the beauty of her face, than that of her own lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. The Merchant ask'd whether ſhe would be pleas'd to ſee his Garden? She made anſwer, that ſhe was extremely oblig'd to him for the trouble he gave himſelf to divert her; and to ſatisſie him how kindly ſhe took that favour at his hands, ſhe went along with him juſt as ſhe was, without putting up her hair, which hanging down over her ſhoulders, added much to her beauty, and it is not much to be doubted, but ſhe had a deſign in it. She went down with this new Gallant of hers, who thought it an extraordinary pleaſure to have her by the hand; and in that poſture ſhe ſaw the whole Garden, ſeeming to be much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the delightfulneſs of it.</p>
            <p>Having recreated her ſelf with him, till the Sun Sun began to be ſomewhat hot, ſhe return'd into the houſe, and broke her faſt, after which, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of ſeveral things, ſhe deſir'd to ſee the whole houſe. The amorous <hi>Genoeſe</hi> deſiring nothing ſo much as that ſhe might ſee his wealth, ſhews her a great number of excellent Pictures, done by the beſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58823:67"/>
Painters in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſome very rich pieces of Tapeſtry, Cabinets of Ebony, of ſeveral faſhions, embroider'd Beds, and all ſorts of Houſhold-ſtuff of great value. In a word, there wanted not ought of thoſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the furniſhing of a houſe fit for a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Having ſeen all the rooms, he open'd a curious Cloſet, near which there was a little Oratory, and in that Cloſet there were a great many pieces of Painting, done at <hi>Rome,</hi> of extraordinary value, <hi>Agnus-Dei</hi>'s of gold and ſilver gilt, and Flowers, done as near the life as could be imagin'd. The Cloſet was full of Books, very richly bound, and neatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd into gilt Drawers. <hi>Garay,</hi> who was a curious perſon, and had read much, was looking very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the Titles of the Books, which were in one Drawer, and having put that into its place, he took out another, wherein there were others very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bound, but had no Titles on the backs. <hi>Garay</hi> opens one of them, and finds the Author of it to be <hi>Arnaldus de Villa Nova,</hi> and near that were the works of <hi>Roſino, Alquindus,</hi> and <hi>Raymundus Lulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The Merchant perceiving him ſo taken up with the peruſal of thoſe Books, ask'd him what he look'd on ſo attentively. <q>I find here, Sir, <hi>replies Garay,</hi> a great many Books of Chymiſtry, and, from the curioſity I obſerve in your collection of Treatiſes of that kind, I infer, that you have ſtudied that Science. </q>
               <q>'Tis true, <hi>ſays the Genoeſe,</hi> I have ſpent ſome time in the peruſal of thoſe Authors; but how far, I pray, are you acquainted with them? </q>
               <q>Onely ſo far, <hi>replies the other,</hi> that I have ſpent the beſt part of my life in that ſtudy. </q>
               <q>Nay then, <hi>ſays the Genoeſe,</hi> you muſt needs be a very great Chymiſt.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:58823:67"/>
I am not to acknowledge what I am, <hi>replies Garay,</hi> we ſhall talk another time of theſe things more at large; for the preſent, I ſhall onely tell you, that, beſides theſe Authors, I have read all I could ever meet with that treated of this Science. I have turn'd over the works of <hi>Avicenna, Albertus Magnus, Terno, Pythagoras;</hi> the Secrets of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidus,</hi> the Book of the <hi>Allegory of Morillus,</hi> that of the <hi>Secret Stone,</hi> and that entituled, <hi>De tribus verbis;</hi> beſides many Manuſcripts, which I never ſhew'd any man. </q>The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> was almoſt out of of himſelf for joy to hear theſe things. <q>I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely glad, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that this Science pleaſes you, for I have a particular inclination for it. </q>
               <q>I know it very well, <hi>replies Garay,</hi> (which he ſaid, having already reſolv'd how to put a ſlur up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him) but in regard I place a great confidence in you, I will tell you a thing in your ear, which you will be much aſtoniſh'd at. It is this (whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the ear) that my Niece knows, without any ſtudy, in a manner as much as I do of this Art, and is very fortunate in the practick part of it, as you ſhall ſee by experience. But I entreat you not to ſpeak to her of it at this time, for ſhe would not have it known to any, nay would not take it well. </q>
               <hi>Garay</hi> could not have pitch'd upon a more likely way to bring the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> into the gin; for his avarice was ſuch, that he would have parted with his Soul to find out the Philoſopher's ſtone, hoping, if he once got that ſecret, ever afterwards to ſwim in gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> buſied her ſelf at the other end of the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, while <hi>Garay</hi> made this diſcourſe to the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:58823:68"/>
and was looking upon ſome other curious and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Books, for there were of all ſorts. Yet was ſhe not ſo attentive, but ſhe heard ſomewhat of <hi>Garay</hi>'s diſcourſe, concerning Chymiſtry, and perceiv'd the Merchant was much taken with it. The truth is, <hi>Garay</hi> had ſome knowledge in that Science, and that he had ſpent a conſiderable ſum of mony, to find out the Philoſopher's Stone, which though many had ſought, yet could not any affirm they had met with it. The ſucceſs he had had in that buſineſs onely ſatisfi'd him of their folly, who ſpent their time and eſtates in ſo ridiculous a diſquiſition, and he was glad to have met with ſuch an opportunity, to recover ſome part of the mony he had ſquander'd away therein: for the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> crediting what was told him by <hi>Garay,</hi> imagin'd himſelf ſomewhat above a Prince. He told him, that, in that very houſe, he had all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make the experiment, and thereupon brought him into a room full of Furnaces, Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks, Glaſſes, and Crucibles, with all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments us'd by the Chymiſts, and good ſtore of char-coal. <hi>Garay</hi> ſeeing that, concluded the Merchant would be eaſily taken, and what made him the more confident was, that he imagin'd he underſtood all thoſe Books, whereas <hi>Garay</hi> was ſatisfi'd he knew onely ſo much of them as would ſerve to bring him into the nooſe. In fine, they gave over talking of it any further at that time, though the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to quit the diſcourſe. They went down thence into a ground-room, the windows whereof look'd into the faireſt part of the Garden, where dinner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them. After dinner, <hi>Garay,</hi> pretending it was his cuſtom to take a nap, left the Merchant alone
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58823:68"/>
with <hi>Rufina,</hi> to whom he took occaſion to make a full diſcovery of his love, aſſuring her, that all he had was at her ſervice, and deſiring her to diſpoſe of it as ſhe pleaſed. She ſeem'd to entertain the proffers of his affection with much kindneſs, yet at that time ſhe onely rais'd him into a ſleight hope, ſhewing her ſelf very pleaſant to him.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen a Lute, in one of the rooms above-ſtairs, ſhe deſir'd it might be brought down; for her Muſick, at which ſhe was excellent, contributed much to the bringing about of her deſigns. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who had a little skill at that Inſtrument him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was very glad to hear that ſhe us'd it, and caus'd it to be immediately fetch'd, ſaying that his deceaſed wife plaid excellently well upon it, and that about a ſev'n-night before, having entertain'd ſome of his friends with a Collation, they had ſet it in tune. The Lute being come, <hi>Rufina</hi> began to play, and made it appear, that there were very few could excel her at that Inſtrument. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd at her dexterity, and to bring him abſolutely to her lure, ſhe ſung an Air to it, but with ſuch a grace, that he was at a loſs, whether he ſhould more admire her hand, or her voice. The truth is, ſhe had a particular excellency in both, ſo that his exceſſive commendations of them, were not ſo full of flattery as might be expected from a perſon paſſionately in love. With a modeſt bluſh, which ſpread it ſelf gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over her face (a thing ſhe could command, though never acquainted with ſhame) ſhe ſeem'd to expreſs a certain baſhfulneſs, and ere it was quite diſpell'd, <q>Signor <hi>Octavio, ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> what I have done was onely for your diverſion, be pleas'd to receive
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58823:69"/>
it with ſome regard to the deſire I had to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour your ſatisfaction; which yet I have not done without much temerity, before a perſon of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate an ear as you are, and one, no doubt, wont to hear the beſt voices in the world.</q>
               <q> I never heard any, <hi>replies Octavio,</hi> that came near yours, and therefore I beſeech you, let not your modeſty cauſe you any prejudice; nay rather be proud, Madam, of the excellent endowments you have ſo liberally receiv'd from heaven, and acknowledge the favours it hath done you; be more ſenſible of your own worth, and think my approbation below it; and yet when I was a young man, I was much addicted to Muſick, and ſome would needs perſuade me that my time was well beſtow'd in it. I muſt confeſs, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue comes not ſo naturally to me as the <hi>Italian,</hi> the graces and beauties whereof I have better ſtudied upon the Theorbo, which I am ſo far Maſter of, as in ſome meaſure to ſatisfie the hearer. </q>Whereupon perceiving that <hi>Rufina</hi> would have laid by the Lute, he deſir'd her to make uſe of it a little longer, and to ſing one Air more, which ſhe, to honour him, did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavio</hi> took occaſion to give his dear <hi>Rufina</hi> greater commendations for the excellency of her voice than he had done before, and ſhe, to renew her thanks to him, for the favour he did her. He thought it time to give her leave to take a little reſt, and he went himſelf into another room to do the like. <hi>Garay,</hi> on the other ſide, inſtead of ſleeping, was contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to get the Philoſopher's ſtone, not for the credulous <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> but out of him. He had ſo far perſuaded him of his abilities, in that Science, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58823:69"/>
he deſired nothing ſo much as to be as knowing in it as he was, but all out of no other deſign than to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his own inſatiable avarice. He imagin'd that if he could find the Philoſopher's Stone (a Rock ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againſt which ſo many have wrack'd themſelves) all his houſhold-ſtuff ſhould be of gold, that he ſhould become a <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and that the wealthieſt about the City, compar'd to him, would be little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than beggars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garay</hi> had alſo a long diſcourſe with <hi>Rufina,</hi> about the means how they ſhould get the Gudgeon into the net: he gave her ſome inſtructions in writing, that the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> might find ſhe knew ſomething of the Science, at leaſt the tearms of it. <hi>Rufina</hi> got them by heart, and, to begin the cheat, <hi>Garay</hi> ask'd for ſome links of a Gold-chain ſhe had brought from <hi>Sevil.</hi> It was a large one, and if there were a dozen links ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from it, they would not have been miſs'd. Being come into the City, he goes into a Gold-ſmith's ſhop to melt down thoſe links, and reduce them into an Ingot, which he brought back to the houſe, and communicated his deſign to <hi>Rufina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavio,</hi> who had ſlept all this while as ſoundly as if he had not been in love, comes in to them, and they began to talk of ſeveral things, far from having any relation to the buſineſs he had been about, which <hi>Garay</hi> did purpoſely to engage the other to fall firſt into that diſcourſe, and indeed within a quarter of an hour, he was gotten into the ſubject of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. <hi>Garay</hi> diſcours'd of it after the rate of a man that had ſpent his whole eſtate in the work; inſomuch that <hi>Octavio</hi> was aſtoniſh'd thereat, for though he pretended much skill in the Science, yet could he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58823:70"/>
not but acknowledge himſelf much inferiour to the other. <hi>Garay,</hi> deſirous to give the Merchant all the ſatisfaction he could deſire, told him, that he could turn what Metall he pleas'd into gold. The <hi>Genoeſe</hi> was raviſh'd at the propoſal, and earneſtly entreated him that he might ſee it done. <hi>Garay</hi> ask'd him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any char-coal in the houſe; the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe</hi> told him there was good ſtore, for he had had the curioſity to make ſome trials thereof himſelf. They went up both into the room where they had been before, and finding it full of Furnaces, Creu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, Alembicks, and other Chymical Inſtruments, <hi>Garay</hi> ſaid to him, Here we have all things requiſite for the preſent. He caus'd ſome fire to be brought, and having put a little Copper into a Creuſet to melt, the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> ſaw it melting: <hi>Garay</hi> took a box out of his pocket, wherein there was a paper full of powder, which he ſaid was the moſt principal ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the whole work. He put it into the Creuſet, which having brought as cleaverly as he could to a window, he pour'd out the melted Copper, and put the Ingot of gold into its place, and when he had cover'd it, he told the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> that it ſhould not be ſtirr'd thence for half an hour. That time they ſpent in diſcourſing of ſeveral things in Chymiſtry, wherein <hi>Octavio</hi> deſir'd to make ſome further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. At laſt, <hi>Garay</hi> thought it time to ſhew him what he had done, and ſo opening the Creuſet, he took out the Ingot and ſhew'd it him. The covetous Miſer was almoſt out of himſelf for joy to ſee it, though he were not fully ſatisfi'd of its being perfect gold. <hi>Garay</hi> wiſh'd him to have it tri'd by a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith; which trouble he would needs take upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58823:70"/>
himſelf, and having found that it was very fine gold, of twenty two Carats, he returns extraordinarily well ſatisfi'd. While he was gone out, <hi>Garay</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed <hi>Rufina,</hi> how to effect their deſign upon <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> who being more covetous than amorous, would have them immediately to begin the great work of finding the Philoſopher's Stone. He promis'd <hi>Garay</hi> extraordinary recompences, and told him, that he would be at the whole charge, though it ſhould amount to twenty thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garay,</hi> who had contriv'd how he intended to gull the Merchant, return'd this Anſwer to the great proffers he had made him. <q>Signor <hi>Octavio, ſaid he,</hi> I am now gon almoſt ſeven years beyond the grand climacterical year of my life, which is as much as to tell you, that I have paſt the greateſt and beſt part of it. It were no hard matter for me, with the help of the Science I am now Maſter of, to ſpend the little which is yet to come, at my eaſe, and it may be more plentifully, than ſome of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt Grandees of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that I can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any man's favour or aſſiſtance, I think you may have obſerv'd your ſelf. And in regard I have no children, to inherit my eſtate, which, I thank hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is ſomewhat conſiderable alſo in Lands, the main concernment I have in this world, is to look after this young Woman, my Niece. She is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready but too rich, in that ſhe hath all I have, though her Father, who was my elder Brother, left her no mean fortune. She might, had ſhe a mind to it, be as nobly married as ſhe was before, for her late husband was deſcended from the nobleſt houſes of <hi>Andaluſia.</hi> Nor were it hard for me to add to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58823:71"/>
her wealth, you know it; but ſuch is my confidence in you, that I will tell you the reaſon why I do not. That I am the ableſt Alchymiſt in all <hi>Spain,</hi> is known to many, which being alſo come to the ears of his Majeſty, I am ſought after every where; but I have hitherto had the happineſs to keep out of their clutches, who are perpetually emploi'd to find me out, having ſpread a report, that I was gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>England.</hi> It is not out of any contempt of the honours and wealth of this world, that I avoid the ſearches of thoſe, whom his Majeſty hath enjoyn'd to bring me to him, but out of this conſideration, that I would not purchaſe any favour with the loſs of my liberty, for I muſt expect no leſs, than to ſpend the reſt of my days in a noble kind of captivity. I will expreſs my ſelf more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you. His Majeſty hath at the preſent very great Armies a-foot in ſeveral parts, which put him to a vaſt expence, ſuch as his own Revenue and what comes from the <hi>Indies</hi> are not able to defray: ſo that, to ſatisfie his ambition, he is forc'd to make uſe of the induſtry of his Subjects. Now were it my ſad fortune to be found by thoſe who ſo narrowly ſearch after me, the King, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, with the aſſiſtance of my Art, he might eaſily recruit the charge he is at, would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſpoſe of me into ſome Fortreſs, where being confin'd for the reſt of my days, I ſhould be perpetually kept at work, to augment his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and ſupply his preſſing exigencies. I ſhould not think it much to do it once or twice, but the avarice of men is grown to that heighth, that they are not ſatisfi'd with abundance, if they have the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58823:71"/>
leaſt apprehenſion, that the ſource of it may ever be dried up. This is the true reaſon, Signor <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> which obliges me to keep out of my own Country, and to play leaſt in ſight; and therefore receive what I have told you as a great ſecret, ſuch as I ſhould not have communicated to my own Brother, had he been in the world: but I have that confidence of you, that you will never reveal it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavio</hi> return'd <hi>Garay</hi> his moſt affectionate thanks for the great truſt he repos'd in him, and thought himſelf ſo happy in the diſcovery he had made to him, that he conceiv'd the greateſt Nobles might juſtly envy him. His Anſwer to him, was, that the grounds and motives, on which he conceal'd the excellent knowledge he had acquir'd, were juſt and rational, ſince that no doubt but he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, though for no other reaſon than this, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his carrying over ſuch a Secret into another Country, to ſerve a King that were an enemy to his Catholick Majeſty. He acknowledg'd himſelf infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely oblig'd to him, and wiſh'd it were in his power to ſerve him; but having onely the wealth he was poſſeſs'd of to proffer him, he entreated him to diſpoſe of it as freely as if it were his own, and ſince he had ſhewn him a trial of his abilities, that he would not think that enough, but ere he left <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba,</hi> give him ſuch further inſtructions, as, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, he might not miſcarry in the great work. <hi>Garay</hi> promis'd to ſatisfie his deſires, telling him withal, that ſo precious a thing as Gold could not be gotten but with Gold, and that the foundations of all deſigns require charge; that the Philoſopher's Stone could not be found without coſt and much
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58823:72"/>
pains; that if he were reſolv'd, he ſhould attempt the doing of it, he muſt be at the whole charge, and that afterwards the profit ſhould be equally divided, and that in a ſhort time he would be glutted with wealth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> raviſh'd at that propoſal, proffer'd to ſpend all he was worth upon that accompt. <hi>Rufina</hi> promis'd to aſſiſt them. Nay, <hi>ſays Garay to her,</hi> there is ſuch a neceſſity of your aſſiſtance; that we ſhall not be able to do ſo well without it. They thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, that within two days they ſhould begin the great work. <hi>Garay</hi> told him, that the principal of the divine <hi>Elixir,</hi> (ſo the Chymiſts call the perfection of their work) was form'd of the ſolidity of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and other things which he nam'd to him, together with the urine and excrement of a red-hair'd child; that all was to be put into an Alembick, with powder of <hi>Aloes,</hi> the infuſion of <hi>Opium, Toads greaſe, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and <hi>Salt-peter.</hi> But he hop'd to do it chiefly with the <hi>urine</hi> and <hi>excrements</hi> aforeſaid, which he order'd <hi>Octavio</hi> by all means to procure, as being the moſt neceſſary ingredient of all.</p>
            <p>He promis'd to find it, and, to begin the work, the Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chant deliver'd him five hundred Crowns in gold, to buy certain precious drugs, which he ſaid were neceſſary; and this the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> did the more willingly, as well out of the confidence he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them multipli'd into ſo many thouſands, as out of a deſign he had thought on the night before, of making <hi>Rufina</hi> his wife, and by that means assuring himſelf of <hi>Garay.</hi> Whereupon, that very evening af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper, he took occaſion to carry <hi>Garay</hi> along with him into the Garden, and acquainted him with his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58823:72"/>
reſolution. The Alchymiſt thought it a good way to further his work, and accordingly he approv'd of his intention, and acknowledg'd it would be a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Neece to meet with ſo worthy a Perſon; but that there was one Obſtacle to be firſt removed. <q>What may that be <hi>ſays the other?</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Garay</hi> told him, that his Neece could not be Married, till a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation were firſt obtained from <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard, that, out of the extraordinary regret ſhe conceiv'd at the loſs of her late Husband, ſhe made a Vow to enter into a Religious life; that the occaſion of their going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> was to receive ſix years Arrerages of a Rent due to them from a perſon of Quality, who was very backward in paying, in order to her reception into a Nunnery; but that as ſoon as the Diſpenſation were come from <hi>Rome,</hi> they would conclude the Marriage, which he doubted not but ſhe would accept, not onely out of the compliance ſhe had ever expreſs'd towards him, but alſo out of this conſideration, that ſhe was to match her ſelf with a Perſon inclin'd to the ſtudy of a Science, wherein ſhe had naturally attain'd ſo great perfection. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi> was the moſt ſatisfy'd Man in the world to have ſuch a parcel of good words given him, inſomuch that from that very hour <hi>Garay</hi> became abſolute Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all he was poſſeſs'd of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> having conferr'd notes upon this new Overture, were more confident than ever, to compaſs their deſign. He freely laid out the Money receiv'd of <hi>Octavio</hi> in Drugges, perſuading him they were not to be had under ſuch and ſuch rates. He alſo furniſh'd himſelf with new Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, Creuſets and Alembicks, pretending that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58823:73"/>
thoſe in the Houſe before, were not for his purpoſe. In the mean time, the ſilly Merchant was enquiring up and down where he might have the Urine of a Red-headed Child, which he had much ado to get; for the Mothers fearing it was to be us'd in ſome operation of Witchcraft, would not eaſily let him have it; but Money is omnipotent, and can do any thing. <hi>Garay</hi> could have done as much in one Day as in a hundred, as to the performance of what he had promis'd, but the poor Merchant muſt be fool'd ſome way or other, till he met with an opportunity to ſmite him, and take a Dog's leave of <hi>Corduba,</hi> with as much as he could ſhift away on two good Horſes, which lay Leger in a ſecret place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>He diſpos'd all the Diſtillations into the Furnaces, in the preſence of <hi>Octavio;</hi> he bought ſome Metals, as Braſs, Copper, and Tin, ſeveral ſorts of Salts, and other things commonly uſed by Chymiſts; and ſetting Fire to the Furnaces, they Diſtill'd what had been put into them, but contributing nothing to the buſineſs, and only to abuſe him, who was at the charge of all the Foolery. As to <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Love, he was much better treated than he was before; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſince the propoſal of Marriage, <hi>Rufina,</hi> the better to carry on the main deſign, grew more kind to him, eſpecially in <hi>Garay</hi>'s abſence, which the beſotted Cocks-comb was ſo tranſported with, that he knew not whether his head or his heels were on the ground.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Octavio</hi> receiv'd a Bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of a conſiderable Sum, to be paid within twenty days after ſight. This, with the breaking of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58823:73"/>
ſome of his Debtors in other Countries, put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome fear of doing the like, if his attempts in Chymiſtry prov'd not ſucceſsful. But to prevent all inconveniences, he did what moſt of his Quality and Kidney are wont to do, who being upon the point of breaking, ſecure what they can of their Eſtates, that they may afterwards the more commodiouſly remove into ſome other Country. So our Merchant, finding himſelf within ſome diſtance of breaking, provided for the misfortune, in caſe it ſhould happen, and ſo promoted the miſchievous plot of <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> whom he truly acquainted how affairs ſtood with him, as if they had been his moſt faithful Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Garay</hi> had left in the cuſtody of a certain friend of the Merchants, a good ſum of Money, and ſome Jewels of great Value, with order they ſhould not be deliver'd to any but one of them two. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, he brought ſome to his Country-houſe, and hid them in a ſecret place in the preſence of <hi>Rufina,</hi> of whom he had a confidence, as if ſhe had really been his Wife. <hi>Garay,</hi> who was ſtill buſie about his Diſtillations, put him into good hope, that within twenty days he ſhould ſee the end of the great work, and his Houſe full of Gold, to recover the loſs he had receiv'd by his Debtors.</p>
            <p>About this time, there happen'd a buſineſs which oblig'd <hi>Octavio</hi> to take a Journey, to adviſe with a Correſpondent of his, how to prevent the misfortune he ſaw coming upon him. <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> being entruſted with the Houſe, thought it a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to diſlodge, and make the beſt they could of the preſent game. They ſecur'd all the Money and Jewels they could come at, and left the Plate and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58823:74"/>
ſome other things, they could not ſo conveniently carry away, behind them, though with ſome regret, thinking it more prudence to make a ſafe retreat with what were conſiderable, than to hazard all, by graſping at too much. Having therefore loaden themſelves with what was moſt pretious, they left the Furnaces, and the Alembicks, made the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone at the coſt of the abſent Merchant, and took Horſe while the people of the Houſe were faſt aſleep. They took their way towards <hi>Malaga,</hi> and travell'd all night, having about them above ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns in Money and Jewels, and left, upon a Table near the Furnaces, a paper of Verſes, to haſten the credulous Merchant to hang himſelf.</p>
            <p>Two days after their departure he returns home, very ill ſatisfy'd with his Journey, in that he had not done any thing in the buſineſs which occaſion'd it. All the hope he now had was in his Uncle, <hi>Garay,</hi> imagining, by his means, he ſhould yet be able to ſhew his head, and not onely keep up his Reputation, but alſo be Richer than ever he had been, ſuch a ſtrange Miſt had the Witchcraft of Chymiſtry caſt before his Eyes.</p>
            <p>He came not to his Country-houſe till after Night, where he found the Servant whom he had left with <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina,</hi> for the reſt of his people were in the City. The Servant receiv'd him with a ſad countenance, and being got up ſtairs, he ask'd him (fearing ſomewhat were amiſs) where his Gueſts were, of whom the Servant could give him no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as having not ſeen them when they went out, and could onely ſay, that, two Nights before, they had lock'd him into the Room where he lay, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58823:74"/>
he had been forc'd to break open, becauſe he could not otherwiſe get out. They ſearch'd up and down, and found that the Cheſts had been opened, and all the Money convey'd away. This was not the worſt the Merchant feared, but that they had alſo been with him, in whoſe cuſtody he had greater ſumms of Money, and the moſt pretious of his Houſhold-ſtuff. It being too late to make any enquiry that Night, he thought it his beſt courſe to go to Bed; but deſirous to viſit the Furnaces once more, he finds on the Table the Paper, left there by <hi>Garay,</hi> which having open'd, he found in it theſe Lines.</p>

            <p>The poor Merchant had no ſooner read them, ere he was convinc'd, they were his kind Gueſts who had robb'd him, and extracted what he had in his Cheſts and Cabinets with more eaſe than he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it into them. How he ſpent the Night, is onely to be imagin'd, being juſt upon the point of Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not knowing any means to remedy it. All the hope he had, was, that the Money and Jewels which he had left in a friend's hands, were ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; nay he deſpair'd not to find out thoſe, who had done him the miſchief. He turn'd himſelf from one ſide to another, not out of any diſturbance, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by his Love to the ſubtle <hi>Rufina,</hi> (for that was abſolutely loſt with his Money) but that he had been ſo baſely trapan'd by a beggarly Raſcal. Then did he begin to curſe Chymiſtry, and all the Authors that ever writ of it, whereas he ſhould rather have given God thanks, who, by the cheat which was put upon him, had prevented the proſecution of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which might have abſolutely ruin'd him. As ſoon as he perceiv'd any appearance of Day, he got up, and went into the City, to his Houſe, whom he had entruſted with the keeping of his Money and other things. He ask'd him whether <hi>Garay</hi> had been with him? the other anſwered that he had, and had taken away whatever he had in his cuſtody, and that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58823:75"/>
therein he had follow'd his own orders. That word ſtruck him almoſt Dead; nay the reſentments he expreſs'd of that loſs were ſo great, that if the other had not known the cauſe of it, he would have thought him out of his wits. He comforted him the beſt he could, and told him, that his onely courſe was to make a ſpeedy ſearch for the Robbers. He did all he could to that purpoſe, ſending Officers and others ſeveral ways; but that which <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> had taken was ſo extraordinary, that they could never meet with them. So they return'd to <hi>Corduba,</hi> to be paid for their fruitleſs purſuit, by him who had ſent them, which, as his affairs ſtood then, added not a little to his affliction. This adventure was ſoon known all over the City; and the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> not able to accept of another Bill of exchange that had been ſent him, was forc'd to abſent himſelf, and to return to <hi>Genua,</hi> with what he could make by the ſale of his Goods. By this means he turn'd Bankrupt, and defy'd his Creditors, who could not find any thing he had left behind him. The ſame thing happens many times to thoſe, who, with ſmall Eſtates, engage themſelves in too great affairs, preſuming upon this, that, if it comes to the worſt, they can ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by an eſcape.</p>

They had ſhifted their Cloaths, and having diſguis'd themſelves as well as they could, they carefully avoided all thoſe places where they had the leaſt apprehenſion they might be known. It
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58823:76"/>
was <hi>Garay</hi>'s charge to provide Victuals; and being about the beginning of the Spring, they found it no great inconvenience, to lye abroad in the open air. They got into a thick Wood juſt as the Sun was ready to ſet, and fearing that a thick Cloud, under which they were, might break upon them with too great violence, as there was ſome likelihood, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Thunder and Lightning that had gone before, they went into the thickeſt part of it, the better to ſecure themſelves. Other Travellers, upon the ſame apprehenſion, had taken refuge at a place, near that where <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> were. The noiſe they made in diſcourſing, rais'd in <hi>Garay</hi> a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to come and over-hear what they ſaid; and through the means of thick Buſhes, being come near them, he perceiv'd they were three Men, one whereof, ſpeaking to the others, ſaid; <q>If this Tempeſt laſts all night, I doubt we ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of our deſign. </q>
               <q>I fear me ſo too, replies another, and no doubt but the Hermit of <hi>la Serre</hi> will be out of all patience that he hath expected us ſo long. </q>
               <q>O that Brother <hi>Criſpin</hi> is an excellent fellow, <hi>ſays another of them:</hi> his Religious frock covers a great deal of miſchief, and he is ſo inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating in his behaviour, that he is very much in their favour, who beſtow'd the Hermitage upon him. </q>
               <q>He is ſo tranſcendent an Hypocrite, <hi>replies another,</hi> that he is able to blind all the World: he hath the reputation of a virtuous perſon all over the Country, and there is not within twenty Leagues about a more conſummate Villain than he is. </q>
               <q>I have been acquainted with him theſe twelve years, <hi>ſays the Second,</hi> and his profeſſion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58823:77"/>
hath been to receive Thieves, and their Booties; and he hath been ſo fortunate as never to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Guilty of any crime of that kind, whereas ſo many other poor Rogues have been taken and truſs'd up, at the firſt falling into the hands of Juſtice. </q>
               <q>It muſt needs be acknowledg'd, <hi>ſays another,</hi> that his Hermitage is a very convenient place for perſons of our profeſſion, and the Cellar he hath made under it, is ſuch a place, as the Divel himſelf would never find out. We could never have met with a more ſecure place, to put up the fifteen hundred Crowns we yeſterday disburthen'd the Merchant of. 'Twas the moſt conſiderable Robbery that hath been committed in this Country of a long time. </q>
               <q>If it would but hold up a little, <hi>ſays he who had ſpoken firſt,</hi> I hope to make as good a Prey, yet before it be Day.</q>They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon adviſed concerning the means how to execute their deſign. <hi>Garay</hi> miſs'd not a word of all they had ſpoken; the Country he was acquainted with as well as if he had been Born in it, and very well knew the Hermit, whom, till then, he had accounted a perſon of great ſanctity, ſo far was he from imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he drove ſuch a Trade, and that his Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage had, for ſo many years, been the refuge of High-way-beaters, and Houſe-breakers.</p>
            <p>Having made this ſtrange diſcovery, he returns to the place where he had left <hi>Rufina,</hi> and gave her an accompt of what he had heard from thoſe Robbers. They continu'd there without making any noiſe, they and their Horſes, till ſuch time as the others were gone, conſidering with themſelves how they might make their advantage of that unexpected adventure:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:58823:77"/>
And taking their way to a blind Inn, not far thence, they ſtay'd there the remainder of that Night, and all the next Day. Having, in that time, conſider'd what they had to do, they went both towards the Hermitage, where Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> (ſo was the Hermite named) lived, and being got within a ſmall diſtance of it, <hi>Garay</hi> bound <hi>Rufina</hi> to a Tree, upon which ſhe cries out as loud as ſhe could, <q>Is there no body to relieve a wretched Woman, ready to be Murther'd here? O Heaven, revenge the injury done to my innocence.</q> On the other ſide, <hi>Garay</hi> acted his part, ſaying, <q>'Tis in vain for thee to call any body to thy relief; thou haſt not long to live, and therefore recommend thy ſelf to God, for thou ſhalt not eſcape out of my hands; as ſoon as I have bound thee to this Tree, I will diſpatch thy Soul into the other World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the firſt noiſe of her crying out, <hi>Crispin</hi> hears her, and being all alone in the Hermitage, a thing ſeldome happened, for, moſt nights, he had the company of ſome of the tribe, who though guilty of much watching, were not much either of ſanctity or miracles. The Hermit came out with two good Pocket-piſtols, and being got near the place, whence he had heard the noiſe, he diſcharg'd one of them, which happen'd very luckily for <hi>Garay.</hi> For it being reſolv'd upon the queſtion between him and <hi>Rufina,</hi> that he ſhould run away as ſoon as any came near them, it might be conceiv'd, the diſcharging of the Piſtol had frightned him. He preſently mounted one of the Horſes; and leading away the other, he rid away with all the ſpeed he could. <hi>Crispin</hi> comes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58823:78"/>
near the Tree, and, by the light of the Moon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Rufina,</hi> weeping moſt bitterly, and ſeeming to be aſtoniſh'd, through that fright ſhe was in. Seeing the Hermite coming towards her, <q>What art thou return'd Traitor, <hi>ſaid ſhe?</hi> will nothing deter thee from executing thy cruel deſign? Come, take away my Life, and put me out of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, and doubt not but one time or other, Heaven, ſince it will not reſcue, will revenge my innocence.</q>The frock'd Hypocrite, hearing this diſcourſe, and perceiving thereby that ſhe miſtook him, made her this Anſwer, <q>Madam, I am not the perſon you think me to be, but one who comes to relieve you in this extremity, and to ſave your Life. What is become of the Villain, who would have taken it from you, and hath oblig'd me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of my Profeſſion, to take Fire-arms to purſue him, not doubting but what I do will be accompted an act of meritorious charity in the ſight of God?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having thereupon unbound her, <hi>Rufina</hi> caſt her ſelf at his feet, ſaying, <q>It muſt needs be, Brother <hi>Crispin,</hi> (for ſhe knew his name) that you had ſome revelation from Heaven, of the violence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me, ſince you came ſo miraculouſly to my relief, and that with Arms ſo contrary to your Profeſſion. Heaven reward you for the charitable aſſiſtance you have afforded an innocent Woman. I cannot expreſs the reſentment I have of the kindneſs you have done me, otherwiſe than by ſubmiſſions and vows, as being oblig'd to you for no leſs than my Life, which the fury of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58823:78"/>
was juſt going to deprive me of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crispin</hi> was extreamly taken with the Woman, (nay notwithſtanding his vow of chaſtity, he had a kindneſs for the whole Sex) but he was yet maſter of ſo much modeſty and reſerv'dneſs, that he ſorbore all diſcourſe of Love and Familiarity; and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his counterfeit ſanctity, <q>My dear Siſter, in the Lord, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> I think my ſelf far from deſerving all the favours it pleaſes God to do me: but I endeavour all lies in my power to Live vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, ſerving my Creator in this ſolitary place, where it hath been the pleaſure of his divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that I ſhould be a means to ſave your Life: I heartily thank him for it, and am extreamly glad, that what is done is to your ſatisfaction. For this night, I can onely proffer you ſuch a reception as a poor Cell can afford, where you may continue, till you have accommodated your affairs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd your ſelf to your Brother. I aſſure you it is abſolutely at your ſervice, and I offer it you with ſuch a cordial affection, as a good Chriſtian ought to have for his Neighbour, for I had not put my ſelf into this habit, were it not to exerciſe ſuch charities as theſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> renew'd her thanks to him for the civil proffers he made her, burſting forth afreſh into feigned tears, a thing ſome Women can do when they pleaſe, but this had the knack of it beyond any. She gladly accepted of his kindneſs, as what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced very much to the compaſſing of her deſign. They thereupon took their way towards the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and Brother <hi>Crispin,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Rufina</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58823:79"/>
weary, endeavour'd to comfort her with all the kind words he could think of, and at laſt took her by the arm, to help her forward. He open'd the door of the Hermitage, and when they were got in, <hi>Rufina</hi> was not a little aſtoniſh'd, to ſee a rough Plank, which he pretended was his Bed, with a Crucifix at the head of it, and on one ſide, hanging up by a Nail, an Inſtrument made of good Whip-cord; wherewith his credulous Zealots believ'd that he diſciplin'd himſelf: all the other furniture of the Room conſiſted in a little rotten Table, which, by much travelling and removing from place to place, had brought four feet to three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> finding the room ſo poorly furniſh'd, and the perſon who made his aboad in it ſo mortify'd and reſerv'd in his behaviour, began to repent her ſelf, that ſhe ever came thither, and imagin'd that <hi>Garay</hi> had miſ-underſtood the conference of the Robbers in the Wood. But the devout Hermit put her out of her dumps, for taking notice of her looking a little ſtrangely on the accommodations of his Houſe, he ſaid to her, <q>My dear Siſter, you may haply think this a very poor Lodging, and that you will have but an ill Nights reſt; be not troubled, I will Lodge you much better than you imagine. 'Twas your happineſs to come hither at this time, now that there are not any here upon their ſpiritual retreats, which ſome devout ſouls of your Sex are wont to make at this Hermitage, ſometimes for eight or ten days together. Some of theſe, for the greater conveniency of their devotion, have ſent hither Beds, and ſome other Houſhold-ſtuff.</q>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58823:79"/>
Incomparable Hypocrite! Having asked her whether ſhe liv'd at <hi>Malaga,</hi> and ſhe telling him that ſhe was a ſtranger in thoſe parts, he would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her, that there were Beds in the Hermitage for ſuch as came to make their ſpiritual retreats there, which was a damnable lie: but the truth of it was, that he, for his own eaſe, had very good Quilts, and other neceſſaries for a bed or two, for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſecret camerades who came often to viſit him. Theſe conveniences were diſpos'd into a low room, which was alſo the Treaſury, where thoſe birds of prey, put up ſuch things as the true owners of them never intended ſhould be acquainted with the place. He thereupon deſir'd her to have a little patience, till he went down to fetch ſome bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, which having brought, he made her a bed in a little Cell, at a ſmall diſtance from his own. They had a better ſupper then <hi>Rufina</hi> expected, there was ſome boil'd meat and broth, and a cold Rabbet, which <hi>Criſpin</hi> pretended had been leſt at the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage by one of his Penitents, a very devout old Gentlewoman, whom he was infinitely oblig'd to; and to cloſe their ſtomachs, they had ſome excellent fruits, according to the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> was a woman much inclin'd to mirth, but at this time, doing her natural diſpoſition ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſhe ſeem'd to be very melancholly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and ſo continu'd all the time they were at ſupper, eating very little, the better to expreſs her wearineſs, and being troubled at the accident, which had befallen her. The Hermit in like manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he had no great ſtomach, whether the meat
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58823:80"/>
was not dreſs'd to his mind, or that he did it out of a compliance with his fair gueſt, whom he look'd on ſo attentively all the time they were at ſupper, as if he had been to read a Lecture of her Phyſiognomy. At laſt, having taken away the meat and cloth, the Hermit, deſirous to know of <hi>Rufina,</hi> the cauſe why her own Brother would have taken away her life, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to ſatisfie him, which ſhe did in this ſhort account of her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Though it cannot but add very much to my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make a rebearſal of the occaſion of it, yet the kindneſs you have done me, my dear Brother, being ſo tranſcendent, I ſhould be a very ungrateful perſon, to deny you the ſatisfaction of ſome account of her whom you have ſo highly oblig'd. <q>I was born, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> in the City of <hi>Almeria,</hi> of noble Parents, my Anceſtors having been famous there for ſeveral ages. All the children they had were onely my ſelf, and a Brother, who is a year older then I am. My Father and Mother left this world, and me in it a little before I was fully ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to the fifteenth year of my age. There were thoſe who thought the face you now ſee not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome, that is in other words, ſeveral perſons courted me in order to marriage, but my Brother oppos'd it as much as lay in his power, charging my Sutors with ſome defects or other, in their eſtates or extraction, ſo that not any one of them obtain'd what they ſo much deſir'd. I believe the true cauſe of my Brother's refuſals proceeded from a deſire he had that I ſhould go into a Nunnery, where I had two Aunts, and he get to himſelf
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58823:80"/>
ſomewhat of the fortune my Father had left me. I diſcover'd his deſign, by their continual preſſing of me to become a Nun. But I never had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to that kind of life, and ſo my Anſwer to them was ſutable thereto; which incens'd my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much againſt me, that he never look'd kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on me ſince.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>While theſe things were in agitation, a young Gentleman, who had left <hi>Almeria</hi> ere he was ten years of age, return'd from <hi>Flanders,</hi> where, for the good ſervices he had done his Majeſty, he had been advanc'd to the command of a Company of Foot and a Troop of Horſe. He came accordingly in a very good equipage, both as to Cloaths and Horſes. He had a pretty conſiderable eſtate, and had not receiv'd any thing from it ſince his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſo that there was a good ſumm lay ready for him. He one day chanc'd to ſee me at Church, and lik'd me ſo well, that he enquir'd who I was. Some gave him an account of me, and ſoon after, he began to make his addreſſes to me, and to court me by Letters and other ways. To make my tale ſhort, I was not inſenſible of his affection, but conſidering with my ſelf the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity there was between us as to birth, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent endowments he was Maſter of, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his love, and admitted him to come into the houſe, but upon the aſſurance he gave me, that his courtſhip was really in order to marriage. He viſited me with much freedom, for my Brother was then ſick of a diſeaſe, which had brought him almoſt to death's door, (I would it had carried him
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58823:81"/>
quite into that cold room, my condition would not be ſo ſad as it is at the preſent.) One of my former Sutors, being not a little troubled to ſee a New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer ſo highly advanc'd in my favour, began to watch him, and in a ſhort time ſaw him let in and coming out of our houſe, at an unſeaſonable time of the night. He made a very ungentlemanlike advantage of that diſcovery; for, envying any other ſhould have what he could not obtain, he gave my Brother an account of what was done in his houſe. One day coming to viſit him, and being all alone with him, he told him what he had ſeen. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had recover'd a little of his ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to get up, and by his own obſervation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in what the other had told him. Yet could he not be reveng'd of me, by reaſon of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and put it off to ſome other opportunity. He ſeem'd to be extremely troubled that I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd my affection to that Captain, and proteſted that he would have been much leſs, had I made choice of any other, for he had had ſome difference with his elder Brother, and ever ſince, they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been good friends.</p>
               <p>At laſt, my Brother recover'd his former health, and finding the Captain gone from <hi>Almeria,</hi> he told me, that he would carry me to ſee an Aunt of ours at <hi>Malaga,</hi> who was a Nun of the Order in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> I believ'd him, and not imagining he knew anything of the correſpondence between the Captain and my ſelf, I was very glad of the opportunity to ſee that Aunt, whom I was much oblig'd to, for ſeveral things ſhe had ſent
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58823:81"/>
me of her own working. We prepar'd our ſelves for the journey, and rode each of us on a horſe, with two ſervants on two others to wait on us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into the wood near this place, he ordered the two ſervants to go before, to prepare a lodging for us, and being come to the place where you found me, juſt as day was taking its laſt leave, he threw me off my horſe, and put me into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you found me in, wherein no doubt I had periſh'd, had not you fortunately reliev'd me, for the diſcharging of the Piſtol made him get away before he had done the work he intended. May God, the requiter of all good turns, remember the charitable aſſiſtance you did me, which was ſo ſtrange, that I ſhall never forget it as long as I live.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Hermit having heard this ſtory, took occaſion to comfort her the beſt he could, and promis'd her to do any thing that lay in his power; whereupon they parted for that time, and went to their ſeveral Beds; ſhe, to that which had been prepar'd for her, and he, to another, that lay in a ſecret place, very well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; for, however he blinded the world with an apparent auſterity, he was a perſon who lov'd his eaſe as well as any other. He was deeply fallen in love with <hi>Rufina,</hi> and mighty deſirous to acquaint her with his paſſion; but the fear of ſcandal made him a a little reſerv'd. He ſpent the whole night without any reſt, contriving how he might beſt make a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his love to her.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it began to dawn, he got up and ſoon after him <hi>Rufina,</hi> who going into the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:58823:82"/>
to the Hermitage, found him on his knees before the Altar, which oblig'd her to do the like, at a little diſtance from him. He thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his devotion a while, but not without much diſtraction, for he could not forbear looking on her, to ſuch a height was his love grown in one night. On the other ſide, <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was as well read in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie as the Hermit, was reſolv'd to outvy him at kneeling, in which poſture ſhe continued ſomewhat longer than ſhe could have wiſh'd. At laſt perceiving that <hi>Criſpin</hi> had done his prayers, ſhe alſo ended hers. Whereupon the holy Brother comes to her, and ſaid to her, <q>Bleſſed be the great Preſerver of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, my dear Siſter in Chriſt, for his infinite mercies; be it his good pleaſure that you may live happily all the reſt of your days, and have all thoſe enjoyments of body and mind you can your ſelf deſire. I pray tell me, excellent creature of God, how you reſted this night. </q>
               <q>Very well, my beloved Brother, <hi>repli'd ſhe,</hi> I thank your kindneſs, though the trouble I am in ſuffers me not to be quite free from diſquiet. </q>
               <q>There is nothing more argues a devout Soul, <hi>ſays Criſpin,</hi> than a ſweet and humble compliance with the will of Heaven; put your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him who hath numbred the hairs of your head, and doubt not but this heavineſs will be turned into joy. </q>
               <q>If it be his bleſſed will, it ſhall be ſo, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> though we ſee not the means how it will be effected. </q>
               <q>O excellent creature! <hi>cries out the amorous Hermit,</hi> how highly meritorious in the ſight of God is this holy acquieſcence and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:58823:82"/>
Having ſo ſaid, he brought her into a little room, out of which they had the proſpect of the fields, where being both ſate down, <hi>Criſpin</hi> began to open himſelf to her in this diſcourſe. <q>When I ſeriouſly conſider, Madam, the ſtrange effects of beauty, how the purſuance of it forces men into diſturbances, and in a manner tranſports them out of themſelves, I cannot chuſe but pity and excuſe them, becauſe the frailer part of man endeavours its own ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the heart is naturally enclin'd to deſire that which the eye contemplates with a certain pleaſure, eſpecially having for its object the moſt delightful thing that God ever fram'd. You may hence take occaſion to imagine, Siſter, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections we ſhould make on the celeſtial beauties, and thoſe ſupernatural miracles which tranſcend the reach of our ſenſes. When I left the world, which was in an age not much acquainted with the wickedneſs of it, I propos'd to my ſelf, as far as I could with a reſpect to humanity, to keep my ſelf at as great a diſtance as I could from the ſight of that admirable ſex, which is not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly called, the fairer half of the world; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I have already put away childiſhneſs, and began to entertain thoughts ſutable to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and apprehended, that to be exempted from the charms of women, was a privilege wholly angelical. I am at the preſent much more ſatisfied as to that particular, than I could have been in that ſtate of innocence, and I find there is an abſolute neceſſity I ſhould keep out of your ſight, or fall into the ſnare I ſee the devil lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:58823:83"/>
for me. The ſumme of this diſcourſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is to ſhew you, that beautiful faces are very dangerous, and that, ſince my firſt ſight of yours, I feel my Soul in a very great hazard. Be not ſtartled, I beſeech you, to hear me talk after this rate; this diſcourſe, I muſt confeſs, is very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſonant to the habit I have on, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I have embrac'd: but theſe have not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mann'd me, and conſequently not exempted me from humane infirmities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe words there might be ſeen ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his face a certain bluſh, as if he could not make the firſt overture of ſuch a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſing ſomewhat he was never truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, Shame. <hi>Rufina,</hi> with a counterfeit modeſty, ſeem'd to do as much as he had: but Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion preſenting her fore-lock, and telling her that that was the moſt likely way to bring about her deſign, ſhe would not give him an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but made him this Anſwer. <q>Though I know my ſelf not to be of their number, who, by their beauty, may engage men into any diſquiet, yet muſt I acknowledge, Brother <hi>Criſpin,</hi> that, as to this point, I am of your opinion; for the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Beauty are ſo powerful, that I my ſelf, though a woman, am carried away therewith, as well as others, and know not a greater pleaſure, than that of ſeeing a handſome face, and admiring the effects of it. And therefore I wonder not at all, that men are reduc'd to ſome extremities, when they are paſſionately in love, ſince it is to be imagin'd, that the force of beauty operates with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58823:83"/>
an extraordinary influence. Nor do I think any more worth my admiration, to ſee it hath its effects as well on thoſe who are retir'd out of the world, as on thoſe whoſe affections are moſt inclin'd thereto, inaſmuch as they have not attain'd a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection purifi'd from the droſs of all humane enjoyments: And therefore, I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think my ſelf the more oblig'd to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity you have ſhewn me, ſince I underſtand, that your exerciſing of it is not without the Ioſs of your quiet, and ſomewhat of ſcandal. I could wiſh with all my heart, that I were not the cauſe of ſo much trouble in the world; but in regard you are not heard by any but my ſelf, you need fear nothing as to that particular. You were deſirous to know the Hiſtory of my Adventures, I am no leſs to be acquainted with yours, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to underſtand what might have oblig'd you to leave the world ſo ſoon, to live in this ſolitary place, and with ſo great auſterity. For though I doubt not but you did it in order to the ſalvation of your own ſoul, yet me-thinks I perceive in you thoſe excellent endowments, for which you might have been eſteem'd in your youth, and put off the execution of ſo hard a penance till an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi>'s diſcourſe was as the counterfeit Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite could have wiſh'd it, and thereupon being tranſported with joy, he came more home to his purpoſe, and told her in plain tearms, that the charms of her beauty had ſo inchanted him, that, from the minute ſhe firſt came into his houſe, he had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58823:84"/>
not had any reſt, he loving her as paſſionately as man could be imagin'd to love woman. <hi>Rufina,</hi> who minded her own work, entertain'd the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſomewhat of kindneſs, excuſing it upon the account of humane frailty: ſo that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſome hope, that he ſhould obtain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he ſeem'd to be the moſt ſatisfi'd perſon in world. <hi>Rufina</hi> pretended indiſpoſition, and for two days together kept her bed, where ſhe was treated by her charitable Entertainer, with the beſt meat could be had for mony, which was brought to the Hermitage in the night time, by his Camerades.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange, that <hi>Rufina</hi> ſhould have the confidence to continue all alone in that ſolitary place, with a perſon of whoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs ſhe had a ſufficient knowledge: but ſhe knew withal the paſſion he had for her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd thence, that a real Love never being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect, ſhe could not imagine he would ever injure her. What further aſſur'd her, was the hope ſhe had put him in to treat him more kindly, when ſhe had certain notice brought her, that her Brother had left <hi>Malaga;</hi> beſides, that the apprehenſion ſhe had leſt ſhe might be diſcover'd, kept her from requiting, as ſhe thought her ſelf oblig'd, the extraordinary kindneſs he had ſhewn her. Thus ſhe drew in by degrees the Rampant Hermit, who, to further on the work, promis'd her to make a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry, by the means of his friends, whether her Brother were at <hi>Malaga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That night, <hi>Criſpin</hi>'s three intimate friends
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58823:84"/>
came to the Hermitage, bringing along with them above two thouſand Crowns in gold. This was the robbery they were engag'd upon, when <hi>Garay</hi> over-heard their diſcourſe in the wood. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery had been made by <hi>Criſpin,</hi> in a houſe of the City, where he was wont to receive alms, and the rain having prevented the execution of the deſigne that night, they had now done their work, by thruſting a little boy into the houſe where the mony was, who made a ſhift about mid-night to open the door for them.</p>
            <p>The three Robbers brought the mony that very night to the Hermitage. <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing they ſhould ſee what female-company he had in the houſe, receiv'd them in his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and treated them with a Supper. As they ſupp'd, they diſcours'd of divers things. There was among them one, who having quitted his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, had engag'd himſelf in that infamous kind of life, not regarding his extraction, nor his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which were much beyond ordinary. This perſon furniſh'd them with diſcourſe upon all occaſions; whence it came that <hi>Criſpin</hi> deſir'd him to divert them a little, and, to drive away the time a while after ſupper, to entertain them with ſome Hiſtory or Novel, for he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them. He preſs'd him the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that <hi>Rufina</hi> might alſo participate of the diverſion, who, from the room where ſhe was, might hear all their diſcourſe. She was very glad, to find, that <hi>Criſpin</hi> was the ſecret entertainer of ſo virtuous a Society, and immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58823:85"/>
by their diſcourſes, that they were the ſame perſons, whom <hi>Garay</hi> had over-heard in the wood. The young man, whom the Hermite had intreated to tell them ſome ſtory, diſplay'd the excellency of his wit and memory, in the relation of the enſuing Novel.</p>

Conſtantia:</hi> but his Father and Mother leaving this World ere he was full fifteen years of Age, he was forc'd into that courſe of Life, which is commonly taken by the younger Brothers of Noble Houſes, who have not much left them, and with the little Money he could get together, he went to trail a Pike in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He behav'd himſelf ſo gallantly there upon ſeveral occaſions, that he got the Colours of a Company of Foot, and after other ſucceſsful encounters againſt the Dutch, he was advanc'd to the Command of the ſame Company. Having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in that Charge made yet greater demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Conduct and Valour, his moſt Serene Highneſs the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert</hi> prevail'd with his Majeſty to beſtow on him the Order of the Knights of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> with an aſſurance of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandery, that ſhould be void, belonging to that Order. Having obtain'd that, he ſtill continu'd his Military employments, till ſuch time as there was a Ceſſation of Arms made between the King and his Enemies of the Low-countries, to laſt a year and a day. This opportunity, together with the news he receiv'd out of <hi>Spain,</hi> of his Elder Brother's Death, oblig'd him to deſire leave to make a journey into his Country, where two Children his Brother had left, and his own Siſter, ſtood in need of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; the former, to be protected by him; the latter, to be diſpos'd of in marriage. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> fifteen days after his Siſter's departure thence for <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> where the Court was then, with an Aunt of his, a Widdow, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Siſter, who would needs have her along with her; this old Lady, who had a great kindneſs for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58823:86"/>
her, having reſolv'd to leave her all ſhe had at her Death, in hopes ſhe might with thoſe advantages meet with a better match.</p>
                        <p>As ſoon as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was come into his Country, he took order about his Brother's Eſtate, and the Tuition of his Nephews, whom he left in the cuſtody of an antient Kinſman of his, whom having entruſted with the care of their education and maintenance, he reſolv'd to go and viſit his Siſter at <hi>Vailladolid.</hi> As he was ſetting things in order for that Journey, paſſing through the broad place of <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> he ſaw abundance of people, going towards an Inn, which was at the end of it, accompanying two Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in one whereof there was an old Gentleman, and, in that which follow'd, a young Lady, whoſe tranſcendent Beauty, heightned by the ſumptuouſneſs of her attire, raviſhed the eyes and hearts of all that ſaw her, but above all thoſe of <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> He was ſo enflam'd by that tranſient ſight of her, that, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering with his Cloak the Order he was of, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Litter, ſo tranſported out of himſelf, that he reflected not on what thoſe who obſerv'd him might ſay of his demeanour. He ſaw her lighting at the Inn-gate; and if he was before rais'd into a kind of aſtoniſhment at the beauty of her Face, he was now no leſs, at the handſomeneſs of her Body, the magnificence of her Cloathing, and the ſweetneſs of her Complexion. In a word, he was reduc'd to ſuch an extremity by the paſſion he immediately felt in himſelf for her, that he made enquiry, and ſet himſelf to find out, who that miracle of perfections might be, which had ſo of a ſudden ſurpriz'd his Heart, and attain'd ſo abſolute a diſpoſal of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:58823:87"/>
He was ſoon ſatisfy'd as to that particular, for, meeting with one of her Servants going from the Inn towards the Market-place, he with much civility ask'd him, who that old Gentleman was, and whither he was then going? The other, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood civility well enough, return'd him this Anſwer, <q>The Gentleman, whoſe name you are ſo deſirous to know, and who is my Maſter, is called the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> a perſon of the higheſt Rank next to Soveraign Princes, who comes into <hi>Spain,</hi> an Ordinary Ambaſſadour, from the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> to his moſt Catholick Majeſty the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He brings along with him his beautiful Daughter, the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> to be married to <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> his Excellency's Nephew, who is at the preſent at <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> a Gentleman of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worth, who in the flower of his Youth left <hi>Germany,</hi> to go and ſee foreign Countries, attended onely by four Servants. He has travell'd over all <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and is now reſolv'd to make his aboad in <hi>Spain,</hi> having already continu'd ſome time at the Court, with a very great Train. He hath a Houſe magnificently furniſh'd, and is very highly in favour with his Catholick Majeſty, and well reſpected by all the Nobility about the Court; nay his generoſity and excellent conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation have acquir'd him the eſteem of all the greateſt perſons in this Country. This marriage of Signor <hi>Leopoldus</hi> had been treated of in <hi>Germany,</hi> with this Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> the onely Daughter of my Maſter, who leaving his Country upon his being honour'd by the Emperour with the preſent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, hath ſollicited the buſineſs with greater
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58823:87"/>
earneſtneſs; ſo that his Imperial Majeſty ſeems deſirous that this Match ſhould go forward. We came by Sea, but had ſuch diſtreſs of Weather, that we were like to be caſt away ſeveral times. While we were in that danger, my Maſter, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman much inclin'd to Devotion, made a Vow that if he eſcaped, through the interceſſion of the glorious Patron of <hi>Spain,</hi> (for whom he hath a particular Devotion) he would viſit the place where his ſacred Body lies buried, ſo well known all over the World for the great Miracles daily done there. Being come to <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter continu'd there fifteen days, during which time all things were agreed upon in order to the Marriage. That great affair being concluded, he would needs perform his Vow, and go to Saint <hi>James</hi>'s. His Nephew <hi>Leopoldus</hi> is not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, but ſtays at <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Diſpenſation, for the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> and Signor <hi>Leopoldus</hi> are Couſin-Germans. Thus Sir, I think I have ſatisfy'd your deſire, as to the queſtion you put to me.</q>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> gave the Servant very great thanks for the accompt he had given him of his Maſter, and aſſur'd him he would requite his kindneſs, if it lay in his power, and ſo took leave. This diſcourſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after night, as they walk'd over the Market-place, it being ſo dark as that the Marqueſs's Servant could not take any particular notice of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who did all he could to avoid being diſcover'd. The accompt he had receiv'd, that the Beauty, which had ſtollen away his heart at the firſt ſight, was already engag'd, and, within a ſhort time to be married,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58823:88"/>
caus'd him to return home a much ſadder Man than he had left it. This affliction, with the love which he already had for her, bereav'd him of all reſt. That very night, he would needs go and ſee the Marqueſs and his Daughter at Supper, yet ſo as that he might not be perceiv'd by them. The maſter of the Houſe plac'd him ſo as that be might ſee all at his eaſe, yet not be ſeen himſelf; and this was to leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. The next day, the Marqueſs went thence, ſo as that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſaw not the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> any more that time: nor was he much troubled at it, for having in the night advis'd with his pillow, to find out ſome remedy for his diſquier, he found it neceſſary, that he ſhould not be ſeen, either by the Marqueſs, or his Daughter, or any one belonging to them, that he might the better compaſs a deſign which onely Love could inſpire him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
                        <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Galicia</hi> is very full of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and conſequently the way to Saint <hi>James</hi>'s muſt be troubleſome to travel, ſo that the Marqueſs could make but ſhort Journeys, whence <hi>Don Pedro</hi> inferr'd, that he could not be back in leſs than twenty days; preſuming he would make ſome aboad at <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> to do his devotions, and refreſh himſelf, ere he ſet out for his return. Accordingly, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of his affairs in order to the deſign he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of, and, taking leave of all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, he went to <hi>Pont-ferrada,</hi> a Town which lay four Leagues further from the Court than <hi>Ville-Franche.</hi> He took up his Quarters at an Inn, whence he ſtirr'd not in the day-time, but onely took the air a little in the night, yet with ſuch a caution not to be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58823:88"/>
known to any, that he diſcover'd himſelf to none of the Inhabitants, but onely his Land-lord, whom he acquainted with his quality, and the deſign had brought him thither. He was attended onely by one Servant, whoſe fidelity and courage he had many years experienc'd, for he had ſerv'd him as a Soldier, and waited on him, from the time of his firſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Ville-Franche. Felician</hi> (ſo was this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant named) perceiving his Maſter more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy than he had been wont to be, and that ſomewhat kept him from reſting in the night, for he heard him diſquietly turning in his bed, and ſighing ever and anon, he imagin'd that the cauſe of his diſturbance was not at <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> inaſmuch as if it had been, he would not have fail'd, night or day, to diſcover by his viſits, what could not be known by his diſquiets and ſighs. Thus this diſcreet Lover not diſcovering any thing of his ſecret paſſion, <hi>Felician</hi> could not gheſs at the occaſions which bred ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in his mind: nay though he did all lay in his power to pry into it, yet could he never meet with any ſatisfaction. One day, finding his Maſter all alone, and not able to endure that reſerv'dneſs in him any longer, he thus ſpoke to him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I ſhould never have imagin'd, Sir, that you could be guilty of ſo great a cloſeneſs towards a ſervant, whom you have ever found faithful, and to love you even beyond his own life. You have heretofore thought me worthy the knowledge of your moſt important ſecrets; pardon me, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tell you, that your ſilence now gives me juſt cauſe to conceive, that you have not the ſame thoughts of me, and that I muſt be guilty of ſome

crime, whereof I have not my ſelf the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. Wherein, I pray, Sir, may I have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you? You muſt needs harbour ſome ill thoughts of me, ſince you conceal from me the diſquiets which deprive you of all appetite to meat or reſt. Sure they proceed from Love, or I am mightily miſtaken. You cloſe not your eyes all night, and ſpend the day in retirement, avoiding all ſociety, and giving your ſelf up to perpetual ſolitude, and melancholy; which I am extremely troubled to ſee. You have left your Country, telling your friends that you were going to Court; whereas you continue in an obſcure place, where you are afraid to be known. 'Tis impoſſible for me to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear grieving at it, as long as I am ignorant of the cauſe thereof. Pardon my curioſity, Sir, which however impertinent, is an argument of my faith and readineſs to ſerve you. I know it to be the duty of a good and faithful Servant, punctually and implicitly to obey the commands of his Maſter, without inſinuating himſelf further into his ſecrets, than he is willing he ſhould be acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I have hitherto kept my ſelf within thoſe bounds, and have ſo liv'd with you as that I fear not any reproach you can make me. But now at laſt, my ancient fidelity gives me the boldneſs to ask you, what buſineſs may have brought you to this place; what occaſions your diſquiet, and what you intend to do in this obſcure Inn, where you admit not of any enjoyments? Have you a greater confidence of the happy Maſter of this Houſe, whom you have known but within theſe four days, than of an old Servant, of whoſe zeal and fidelity
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58823:89"/>
you have had ſo many experiences? You have heretofore thought my advice worth the asking, nay have follow'd it, in things, for ought I know, of as great importance as this is.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Felician</hi> having thus ended his complaint, his Maſter conceiv'd himſelf oblig'd to make him ſome Anſwer, which was this. <q>
                              <hi>Felician,</hi> I muſt confeſs, I have look'd on thee, and that juſtly, as my friend, a title I may well allow one who hath ſhar'd with me, in war, the dangers, in peace, the enjoyments I have been engag'd in. It is a very hard thing, not to ſay impoſſible, that any man ſhould, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of himſelf, take a courſe contrary to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him by Heaven; though it be ſaid, that a wiſe man ſhall have dominion over the Stars, that is (as Aſtrologers expound it) humane Prudence ſhall elude the decrees of Fate. I am born to love a Beauty, which ſurpriſing my heart, hath withall poſſeſs'd it ſelf of all the faculties of my Soul. I find my ſelf no longer Maſter of my own liberty, that I am not able to make the leaſt diſpoſal of my will, and ſo it were a madneſs for me, to oppoſe the inclination, whereto the ſovereign Powers have made me ſubject. I ſuffer my ſelf to be fooliſhly carri'd away by my paſſion, though I know well enough that I attempt a thing abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and beyond my ſtrength. This is the cauſe of my diſquiet, muſing, and melancholy, ſpending the nights without reſt, and the day in ſolitude, ſuffering a thouſand aſflictions which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and loving where I am not to hope the leaſt return of Love, by reaſon of an invincible obſtacle that lies in my way. This is that deſtroys my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58823:90"/>
and poiſons all my joy. I have ſeen that divine Beauty, that mortal Angel, that prodigy of miracles, who paſs'd through our Town with her Father the Marqueſs <hi>Rodolfo:</hi> the excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments ſhe is Miſtris of, and which thou maiſt have admir'd as well as my ſelf, are all the excuſe I can alledge for the blindneſs of my paſſion; but they feed it not with any hope. There is an obſtacle lies between me and the poſſeſſion of her, which I ſhall find it impoſſible to remove. This tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Beauty is already made ſure to a Gentleman of great worth, who is her Couſin-germane, named <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and me-thinks I ſee her ready to join hands with him. I hear ſuch high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his excellent parts, that I find the little hope I had ready to leave me. I love her, or to ſay better, I adore her, and if I may judge by the preſent agitations of my heart, I may ſay, it will never be diſengag'd from the paſſion I have for her. I know it is madneſs in me to think of her, and that I cannot, without extravagance, ever hope ſhe may be mine, to the diſappointment of a young Lord, who, with the advantages of bloud, hath all thoſe of nature. Nay I think it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to find out ſome means to acquaint her with my Love, and to get a Letter convey'd to her. I know that the houſes of <hi>Oſorio, Toledo, Astorga,</hi> and <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> whence I derive my extraction, are not inferiour to thoſe of <hi>Rodolfo</hi> or <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> and conſequently that I am as nobly deſcended as ſhe is; that would not be the greateſt obſtacle, if I could but make my ſelf known at Court. I hear that ſhe intends thither, when ſhe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58823:90"/>
returns from her pilgrimage; I have but three months to carry on this buſineſs, which is the time requiſite to get the diſpenſation from <hi>Rome.</hi> I have a long time conſider'd with my ſelf of the means, how I might get acceſs to her, and that I conceive the moſt likely to take, is to counterfeit, what indeed is but too real, a certain diſtraction of mind. By acting the mad-man's part, I might ſo diſguiſe my extravagancies, as that the Father, pleas'd with my humour, may haply carry me along with him to the Court. This certainly is a deſign fantaſtick enough, and not onely contrary to my quality, but abſolutely oppoſite to the opinion I ſhould endeavour to raiſe my ſelf in the world. I have a certain confidence, that at Court I ſhall be known to very few, becauſe I have been a long time out of <hi>Spain.</hi> Beſides theſe conſiderations, the habit I will put on, being altogether extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, I ſhall be ſo diſguis'd, that my neareſt friends and relations will hardly know me. If, by this means, I can get into the Marqueſs's houſe, I ſhall hope the plot will take. For I have heard this Lady is not fully ſatisfi'd with the marriage, having underſtood that her Couſin is a perſon of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd life, and inclin'd to Women; and that ſhe admits of his addreſſes onely out of obedience to her Father. I have communicated my deſign to the Maſter of the houſe, as being a diſcreet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who may ſerve me, and puts me in hope to get me into the Marqueſs's ſervice, when he comes to give him an account of my pleaſant extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, as we have already agreed together. Thus, my dear <hi>Felician,</hi> have I given thee a faithful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58823:91"/>
of my ſelf, thou know'ſt now as much as I do, as well of my affliction, as my love; miſtruſt not the confidence I have of thee, and aſſiſt me with all thy wit and induſtry, or expect ere long to be a witneſs of my departure out of this world.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Felician,</hi> out of compliance with his Maſter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the project, though he doubted much the ſucceſs of it. He ſaw his Maſter was too far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to receive any prudent advice; ſo that he promis'd to aſſiſt him according to the deſign he had laid to get acceſs to his Miſtreſs, and troubled not his thoughts with any thing but how to compaſs it. It was his buſineſs therefore to get cloaths made for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſutable to his extravagance. He put him into a Caſſock after the old faſhion, with puffs at the ſleeves of green cloth, and large skirts, a Cloak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Rocket, very ſhort, and a <hi>Milan</hi> Cap, of green Pluſh. Being thus diſguis'd, he chang'd his quarters, and went to the Hoſt's Brother's houſe, who alſo muſt of neceſſity be acquainted with the ſecret. All this could not be done without ſome yellow pieces, whereof he had brought good ſtore out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with ſome Jewels of value he had gotten by gaming, at which he was very fortunate.</p>
                        <p>About this time the Marqueſs, with the beautiful Lady his Daughter, were upon their return from their pilgrimage. Before they got to <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> the beams of his Litter broke, ſo that he was forc'd to come to the Town on horſe-back, and to ſtay there two days, while the Litter was mended. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs took up the ſame Inn where <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had lodg'd, as being the beſt in the Town. The Hoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught what he had to ſay to the Marqueſs, for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58823:91"/>
the furtherance of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s deſign, ſoon met with an opportunity to do it. For, as moſt perſons of Quality, when they travel, are very inquiſitive to know what is rare or remarkable at the places through which they paſs, the Marqueſs deſirous to hear what there might be at <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> call'd for the Hoſt. Having travell'd ſeveral times before into <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſpoke the Language very well, was a very ſociable perſon, and glad of company.</p>
                        <p>The Hoſt being come into the room, he began to ask him concerning the Antiquities of the Town, the illuſtrious Families had liv'd in it, the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Inhabitants, the beauty of the Ladies, and ſuch particulars: wherein the Hoſt ſatisfy'd him, giving him a very exact account of all he knew. Among the antiquities and remarkable things of the Town, he came to ſpeak of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> telling ſuch ſtories of him as might raiſe a deſire in the Marqueſs to ſee him. <q>There is come, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> within theſe fifteen days, a very rare perſon to this Town, fantaſtically clad in a green ſtuff; but there is a greater extravagance in his behaviour than there is in his cloaths, and yet in the height of his diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there may be obſerv'd certain ſhadows of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and ſtaiedneſs which render him excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good company. Being asked by ſome of our Inhabitants, who he was, I am, ſaid he, Son to the River <hi>Sil,</hi> which paſſes by the walls of this Town, and deſcended from one of the moſt illuſtrious Families of <hi>Galicia.</hi> He expects to be treated with <hi>your Honour,</hi> and <hi>your Lordſhip,</hi> in diſcourſe, though he is known by the title of <hi>Knight of the Noble Order of the Marigold.</hi> The fooleries he tells
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58823:92"/>
to make good the title he aſſumes, are ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that they force Laughter from the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. He ſeldome comes out of his Lodging, feeds high, and we cannot imagine whence he ſhould have means to live at that rate. He hath a Servant to wait on him, who knows the length of his foot, and complies with him in his madneſs, either for his advantage, or that he hath a ſoft place in his Head, as well as his Maſter; and I think them both very well worth your notice. I wonder the Knight hath not been yet to wait on your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; for he is mighty deſirous to converſe with Strangers, and finds them out as ſoon as he hears of their arrival.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Marqueſs was much pleas'd with this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hoſt, and deſir'd him to bring him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that noble Knight. The fair Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> expreſs'd alſo a deſire to ſee him, for ſhe had been preſent at the Hoſt's diſcourſe. He gladly ſatisfy'd them, being over-joy'd the Prologue of the deſign had taken ſo well. He went to his Brother's to fetch him, having before told the Ambaſſadour, that he muſt treat him honourably, if he expected to make any ſport with him; inaſmuch as, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſelf-conceited in his madneſs, he would be put out of all humour, if he were entertain'd with any diſ-reſpect, or indifference.</p>
                        <p>The Marqueſs, who was a perſon naturally inclin'd to mirth and civility, promis'd him he would obſerve his directions. Whereupon the Hoſt marches away for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who came into the room very humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in his fool's coat, making wry mouths, and ſome fantaſtick geſtures, the introduction to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58823:92"/>
extravagance. The Ambaſſadour, how ſerious ſoever he would appear, as being oblig'd by his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſſemble, could not forbear Laughing, to ſee him in that equipage, attended by <hi>Felician,</hi> who, on the other ſide, acted very well the part had been given him. He went to receive him at the Chamber-door, with this complement; <q>Welcome to the nobleſt piece of Gallantry that ever <hi>Spain</hi> ſaw; welcome the mirrour of all the brave Knights that ever were celebrated for their heroick Actions. </q>
                           <q>The News your Excellency tells me, replies <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> deſerves not the reward may be expected for it: you are extreamly miſtaken, if you think your ſelf the firſt of thoſe who have admir'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's prodigality towards me in excellent parts and endowments. </q>
                           <q>Give me the favour at leaſt, anſwers the Marqueſs, to be one of the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſſes thereof, which no doubt I ſhall, if you pleaſe but to honour me a while with your ſweet company. For as a rich Diamond pleaſes all the world, ſo the attractions of your countenance, and the tranſcendent inſinuation of your behaviour forces the admiration of all that ſee you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was by this time got near the fair Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> whereupon looking with a certain aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on her miraculous Beauty, <q>My Lord Marqueſs, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> I beſeech you forbear at preſent the praiſes you are pleas'd to give me, for it were to profane thoſe which are due to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature. I pray let me know whether ſhe be your Daughter, for if ſhe be, you will be much concern'd in the Elogies I ſhall give this—this—this—(well) Miracle. Her coming into the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58823:93"/>
world was to embelliſh our Hemiſphere, to ſupply <hi>Cupid</hi> with freſh Darts, to become the Load-ſtone of Hearts, the delight of the Eyes, the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univerſe, the maſter-piece of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the miracle of Nature. By the Noble Order of Knight-wood I am of, I ſwear, that the very minute I firſt caſt my Eye on this accompliſh'd Beauty, I found my heart was grown rebellious, and no longer mine; my will bereay'd of all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and my ſoul become abſolutely her Slave. In a word, Sir, I think my ſelf ſomewhat different from what I was before, and the more I feel my ſelf, the more I am aſtoniſh'd at the ſtrange Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis. </q>
                           <q>The commendations you give me, renowned Knight, replies the Lady, ſmell too much of ſlattery: I am confident you do not your ſelf believe one half of what you have ſaid, and therefore it will be hard for you to perſuade me to it. You conſider not that you act againſt your own Sentiment, when you ſpeak againſt your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I ſhould never adviſe a Gallant, who would raiſe himſelf an eſteem with the Ladies, to hazard his own diſappointment by ſo ill a Prologue; for to give undeſerved praiſes breeds a ſuſpition of imperfections; and to be forc'd to the belief of falſhood brings truth into queſtion. </q>
                           <q>The truth, I tell you, <hi>replies the amorous Extravagant,</hi> is ſuch, ſo pure, ſo clear, and ſo far from all ſuſpition of being otherwiſe, that you ſhall ever find it as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Mouth as in your own Looking-glaſs. </q>
                           <q>Be not ſo haſty, honourable Knight, <hi>ſays the Lady to him,</hi> be pleas'd to take a Chair, for we deſire to diſcourſe with you at leiſure.</q>
                           <q>Were it Heaven's
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58823:93"/>
pleaſure, Madam, <hi>ſays Don Pedro, as ſoon as he was ſate,</hi> that I might ever continue near you: but I ſee the honour you are pleas'd to do me will be but ſhort, and my joy ſoon be over, for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that within two days you leave this place, and if you go without me, I ſhall dye out of pure grief. In the mean time, give me leave to look on this manſion as the Empyreal heaven, ſince ſo great a Deity hath honour'd it with her preſence. </q>
                           <q>We forget all civility, <hi>ſays the Marqueſs,</hi> when we fall into other diſcourſe, before you have firſt entertain'd us with your own noble adventures, that we may thereby know what reſpects we ought to pay your worth. </q>
                           <q>There is not any due to me Sir, <hi>replies the diſguiz'd Cavalier;</hi> but that the ſervice, I have vow'd you, may be the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, I will give you an account of my extraction, and relate you the perfect hiſtory of my Life hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: be pleas'd to afford your attention to what I ſhall ſay.</q>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Galicia</hi> was heretofore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Counts, and afterwards by Kings. <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar</hi> reign'd in that time, and continu'd a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower after the burial of his firſt Wife, by whom he had no other Children but the Infanta, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domira,</hi> who coming to reign after him was called the VVenching-Queen. She fell in love with the Gallant <hi>Ricaredo,</hi> one of the richeſt and prope eſt perſons in the Kingdome. He ever kept about the Court, and was a Kinſman, though ſomewhat afar off, to the King, but his principal Favourite, by which means he had acceſs into the Queen's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and got of her that favour whereby Mankind
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58823:94"/>
is propagated. I prov'd to be the iſſue of that amorous Union, and the good hour of my birth happen'd at a time that the King chanc'd to be at his Daughter's lodging. The pains of Child-birth ſurpriz'd her, and being a Novice in ſuch adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhe could not diſſemble her Labour, even in the preſence of her Father, who imagin'd it was ſome other accident had happen'd to her. Her VVomen holp her to Bed, not knowing the diſeaſe that troubled her; but not long after I came into the world, it ſeems, to run through all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that have happened to me ſince. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the world by a faithful Servant, who knew of my Mother's Loves, ſhe took me in her Lap, to be deliver'd to a Brother of hers, who was alſo acquainted with the buſineſs. As ſhe went out of the Infanta's Lodgings, ſhe meets with the King, going to viſit his Daughter. She was affraid his curioſity would have egg'd him on to examine what ſhe had in her Lap; which made her turn back of a ſudden, and, by a ſecret pair of ſtairs, go down into the Garden, where having diſpos'd me into a little wicker Basket, ſhe put me into the River <hi>Sil,</hi> which ran by the wall thereof, and told the Infanta that ſhe had deliver'd me to her Brother, as they had reſolv'd. I was carry'd awhile on the Chryſtal waves of that clear River, but at laſt, the water growing ſomewhat rough, I ſunk, and was receiv'd into the arms of the God of that River, who encompaſs'd by his fair Nymphs, conducted me into his own Chryſtal palace. You may haply imagine this diſcourſe a feign'd ſtory taken out of the inventions of the Poets; but give
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58823:94"/>
me leave to aſſure you, that the buſineſs happen'd no otherwiſe than as I tell you.</p>
                           <p>I was brought up by the Nymphs in that ſecret Manſion, and inſtructed by the God of the River, who wiſh'd I might prove worthy ſo noble an edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. He caus'd me to be inſtructed in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Sciences, and ſpar'd no pains to make me an accompliſh'd perſon. I learnt three or four Languages, but particularly the Latin above any of the other. Being arriv'd to the twentieth year of my Age, Love, to ſhew his omnipotency, and that all places are under his juriſdiction, caus'd his flames to faſten on me even through the water. In that Virginal company of Nymphs, there was one, for whom the God of that watery habitation had a particular eſteem; and ſhe deſerv'd it, for ſhe very much excell'd all her Companions; her name was <hi>Anacarſia.</hi> Her endowments were extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and her beauty beyond all compariſon. In complexion and ſtature ſhe came ſomewhat near this fair Lady your Daughter, and had the ſame advantage over the reſt of the Nymphs, as the Delphick Torch hath over the other Planets. She play'd excellently well on all kinds of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to ſum up all in a word, ſhe was a prodigy of all perfections. I fell ſo paſſionately in love with this beauty that I had not a minute's reſt, from the time that little Deity had wounded my heart, with the mortal darts of her ſparkling Eyes. I found it a hard buſineſs to diſcover my love to her, in regard I could never meet her alone. She was perpetually haunted by ſome of thoſe who liv'd in that Chryſtal palace; they follow'd her every
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58823:95"/>
where, and would never be out of her ſight. But one day, when all the other Nymphs were gone to a Muſick-meeting, at which were alſo to be read certain Lectures of Poeſie, being the ordinary divertiſements of the God of that River, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Anacarſia</hi> purpoſely pretended ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to give me an opportunity to ſpeak with her. She ſent me notice of it, by one who came to tell me from her, that ſhe kept her Bed onely for my ſake, than which I could not have expected a kinder complement from one of her Sex. I went to her chamber, and found her careleſsly laid on a Bed of Moſs, exceeding in whiteneſs the fine Sheets ſhe lay on, and diſputing as to ſplendor and light, with the Sun, who then beheld her. I was ſtartled at the ſight of ſo many charms, and was upon the point of loſing all Sentiment, an effect natural enough in thoſe who are truly touch'd with love. But recovering my ſelf a while after, though ſtill much troubled, and my tongue but as it were newly looſned, I took the confidence to make this diſcourſe to her.</p>
                           <p>Adorable Nymph, the glory of theſe deep Habitations, but the unavoidable Rack of thoſe hearts, which are captivated by your Beauty, my ſoul, ſince the firſt time I ſaw you, is abſolutely diſpos'd to ſerve you; I have no further power over her, ſhe is wholly yours, and glories in her ſlavery. Treat her as a thing belongs to you, and as I have vow'd her to you with an inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. You have done me an extraordinary favour in allowing me to declare the amorous paſſion I have for you: may I further hope that you will
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58823:95"/>
allay it, and if I ſhould be admitted to that degree of felicity, ſhould I not be the happieſt and the moſt glorious of all men?</p>
                           <p>The fair <hi>Anacarſia</hi> infinitely pleas'd with ſo obliging a diſcourſe, and the worth ſhe obſerv'd in me, highly honour'd me with her affection, and compli'd with my amorous deſires, in ſuch ſweet and melting expreſſions, as put me in hopes of the happy accompliſhment of my Love. But it was not long ere our diſcourſe was interrupted by the God of the River, who finding neither of us at the Meeting, came ſtreight to her Chamber, and ſlunk in ſo ſoftly, that he over-heard ſome part of our amorous conference; which ſo incens'd him againſt me, that he immediately reſolv'd to give a check to my preſumption. He laid ſiege, with his clear waters, to the chamber of <hi>Anacarſia,</hi> and ere he had quite damm'd up the door, he caſt me out with ſuch violence, that I was got to the bank of the River. I preſently heard a voice ſaying unto me, <hi>Guadomarus,</hi> thou art deſcended from Kings, though it be a long time ſince they have had Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their hands; Princes of another Family have diſplac'd them. Thou art born a Pagan, chooſe what Law thou thinkeſt beſt; if thou wilt follow my advice, thou wilt take that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in this Kingdom, under which lived thy il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Anceſtors. I have juſtly baniſh'd thee out of my dominions, becauſe it was not fit I ſhould ſuffer profane love to be made to a Nymph who had vow'd her chaſtity to me, as I had mine to her. I have promis'd her my protection and aſſiſtance in all things. Keep henceforward within thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58823:96"/>
and aſſure thy ſelf I wiſh thy good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, ſo far am I from doing thee any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie. Whitherſoever Fortune ſhall diſpoſe of thee, be confident, thou wilt not be out of the reach of my care.</p>
                           <p>With thoſe words the waters of the River ſeem'd to ſtir themſelves into a gentle curl, which being preſently laid, it became as ſmooth as it had been before. I immediately found my ſelf (by what adventure I know not) in a Kitchin-garden, in the midſt of a bed of Marigolds, which I look'd on as a good Omen, and thought my ſelf oblig'd to derive my name thence. Afterwards, at my bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, I took the name of <hi>Peter Gil</hi> of <hi>Galicia,</hi> taking the ſurname from the Kingdom which had been heretofore in the poſſeſſion of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who have been dead theſe four hundred years, as I have found in Hiſtory. Beſides that name I have taken as an additional title, that of <hi>Knight of the noble Order of the Marigold;</hi> I have aſſum'd it my ſelf, for an illuſtrious Hero, as I am, may be his own Herald, and by what appellations he pleaſes raiſe himſelf above the ſphere of the common ſort of people.</p>
                           <p>Thus have I given your Excellence an accompt who I am, and diſcover'd to you my true Original. If the qualities and endowments I own, deſerve the Honour to be receiv'd into your alliance, give me leave, O moſt illuſtrious Marqueſs, to make my addreſſes to this ſuper-celeſtial Beauty, this Miracle of our age, whom Nature was humorouſly pleas'd to frame for the delight of the eyes, and torment of hearts. I onely expect your good will, give it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58823:96"/>
me, I beſeech you, and thereby ſatisfie my extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paſſion. I think you ſo generous, that you will not deny it me, if you conſider, that granting it not, you bereave me of my life, which you know is the moſt illuſtrious of any in Europe; and are conſequently ſatisfi'd, that the world, loſing in me, the moſt renowned Knight it ever had, muſt withall loſe the worthieſt Kinſman of his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty King <hi>Philip.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                        <p>He deliver'd theſe laſt words with ſuch pleaſant geſtures, the better to expreſs the violence of his paſſion, that both the Marqueſs and his Daughter had much ado to forbear laughing. <hi>Felician</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd to ſee the force of that paſſion, which, of an accompliſh'd Gentleman, made a ridiculous laughing-ſtock; and could turn a perſon of eminent parts and judgment, one not long before conſulted in <hi>Flanders</hi> as an Oracle, into a counterfeit Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant. For if he had not pretended the loſs of his wits, he had loſt all the hopes of his love; and he could not have gotten near ſo fair a Lady upon any account but that of madneſs.</p>
                        <p>The Marqueſs compoſing his countenance to more ſeriouſneſs, return'd him this Anſwer. <q>Signor <hi>Don Pedro Gill,</hi> the moſt illuſtrious, and onely Knight of the Noble Order of the Marigold, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pleas'd with the knowledge you have given me of your perſon, and the accompt you have entertain'd me with of your miraculous birth and noble education. Had a perſon, leſs illuſtrious than your ſelf, acquainted me therewith, I ſhould have miſtruſted his diſcourſe, and imagin'd he told me fables: but a perſon of your worth and quality ought
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58823:97"/>
to be credited in all things. What further confirms me in the truth thereof is, that, he is no leſs then a Prince who ſpeaks to me. Believe me, I have a great reſpect for your rare Qualities, and ſuch an honour for your perſon, that I would aſſure you my own is wholly at your ſervice. I have that eſteem for your friendſhip, that I ſhall endeavour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it while I live. I wiſh my ſelf a natural Inhabitant of this Kingdom, that I might have the greater opportunities to further your ſatisfaction. I ſhall ſtay here but till ſuch time as his Imperial Majeſty ſhall ſend order for my return; but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abode I ſhall make here, command me in any thing lies in my power. As for the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you deſire to make your addreſſes to my Daughter, I from this time give it you, and I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to accept of it, and to entertain you kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but ſhe is already made ſure to a Couſin of hers, and I have ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Diſpenſation, which once come, the Marriage will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. This obſtacle lies in your way, and you will find it a hard matter to remove it. I am ſorry I had not the happineſs of your acquaintance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for how gladly would I have embrac'd the honour of having a Son-in-law of your worth and quality, and to ſee my Family alli'd to the Blood-Royal of <hi>Galicia?</hi> The end of moſt Courtſhips is Marriage; of yours you ſee it cannot be. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs your ſelf to my Daughter upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I know you would not; the husband ſhe expects is a perſon of ſo much gallantry, as not to receive any ſuch affront.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The diſguis'd Extravagant broke forth into great
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58823:97"/>
reſentments upon his obliging diſcourſe, which made excellent ſport for all that were preſent. But having laugh'd their fill, the Marqueſs and his Daughter could not forbear making charitable reflections on that ſtrange kind of diſtraction. It pitied them to ſee a Gentleman every way ſo accompliſh'd, fall'n into ſuch unheard of extravagancies, as to alledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſcended from a River, and brought up in it, five hundred years before. While ſome that were preſent, purpoſely to urge him to ſpeak, oppos'd the ſtories he had told them, and he endeavour'd to give them ſatisfaction, the Marqueſs acquainted his Daughter with a thing had come into his mind, which was to carry <hi>Don Pedro</hi> along with them to the Court, it being likely he would find them excellent ſport by the way. They reſolv'd to treat him as a Perſon of eminent quality, having underſtood by his Servant, that he was really ſuch, and that upon his recovery out of a great ſickneſs, that madneſs had ſeiz'd him. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> was very well content, leaving it to ſome other time to acquaint him therewith. <hi>Don Pedro Gil</hi> coming to take his leave of the Marqueſs ſaid to him, That ſince he was ſo unhappy as not to deſerve his fair Daughter's hand, in the quality of a Husband, he would allow him to love her with a vertuous Love, ſuch as even her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould not diſapprove. The Marqueſs gave way, deſiring him to honour him with his company at ſupper that night, for that he had ſomewhat to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto him. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> gladly accepted the proffer, and thereupon they parted.</p>
                        <p>The Marqueſs and his people talked very much of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> wondring at the ſtrange kind of madneſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58823:98"/>
he was fallen into. He acquainted them with the deſign he had to take him along to the Court. The Maſter of the houſe where he was lodg'd happening to be then preſent, told him, that he doubted <hi>Don Pedro Gill</hi> would hardly be perſuaded thereto, if the Marqueſs treated him as an inferiour; for he was mighty ſelf-conceited, and ſtood much upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but if he were willing, there would ariſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other difficulty in the manner of his travelling; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, ſaid he to him, your Excellency going by Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I think he would be loath to go by horſe. <q>We'l find an expedient for that, ſays the Marqueſs, which is, that my Daughter, as his Miſtreſs, ſhall command him to entertain her at the ſide of her Litter; for if his love continues, he will be glad of the opportunity; and he ſhall have an excellent horſe, richly harnaſs'd, which I have led after me, to ride on when I am weary of the Litter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who had been acquainted with all theſe diſcourſes, fail'd not to come to ſupper, to which he had been invited. The Marqueſs receiv'd him very civilly, and caus'd a chair to be ſet for him, near his Daughter, which he thought a very ſignal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. They talk'd of divers things, the Marqueſs finding he had an excellent wit in his intervals, which ever clos'd with ſome pleaſant extravagance. They were very merry at ſupper, and were oblig'd for their diverſion to the merry diſcourſes of <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> At laſt, the cloth being taken away, the Marqueſs broke his mind to him in theſe words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>'Tis a thouſand pities, moſt renowned Knight, that a perſon ſo accompliſh'd as you are, and one furniſh'd with all the excellent endowments that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58823:98"/>
recommend men to the favour and eſteem of Princes, ſhould as it were defie their Courts, and ſpend your time and talents in ſuch an obſcure place as this is. I have heard that the reaſon of this your retirement is, that you have not means to live ſutably to your condition and the rank you ſhould maintain. If it be ſo, give me leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an expedient to you, out of the particular eſteem I have for your Signory. I ſhall take it for a very great favour, if you will be pleaſed to go along with me to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> where you ſhall be treated, in my Quarters, with all the ſubmiſſions and reſpects due to a perſon of your quality, yet ſo as that it ſhall not coſt you any thing. By this means coming to be known, and your worth ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, you may meet with a rich wife, of ſome illuſtrious Family; wherein my Daughter may do you a kindneſs, in regard ſhe, having occaſion to ſee many of them, will advance you into her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for whom you have moſt inclination. Let me obtain of your Knight-hood the favour I deſire of you; live freely with us, ſince you would have me believe, that the love you bear my Daughter is pure and ſincere; I will undertake it ſhall be kindly taken by the Husband ſhe hopes to have. I expect your Anſwer to this particular, and I deſire it may be conſonant to the eſteem I have for your worth.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was extremely ſatisfi'd, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture had taken ſo well, and immediately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that, living in the houſe with the Marqueſs, he ſhould be near her whom he ador'd, which was the main end of his deſires; whereupon he return'd him
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58823:99"/>
this Anſwer. <q>No temptation in the world ſhould have forc'd my removal from this place, but the extraordinary Civilities I have receiv'd from your Excellency. I had reſolv'd to ſpend the reſt of my days in this retirement, as conceiving it the beſt courſe for a perſon of my Quality, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues are much below his Honour, to confine himſelf to ſome place, where he is not much known, and ſo avoid the charge of Servants and Cloaths. But the reſpects you are pleas'd to have for me, together with this tranſcendent Beauty, who, by the forcible attractions of her divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, draws hearts after her, as the <hi>Thracian Orpheus</hi> did living creatures, ſtones and plants, by the harmonious ſound of his Harp, have made me wholly at your ſervice. I ſhall not trouble either you or my ſelf to tell you how perſons of my Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ought to be treated, as thinking it enough, that I have already acquainted you with my Titles, and particularly that I am of the Blood-Royal. The greateſt favour you can ever do me, is, that you command me to wait on your Daughter, which if you do, I ſhall the more willingly accept of the proffer you are pleas'd to make me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Marqueſs finding him willing to go along with them, all that remain'd to be done was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to do it on horſe-back, which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do, that he might the better entertain his Miſtreſs at the ſide of her Litter. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> help'd the Lady into her Litter, being proud in his mind at that introduction of his ſervice to her, and that he had the happineſs to take her by the fair hand, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing his attendance on her from their departure
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58823:99"/>
from <hi>Pontferrada,</hi> till they came to <hi>Valladolid.</hi> All the way along, he entertain'd her with pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, intermixt with amorous expreſſions, and at every Inn they came to, ſhe fail'd not to give her Father an account of the divertive diſcourſes ſhe had had with <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The laſt day of their Journey, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> would needs feel the pulſe of his Miſtreſs as to her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Marriage, and endeavour'd to diſcover how ſhe was inclin'd thereto. He brought the buſineſs upon the Stage, ſo dexterouſly, as that ſhe might not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him guilty of any impertinent curioſity. It is commonly obſerv'd that perſons any way afflicted are apt to break their minds to any people, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe with whom they are familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Accordingly, to eaſe her own thoughts, and ſatisfie <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſhe made him this Anſwer. <q>Worthy Knight of the moſt honourable Order of the Marigold, I muſt needs acknowledge, that my Couſin <hi>Leopoldus</hi> is a perſon endow'd with all the Qualities, capable to raiſe a Woman's Love to the higheſt pitch, but I have withall diſcover'd him to be ſo fickle, and one ſo naturally inclin'd to addreſs himſelf to all ſorts of Women, not regarding whether they be nobly or meanly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, that it very much cools my affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and makes me fear his alliance, though I find my ſelf ſufficiently inclin'd thereto, could I perceive any likelihood of his reforming himſelf of that inſufferable humour. But, far from that, ſince my coming into <hi>Spain,</hi> when he ſhould have endeavour'd to give me greater aſſurances of his affection, I find him as indifferent as to my ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58823:100"/>
as ever: and God knows with what appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions I am induc'd to condeſcend to this Match. For if I am now frightned at the thoughts of his miſ-carriages, what muſt I not fear, when he ſhall become my Maſter? The obedience I owe my Father, and the neceſſity I find that this Marriage ſhould be concluded, for the compoſure of ſome differences in our Family, make me wholly paſſive in the buſineſs, and ſo content it ſhould go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I admit of his Addreſſes not without ſome violence to my own inclination, and all I can do, is to pray Heaven, that it would inſpire him with better reſolutions.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could have wiſh'd that ſhe had not been ſo reſolute, as ſhe ſeem'd to be. He therefore, though then perſonating a Fool, anſwer'd her as a wiſe Man, and advis'd her to bear a while with the failings of her Couſin. <q>Deſpair not, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> but <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> may become another Man, and that if he be ſuch as you deſcribe him now, that volatile humour will be fix'd in him, when he ſhall come to be poſſeſs'd of ſo fair and accompliſh'd a Lady. </q>But he reſolv'd, upon the firſt opportunity ſhould preſent it ſelf, to expreſs his mind to her in other tearms, and to make a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of himſelf to his Miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>They came that day to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and <hi>Leopoldus</hi> met them half a days Journey ſhort of it. He was very kindly receiv'd both of the Marqueſs and his Daughter, whereat the diſguis'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was not a little troubled: for finding <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> a very graceful perſon, he began to entertain ſome doubts of the ſucceſs of his enterprize. The Marqueſs
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58823:100"/>
thought fit to make him acquainted with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that, by the Character he gave him, he might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly treat him. <q>Nephew, ſaid he to him, I pray take notice of this noble Cavalier, who hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured us with his company from <hi>Galicia,</hi> for his perſon, and the rare qualities he is Maſter of are ſuch as deſerve the higheſt eſteem. I deſire you to reſpect him accordingly, and aſſure your ſelf all you do will be below his merit, not onely upon the accompt of the Royal Blood from which he is deſcended, but alſo the Romantick title he aſſumes to himſelf, of <hi>Knight of the honourable Order of the Marigold.</hi> He pretends a juriſdiction over all thoſe places where ever any of that Herb grows, and never ſees it, but he thinks of the complexion of a Miſtreſs he once had, who ſpent moſt of her time in Kitchin-Gardens, in one whereof it was Love's pleaſure to make him a Captive to her Beauty, as ſhe was gathering ſome Marigolds.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This deſcription made <hi>Don Leopoldus</hi> take a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and he doubted not, as well by his accoutrements, as by the fantaſtick title he had taken to himſelf, to conclude him a moſt tranſcendent Extravagant, and that, as ſuch, they had entertain'd him into their Company. Accordingly, to comply with his Uncle, he made this complement to <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> 
                           <q>Moſt honourable Knight of the Marigold, I ſhall receive your acquaintance with as great ſatisfaction as I ſhould do that of the greateſt Monarch in the world, and think my ſelf infinitely oblig'd to you, that, being a perſon of ſuch extraordinary parts, you were pleas'd to honour the Marqueſs my Uncle, and my Couſin, with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58823:101"/>
your company ſo far out of your own territories. In acknowledgement of that noble favour, be pleas'd to accept the proffer I make to you of ever being your moſt affectionate and moſt humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, than which I cannot expect a higher relation to you, when I conſider the character my Uncle hath been pleas'd to give you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> return'd him his moſt humble thanks, and ſaid to him, <q>I have ſo high an eſteem for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this fair Lady is concern'd in, that I ſhall make it my buſineſs to ſacrifice all you think moſt excellent in me to her ſatisfaction and yours, as long as it ſhall pleaſe his Excellency to give me leave to be of his retinue. </q>
                           <q>How, <hi>replies Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> may we expect that further happineſs as to enjoy your company for ſome time? </q>
                           <q>I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you have to be ſo glad of it, replies the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, for you are to know, that <hi>Don Pedro Gil</hi> is fallen deeply in love with your Couſin, and that it is his affection hath occaſion'd this acquaintance, though he hath aſſur'd me, that, ſince he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſhe was deſign'd for you, that Love is turn'd into a pure fraternal friendſhip, and under that innocent paſſion he endeavours to oblige her what lies in his power. </q>
                           <q>Be pleas'd to take my further aſſurance of it, ſays <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that no thought of that may break your reſt; for that conſideration laid aſide, I ſhould think my ſelf capable to raiſe a jealouſie even in <hi>Narciſſus</hi> himſelf, were he now alive: for I dare, without any vanity, affirm it, that there is not a perſon in the world may be compar'd to me either as to gracefulneſs of body; or accompliſhments of mind.</q>
                           <q> I am ſufficiently
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58823:101"/>
convinc'd of the truth of what you ſay, ſays <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poldus,</hi> though I have not known you long: and therefore wholly relying on the promiſe you make me, I ſhall fear nothing as to your pretenſions, which were they any other Man's, I ſhould not be guilty of ſo great an indifference.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe diſcourſes, they got to the Court, and the Ambaſſadour being alighted at his Houſe, he there found many Ladies, impatiently expecting the arrival of the fair Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was receiv'd out of her Litter into the arms of her deſign'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whereat <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could do no leſs than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a little jealouſie. <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> to begin the demonſtrations of his Love, had prepar'd a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Supper, to which were invited all thoſe, of both Sexes, who were come thither to receive the Ambaſſadour and his Daughter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went to Bed preſently after Supper, extreamly troubled in mind, that he had engag'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an enterprize, wherein he found ſo great difficulties. He could not imagine any means to bring it about, ſo as that he might come off with credit; he met with too many Obſtacles, and what afflicted him moſt of all, was, the reſolution the Lady had taken to ſatisfie her Father's deſire, who was deſirous the marriage ſhould be concluded with <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> though he had been acquainted, as well as ſhe, with him miſ-carriages. <hi>Felician</hi> could not forbear grumbling at the reſolution of his Maſter, which muſt have ended amidſt thoſe difficulties. He expos'd himſelf as an Extravagant perſon in a Court where he might have rais'd himſelf into eſteem, and out of a hope not likely to be brought to any effect,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:58823:102"/>
he ran himſelf daily into new inconveniences. The Maſter and Servant ſpent ſome part of the night in diſcourſing about the buſineſs, till at laſt <hi>Don Pedro</hi> fell aſleep, with a reſolution to diſcover himſelf to his Miſtreſs, and, if his addreſſes were not well entertain'd by her, to return immediately into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The viſits of the Cavaliers and Ladies, continu'd ſix days, during which time the Marqueſs and his Daughter were often ſeen, both of them taking much pleaſure in the pleaſant demeanour of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who acted the part he had undertaken ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well, that his Extravagancies became the diſcourſe of the whole Court, all ſpeaking of him as one of the moſt humorous Fools that had come upon the Stage of a long time; inſomuch that ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd the Ambaſſadour to bring him to the Palace, aſſuring him the King would be much pleas'd with his behaviour. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> coming to hear of it, ſeem'd to be very angry, and excus'd himſelf, out of a fear his Majeſty might not entertain him, ſuitably to his quality and extraction; that he would not run the hazard of receiving an affront, and that the leaſt diſ-reſpect ſhewn him would force him to violent reſentments thereof. The Ambaſſadour preſs'd him no further, leſt he might put him out of humour, perceiving he lik'd not the propoſal, and put it off to ſome other time, when haply he might find him more inclin'd to compliance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> who was alſo Lodg'd in the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour's houſe, had onely two Servants to wait on him, whom he truſted with the knowledge of all his Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures. It happen'd that both theſe fell Sick
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:58823:102"/>
at the ſame time, a time when he ſhould have ſhewn more reſerv'dneſs in his Amours, to raiſe himſelf into a better eſteem with his Miſtreſs; but he, on the contrary, minded his own enjoyments above all things, and never conſidering the preſent poſture of his affairs, he continu'd his Night-viſits, as he was wont to do before her arrival. Being thus diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their attendance, who were beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his humours, he conceiv'd he could not pitch on a fitter perſon to accompany him than <hi>Felician,</hi> who, with the leave of his Maſter <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> went along with him. Finding him a ſubtle fellow, and experienc'd in ſuch affairs, he thought him a perſon fit for his purpoſe, and accordingly that he might truſt him with any thing. He took him along with him three or four nights together to a certain Houſe, out of which he came at a very unſeaſonable hour. Though <hi>Felician</hi> went in with him, yet durſt he not be ſo impertinently inquiſitive, as to ask who was the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, till the third or fourth night that he had accompany'd him thither; and then being alone with a Servant-maid (who taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by her Miſtreſs began to expreſs ſome kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards <hi>Felician)</hi> he ask'd her whoſe Houſe that was, and to whom <hi>Leopoldus</hi> made his Viſits. Love and Secrecy are ſeldome found in the ſame Lodging. She was a Servant, and in love with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lician;</hi> there needs no more be ſaid, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ppear, that ſhe ſatisfy'd him in whatever he deſir'd to know. <hi>Felician</hi> underſtood from her, that that Houſe belong'd to his Maſter's Aunt, and that his own Siſter was the Perſon whom <hi>Leopoldus</hi> had at rack and manger, upon a promiſe of Marriage ſhe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58823:103"/>
had gotten from him a little before under his hand, ſhe, by reaſon of her retiredneſs, being innocently ignorant of the treaty of marriage between him and his Couſin the Lady <hi>Margaret.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Felician,</hi> having pump'd out all theſe particulars, fail'd not to give his Maſter an account thereof the next day. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was extreamly ſurpris'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; not without indignation againſt his Siſter, though that procedure of <hi>Leopold</hi> rais'd him into ſome hope of effecting his deſign, preſuming the more upon it, in that being equal, as to birth, to <hi>Leopold,</hi> he was reſolv'd ne ſhould never marry any other, than her whom he had ſo highly diſhonour'd. He thereupon commanded <hi>Felician</hi> to acquaint the Maid who had made thoſe diſcoveries to him, that the marriage of <hi>Leopoldus</hi> and his Couſin was agreed upon, and that a Meſſenger was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Diſpenſation, not forgetting the rare accompliſhmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s of the Lady <hi>Margaret;</hi> to the end ſhe might acquaint his Siſter therewith, to ſee what courſe ſhe would take, and how ſhe would remedy the affront intended her. He punctually executed the orders he had receiv'd from <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſo that the night following <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> (ſo was <hi>Don Pedro's</hi> Siſter called) was acquainted with the whole buſineſs. She thereupon had a great conteſtation with <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> who impudently deny'd that he had any thing to do, as to marriage with his Couſin. In fine having done all he could to vindicate himſelf, and appeaſe <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> ſhe pretended to be ſatisfy'd with him, provided he more fully juſtify'd his innocence the next morning. So ſhe diſmiſs'd <hi>Leopold,</hi> who went away well ſatisfy'd, imagining her to be ſo too: but reſolving with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58823:103"/>
not to give her any viſit a while, he pretended ſome indiſpoſition. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> underſtood that night from <hi>Felician</hi> all that had paſs'd between <hi>Don Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi> and his Siſter, and was extremely incens'd againſt her that ſhe had given credit to the deceitful words of a perfidious man. However he thought fit to let paſs two days, to ſee what courſe his Siſter would take in that time, commanding <hi>Felician</hi> to proſecute his diſcoveries.</p>
                        <p>The next day, <hi>Don Leopold</hi> not coming to clear himſelf, as he had promis'd, <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> was ſo enrag'd, that ſhe would ſtay no longer, but reſolv'd to be ſatisfi'd from the mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ambaſſador, of the affront intended to be done her. She took a Coach, and veiling her face, came to his houſe, but at ſuch an unfortunate time, that ſhe met <hi>Don Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi> at the door, who, diſcovering who ſhe was, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently imagin'd what might occaſion that viſit, and that her coming thither was to acquaint the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador how he was engag'd to her, and to ſhew him the promiſe of marriage. <hi>Don Leopold</hi> receiv'd her with extraordinary kindneſs, which ſhe taking other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he expected, added the more to his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. He told her, he had ſomething particular to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with, and entreated her to go along with him to a room at ſome diſtance from his Uncle's lodgings. <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> would not be perſuaded a good while to give him that ſatisfaction, telling him, that ſhe muſt firſt ſpeak with the Ambaſſador, and that afterwards he ſhould talk with her as long as he pleas'd. That <hi>Don Leopold</hi> endeavour'd to prevent, aſſuring her, that he was at that time very buſie, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a Pacquet of Letters he had receiv'd from
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58823:104"/>
the Emperor. He was ſo importunate with her, that ſhe would hear him before ſhe ſpoke with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, that at laſt he prevail'd. Whereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting her to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s chamber, he entreated him to keep her company, till he came back to ſpeak with her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> having her face veil'd all this time, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> knew her not, but by the diſcoveries he had receiv'd, he ſuſpected her to be his Siſter. On the other ſide, he was ſo transform'd by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of his cloaths, and, what added much to his diſguiſe, his perpetual wearing of Spectacles, that ſhe could not have the leaſt imagination of his being her Brother. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> kept her company a while, without enquiring into the occaſion of her coming thither, and at laſt, leaving her lock'd up in the room, he went to look for <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> to know how he would have him diſpoſe of her. He was then buſie with his Uncle, ſent one to deſire <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain that Lady a while, with this excuſe, that, as ſoon as he could, he would come and diſpatch her. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> returning to his Chamber, immediately lock'd the door.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that her Couſin had ſpoken to a Woman with her face veil'd, in one of the walks leading to the Ambaſſador's houſe, and deſit'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her to his chamber. The jealouſie ſhe conceiv'd thereat rais'd in her a deſire to know who ſhe might be, which ſhe might eaſily diſcover, by reaſon there was a paſſage from her lodgings to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s chamber, and at the end of it a door, whereof ſhe had the key. She open'd it very ſoftly, leſt ſhe might be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58823:104"/>
perceiv'd, and that juſt as <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> coming into the room, found his Siſter with her face unveil'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be ſeen onely by <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> whom onely ſhe ſtaid for. As ſoon as he had taken a ſleight view of her, he made this diſcourſe to her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Ungracious and unhappy woman, unworthy the Houſe out of which thou art deſcended, and that I ſhould call thee my Siſter! Is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt be guilty of ſo ſtrange an oblivion of thy ſelf, as, relying on the vain promiſes of a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſon, to come into this houſe to ſeek him who hath abus'd thee, and to whom thou haſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently proſtituted thy ſelf? Comeſt thou to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune a man that hath forgotten thee, and to court him who hath ſo palpably deceiv'd thee? If, beſotted with a fond love, it be thy deſign to be married to him, thou haſt friends to whom thou might'ſt have communicated thy deſires, rather than have abandon'd thy ſelf to a man who treats thee with ſo much contempt, and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his careſſes, laughs at thee in his ſleeve. He is upon the point of marriage with his Couſin; art thou ſo ſimple, as that thou onely ſhouldſt be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what is known all over the Court? Had I not a reſpect for the place where thou art, this ſword ſhould diſpatch thy criminal Soul into the other world, that thou might'ſt be an example to all ſuch ſimple Gulls as thou art. Haſt thou ſo far forgotten the reſpect due to thy Aunt as to profane her houſe, by aſſigning <hi>Leopold</hi> his nocturnal meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in it? Thou ſhouldſt have bethought thy ſelf who thou art, that he is of no better Houſe than thy ſelf, and that thy quality is as high as his. 'Tis
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58823:105"/>
a great happineſs to thee, that an humour took me to come into this Court, though thou ſeeſt me in this ridiculous habit, to prevent, what lies in my power, <hi>Leopold</hi>'s further abuſe of thee; which I will do with the hazard of my life. Tell me, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous woman, what hath paſs'd between you, that I may take ſome courſe therein, and diſſemble not the truth in any thing, for it concerns thee no leſs than honour and life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The diſconſolate <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> heard this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with her eyes faſtned on the ground and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with tears, without giving him the leaſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: but at laſt, to obey her Brother, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation ſhe ſaw juſtly grounded, ſhe told him, in few words, how <hi>Leopold</hi> had ſeen her at a certain publick meeting, that he lik'd her, and, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd out her lodgings, he had ſent her ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that having continu'd his addreſſes to her with great demonſtrations of affection, ſhe had granted him entrance into the houſe, and that upon a promiſe of marriage under his hand (which ſhe had about her) ſhe had permitted him to diſpoſe of her as he pleas'd. In fine, ſhe gave him a particular account of all that had happened between them; whereupon he, to add no more to her affliction, put her in ſome hope, that <hi>Leopold</hi> ſhould be forc'd to perform the promiſe he had made her.</p>
                        <p>The fair Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> had heard all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, at the door which was between her lodgings and <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s chamber, extremely aſtoniſh'd how a perſon of quality (ſuch as ſhe found <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to be by his diſcourſe) and one of ſuch an excellent wit, could put on a Fool's coat, and behave himſelf as an
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58823:105"/>
extravagant in their houſe, and all about the Court. She was ignorant of the cauſes of that ſtrange Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis, and yet ſhe had a certain ſuſpicion, that it might be upon her account. On the other ſide, ſhe reflected on the double treachery of her Couſin <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> in treating of a marriage with her, having given a promiſe of the ſame thing to another, and that a perſon ſo highly qualifi'd as <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> ſeem'd to be.</p>
                        <p>Being fully ſatisfi'd as to thoſe two things, ſhe would not ſtand to hear them any longer, but ruſh'd into the room ſo of a ſudden, as that ſhe had not the time to put any thing over her face, nor he, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his indignation. Seeing her coming towards them, <q>Ah Madam, ſaid he to her, what mean theſe Ambuſhes? What's your deſign therein, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princeſs of my Soul, and abſolute Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs of my inclinations? Do you uſe ſuch a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery againſt thoſe who could not ſo much as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you guilty of any ſuch thing? I wiſh ſo great a Beauty would not give me any more ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, for another ſurpriſe of this nature would make me die out of pure joy, as it hath been the fortune of others to die out of an exceſs of grief. </q>
                           <q>There is no diſſembling any longer, <hi>replies the Lady,</hi> for I am fully aſſur'd that you are not the perſon you ſeem to us to be, and that the affliction you are in requires rather ſecret and real reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than perſonated extravagancies. My curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity heightned by a little jealouſie, procur'd me the diſcovery of more than you imagine; I have found the perfidiouſneſs of my Couſin <hi>Don Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi> greater towards me than I could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:58823:106"/>
conſidering his pretended kindneſſes. I would fain be deliver'd out of the confuſion I am in, and I earneſtly intreat you to reſolve me this riddle, for its obſcurity perplexes me very much: but before you take that trouble upon you, give me leave to carry this Lady your Siſter to my lodgings, and if my Couſin comes in the mean time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her, you may tell him, that ſhe went away much diſpleas'd at his long ſtay, and leave the reſt to me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having ſo ſaid, ſhe took <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> along with her, aſſuring her ſhe would do all lay in her power to ſerve her, which put her in hope of a better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in her affairs, than ſhe could have deriv'd from either her Brother's indignation or <hi>Leopold</hi>'s trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> left <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> among her Women, and returns to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who though at firſt ſupriz'd at the ſight of her, and the thought of her having over-heard the infamy of his Siſter; yet was he withal glad of it, ſince her jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and curioſity had diſcover'd his transformation, and the unhandſome carriage of her Couſin. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> therefore was very glad to ſee his Miſtreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, as might be ſeen by the chearfulneſs of his countenance. She deſir'd him to take a chair, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like her ſelf, ſhe open'd her mind to him in theſe words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>I have been in an extraordinary confuſion for ſome days paſt, and ſo incens'd againſt my Couſin <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> to ſee the ſtrangeneſs of his behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, that I come to receive your advice how far I ought to reſent it, and withal to be ſatisfi'd in ſome things, whereof I muſt yet acknowledge
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:58823:106"/>
my ſelf ignorant. One is, and that much raiſes my wonder, to ſee you counterfeiting the Fool and Extravagant, in a Court, where you might rather act the part of a perſon of Honour and Gallantry, as having the advantage of being Brother to ſo fair a Lady as <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> who, beſides the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of beauty, ſeems to be Miſtreſs of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other good qualities. You may infer from my diſcourſe, that being of the quality I ſuppoſe you to be, you diſhonour your ſelf in repreſenting the Natural and ridiculous perſon, as well in regard of the habit you have aſſum'd, as the extravagant actions wherewith you amuſe the world. Which ſince I cannot imagine you would do but that there muſt be ſome great myſtery in it, I am the more deſirous to know your motives thereto, in that I conceive it will be a means to clear my mind of certain doubts which now lie ſomewhat heavy upon it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having deliver'd this with the beſt grace in the world, the fair Lady was ſilent, and left <hi>Don Pedro</hi> the liberty to make her this reply. <q>If you find me at any loſs, Madam, in ſatisfying your deſires as to this particular, I queſtion not but you will have the goodneſs to attribute it, to that diſtraction poor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are ſubject to, when they addreſs themſelves to the objects of their vows and adorations. You cannot be ignorant, (though you knew it not by experience) that Love is a powerful Divinity, to whom men ſacrifice all things; no impoſtures but he invents; no intrigues but he is author of; no difficulties but he overcomes, to compaſs his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. This premis'd, I am in the next place freely
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58823:107"/>
to acknowledge, that the day you paſs'd through <hi>Ville-Franche,</hi> which is the place of my birth, I found my ſelf wounded by the lightning of your fair eyes. I did all lay in my power to oppoſe that paſſion; but it ſtill prov'd predominant, and the engagement I knew there was between you and your Couſin <hi>Don Leopold</hi> could not abate ought thereof. Nay though I knew all the particulars of that engagement, wherein you rather compli'd with the commands of a Father then your own inclinations, inaſmuch as you look'd on that too happy Kinſman, as a fickle perſon, unworthy your affection, a truth I have ſince heard confirm'd by your ſelf; nay though I ſaw the marriage in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner concluded, yet all could not break the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I had taken to diſguiſe my ſelf as you have ſeen to traverſe it, and fortune now ſeems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my deſignes. I am not therefore, Madam, to repent me of the ſlurre I may have put upon my Bloud and the noble Houſe from which I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, in acting the Fool's part in yours, into which it was my buſineſs to introduce my ſelf by all means imaginable, ſince the impoſture hath prov'd ſo fortunate, and that I begin to conceive ſome hope of attaining my deſires. You know, Madam, that I durſt not have preſum'd to make you a real diſcovery of my ſelf; for beſides that I ſhould run the hazard of not finding credit with you, I came in at a time when your marriage was in too great forwardneſs to be eaſily croſs'd by after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications. In fine, it was Heaven's pleaſure, that a ſtrange conjunction of my Siſter's misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and your own juſt jealouſies, ſhould give you
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:58823:107"/>
a diſcovery of what, haply, I ſhould yet a while have kept from your knowledge. My true name is <hi>Don Pedro d' Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> and conſequently I may affirm my ſelf to be of the moſt eminent Families of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince I am deſcended from the Seignors of <hi>Ville-Franche</hi> and <hi>Astorga.</hi> I have the honour to be Knight of the Order of <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> and I have acquir'd it by ſome years ſervices done his Majeſty in <hi>Flanders,</hi> with hopes, ere long, to be gratify'd with an advantageous Commandery. I have given you an account of my Quality, and have not conceal'd from you my preſumption. All I how now to Apologize for, is, my Love; and, I am the more confident of your pardon as to that, if you but ever ſo little conſider the unavoidable influence of your own attractions. Nay I cannot but account it a happy offence, ſince it hath prov'd the occaſion of your being undeceiv'd; and when I make a joynt reflection on my own happineſs, and my Siſter's credulity, I cannot repent me of a diſguiſe, whereof the ſatisfaction infinitely exceeds the ſhame. For it is in your power to reſtore me the honour I have depriv'd my ſelf of, onely for your ſake; and I ſhall force him, who hath ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joll'd my Siſter out of her Honour, to perform the promiſe he hath made her, or it ſhall coſt him his Life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fair Lady was raviſh'd to hear theſe words from her diſguis'd Lover, and thought her ſelf oblig'd to make an extraordinary return to ſo extraordinary a demonſtration of affection. And being now fully undeceiv'd as to the Sycophancy of her Couſin <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> ſhe made him this Anſwer. <q>Signor <hi>Don
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:58823:108"/>
Pedro,</hi> That you have, upon ſo ſlight a ground as the little beauty I can pretend to, engag'd your ſelf in an enterprize ſo prejudicial to your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and deſcent, I cannot but look on as a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent expreſſion of your Love; though I do not excuſe you as to this, that the noble accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments you are maſter of might no doubt have more happily and more worthily been otherwiſe employ'd. I have reſented, as I ought, the little reſpect my Couſin expreſs'd towards me, and therefore it is but juſt he ſhould not enjoy me, ſince it may be inferr'd from the forwardneſs of his matching with another, that he never truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it. It muſt needs be an extraordinary joy to me, that I am undeceiv'd before we were joyn'd by that Tye which onely Death can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. I am ſatisfy'd as to the little affection he had for me, and I do yours but juſtice, when I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that I ſhall be ſo far from forgetting it, that I ſhall endeavour all lies in my power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite it.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was deliver'd with ſo obliging an accent, that the amorous Cavalier would have caſt himſelf at her feet, would ſhe have permitted it. He return'd her his thanks with a thouſand ſubmiſſions for ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a favour, and the ſweet encouragement ſhe was pleas'd to give his Love. It was not now a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time to expatiate into Complements; <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> was left in the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Lodgings, whoſe return ſhe expected, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> look'd for <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> to enquire after the Lady he had recommended to his cuſtody. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> went to comfort her whom ſhe had left among her
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:58823:108"/>
Women, and to put in execution what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, between her and <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> About half an hour after her departure thence comes <hi>Don Leopold</hi> to his Chamber, to look after the Lady he had left there. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> told him, that he could ſtay her no longer, that ſhe was gone, thinking he would not have come to her again. <q>Nay then, I am glad I ſtaid ſo long, <hi>ſays Leopold,</hi> ſince my ſtay hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd her to do as I would have had her, which was that ſhe might be gone out of the houſe. This Woman plagues me extreamly, and it was no ſmall happineſs to me, that ſhe met not with my Uncle, for I ſhould have been much troubled had ſhe had any diſcourſe with him. </q>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ask'd him ſome odd queſtions, as he was wont to do, to ſift ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further out of him, but <hi>Don Leopold</hi> would diſcover no more. The other eaſily apprehended, by the little had fallen from him, what courſe he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take; and the indignation he conceiv'd at his ſlighting of his Siſter was ſo great, that it was not without much violence done himſelf, he forbore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to account for it.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> had viſited <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> of whom ſhe had receiv'd a punctual relation of her Loves, which were but too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to her by the promiſe of Marriage ſhe had brought with her. And after ſhe had entred into a ſecond admiration at the double perfidiouſneſs of her Couſin <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> ſhe ſent to deſire her Father to come to her, who being alone with her, ſhe made him this diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>It hath ever been a laudable cuſtom, that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould diſpoſe of their Daughters in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:58823:109"/>
as they either pleas'd themſelves, or found moſt convenient for their affairs, but with this caution, that it ſhould not be abſolutely done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their wills and inclinations. Many are yet willing to do ſo, out of a preſumption, that Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will change Men's humours: but it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome found to work that effect. Thoſe therefore may be ſaid to do well, who, referring the ſucceſs to the higher Powers, by an implicite obedience, comply with the diſpoſal of their Parents: but thoſe, in my judgement do better, who uſe ſome precaution, and endeavour to prevent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which they muſt otherwiſe fall into. I have ever been ready, Sir, to do whatever you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me, eſpecially in the buſineſs now in agitation, though I have found my Couſin <hi>Don Leopold</hi> to be of a diſpoſition ſo contrary to mine, that I promis'd my ſelf little ſatisfaction from our being joyned together in the inſeparable eſtate you intended. I have endeavour'd to obey you, though with ſome violence to my own inclinations, which directed my affection to other perſons not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him, either in quality or eſtate. I conſented to this Marriage becauſe you ſeem'd ſo much to deſire it. When it was fully concluded, there was a perſon ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for the Diſpenſation; and even during that time, when I expected my Couſin ſhould have expreſs'd moſt Love to me, I have found he hath done quite contrary, ſince he hath given a promiſe of Marriage to another Lady, whom you ſhall preſently ſee.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>She thereupon call'd for <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> whom ſhe had left in her own Chamber, and who immediately
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58823:109"/>
came before the Ambaſſadour. Having diſpos'd her into a Chair, the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> continu'd her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <q>This, Sir, is the Lady I ſpoke of, to whom my Couſin hath given a promiſe of Marriage under his hand, which ſhe now hath about her, and you ſhall ſee, how this perfidious perſon became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by maſter of her Honour. Coming hither to ſpeak with you, and complain of the affront intended her, ſhe met him, who, giving her fair wo ds, lock'd her into <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Chamber, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that you were buſie, and that it would be long ere you would be ſeen by her. Some little curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity occaſion'd my going to that door, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my Lodgings and his, and there I came to the knowledge of this buſineſs, having over-heard ſome part of their diſcourſe. I thought fit to bring this Lady to my Chamber, to give you further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſo preſſing a Truth. Her quality is great, ſince ſhe is of the Houſe of <hi>Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Toledo,</hi> two of the moſt illuſtrious Families of <hi>Spain:</hi> She is reſolv'd to make the caſe known to her Friends, who are very noble, and of great credit in this Court, that they may oppoſe my Marriage and prevent our common affront. I have hitherto obey'd you as a Father, I now appeal to you as my Judge, and I be ſeech you diſcharge me of ſo unjuſt an obedience for the future: for I am reſolv'd rather to confine my ſelf for the reſt of my days, in the moſt auſtere Monaſtery about this City, than ever be Wife to a Man ſo inſenſible of worth and honour.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambaſſadour was extreamly aſtoniſh'd at both what he ſaw, and what he had heard. He exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58823:110"/>
the promiſe made to <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> and found, that that diſcovery alone was ſufficient to prevent his Daughter's marriage with <hi>Leopold.</hi> He immediately reſolv'd to break all to pieces, and to diſmiſs his Nephew, that there might be no more talk of the buſineſs. He caus'd the Ladies to with-draw, and ſent for his Nephew, whom he ſhew'd the ſchedule he had made to <hi>Donna Blanca,</hi> asking him whether he knew the hand. He not a little troubled, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colour, began to deny it: but the Ambaſſadour told him, that as he could not do it ſincerely, ſo it would be very unhandſomely proffer'd, ſince the truth would be prov'd by ſeveral of his Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the ſame hand. At laſt <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> not without extream confuſion, acknowledg'd, that, blinded by Love, he had indeed made that promiſe, but he would loſe his Life ere he perform'd it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> having quitted his Fool's coat, and put on a very Rich ſuit, with the Croſs of <hi>Alcantara</hi> on the Caſſock, and the Cloak, heard this diſcourſe from a corner of the Room where he was diſpos'd, and not able to endure any longer: <q>Signor <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold, ſaid he coming up to him,</hi> have a better care what you ſay, and conſider her quality whom you injure. Her birth is at leaſt as noble as yours. She is my Siſter, and, as ſuch, I am oblig'd to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and protect her: if you perform not the promiſe you have made her, I wear a Sword by my ſide which ſhall force you to do it, if Honour will not. </q>
                           <q>I have already conſider'd what I am in duty oblig'd to, as to that point, <hi>replies Don Leopold,</hi> and no Man ſhall force me, by menaces, to do any thing againſt my will.</q> This ſo enrag'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
                           <pb n="211" facs="tcp:58823:110"/>
that he gave <hi>Don Leopold</hi> a challenge. The diſpute grew higher and higher, which oblig'd the Ladies to come in between them, and to give order the doors ſhould be ſhut, leſt they might get out to fight.</p>
                        <p>While theſe things paſs'd, the Ambaſſadour mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the perſon of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and imagin'd him ſome other perſon come thither after his Siſter: for, ſeeing him ſo well clad with the Croſs of <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> and without Spectacles, which he conſtantly wore, he knew him not: but having conſider'd him better, he found that he who challeng'd his Nephew was the ſame perſon, who, by his pleaſant extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, had found him ſo much ſport. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> perceiving her Father had his Eyes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd on him, with ſome aſtoniſhment, imagin'd the cauſe of it, and gave it a check in theſe words. <q>He, Sir, whom you ſee in a habit ſo different from that he was wont to wear, and who ſeem'd ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to you, is <hi>Don Pedro d'Oſorio</hi> and <hi>Toledo.</hi> When this diſpute is over, you ſhall know the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives oblig'd him to that diſguiſe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ambaſſadour was the more aſtoniſh'd at that, and would have preſs'd his Daughter to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of that ſecret, had he not ſeen the two Cavaliers, with Swords drawn, ready to make that Room the place of their Duel. He ran in between them, and endeavour'd by mildneſs to perſuade his Nephew, not to conteſt in a buſineſs, which was not to his advantage; that if he ſatisfy'd not the injur'd Cavalier, miſchief would follow; that he ſhould not rely on any protection he might hope from him, inaſmuch as ſeeing the little reaſon he had of his ſide, and the affront he intended that Lady, he ſhould
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:58823:111"/>
rather be againſt him, by aſſiſting his Adverſary, than countenance him in ſo unjuſt a buſineſs. That as to his Daughter, he might quit all hope of her, that he ſhould never be her Husband, and that it would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a great poorneſs of ſpirit in her, if ſhe had any thoughts of kindneſs for him, after ſhe had been ſo unworthily treated by him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Leopold,</hi> finding himſelf preſs'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches on all ſides, and withall hearkning to the advice of his Conſcience, thought it beſt, to follow his Uncle's counſel. He thereupon went with open arms to his true Wife, to whom he once more gave his hand as a Husband, and then embrac'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, whom he yet knew not. The Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> thought it a good opportunity, before the whole Company, to give her Father an accompt how <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had fallen in love with her, how he got into his Retinue in the quality of a Jeaſter; that ſhe conceiv'd her ſelf oblig'd to requite the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary demonſtration of his affection to her, by an exchange of hers to him, if her Father approved thereof. The old Gentleman had ſo much mettal left, as to admire the ſtrange conduct of Love in all its operations, and particularly, how it made the wiſeſt Men mad, and the Mad wiſe, making its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of extravagance it ſelf, to compaſs its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Without any further demurring, he gave his conſent, whereupon the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> took him by the hand, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was ſo happy, as, by odd and unlikely means, to ſee all his deſires accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd. The ſolemnities of both the Marriages were put off till eight days after; all the Grandees about the Court came to them. The Balls thereat,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:58823:111"/>
and the Tilting were extraordinary: but what more nearly touches the ſtory, is, that the King honour'd theſe two Cavaliers with great advantages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had alſo thoſe of a numerous iſſue, for which <hi>Don Leopold</hi> needed not much to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi'd him, being the moſt ſatisfi'd man in the world with his choice, whom he infinitely loved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made it appear, that the Inclinations of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, before they are united by Matrimony, though by ſome intervening occurrences ſomewhat remitted, may yet, by that ſacred Tie, be heightned into a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vigorous flame of perfect Love.</p>

            <p>THE Novel was lik'd and commended by all that heard it, nay <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely ſatisfi'd therewith. Brother <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who repos'd a very great confidence in her, was nothing troubled that ſhe ſhould over-hear the deſigns laid by him and his Camerades to ſearch thoſe places, where they had notice there was anybooty. <hi>Criſpin</hi> approved of ſome of the Robberies propos'd by them, and oppos'd others, for the inconveniences he found in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof: for they look'd on him as a perſon of great authority among them. His experience in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that kind was ſuch, that he aſſum'd the title of Director, or rather Dictator of that famous Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: inſomuch that not any one durſt contradict what he had once decreed. It was by this time grown very late, ſo that they would not make a Divident of what they had brought in that night, leaving it to be done at the next meeting, and committing it to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Hermit, who was their very faithful Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:58823:112"/>
               <hi>Crispin</hi>'s Companions being gone to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he thought it incivility for him to do the like ere he had made a viſit to <hi>Rufina,</hi> to wiſh her a good night's reſt. He found her a little more chearful than he had ever obſerv'd her before, whereat he was very glad. He ask'd her what ſhe thought of the Novel; ſhe told him, that ſhe thought it very pretty and full of diverſion, and that if ſhe might often hear the like, they would procure ſome abatement of her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. <q>Take a good heart, Madam, <hi>ſays the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to her,</hi> I hope you will here ſee an end of your affliction; we ſhall endeavour to find you all the divertiſement we can, and 'tis poſſible you may not repent your being among us, if you will but remit ſomething of your reſerv'dneſs, and lay aſide, as a thing extremely ſtrange in this place, ſome part of your modeſty. </q>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> thought it time to alleviate her ſeverities with ſome affability, and to quit her feigned grief. From that time, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to treat the Hypocrite with greater kindneſs, that ſhe might the better execute the deſign ſhe had to make a Novice of an old Projector. <hi>Criſpin</hi> went to bed, half laid aſleep with her favourable looks, and the hopes derived thence, that the Fort would within a ſhort time be reduc'd, ſince he had made his approaches ſo near, and taken off the Mask of his feign'd Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>The next morning at the very break of day, <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpin</hi>'s companions left the Hermitage, to ſeek out their livelihood, at their coſt, who leaſt miſtruſted them. The Hermit himſelf was ſoon after for his march into the City, to beg alms, where he was wont to receive any. He went to take his leave of <hi>Rufina,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:58823:112"/>
who deſir'd him to make very diligent enquiry for her Brother, giving him the marks of his face, perſon, and cloaths, much different from thoſe whereby <hi>Garay</hi> might have been found out. He lock'd the door on the out-ſide, and carried away the key with him, which <hi>Rufina</hi> was not much troubled at; for ſhe had brought with her from <hi>Corduba</hi> ſome of thoſe keys, which open all locks, an invention better than Picklocks, and ſome other devices, which ſhe had uſed at the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>'s. Thus was ſhe left all alone in the Hermitage, having before-hand appointed <hi>Garay</hi> to come to her as ſoon as Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> got to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laga;</hi> which he accordingly did, mounted on one of the two horſes he had brought with him. <hi>Rufina</hi> having heard him, open'd the door, and gave him a ſhort account what trade Brother <hi>Crispin</hi> drove, of his falling in love with her, and how there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſumme of mony in the Hermitage, brought thither the night before by his Camerades. <hi>Rufina</hi> had reſolv'd to carry away all the ready mony, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereto, ſhe ſent away <hi>Garay</hi> back to the City, to get ſome ſleeping-powders, to be adminiſtred to <hi>Crispin</hi> at his return, that ſo they might have the whole night to do their work in. <hi>Garay</hi> brought the powder's before <hi>Criſpin</hi> got home, for he ſpent the whole day in begging, and return'd not to the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage till towards night.</p>
            <p>Being got home, he was very kindly receiv'd by <hi>Rufina,</hi> whereat he was tranſported with joy, for he grew more and more in love with her. He ſhew'd her what he had gather'd that day, and beſides what had been voluntarily given him, he had very uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably taken, of his own accord, two ſilver ſpoons,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58823:113"/>
and a neck-lace of pearl. The neck-lace he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſented <hi>Rufina</hi> with, and put it about her neck, with a thouſand amorous complements. She gave him infinite thanks for his Preſent, after which they ſupp'd very merrily together, he ever and anon entertaining her with ſome diſcoveries of his love, whereto ſhe gave him very favourable Anſwers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing it ſhould not be long ere he had of her what he ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>It had been ordered among the Ferrets that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Hermitage, at the laſt Committee, that a general meeting ſhould be had there that night, as well for the diviſion of the former booty, as the making of new propoſals. <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who was not willing <hi>Rufina</hi> ſhould be ſeen, and expected ſome ſecret kindneſs of her, thought it concern'd him to prevent it. As ſoon as they were come together, he found out an evaſion to diſperſe them. He told them, that he had received notice from the City, that there was a ſtrict ſearch made for a perſon who had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly murther'd another; and inaſmuch as Sacred places were no Sanctuaries for ſuch cowardly Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he feared there would be ſome ſent to the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, and if it chanc'd any one of them ſhould be apprehended for ſome other crimes, he might be ſeiz'd and carried away priſoner, and afterwards, brought to the Torture, confeſs what he had not been charg'd with at his apprehenſion. Perſons of that profeſſion are commonly ſtartled at any thing; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they ſoon credited what their Director ſaid to them and left the Hermitage, adjourning the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to the fourth night after. By this means <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spin</hi> was left alone in the Hermitage, with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58823:113"/>
who had promis'd to give him ſatisfaction that night; whereat he was almoſt out of himſelf for joy, thinking he ſhould never ſee the hour, that ſhould give him the poſſeſſion of that Beauty.</p>
            <p>Soon after they went to ſupper, which was very magnificent, for <hi>Crispin</hi> had brought ſome, both wild and tame, fowl, ready for the ſpit, and a good large bottle of <hi>Malaga,</hi> which is the beſt of any wine in <hi>Spain. Rufina</hi> having plaid the cook, and made all things ready, they began both to eat very heartily, their minds disburthen'd of all care and trouble; healths were drunk, <hi>Rufina</hi> out-vying the Hermit at that exerciſe, and having the management of the bottle, ſhe took care that <hi>Crispin</hi> never drunk without the powder prepar'd for him. He drunk as liberally as the other fill'd, till at laſt, tumbling down under the table, he fell dead aſleep, inſomuch that <hi>Rufina,</hi> to try whether the potion had wrought its effect, pull'd him by the ears and noſe, to awake him, but it was to as little purpoſe as if ſhe had done it to a dead corps. With that aſſurance, ſhe went down into the Cellar, which was under ground, and out of certain cheſts ſhe found there, ſhe took all the mony ſhe met with, whereof there was no ſmall quantity. She diſpos'd it into bags, which ſhe ty'd with cords, and into long leather pouches, wherein the Thieves had brought it, they having robb'd a rich Drover who was going to <hi>Madrid.</hi> That done, <hi>Rufina</hi> comes out, and, by a ſignal, got <hi>Garay</hi> to her, who lay hard by perdue for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>They took all the ready mony they could find and put it on <hi>Garay</hi>'s Bay, and got up on the other horſe, and put forward towards <hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ga,</hi> extremely
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58823:114"/>
pleas'd that they had ſo eaſily trapann'd the ſubtileſt and moſt experienc'd Thief in <hi>Europe.</hi> They left ſome things behind them, which might have been well worth the conveyance thence; but it was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim of theirs, never to burthen themſelves with any thing that might be known or challeng'd. They ſoon got to <hi>Malaga,</hi> and took up their quarter's in <hi>Garay</hi>'s Inn, <hi>Rufina</hi> not being ſeen by the people of the houſe, that night nor the next day. She knew what night the Conclave of the Hermitage was to meet; but ere I tell you what courſe ſhe took, me-thinks I hear <hi>Crispin</hi> ſnoring, and calling to me, to give an account of him. He ſpent that night more innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he had done any one of a long time before, for, never ſtirring from the place where he had fallen aſleep after ſupper, it may be preſum'd he thought no hurt. By that time the Sun was got high enough to raiſe the flies from creeping to flying, he awoke, having not the leaſt apprehenſion of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him in the night. He call'd <hi>Rufina,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting himſelf ſo far, that by his exceſſive ſleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had miſs'd the opportunity he had ſo much wiſh'd for; but all his calling was to no purpoſe. He ſought her all about the houſe, in the Church, in the Cellar, and not finding her, he went out into the fields to look for her, thinking ſome ſtrange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent muſt needs happen to her, when he found all the doors lock'd. He made a ſecond ſearch for her, but finding the cheſts open'd, and the bags of white and yellow pieces diſlodg'd, he was convinc'd of his being robb'd, and that the poor innocent woman, frightned by the thieves, had made her eſcape, and lay lurking ſomewhere about the neighbouring fields,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58823:114"/>
inaſmuch as ſhe would not venture to go far in a dark night. He ſought after her till he grew weary, but ſhe was got far enough out of his reach. At laſt, hearing no account of her, it came into his mind that ſhe might be guilty of the robbery; which ſtruck him ſo to the heart that he was ready to hang himſelf, to think that ſo famous a Rogue, and one that had been, for ſo many years, the Dictator of a Crew of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, ſhould be ſo baſely trapann'd by a woman; and then he inferr'd that all ſhe had done was onely to bring him into the nooſe. However, he went that day, as he was wont to do, to <hi>Malaga,</hi> to try if he might find her in the City. He met <hi>Garay,</hi> but having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen him before, he was never the nearer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had ſet things in order for their departure to <hi>Caſteel;</hi> but ſhe would not go till ſhe had ſerv'd the hyppocritical Hermit ſuch a ſcurvy trick as that ſhe might never fear any requital from him. She knew the time of their meeting at the Hermitage, a place intended for other uſes than to be the Rendezvous of a pack of high-way-men and houſe-breakers. That they might be all found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to receive the chaſtiſement due for their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, ſhe writ a Letter to one of the Magiſtrates, acquainting him with the time, when, and the place where he ſhould find the Malefactors, and how they might be taken. That done, <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Rufina</hi> took their way for <hi>Toledo,</hi> towards which place, we ſhall leave them on their way, to give an account what was done upon the Letter. As ſoon as it was night, the Magiſtrate, attended by ſome of his men, went to the Hermitage, beſieg'd it, and got in. He found in the firſt place <hi>Crispin,</hi> little thinking to receive
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58823:115"/>
ſuch a viſit: yet was it ſeaſonable as to the preſent ſecuring of his life; for they were beginning to ſquabble about the mony loſt, and the others charg'd <hi>Crispin</hi> with treachery, and 'tis likely he had had the worſe among them, being but one to three. Having ſecur'd him, they ſearch'd the whole houſe, and at laſt, went into the Cellar, where they found his Companions, as alſo ladders of cords, pick-locks, iron-crows, and all the other engines fit for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their profeſſion. They alſo ſearch'd the cheſts, in which they found ſeveral pieces of Plate, and other things of value, undeniable demonſtrations of the devout exerciſes of that vertuous company. They were all taken and brought away Priſoners. <hi>Crispin</hi> himſelf was ſo much at a loſs, that he knew not what Anſwer to make to what was ask'd him. Whereupon one of the Officers made him this comfortable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: <q>Ungracious and unfortunate man, vile Hypocrite, who, cover'd with the cloak of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, doſt commit ſuch robberies! How will the world be ſurpriz'd to find it ſelf ſo miſtaken in thee? How will others, who have entred into that holy profeſſion of renouncing the world and its enjoyments, ſuffer in the reſpects of men, when the infamous Hiſtory of thy life comes to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd? Were not the charities beſtow'd on thee every day by ſo many good people, ſufficient for thy competent ſubſiſtance, that thou might'ſt ſpend thy time comfortably in a place ſo holy and ſo convenient for the ſerving of God as this is, but thou muſt give thy ſelf over to the baſeſt and moſt diſgraceful employment in the world? Thou art now fallen into my hands, and I promiſe thee, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:58823:115"/>
neither thou, nor thy companions, ſhall get out of them, till you are to be honourably conducted to the Gallows or ſome worſe place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With theſe juſt reproaches, he carried them away to the City, where they were condemn'd to die, all the others having, upon the Rack, confeſſed ſeveral crimes, charging <hi>Crispin</hi> to have been the man, who gave them intelligence of the robberies, that were to be committed, and many times open'd the door for the better execution thereof. As for his part, he expreſs'd ſo much courage and reſolution in the midſt of his torments, that he obſtinately deni'd whatever was laid to his charge. Yet could not all prevent the paſſing of the ſentence upon him, but the execution of it was a little delai'd, as to him, by reaſon of his falling into a violent Feaver in the priſon: but his companions were all truſs'd out of the way. Not long after, <hi>Crispin</hi> being, upon his recovery, to follow them, went out of the priſon, at noon-day, in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cloaths, not without the great aſtoniſhment of all the world, who expected to ſee his Exit hence, and to the greater affliction of the Jayler, who was conceiv'd to have been corrupted with mony, and to have ſet him at liberty. But he clear'd himſelf, by producing the perſon who had furniſh'd him with the cloaths, wherewith he had diſguis'd himſelf, who was condemn'd to ſpend the remainder of his life, though he liv'd ninety-nine years, in the Gallies.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ufina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> were by this time gotten to the Imperial City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had reſolv'd to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To give the greater credit to her reputation, ſhe pretended that <hi>Garay</hi> was her Father, and took a very fair Houſe in the moſt eminent quarter of the City; her train conſiſting of a Slave ſhe had bought at <hi>Malaga,</hi> a waiting Gentlewoman, a Lackquey, and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-uſher, ſhe had taken up at <hi>Toledo.</hi> She put on the habit of a Widdow, and <hi>Garay,</hi> very handſomely clad for a perſon of his Age, went under the name
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58823:116"/>
of <hi>Don Jeronimo,</hi> and ſhe under that of <hi>Donna Emerentiana,</hi> their Surname <hi>de Menezez,</hi> aſſuming their deſcent from the illuſtrious Family of thoſe, who, under that name, are ſo well known in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.</hi> She bought Houſhold-ſtuff ſuitable to the condition of a Widdow of Quality, and accordingly ſhe was viſited by the chiefeſt Ladies of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who were extreamly ſatisfy'd, as well with the charms of her beauty as thoſe of her converſation, inſomuch that they accounted themſelves very happy in her Neighbour-hood. She ſoon became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many of her own Sex, who took for Gold all that Gliſter'd in that ſubtle Woman. Going every day to hear Maſs in the great Church, it could not be long ere ſhe was obſerv'd by ſome of the young <hi>Gallantillos</hi> of the City, who, having diſpatch'd their Devotions, ſpend ſome time in contemplations of the Ladies who may be preſent. Accordingly, ſhe being noted to be one newly come to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and withall very handſome, there wanted not thoſe who began to Languiſh for her, and make their Addreſſes to her.</p>
            <p>While ſhe is informing her ſelf who were the richeſt and likely to have moſt ready Money, that ſhe might not, for want of practice, forget her old Trade. We ſhall leave her taking her meaſures, and her new Gallants preparing for their amorous adventures, and take a turn to <hi>Malaga,</hi> to ſee what became of <hi>Crispin,</hi> after he had ſo cleaverly got out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Finding himſelf once more at liberty, he left <hi>Malaga,</hi> and got into a Wood, not far from the City, where he continu'd till Night, and then he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58823:117"/>
went to the Hermitage, where he had Liv'd many years in the reputation of a good Chriſtian, and a perſon of a very exemplary Life. As ſoon as he was convicted of the crimes laid to his charge, there was put into his place a very Religious man, who went about to ſeveral Churches, begging alms, to build a little Hoſpital there. He was not as yet fully ſetled in the Hermitage, the place being not yet furniſh'd. <hi>Crispin</hi> got thither in the night, and oppoſite to the South-ſide of it found a place, where he had laid up ſomewhat againſt a Rainy day. Breaking up the ground with a Hoe he had left in the Wood, he came at laſt to a little Earthen pot, wherein was a Bagg, and in that all the Money he had reſerv'd, of all the Robberies he had been engag'd in; for he ever had two ſhares of the Booty, for his two Offices of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and Concealer, of the good Company which frequented the Hermitage.</p>
            <p>With that Summ, which might amount to five or ſix hundred pounds ſterling, all in Gold, he went to the City of <hi>Jaën,</hi> where he had a friend of the ſame profeſſion. This friend of his had heard of his eſcape out of Priſon, whereat he had been not a little troubled, inaſmuch as he might have made ſome commemoration of his Camerade upon the Rack, with whom he had been engag'd in ſeveral Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries. He was very glad to ſee <hi>Crispin</hi> at liberty, in hopes of his direction and aſſiſtance in ſome new enterpriſes. <hi>Crispin</hi> was but poorly accoutred, as having been uncas'd of the Hermit's habit, which he had ſhewn himſelf unworthy of; but the Bagg he had ſo well Lin'd was a ſoveraign remedy againſt Nakedneſs. He gave his companion Money to buy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58823:117"/>
him a Light-colour'd ſuit, and having taken off his long Beard, he put on a Periwig, which, with a Sword by his ſide, diſguis'd him ſo that he ſeem'd to be quite another Man, and not to be eaſily known even by thoſe who had been particularly acquainted with him. In that Equipage he continu'd ſome time at <hi>Jaen,</hi> till there happen'd an opportunity to commit a conſiderable Robbery at <hi>Andujar,</hi> which was very faithfully divided between him and his companion. But fearing the perſon who had been Robb'd would make a diligent ſearch after them, <hi>Crispin</hi> thought it their beſt courſe to be gone thence in time, the adventure at <hi>Malaga</hi> being ſtill freſh in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>They took into their company a third perſon, whom they met with by chance, a young Man, born and bred in the City of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and they came to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had never been but as they travell'd through it. The new Camerade they had taken in, was call'd <hi>Jaimo,</hi> a poor Rope-maker's Son of <hi>Valentia,</hi> who, for ſome roguiſh exploits he had done there, which brought him ſome Money, had been oblig'd to abſent himſelf thence for ſome years. He was a handſome, fair-hair'd, ſprightly young Man, and beſides the accompliſhments of his perſon, he had an excellent Wit, and was not inferiour, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, to either <hi>Crispin</hi> or his Camerade.</p>
            <p>This young <hi>Adonis</hi> went very Gallantly, upon their charges who either were ignorant or mindleſs of the old Proverb, <hi>Fast bind, fast find.</hi> He had the art to transform into the current Mode all the Cloaths he got by ſlight of hand, and ſo diſguis'd them by changing the Laces and Trimming, that the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58823:118"/>
very Owners could not have known them. On a certain Feſtival day, he put on a very Rich ſuit, and went along with <hi>Criſpin</hi> to Maſs, in the great Church, and into the ſame Chappel, where <hi>Rufina</hi> was at her Devotions, under the name of <hi>Donna Emerentiana.</hi> Though, as I told you, ſhe was in a Widdow's habit, <hi>Criſpin</hi> knew her at the firſt bluſh, and was not a little glad to ſee her. He kept himſelf from her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for fear of being diſcover'd, though there was no great fear of it, as he was then accoutred. He ſhew'd <hi>Rufina</hi> to his Camerade <hi>Don Jaimo,</hi> who was infinitely taken with her; and having deſir'd him to dogg her, ſo as ſhe might not perceive it, he did it ſo cunningly, that he kept his Eye on her, though ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to look another way, till he ſaw her go into her Houſe. He was very glad to hear by the Neighbours, that ſhe Liv'd there, and that in great Reputation, under the name of <hi>Donna Emerentiana de Menezez,</hi> lately come from <hi>Badajos,</hi> with her Father, to live at <hi>Toledo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crispin</hi> had a devilliſh pique againſt her, for the ſcurvy trick ſhe had ſhewn him at <hi>Malaga,</hi> and heartily ſwore, that ſince he had ſo fortunately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd her, he would not leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> ere he had call'd her to an accompt for the Money ſhe had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away from the Hermitage, together with the intereſt, and all the charges of his Impriſonment. To compaſs his deſign, he inſtructed <hi>Jaimo</hi> what he had to do, and whom he ſhould repreſent, without making a real diſcovery of himſelf to her. It was not long ere an opportunity offer'd it ſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the deſign they had agreed upon. One even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about an hour before night, there chanc'd to be a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:58823:118"/>
quarrel in the Street, where <hi>Rufina</hi> liv'd, wherein there were two Men wounded. The Officers of Juſtice preſently came in, and carried the wounded to their Houſes to be dreſs'd, and ſecur'd ſome others that happen'd to be then in the ſtreet, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing engag'd in the quarrel; which occaſion'd others to run for't, it being no great pleaſure to come into trouble and reſtraint for another Man's crime.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crispin</hi>'s plot took its riſe from that Quarrel. <hi>Jaimo,</hi> inſtructed by that ſubtle Hypocrite what he had to do, had taken the Croſs of Knight of the Order of <hi>Monteſa,</hi> an honour beſtow'd by the King onely on the natural Inhabitants of the Kingdome of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and to that purpoſe he had gotten a very light handſome black ſuit made him. In this Equipage, being come to <hi>Rufina</hi>'s houſe, and having given his Cloak to <hi>Criſpin,</hi> he drew his Sword, and went in, acting the part of a Man much aſtoniſh'd. Finding the door which led up ſtairs open, he goes up, and came into the room where the jovial Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was with her Maids. They were a little ſtartled to ſee a Man coming in to them with his Sword drawn, without a Cloak, and in a manner frightned out of his Wits. <hi>Rufina</hi> roſe from the place where ſhe was ſate, and found the Impoſtor in the poſture of a ſuppliant, addreſſing himſelf to her in theſe words. <q>If compaſſion be not at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from ſo beautiful a countenance, be pleas'd, Madam, to let your Houſe be my Sanctuary againſt the Officers of Juſtice by whom I am purſu'd. That I have Kill'd a man, I muſt acknowledge, but it was in my own defence, in this ſtreet, where
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:58823:119"/>
he had ſet upon me with advantage. The Officers perſuing me at the heels, I had infallibly been taken, had I not very courageouſly made my party good, by laying two of the moſt forward with their Bellies to the Sun, who with the Commiſſary had me in a manner by the Collar. I eſcap'd from the reſt, by the pure activity of my Leggs; for it is prudence for a Man to give way to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, whom he is oblig'd to reſpect. But they perſiſting ſtill in the purſuit, I found your Houſe open for my ſafety, and I have taken the boldneſs, ſhutting the door after me, to come up into your Chamber. I therefore moſt humbly beſeech you Madam, if it may be done without your incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, that you would diſpoſe me into ſome ſecret corner of your Houſe, till the people now in the ſtreet be diſpers'd, and that I may ſafely go hence. But if my preſumption puts you to any diſtraction, or give you any trouble, you need onely give me the leaſt ſignal, and I will immediately go out into the Street, though I were ſure to leave my Life in it, as chooſing rather the horrours of Impriſonment, than to be over-importunate to ſo fair a Lady.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We have already given a deſcription of this fine Orator. <hi>Rufina</hi> look'd very earneſtly upon him; and ſhe who never had lov'd any thing comparably to Money, immediately found her ſelf ſuſceptible of an inclination towards that young Man, who ſeem'd to her as eloquent as ſhe had thought him handſome. Whereupon ſhe return'd him this Anſwer. <q>You have done me but juſtice, Sir, when you thought me ſenſible of honour and compaſſion; perſons
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58823:119"/>
of my condition are never deſtitute thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as you are. I preſume, by what I ſee of you, that you are a perſon of Quality; and therefore ſympathizing with your affliction, I heartily proffer you my Houſe, to continue in it as long as you ſhall think fit, to avoid the purſuit of thoſe who look after you: for it were not juſt you ſhould fall into their hands, ſince, by my means you may be ſecur'd from ſo great a danger. Fear not any thing here; for though the Officers ſhould come into the Houſe, I ſhall put you into ſo ſecret a place, that they ſhall never find you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young Spark gave her a thouſand thanks for ſo ſignal a favour, which oblig'd her to make him this further diſcourſe. <q>You very well know, Sir, by the habit I am in, with what reſerv'dneſs I ought to live in my Houſe, and yet I freely proffer you the ſecurity you promiſe your ſelf in it, till you have accommodated your affairs. But I have a Father, now from home, who will expect an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of my demeanour: and if, at his arrival, which it may be will be this day, he will entertain you with a Room in his Lodgings, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he will think it an honour, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. </q>The young Gallant renew'd his thanks to her, for that continuance of her kindneſſes, and he expreſs'd himſelf ſo gentilly, that ſhe was more and more taken with him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, thoſe who were of the Plot, knock'd very confidently at the door, calling upon them to open to the Officers. The family was at firſt a little ſtartled; but <hi>Rufina,</hi> recovering her ſelf out of the little diſorder which appear'd in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:58823:120"/>
took <hi>Jaimo</hi> by the hand, and led him into an upper Room which had a double Partition, before which there was a piece of Hangings, and left him there, with an aſſurance it would be impoſſible to find him out. That done ſhe went to open the door, and <hi>Criſpin</hi> impudently comes in, without the leaſt fear of being known, being diſguis'd as he was. He was attended by ſome Rogues of his Profeſſion, who with Lanterns and Fire-arms, perſonating the Officers of Juſtice, uncivilly ruſh'd into the Room where <hi>Rufina</hi> was. <hi>Criſpin</hi> gave her a kind ſalute, and counterfeiting his Voice ſuitably to his Perſon. <q>I know, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that it ſpeaks a kind of incivility, to come ſo boldly into a VViddow's Houſe; but my Charge obliges me thereto, and therefore you will excuſe me. The Lieutenant Criminal hath commanded me, to ſearch all the Houſes hereabouts to ſee if I can find a Malefactor we look for. Our ſearch hath hitherto been to no purpoſe, and we have but this one Houſe to ſearch; give us therefore leave to look into all the Rooms of it, that we may ſatisfie our Superiours, and withall our own Conſciences. </q>
               <q>You may aſſure your ſelves, <hi>ſaid ſhe to them,</hi> upon my word, that I ſaw no Body come into my Houſe; but, that you may not think amiſs of me, or conceive me a Woman to ſhelter Murtherers, and Miſchievous perſons, ſearch, and ſee whether you can find the perſon you look for.</q>One of the Maids took a Wax-candle to light them, and they viſited ſeveral Chambers, yet not too exactly, that the ſlightneſs of the ſearch might be thought a Courteſie.</p>
            <p>That done, he civilly took leave, recommending
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:58823:120"/>
the proſecution of the plot to his Camerade. The counterfeit Knight came out of his hole, pretending an extraordinary gladneſs, that he had eſcap'd their hands, who ſought after him, and in expreſſions full of acknowledgment, he highly celebrated the favour he had receiv'd from the fair widow. She, who, the more ſhe look'd on him, more and more fancied him, made him a thouſand demonſtrations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, aſſur'd him he ſhould be waited on at her houſe according to his worth; and if he would have the patience to ſtay till her Father came in, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he would not ſuffer him to go out of the houſe that night.</p>
            <p>The Gallant, who perceiv'd the Lady began to grow warm, was the more earneſt to beg a leave which he ſaw would not be eaſily granted him, told her, it would be his beſt courſe to take Sanctuary in ſome Religious houſe, whence he might ſend notice to his people at the Inn, where he was; that he was to go the next day for <hi>Sevil;</hi> and that he thought it not ſafe for him, to go that night to his quarters. <hi>Rufina,</hi> troubled to find him ſo reſolv'd, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſes his ſtay, repreſented to him the great hazard he ran, and deſir'd him by all means to ſtay two hours longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jaimo,</hi> who deſir'd nothing ſo much, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to do ſo. She deſir'd his permiſſion, to go and take order about ſome things her Father had left her to do, whereof ſhe was to give an account at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. This was onely a pretence to get out, to confer with her ſlave, in whom ſhe repos'd great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, what courſe ſhe ſhould take. She took her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another room, and freely acknowledg'd to her the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58823:121"/>
inclination ſhe had for that Knight; that it troubled her to let him go out of the houſe, leſt he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his life, or at leaſt hazard his liberty: but on the other ſide, ſhe knew not, whether <hi>Garay</hi> would take it well that ſhe detain'd him, and that he ſhould be in the houſe all night. At laſt, much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at theſe difficulties, ſhe deſir'd her to give her the beſt advice ſhe could, and what ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, were ſhe in her condition.</p>
            <p>The Slave, who was as ſubtil a baggage as her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and immediately apprehended, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſhe would beſt like muſt be ſuch as promoted her paſſion; <q>I muſt acknowledge, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> that it would argue an exceſſive eaſineſs of nature in you, conſidering the ſhort time you have known this Cavalier, to unboſom your ſelf ſo far, as to give him a paſſage into your heart; and I think you would do imprudently on the other ſide to perſuade <hi>Garay,</hi> when he comes, to ſuffer his abode this night in the houſe. My advice is, ſince the houſe is large enough, and that there are two or three empty rooms, into one whereof he may go through your lodgings, that you lodge him there, and make not any body acquainted therewith. It ſhall be my care to bring him thither, when I have made his bed, and ſupply him with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, without <hi>Garay</hi>'s knowing of it. You know <hi>Garay</hi> is to be gone within theſe two days for <hi>Madrid,</hi> and then you may freely enjoy your ſelf with this young Gentleman, whom it will be eaſie for me to perſuade, that the ſearch being ſtill about the ſtreet, it is abſolutely neceſſary that he ſtay, if he will not hazard his life or liberty. </q>The Slave's 
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:58823:121"/>
advice was extremely pleaſing to <hi>Rufina,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd her to go immediately and lay clean ſheets on the bed, and to put the Cavalier in poſſeſſion of the room. 'Twas preſently put in execution, and not long after, the amorous Widow went by a private pair of ſtairs, to viſit her Gallant. <q>You will haply wonder, Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that without my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's permiſſion, I have ventur'd to receive you into my houſe, and that in the night: but to ſecure a perſon of worth, there may be a little breach made of the rules of modeſty. I have thought it moſt convenient, that, as I have been a means of your avoiding the eyes of Juſtice, ſo you ſhould alſo keep out of my Fathers, to the end you may be here in all ſafety. Be pleas'd to think your ſelf oblig'd to me for this little ſervice; but I render it you very heartily, nay I think it neceſſary, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your ſafety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jaimo,</hi> who perceiv'd this fiſh would come into the Weel, multiplies his acknowledgments by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands for this new favour. That begat abundance of pleaſant diſcourſes between them, whereof the iſſue was, that he heightning his flattery by his eloquence, inſinuated himſelf more and more into her good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; &amp; celebrating, one after another, all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and accompliſhments of <hi>Rufina,</hi> he got the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute diſpoſal of her heart. Yet would ſhe have a little further trial of his ſincerity, to ſee whether it were onely her beauty that drew him in, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were true that the charms of it had ſo ſuddenly transform'd a perſon, who fearfully fled into her houſe for ſhelter, into a confident Lover.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Slave coming in, and giving her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:58823:122"/>
an account that ſhe had obey'd her commands, ſhe took <hi>Jaimo</hi> by the hand, and led him to the room prepar'd for him. He found it light enough, as having in the midſt of it a Branch, of Cryſtal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many wax-candles, and a magnificent Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſtaying for him. He was a little ſurpriz'd to ſee ſhe left him alone, but her excuſe ſatisfi'd him, that ſhe would be with him again, as ſoon as ſhe had ſeen her Father in bed. At her departure out of the room, ſhe beheld him with eyes ſo full of love and tenderneſs, that that new demonſtration heightned the Gallant into an abſolute confidence of the good ſucceſs of his enterpriſe. <hi>Garay</hi> was not ſo far ſtricken in years, but that he had the courage left to pretend to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Rufina;</hi> he acted the part of her Gallant, and had he not been already married, he would have treated of a marriage with her. He kept his wife at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who, as many others do that are caſt off, and ſlighted, beſtow'd the time of her Husband's abſence on ſuch as would accept of her kindneſs. Some years had paſt ſince he had heard from her, whereupon imagining ſhe might be dead, he had reſolv'd upon a journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to make a ſecret enquiry after her, that, in caſe ſhe were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd out of the world, he might proſecute his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to marry <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was infinitely oblig'd to him. Upon this account it was that he reſolv'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture within two days.</p>
            <p>Leaving him in thoſe thoughts, let us return to <hi>Rufina,</hi> who ſet him to ſupper as ſoon as he was come in, and, pretending ſome indiſpoſition, excus'd her ſelf that ſhe could not bear him company. It being his cuſtom to go to bed as ſoon as he had ſupp'd,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58823:122"/>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> ſtaid, till word was brought her, that he was faſt aſleep, and then went to her Gallant, cauſing her own ſupper, which was that night ſomewhat more than ordinary, to be carried along with her. As ſoon as the cloth was taken away, during the interval which the ſervants had to ſup, <hi>Rufina,</hi> who was more and more in love with her new Gueſt, entreated him to give her an account of his life, and ſincerely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with his name, his country, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his coming to <hi>Toledo. Jaimo,</hi> whoſe deſign it was onely to abuſe her, entertain'd her with this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, whereto ſhe gave very earneſt audience.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Country, Madam, is <hi>Valentia,</hi> one of the moſt eminent Provinces of <hi>Spain;</hi> you know it well enough by name, and haply are not to learn, that it hath a great advantage over ſeveral others, as well in regard of Nobility and wealth, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of its climate, and the delightful fertility of its ſoil. I am of the noble and antient Family of <hi>Pertuſa,</hi> well known all over that Kingdom. My name is <hi>Don Jaimo de Pertuſa,</hi> and the King, for the many good ſervices done him by my Anceſtors, hath honour'd me with the Order of Knight of <hi>Monteſa,</hi> and the Commanderie of <hi>Silla,</hi> which is the beſt of any belonging to that Order. Beſides what that brings me in, I have in other eſtate as much as may amount to three thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> I am the onely Son of the Family, and I made my addreſſes to a noble Lady of the City I was born in, named <hi>Donna Blanca Ceintillas,</hi> of one of the moſt illuſtrious Families of <hi>Valentia,</hi> a Lady of excellent endowments. I have ſerv'd her with all the affection imaginable, whereto ſhe gave
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:58823:123"/>
me no return, as being pre-ingag'd to another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier, who was alſo a Servant of hers, named <hi>Don Vincent Poiadas;</hi> whereupon ſeeing my Rival pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before me, I was exaſperated beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was a perſon of ſuch an humour, as that nothing would ſatisfie him, leſs than to rid out of the way whatever might obſtruct his amorous pretenſions. Accordingly, one night, meeting with me in the ſtreet where my Miſtreſs liv'd, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by three ſervants, he ſet upon me, though I had but one with me. I defended my ſelf as well as I could, but at laſt came off with ſuch wound; as it was conceiv'd I muſt have di'd of them. There could never be any perfect diſcovery made of him who had hurt me, though every one ſuſpected who it might be: but the common report coming in to the Magiſtrate that <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was my Corrival, he was impriſon'd; but, having clear'd himſelf either by favour or mony, he was ſet at liberty. Being recover'd of my wounds, and reflecting on the advantage, wherewith my Rival had engag'd me, I thought it but a juſt requital to fall on him, upon the ſame unequal terms. I therefore ſurpriz'd him in the ſame manner as he had done me, and the reſult was, that he got off much more wounded than I had been. There happen'd to be ſome in the ſtreet, who knew me, and took their oaths againſt me, a thing not much practis'd at <hi>Valentia,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the truth is ſeldom diſcover'd by that means. Upon this accident it is, that I came thence, for <hi>Don Vincent</hi> was ſo dangerouſly wounded, that the Chirurgeons gave but little hopes of his recovery. I ſaw his Friends were reſolv'd to revenge his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58823:123"/>
death, and was afraid to fall into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. This oblig'd me to leave <hi>Valentia,</hi> and to come to this City, where I have now been about a month. I have underſtood by a perſon of this City, who hath correſpondents in ſeveral others, that he whom I had hurt is out of all danger, nay in perfect health, and that the treaty of marriage between him and <hi>Donna Blanca</hi> is concluded, whereof I have a greater reſentment, then of having this day met with two men, who hir'd by <hi>Don Vincent</hi> came hither purpoſely to murther me. They ſet upon me in this ſtreet, one I have mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I think, and by that means made a ſhift to eſcape out of their hands, with the aſſiſtance of thoſe who came in to part us. I found your houſe open, and being come into it for refuge, I find my ſelf ſecure, and that all I have to fear now, is, your fair eyes. Avoiding one priſon, I am fallen into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but I think my impriſonment ſo pleaſant, that, if you diſcharge me not, I ſhall continue it as long as I live.</q>

            <p>Thus did the counterfeit <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> conclude his relation, leaving <hi>Rufina</hi> extremely ſatisfi'd, to ſee in that Cavalier, not onely thoſe endowments which might deſerve love, but alſo ſuch initiations of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as rais'd in her a certain hope ſhe might one day be his wife: which having diſcours'd within her ſelf, ſhe immediately made him this Anſwer. <q>Signor <hi>Don Jaimo Pertuſa,</hi> I am very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that you ſhould come to the knowledge of me at <hi>Toledo,</hi> upon ſo ſad an occaſion to your ſelf; but it abates much of it, that you intend not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſo ſoon into your Country, for I could wiſh

Such as it is, if it oblige you to any reciprocation, I ſhall think my ſelf but too too happy, and that I have attain'd the greateſt of my wiſhes. In order to ſuch a deſign, Heaven hath not haply made me handſome enough; but I dare ſtand on my good nature, and withal that I have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wherewith to ſatisfie a perſon of your worth and quality. </q>
               <q>Madam, <hi>replies Don Jaimo,</hi> I kiſs the very duſt you tread on, though I think not my ſelf worthy enough it ſhould be touch'd by my mouth, when I conſider the favour I receive from you. Yet can I not but think I have fully ſatisfi'd whatever I ought you, ſince I have reſign'd up to you my heart and ſoul, and ſo I fear not any Action you may have againſt me, as to that particular. As to your forcing of my will, you may ſpare your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble, I am already ſenſible, Madam, that it is at your devotion, and therefore you may forbear ineffectual remedies, where there needs onely that Sovereign one of your Beauty, which is ſo full of vertue, that it hath tranſported me out of my ſelf, that I might be abſolutely at your diſpoſal. 'Twas a happy day to me, that I was ſet upon by thoſe Aſſaſſins of my Country, ſince the miſchief they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me hath procur'd me the favours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

from you. Now I wiſh Heaven would prolong my Life; for if you approve of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I have for you, as you are pleas'd to aſſure me, in ſpight of all the ſtorms of my ill fortune, I ſhall get into a haven where I may defie all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I mean that of your good inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. The thought of them gives me reſpit, and fills me with an abſolute oblivion of my Country, ſince I muſt look on a place, where ſuch happineſs is prepar'd for me, as my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe diſcourſes, and others yet more amorous, paſs'd between <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> and <hi>Donna Emerentiana;</hi> and the crafty Youth had the length of her Foot ſo rightly, that ſhe was eaſily enſnar'd in the ſubtle Webb of his cunning inſinuations, and made it her main buſineſs to ingratiate her ſelf more and more with him. The time inſenſibly paſs'd away in theſe amorous conferences, inſomuch that it was two in the morning ere <hi>Rufina</hi> retir'd to her own Chamber, yet troubled, that ſhe was forc'd to do it ſo ſoon; and the Impoſtor <hi>Jaimo</hi> preſently went to Bed, extreamly pleas'd, that his Camerade's plot had taken ſo well. <hi>Criſpin</hi> was extreamly perplex'd, that all that Day and the next, he had receiv'd no news of what paſs'd, by reaſon of <hi>Garay</hi>'s being in the Houſe: but as ſoon as he was gone, for <hi>Madrid,</hi> the amorous <hi>Rufina</hi> gave her ſelf more liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill more and more deeply in Love with her Gueſt. <hi>Jaimo</hi> acquainted <hi>Criſpin,</hi> by a Letter brought him by the Slave, how he was favour'd by <hi>Rufina. Criſpin</hi> anſwer'd him by the ſame hand, and withall ſent him a Purſe with a hundred pieces,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:58823:125"/>
to get her in to Play, and to make preſents to the Servants, that he might be ſure of them when occaſion ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>The day of <hi>Garay</hi>'s departure for <hi>Madrid, Rufina</hi> was taken up with the reception of two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of her Neighbour-hood, an employment ſhe was not at all pleas'd with, for ſhe wiſh'd them far enough, and her ſelf in her Gallant's company. As ſoon as they were gone, ſhe went to her beloved <hi>Jaimo,</hi> whom we ſhall <hi>Don—</hi>as long as this Scene of the impoſture laſts. She found him tuning a Lute, which her Slave had brought him; for he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Muſician, and had a ſmack of Poetry, an accompliſhment not extraordinary in the Natives of <hi>Valentia,</hi> where there are alſo admirable Muſicians. <hi>Rufina,</hi> hearing him at a diſtance, came ſoftly into his Chamber, charm'd with the ſweet harmony of his Lute, which he touch'd with a miraculous dexterity, and being not ſeen by the young Man, ſhe hearkned to him a good while, perceiving he intended to ſing a Song, as he afterwards did with an admirable grace, and he had made the Verſes, which were upon the occaſion of his Love. This added to the flames of her affection, which were before grown too violent for to keep within the bounds of modeſty: but what moſt raviſh'd her, was, that the Verſes he had Sung were made for her, and upon the accident which had happened to him. VVhereupon the Love-ſtung VViddow coming up to him, <q>What, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> Signor <hi>Don Jaimo,</hi> you are Maſter of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which I little imagin'd? I am extreamly glad of it, yet wonder not much thereat, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Valentia</hi> to be famous for excellent Voices.</q>
               <q>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:58823:125"/>
Mine is but ordinary, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and it is rather the words, than the goodneſs of the Voice that induc'd me to Sing. </q>
               <q>I find, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> this Song is very new, and that it was not made two days ſince. </q>
               <q>'Tis very true, <hi>ſays Don Jaimo,</hi> yet is it not to be much wondred at, ſince the ſubject, upon which it is made, hath ſuch an influence over me, as would make me undertake things impoſſible, as tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever yet I thought worth my admiration. </q>
               <q>No flattery, I pray you, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> for though I know that what you ſay is not true, and that you Men allow a diſtance between your words and thoughts, and, when you do not love, moſt pretend it, yet I cannot but take all kindly from you.

All I have to beg of you is, that you take a more particular notice of my freedome, and thence infer, that my Soul cannot be fuller of affection towards you than it is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, theſe and other inſinuating diſcourſes ſcrew'd up the feign'd Widdow to ſuch a height of kindneſs, that the crafty companion began to deſiſt from the enterprize which had occaſion'd his coming to her, and ſeriouſly diſpoſe himſelf to aſſure her more and more of his love. And thinking her fully ſatisfy'd with the relation he had made her of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he became ſo familiar, as to deſire her to give him the like accompt of her extraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She thought fit to make her condition equal with his, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58823:126"/>
ſhe acquainted him in a ſhort diſcourſe, how ſhe was deſcended from the illuſtrious Counts of <hi>Menezez</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> though ſhe had been born in the City of <hi>Badajos.</hi> The crafty companion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately apprehended what Game ſhe would be at, and that her deſign was to oblige him to Marry her. This was directly contrary to the ſentiments of <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who would not by any means that he ſhould think of any ſuch thing, but continually reflect on the dangers they are apt to run into, who following the profeſſion he was engag'd in, are concern'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious in the execution of their enterpriſes, leſt being, by ſome unexpected accident, prevented, they come to make their laſt Wills on a Gibbet, before they are willing to remove into the other World.</p>
            <p>The young Gallant grew more and more warm in his love towards <hi>Rufina,</hi> particularly upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, that, according to her relation, ſhe was nobly deſcended. He thereupon did all lay in his power to heighten her affection towards him. She on the other ſide, had the ſame thoughts, ſo that concurring in the ſame deſires, as Lovers mutually paſſionate, <hi>Rufina</hi> behav'd her ſelf ſo freely and familiarly towards him, that he might eaſily perceive ſhe had diſcarded all modeſty: inſomuch that, upon little intreaty, ſhe permitted him to invert the order of the Alphabet, and to put Q. before P. But in the midſt of her enjoyments, ſhe remembred her old Acquaintance <hi>Garay;</hi> ſhe reflected on the familiarites had paſs'd between them; ſhe conſider'd how much ſhe was oblig'd to him; and that he was look'd on all over
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:58823:126"/>
the City as her Father. She imagin'd to her ſelf the reſentment he muſt needs have at his arrival, when he found that ſhe had baſely forſaken him. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought her ſelf to give him a ſum of Money pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and to diſmiſs him: but thinking more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of it, ſhe thought it a better courſe to leave <hi>Toledo</hi> before his return, and to perſuade <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> to carry her into his Country, <hi>Valentia.</hi> She reſolv'd within two or three days to declare her mind to him, for <hi>Garay</hi> was not expected home till fifteen days after.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Rufina</hi> and her Gallant paſs'd away the time very jocundly, and he, being very heartily in love with her, was fully reſolv'd to give <hi>Criſpin</hi> the bag, and not to proceed any further in his firſt deſign. 'Twas in the Winter-time, when the Nights are longeſt, that theſe Lovers deceiv'd the ſlow-pac'd Seaſon with an intermixture of Careſſes, Songs, and amorous Diſcourſes, nay many times, they ſung together, their ſeveral parts, to a Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he play'd on. One night, after they had Sung and Talk'd of ſeveral things, <hi>Rufina</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her Gallant to entertain her and her Maids with ſome pleaſant Story, or Novel, if he knew any. The young Man, who was Vers'd in all things, and of an excellent Wit, was content to anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of his Miſtreſs, to give her a new demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his further perfections, and ſaid to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The Novel I intend to tell you, I heard from an accompliſh'd Cavalier of <hi>Valentia;</hi> I thought it not unpleaſant, and ſhall endeavour to preſent it to you as well dreſs'd as I receiv'd it.</q> Whereupon having recollected himſelf a little, he began his diſcourſe thus.</p>

eſteem'd all over the Kingdome. By their death, from whom he deriv'd his being in this world, there fell to him an eſtate of four thouſand Crowns annual rent, upon which he liv'd very nobly at <hi>Sevil,</hi> being the moſt remarkable Perſon at all publick actions done about the City. He had at <hi>Madrid</hi> a Couſin-german, who follow'd the Spaniſh Court, and was gone thither about ſome affairs of great importance, which he had brought to a happy iſſue. Having liv'd there a while, he lik'd it, and the converſation of the Cavaliers inhabiting it, ſo well, that he exchang'd the place of his birth for that illuſtrious City. He there became intimately acquainted with an old Cavalier, whoſe name was <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda,</hi> a perſon who had rais'd himſelf into a general eſteem, by the excellent endowments he had. Beſides which he was honour'd with the illuſtrious Order of the Patron of <hi>Spain,</hi> with a Commandery of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats of annual rent. This old Gentleman was a Widdower, having but one onely Daughter, to whom all his vaſt Eſtate was to fall at his Death. Nature it ſeems had made it her particular buſineſs to enrich this young Lady, with all the graces and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be wiſh'd in one of her Sex. Which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd the envy of all the Ladies about the Court towards her, ſince ſhe had, in point of Beauty, the ſame advantages over them, as the Sun hath over all the reſt of the Planets. Her Father, <hi>Don Juan,</hi> wiſh'd her married with a perſon to his mind, that is, one equal to her, in eſtate and extraction. <hi>Don Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo de Ribera</hi> (ſo was called <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Couſin whom I ſpoke of firſt) might have aſpir'd to the honour of making his Addreſſes to her, as well upon

accompt of the Houſe, from which he was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as the familiar acquaintance there was between him and her Father, <hi>Don Juan.</hi> But being a younger Brother, he thought himſelf too low, in point of eſtate, to pretend to ſo advantageous a match. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thought fit to make ſome propoſal to the old Gentleman, on the behalf of his Couſin <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Sevil,</hi> whom he highly recommended to him for his excellent Qualities, and the greatneſs of his Eſtate; for he was the onely Son of a Noble houſe. <hi>Don Juan</hi> took it very kindly from him, but thought it withall prudence, to make further enquiry into the buſineſs, knowing that perſons ſpeaking for their own Relations are commonly very partial, and think it no mortal ſin to exceed the truth. So that <hi>Don Juan,</hi> immediately writ to a particular friend at <hi>Sevil,</hi> earneſtly deſiring him to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Perſon and Eſtate of <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera,</hi> inaſmuch as it highly concern'd the honour of his Houſe, to meet with a Cavalier worthy his alliance, to be Husband to his onely Daughter <hi>Donna Brianda.</hi>

He thereupon went to <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> and told him, that he might write to his Couſin, and aſſure him he ſhould be very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if he had any inclinations for his Daughter. He made him Anſwer, that he would, and <hi>Don Juan,</hi> as a further obligation, would have his Daughter's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

ſent him, that he might therein find ſome of the rare qualities that were in her, permitting his Couſin to be preſent at the taking of it, that he might aſſure <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> the Painter had not flatter'd her, and that the Copy was below the Original.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> fail'd not to write to his Couſin, to whom he alſo ſent the Picture, celebrating the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of that amiable perſon, which the Painter could not repreſent, as he had done the lineaments of her beautiful countenance. His Couſin <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was extremely ſatisfi'd therewith, and referr'd it to him to make ſome overtures in the treaty of Marriage, till he came thither himſelf, for the further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, he ſent him a full procuration.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was preparing for his journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to wait on his Miſtreſs, who, having receiv'd his Picture, was as much taken with it, as he had been with hers. Leaving his retinue at <hi>Sevil,</hi> till a rich Livery, then making, were finiſh'd, he began his journey, having onely one perſon to wait on him, and a Groom to look to their Mules, who follow'd them at a little diſtance. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> carri'd always about him his Miſtreſs's picture inclos'd in the ſame Letter, wherein his Couſin had ſent it him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come within half a days journey of <hi>Toledo,</hi> he ſent away the Groom, to provide Lodgings for them in the City. He had entertain'd at dinner ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Orgaz,</hi> which was the place where they had baited. The cloth being taken away, they fell to Cards; he loſt his mony, and was vex'd, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd their playing on till he had recover'd his loſſes, and by that time it was grown later than he could have wiſh'd. Being hors'd, he and his man put

forward, but ere they had rode a League, night ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd them, ſo that they made a ſhift to loſe their way, and got in among certain Olive-trees, about half a League ſhort of <hi>Toledo.</hi> Not knowing where they were, and fearing to go too far out of their way, they thought it their beſt courſe to alight, and reſt themſelves under one of the Olive-trees, till it were day. They accommodated themſelves the beſt they could, and wearineſs ſoon laid them aſleep, yet little dream'd of the misfortune which was to happen to them. Being in their firſt ſleep, which is commonly the ſoundeſt, four men came to the place, very ſoftly, for the noiſe of their Mules brought them thither; and theſe were of a profeſſion, which for the moſt part finds thoſe that are of it more work by night than by day. They had then been upon a deſign which had not taken, and ſo they were returning ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolately with empty pockets to <hi>Toledo.</hi>

                        <p>Coming up to them, and finding them both aſleep, they ty'd their hands behind them, and took away all they had, but their Doublets and Drawers, and, to get off with more ſpeed and ſafety, they made uſe of their Mules. <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> being thus baſely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, was exaſperated at the misfortune, but his Man told him that it had happened to them through his fault, becauſe he had not given over playing ſooner. They diſcours'd of it, till the Birds gave them notice of the approach of <hi>Aurora.</hi> Soon after, hearing the noiſe of ſome cattle not far from them, they call'd to him that look'd after them, who came up to them, and unbound them, very much bemoaning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in. They ask'd him, how far it was to <hi>Toledo,</hi> and he told them it was not quite half a

Having knock'd at the Gate, it was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately open'd by an old man, who was Steward to the Lady, and had the overſight of the Shepherds and the profits ariſing from the Sheep. The Shepherd who brought them thither went in to the Lady, and in few words gave her an account of the misfortune had hapned to thoſe Strangers, and the condition he had found them in, whereupon ſhe order'd them to be brought up to her chamber. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> preſented himſelf to her, very much abaſh'd to ſee himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt naked, as having about him onely an old Coat, which the Shepherd had lent him. He told her that his journey was for <hi>Madrid,</hi> about a Law-ſuit of great importance, not diſcovering who he was, but onely that he was a Gentleman of <hi>Sevil,</hi> named, <hi>Don Ferdinand Sanchez de Trivegno.</hi> The Lady, whoſe name was <hi>Donna Victoria,</hi> was much troubled to ſee him in that deplorable condition. There were in the houſe two cheſts full of cloaths, which had been a Brother's of hers, who died not long before. She order'd two ſutes to be brought out, which they put on, that which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had proving ſo fit, that the Lady was much taken with his perſon, and had her eyes always faſtned on him.

ere the Lady made any diſcovery of the affection ſhe had for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſave onely what ſhe did with her eyes, which were the ſilent interpreters of the trouble ſhe was in. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was not inſenſible of it, and had ſome diſcourſe concerning it with his Man; yet had he not the confidence to tell him what he really thought of it, being (as he was) upon the point of diſpoſing himſelf otherwiſe. The Servant advis'd him not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity, and told him he ſhould not be ſo hard-hearted, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Lady of ſo great worth, and one that had ſo highly oblig'd them. The ſolitude of the place, the beauty of the Lady, and the ſilent diſcoveries ſhe made him by her geſtures, oblig'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to anſwer her affection. He entred into ſome Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcourſes with her; but though ſhe were really in love with him, yet would ſhe not grant him any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favour, unleſs he firſt aſſur'd her ſhe ſhould be his wife, and that ſhe had a promiſe of it under his hand.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> on the other ſide, had ſo great a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her, that he had in a manner forgot the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, whoſe Picture he carri'd about him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing with his Servant, (who was a dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and a ſubtil fellow) what he ſhould do, he told him very roundly, that he ought not to let ſlip ſo ſweet and favourable an opportunity; that he might eaſily have the enjoyment of her, and withal give her the promiſe of marriage ſhe deſired, provided he put not into it his own name, but fill'd it with the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious name he had aſſum'd, ſince ſhe knew neither his Country nor extraction. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> follow'd his advice, and thereupon had his deſires of <hi>Donna Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria,</hi>

He continu'd there four days, at the end whereof, acquainting the Lady that his buſineſs at <hi>Madrid</hi> was of ſuch importance as requir'd his perſonal attendance there, ſhe conſented to his departure, on condition he would return again as ſoon as he could; which he, with oaths, promis'd to do.</p>
                        <p>The next morning betimes, he departed, leaving the Lady o're-flown with tears; he was ſomewhat troubled, or at leaſt pretended it.

                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> had ſcarcely come to the period of this Letter, but, through the trouble ſhe receiv'd at the reading of it, ſhe fell into a ſwound, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd therein above half an hour, in the arms of her Maid. At laſt ſhe came to her ſelf, burſting into ſighs and tears; ſhe rail'd at the <hi>Sevillian</hi> Impoſtor, but much more at her own ſimplicity, that ſhe had ſo lightly proſtituted her honour to an unknown perſon, whom ſo ſtrange an adventure had brought to her houſe. She ſpent that whole day in weeping and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning her misfortune: but conſidering withal, what hazard her reputation was in, ſhe reſolv'd it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:58823:132"/>
ſhould not be ſaid of her, that ſhe had been ſo baſely affronted by any man. Whereupon with the light ſhe receiv'd from the Letter, of the occaſion of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the perſon to whom he was to be married, ſhe put things in order to her removal to <hi>Madrid;</hi> which ſhe might better do than any other, in regard ſhe had not any Kinſman near enough to whom ſhe might communicate her intention. She communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her deſign to <hi>Albert,</hi> an old Servant of hers, who had brought her up from the cradle, and was very glad to wait on her.</p>
                        <p>Upon this reſolution, ſhe caus'd two Wagons to be loaden with all things neceſſary to furniſh a houſe fit to receive a perſon of Quality, and took her way towards <hi>Madrid.</hi> Being come thither, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her Servant <hi>Albert,</hi> to enquire whereabouts lived <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda,</hi> and whether the young Cavalier, whom he intended to make his Son-in-law, were come from <hi>Sevil.</hi> She underſtood by him, that he was not yet come, but that they expected him, which much troubled the Lady, who knew nothing of the accident had happen'd to him near <hi>Illeſcas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt thing this affronted Lady did, was to take a houſe for her ſelf, near that of <hi>Don Juan de la Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and order'd <hi>Albert</hi> to live in it as Maſter thereof. That done, ſhe ſent him to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s, to enquire whether ſhe wanted a waiting-Gentlewoman, for ſhe would diſguiſe her ſelf, that ſhe might not be known by <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> The buſineſs had the effect ſhe deſired, for <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> was then enquiring for a widow to wait on her, a cuſtom much practis'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> where Ladies of quality have ſeveral of them, whom, being Widows, they call <hi>Duennas.</hi>
                           <pb n="255" facs="tcp:58823:132"/>
When this was propoſed by <hi>Albert,</hi> who went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Father to his Miſtreſs, <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda</hi> not onely receiv'd her into her ſervice, but her Father, <hi>Albert,</hi> was alſo entertain'd into <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s. <hi>Albert</hi> gave his Miſtreſs an account of his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereat ſhe was extremely ſatisfi'd: ſo that having put her ſelf into the habit of a <hi>Duenna,</hi> ſhe went the next day to preſent her ſelf to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> conducted by her pretended Father, <hi>Albert.</hi> They were both very kindly entertained by <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda</hi> and his Daughter. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> wiſh'd ſhe had not been ſo handſom, that the Sutor ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected might be the leſs taken with her; however, ſhe couragiouſly reſolv'd to proſecute the impoſture ſhe was ingag'd in. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> ask'd <hi>Albert,</hi> what Country-man he was. He told her that he was born at a place called <hi>Utrera,</hi> near <hi>Sevil;</hi> that his name was <hi>Stephen de Santillana</hi> (by which we ſhall henceforth call him) that his Daughter had been married to a Merchant of that City, who di'd as he was going for the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> leaving ſo great Debts behind him, that all his Eſtate went to ſatisfie his Creditors. <hi>Don Juan</hi> hearing that <hi>Santillana</hi> was of <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> ask'd him, whether he had liv'd any time at <hi>Sevil.</hi> He told him, that he had often been in that City, but that his Daughter had liv'd there. <hi>Don Juan</hi> would not at that time enquire any farther, nor enter into any diſcourſe with him concerning <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera. Donna Victoria</hi> was entertain'd as <hi>Duenna</hi> to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> who took ſuch an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to her, that ſhe truſted her with all her Keys, to the great diſcontent of her other Servants, who had liv'd with her many years. <hi>Santillana</hi> told them
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58823:133"/>
that he had a Houſe of his own, not far from <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s, and a Wife (for <hi>Marcella</hi> an ancient Maid of <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s was to act that part) whereupon he had no Lodgings aſſign'd him in <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s.</p>
                        <p>It is now time we return to <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera,</hi> who being recover'd of his fall, came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and lighted at the Houſe of his Couſin <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> who was much troubled that he had not been there ſooner. He told him the cauſe of it, and gave him a particular account of all had paſs'd in <hi>Donna Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria</hi>'s Country-houſe, even to the promiſe he had made her, under a feign'd name. <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> ask'd him, what quality the Lady was of, whereto be anſwer'd, that her name was <hi>Donna Victoria de Sylva,</hi> and that ſhe was of one of the moſt noble Families of <hi>Toledo. Don Rodrigo</hi> was very much diſſatisfy'd with his procedure, reproaching him with the unworthy action he had done, in abuſing and diſhonouring that Lady, and that it was to be fear'd, ſhe might hear of his coming to <hi>Madrid</hi> in order to a Marriage with another, and find means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd for that affront.</p>
                        <p>They afterwards fell into diſcourſe concerning <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> told him, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly fancied the Picture he had ſeen of her, but that, with the other things he had been robb'd of, he had loſt it: though he knew well enough, he had left it under the beds head at <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s, which troubled him not a little, however he diſſembled it. <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> told <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> that it were fit he put himſelf into other Cloaths, before he waited on his Miſtreſs, and that he muſt keep within doors till they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:58823:133"/>
were ready. Within two days a very fair riding Suit was brought him, wherein pretending he was but newly come to Town, he goes to the Houſe of <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda,</hi> by whom he was receiv'd with great demonſtrations of kindneſs. Notice was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carry'd up to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that the perſon deſign'd to be her Husband was coming up to her Chamber, where ſhe was with her Maids about her, who had juſt made an end of Dreſſing her. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> coming in, conducted by <hi>Don Juan</hi> and <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> was infinitely ſatisfy'd at the ſight of his Miſtreſs, whom he very civilly and diſcreetly ſaluted, for he was a perſon of an excellent wit and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident carriage and demeanour. He found by the original of <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that the Painter had done his work very faithfully, a virtue not much practis'd by Painters, eſpecially upon ſuch occaſions as that was. He was raviſh'd, to ſee ſo great a Beauty, and ſhe on the other ſide was well ſatisfy'd with the handſome perſonage of <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There were yet ſome things to be done in order to the abſolute concluſion of the Marriage, at which there was a neceſſity of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s preſence; whereupon he, <hi>Don Juan,</hi> and <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into another room, where they lock'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in with a Notary, and ſome Friends, who were to be witneſſes at the Articles of the agreement. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> continu'd all that time in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with her Servants, talking of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> her Husband-to-be, every one congratulating her good fortune, ſave onely <hi>Donna Victoria,</hi> who ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, her Miſtreſs obſerv'd it, and being all alone with her, <q>
                              <hi>Donna Theodorn, ſaid ſhe to her,</hi>
                              <pb n="258" facs="tcp:58823:134"/>
(that was the name ſhe had aſſum'd) whence comes it, that, while all the reſt celebrate the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my choice, you onely are ſilent? Me-thinks you might have contributed ſomewhat to the publick congratulation, though you had done it onely out of complaiſance. I pray give me ſome reaſon for it.</q>
                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> had done it purpoſely, in proſecution of her deſign, and this queſtion came as ſeaſonably as ſhe could have wiſh'd it, ſo that ſhe made her this Anſwer. <q>As to the perſon of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> Madam, there is not any thing to be ſaid againſt it, nay he is ſo accompliſh'd, that there is not any thing to be wiſh'd in him which he hath not already. My ſilence proceeds hence, that I had a particular knowledge of him at <hi>Sevil,</hi> for I liv'd in a Quarter of the City, which he much frequented. I neither will, nor ought to conceal from you the occaſion of his ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, for it is my duty to be faithful to you, as having no other deſign than to ſerve you, and endeavour your quiet, ſo as that you may not live in a perpetual diſ-enjoyment of your ſelf all the reſt of your days. Know then, Madam, that if you match your ſelf with <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> you will be brought to a kind of civil death, inſtead of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſatisfactions of wedlock.</q> 
                           <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> was much aſtoniſh'd at this diſcourſe, and preſs'd her <hi>Duenna,</hi> to diſcover to her more clearly, what ſhe had but too great a deſire to tell her. Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her to retire into a more ſecret place, where they might not be obſerv'd by her other Women, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> gave her this malicious account of the perfidious <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="259" facs="tcp:58823:134"/>
                           <q>I ſhould not live with the reſpect and duty I owe you as my Miſtreſs, nor according to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I bear you, if I expreſs'd not my ſelf clearly to you, in a buſineſs wherein you are ſo highly concern'd, and on which depends your greateſt felicity in this world. Know then, Madam, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> fell in love with a Lady at <hi>Sevil,</hi> one very handſome and well deſcended, in a word wanting nothing but a fortune ſuitable to her quality. He courted her ſo earneſtly, that ſhe, finding her ſelf oblig'd by ſo great demonſtrations of Affection, Letters, and continual Embaſſies, attended with preſents, from <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſatisfy'd his deſires, upon a promiſe that he would make her his Wife, whereof there are many witneſſes. But the buſineſs was to be kept ſecret for a time; for <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Father was then alive, who, having receiv'd ſome intelligence of that Love, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd all he could to prevent <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Donna Elvira de Monſalvo;</hi> ſo was the Lady called. The continuance of his viſits to her produc'd living proofs, which were two Sons and a Daughter, who are at this time with the Mother. When <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Father was remov'd out of the way, (which happen'd not long after) <hi>Donna Elvira</hi> expected he ſhould make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and marry her, but he, for ſome time, came not ſo much as to ſee her. What inconveniences ſhe was put to from the time of their acquaintance ſhe knows to her ſorrow, and I am not ignorant thereof, for I Liv'd near her, and went often to her Houſe. Being now convinc'd that he intended to leave her in the Lerch, ſhe diſcover'd the buſineſs
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:58823:135"/>
to two Couſin-Germans of hers, who were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd thereat, that they immediately reſolv'd to oblige <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> by force, to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he had made to their Kinſwoman. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went to a certain Farm he had, not far from <hi>Sevil,</hi> to avoid his Adverſaries, who, knowing he went out of the way purpoſely becauſe he would not ſatisfie their Couſin, reſolv'd to be the death of him. Things were in this poſture when my Father brought me to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where I have been about theſe ſix weeks. This is the accompt I can give you of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who muſt not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure in this Court, for the Lady's Kinſmen, whom I know to be gallant and ſtout Perſons, as ſoon as they hear of his being here, will be ſure to attend his motion, and revenge the affront done to their Couſin; nay it will be eaſier for them to do it here than at <hi>Sevil.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> heard very attentively the ſtory told her by the <hi>Duenna,</hi> and was extreamly troubled, to find <hi>Don Pedro</hi> ſo far engag'd with another. She ask'd her a thouſand queſtions, among others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was much in love with that Miſtreſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Donna Elvira</hi> was very handſome, &amp;c. whereto ſhe made ſuch Anſwers as were ſuitable to her deſign, which was to put <hi>Don Pedro</hi> clearly out of her favour. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> reſolv'd to give her Father an account of all, and leave it to him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf more fully of the buſineſs. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went to the Room where he was to ſpeak to him, for all things were concluded as to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> was left in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58823:135"/>
outer-room, where the Women and <hi>Duennas</hi> are wont to wait. There came in to them a Servant of <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s whom he had ſent to the Poſt for Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Sevil.</hi> Enquiring for his Maſter, to give him the pacquet, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> told him, that he was within, but that as ſoon as he came out ſhe would deliver it to him. Having opened the pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, ſhe put into it a Letter ſhe immediately writ, and, ſealing it up again, came where her Miſtreſs was. She ask'd her whither ſhe was going with thoſe Letters? The other anſwered without the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any malice, that they were directed to Signor <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and had been brought thither a little before by one of his Servants from the <hi>Sevil-</hi>Poſt. Curioſity was an ingredient of the firſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and it is very fruitfully ſpread through the whole Sex. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> ſhew'd her ſelf nor free from it on this occaſion, and ſhe was the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable conſidering the ſtory had been told her by the ſubtle <hi>Duenna.</hi> She was tempted to open the pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, wherein finding one Letter written with a Woman's hand (which was that written by <hi>Donna Victoria)</hi> ſhe could do no leſs than open it, and directing her Eye down to the bottom of it, found it ſubſcribed by one <hi>Donna Elvira de Monſalvo.</hi> She read it, and was confirm'd in what before ſhe not fully credited.</p>

                        <p>This Letter fully ſatisfy'd <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> that all ſhe had heard from the malicious <hi>Duenna</hi> was true. Her Father coming into the room as ſhe had done reading it, ſhe acquainted him with all that concern'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſhewing him the Letter from <hi>Donna Elvira.</hi> He was extreamly aſtoniſh'd, to find that a Cavalier of ſo noble a Family, had abus'd a Lady of ſuch quality, and that, having Children by her, he ſhould be ſo impudent as to make his addreſſes to his Daughter. He forbore reproaching him therewith, till he had better inform'd himſelf from a Friend of his of <hi>Sevil,</hi> then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> whom he immediately went to look for.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Juan</hi> was but hardly got out of doors, but <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and his Man came in, for his man having told him that he had deliver'd the pacquet to one of <hi>Donna Brianda</hi>'s Women, he was come to receive it from her, ſince it was not brought to his Couſin's, whither all his Letters were directed. It was his fortune to meet with <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> in the outer-room, where her Father had left her. <q>I ſhould not have return'd ſo ſoon, my deareſt Lady, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> had not ſomewhat extraordinary oblig'd me thereto; it is to receive ſome Letters, which my Man tells me he delivered to one of your Women.</q>

She thought, <hi>ſays Donna Brianda,</hi> that you had been ſtill with my Father. I caſually meeting her as ſhe was coming into the room, ask'd her what ſhe came for. She anſwering, it was to deliver you the pacquet, I took it from her, and (preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that a Cavalier of your age and complexion could not have lived to this time in <hi>Sevil,</hi> and not have an inclination for ſome Lady) a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of curioſity and jealouſie perſuaded me to open it. That curioſity hath done me a courteſie, and hath ſatisfy'd me in ſome things, which before I onely ſuſpected: and therefore I forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring your excuſe, ſince I have receiv'd ſo good an information, before I was any further engag'd with you; for had it come too late, I had been ruin'd. Here's a Letter from a perſon you ſhould be well acquainted with; this would have been enough to undeceive me, but it onely confirms a relation I had receiv'd before, upon which I was almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to put ſuch a check to your pretenſions to me, as that you ſhould have but little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to continue them. Farewell, my preſence will but trouble you, this Letter will acquaint you with what you are not ignorant of.</q>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Pedro</hi> receiving the Letter out of her hand was not a little ſurpris'd, not imagining what might have happen'd to him. He read it, and preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, that it was a trick put upon him by ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious perſon, who was deſirous to obſtruct his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Meeting with <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> (whom, as we ſaid before, he knew not in her Widdow's habit) <q>Ah Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> what forgeries are theſe? I a Miſtreſs at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and of this name?

                           <q>For my part, <hi>replies the ſubtle Duenna,</hi> I find my ſelf inclin'd to believe, that what you ſay may be true; but your main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is to bring my Lady to that perſuaſion. I know her to be of ſuch an humour as not eaſily to quit a reſentment, which ſhe entertains upon juſt grounds, and I much queſtion whether ſhe will admit your addreſſes any further, for I know ſhe hath acquainted her Father withall, and he is gone to a Gentleman of <hi>Sevil,</hi> an intimate friend of his, who is now in this City. </q>
                           <q>I am very glad of it, <hi>ſays Don Pedro,</hi> for he will find it to be an abſolute impoſture, and that there is not any Lady in <hi>Sevil</hi> that goes under the name of <hi>Donna Elvira de Monſalvo.</hi> But I beſeech you tell me, Madam, whether your intimacy be very great with the Lady <hi>Donna Brianda.</hi> 
                           </q>

                           <q>If it be ſo, <hi>ſays Don Pedro,</hi> it's poſſible you may procure me the favour from her, that I may vindicate my ſelf. </q>
                           <q>I much queſtion whether ſhe will ever ſpeak to you again, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> for ſhe is extreamly incens'd againſt you, and when once angry, if juſtly, ſhe is the hardeſt to be appeas'd that ever I knew. </q>
                           <q>But, ſaid he, if you are ſo much in her favour, you may prevail ſomewhat with her, by repreſenting to her the extraordinary affection I bear her. </q>
                           <q>It is in my power, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> to do with her what you deſire; but what will you give me if I can procure you a

                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> would ſee the iſſue of it, and ſo brought him what he deſired. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> kept his word with her; nay either out of ignorance of the form of ſuch obligations, or to make a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his earneſtneſs that ſhe ſhould aſſiſt him, he prov'd ſo liberal, as to give her a Blank ſign'd and ſeal'd, not mentioning the ſumme whereto he oblig'd himſelf, telling her he had not ſpecifi'd it, out of a deſign to requite her beyond his promiſes, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the ſervice ſhe ſhould do him, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Miſtreſs's favour. She ſaw this happen'd according to her wiſhes, ſo that acknowledging the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:58823:138"/>
favour <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had done her, ſhe promis'd him her utmoſt endeavours to deſerve it, by recovering him into the favour of his Miſtreſs. The amorous Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier believ'd her, and took his leave. <hi>Albert</hi> coming in ſoon after, <hi>Victoria</hi> gave him an account of what progreſs ſhe had made, and putting into his hands the Blank ſign'd by <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> bid him write above his name a formal promiſe of marriage, dating it about the time of his being at her Country houſe near <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> with two witneſſes: which <hi>Albert</hi> did, imitating as near as he could <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s hand.</p>
                        <p>That day, <hi>Don Juan</hi> fail'd to meet the Gentleman of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and put off the viſit he intended him till the next. In the mean time, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that ſhe was reſolv'd to lead Apes in hell, rather than have <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to her husband. Having already truſted her <hi>Duenna</hi> with ſome of her ſecrets, ſhe thought ſhe might make an abſolute diſcovery of her ſelf to her, and thereupon told her, how that before her Father had treated of a marriage between her and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> ſhe had been courted by a perſon of Honour, named <hi>Don Sancho de Leyba;</hi> that ſhe had ſome inclination towards him; and that the perſuaſions of her Father had prevail'd with her to entertain the applications of <hi>Don Pedro;</hi> but having diſcover'd his unworthineſs, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to re-addreſs her affection to <hi>Don Sancho.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> was almoſt out of her ſelf for joy to hear that news, for it put her into a confidence that her deſign would take: and the more to promote it, ſhe diſpos'd <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> as much as lay in her power to favour <hi>Don Sancho.</hi> 
                           <q>He muſt needs be diſpleas'd with me, <hi>ſays ſhe to her,</hi> yet I doubt not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:58823:139"/>
but a Letter from me will re-engage him my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant.</q> The crafty <hi>Duenna</hi> proffer'd to be the bearer of it, on condition ſhe might do it by Coach. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> was very glad to find her Woman ſo ready to ſerve her, eſpecially in a buſineſs which ſhe was ſo much pleas'd with; and ſo ſhe commanded a Coach to be made ready, and that ſhe ſhould go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſee <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> to whom ſhe writ a Letter. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> took Coach, pretending to go to <hi>Don Sancho</hi>'s houſe, but ſhe went to her own, and bid the Coach-man return to <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> and tell her, that for fear notice might be taken of the Coach, ſhe would go afoot to the place where ſhe had ſent her, conducted by <hi>Santillana</hi> her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Father. From that houſe, ſhe writ two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one, to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> deſiring him to come to her; the other to <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> to the ſame effect, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to find the houſe.</p>
                        <p>While the Letters were carried abroad, ſhe put off her Widows habit, and put on that of a perſon of the higheſt quality, expecting theſe two viſits with the accuſtomed ceremonies of <hi>Spain. Don Sancho de Leyba</hi> was not long a coming, though he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the perſon who had written to him. There had not paſt many complements between him and <hi>Donna Victoria,</hi> but word was brought her, that <hi>Don Juan de la Cerda</hi> was alighted out of his Coach, and was coming into the houſe. Sir, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> I am oblig'd to ſpeak with the perſon who is coming up all alone. Not but that you may hear the diſcourſe we ſhall have together; and therefore let me intreat you to ſtand behind this Curtain, whence you will hear all we ſay, for it concerns you more
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:58823:139"/>
than you imagine, and will prove to your advantage. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> compli'd, not knowing what might be the iſſue of this precaution.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Don Juan</hi> came in, and having taken a ſeat, <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> (whom he knew not as ſhe was then dreſs'd) addreſs'd her ſelf to him with this diſcourſe. <q>I doubt not, Sir, but you ſomewhat wonder, you ſhould be intreated hither by a Letter, and that from a perſon not known to you. To recover you from that confuſion, I will give you an account of my ſelf. I was born in the Imperial City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> the onely Daughter of the Houſe from which I am deſcended, and Heir thereof. I am of the Family of <hi>Sylva,</hi> ſo well known all over <hi>Spain,</hi> that I need ſay nothing of it. As to my quality, I am to tell you farther, that my Father was, in his time, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd with the Order of St. <hi>James,</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of that of <hi>Alcantara,</hi> with the command of a Troop of Horſe under his Majeſty in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Upon his death, I retir'd to a Country-houſe I have near <hi>Toledo,</hi> where I liv'd privately, contenting my ſelf with the innocent enjoyments of a Country life, without the leaſt acquaintance of any thing of Love, till that, one morning a Shepherd of mine brought to my houſe, two men, who had been robb'd and ſtripp'd the night before by certain High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I took compaſſion on them, eſpecially him, who by his demeanor ſeem'd to be the Maſter, and out of two cheſts of cloaths my Brother had left, I furniſh'd them with two ſutes, wherewith they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their nakedneſs. They ſeem'd to be very thankful for ſo ſeaſonable a favour; but the more conſiderable of the two hath treated me very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:58823:140"/>
which is the ordinary ſtyle of Courtiers, and hath required my charitable offices onely with flatteries and deceit. I was ſo ſimple as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joll'd, by the careſſes he made me, during four days that I kept him at my houſe, and he prevail'd ſo far with me, that I was no longer at my own diſpoſal. The reiterated oaths and proteſtations of a perſon of that worth, rais'd me into a perſuaſion that he really lov'd me, and that induc'd me to love him again; to be ſhort, upon a promiſe he made me of marriage, he got me in an humour to grant him the greateſt of favours. He made me believe that his going to Court was for the proſecution of ſome Law-buſineſs that concern'd him very highly. He deſir'd my leave to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> promiſing to return again in a ſhort time, but with ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of love as might eaſily have prevail'd with one who had not fanci'd him ſo affectionately as I had done. I ſuppli'd him with all things neceſſary, and he left me extremely troubled at his departure. Now, by a Picture and Letter he left behind him under the bolſter, I found that the occaſion of his coming to this Court was in order to a marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him, and that miracle of Beauty, <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> your Daughter. Now our Honour being the moſt conſiderable thing we ought to be tender of, I could do no leſs, upon this procedure of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> than reſolve to come to this Court, and to apply my ſelf to my friends, that, by their favour, I might croſs the marriage he is about, and you will find, that I may eaſily do it, if you but ſee what Cards I have to play. I conceiv'd my firſt overture ſhould be to acquaint you with my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:58823:140"/>
the diſhonour I have run into by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and his treachery towards me, that receiving it from my own mouth, you may not bee too forward to conclude what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready reſolv'd between you, as I have underſtood. With the Paper I have here in my hand, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute him to the utmoſt; it is under his own hand and ſeal, and witneſſes to it: be pleas'd, Sir, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it, and ſee whether I have not reaſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute this ungrateful and perjur'd man, and to force him to a performance of the promiſe he hath made me.</q>

                           <hi>Don Juan</hi> was aſtoniſh'd at this relation of <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s, and, by what was put into his hands, found out the diſpoſition of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and concluded him a fickle imprudent perſon, who purſu'd his enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without any thought of the conſequences thereof, and thereupon he reſolv'd there ſhould be no further talk of any marriage between him and his Daughter. Opening the Paper which <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> had given him, he found in it theſe words.</p>

For though you ſee me in this houſe, (which was taken upon my account) I live in hers, waiting on her in the quality of a <hi>Duenna,</hi> a part I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd, the better to elude <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and to do all ſay in my power to put him out of my Miſtreſs's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: and I have alſo brought that ſo far about, that I am confident there will never be any marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and ſhe is wholly inclin'd to favour you. Now conſider with your ſelf what you would have me to ſay to your Miſtreſs, for I am juſt going to put on my Widows habit, and I muſt return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and am afraid ſhe will think I have ſtaid too long. If you will return her an Anſwer, you have here all things requiſite to do it. I think it were fit you ſhould, that <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> may ſee, I have punctually obey'd her commands. As to the ſecret of my diſguiſe, I pray keep it ſuch, for it concerns me, that it ſhould not be diſcover'd a while. I rely on your diſcretion, and, knowing you to be a perſon of Honour and worth, I preſume you will not diſcover it.</q>

                        <p>This diſcourſe very much ſurpriz'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> who took occaſion to commend her courage and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, and return'd her his moſt humble thanks, for the favour ſhe had done him, in entruſting him with the ſecret of her Love, and prayed Heaven to give him life to acknowledge and require ſo great an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. He promis'd her not to diſcover any thing till ſhe commanded him to do it; and thereupon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in haſte to be gone, he writ a Letter in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to what he had receiv'd from his Miſtreſs, full of amorous complements, and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="275" facs="tcp:58823:142"/>
In the mean time <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> extremely reſenting the impoſture put upon him, acquainted his Couſin <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> with it, whereupon they went both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s. He not being within, they ask'd for <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> who came out without any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to receive their viſit, that it might be the ſhorter; for ſhe had no great mind to ſee <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> The poor Gentleman endeavour'd to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſwearing a thouſand oaths, that he never heard of any Lady in <hi>Sevil,</hi> of the name mentioned in the Letter, and that no doubt ſome envious perſon had put this trick upon him: and that if <hi>Don Juan</hi> ſhould upon enquiry find it to be true, he would be content to loſe his honour and life, nay more, the hopes of ever enjoying her.</p>
                        <p>The earneſtneſs of his diſcourſe put <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda</hi> into ſome doubt, that what ſhe had heard was ſome impoſture advanc'd purpoſely to obſtruct his pretenſions, and referr'd it to her Father to make a full diſcovery thereof. Her Anſwer to them was, that ſhe was not at her own diſpoſal, that it was her duty, to comply with that of her Father, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſhe could not quit the ill-impreſſion ſhe had receiv'd of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> till ſhe were better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Truth: that her Father would come in ere long, and that ſhe could take no reſolution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his orders, in a buſineſs of ſo great importance.</p>
                        <p>While they were engag'd in this diſcourſe, <hi>Don Juan</hi> comes in from the viſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had made to <hi>Donna Victoria. Don Rodrigo</hi> made him a ſhort relation of what had happen'd, and renew'd to him the juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which his Couſin had reaſon to make of the crime laid to his charge. Whereupon both deſiring him to hold his hand, at leaſt till there were an exact
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:58823:143"/>
enquiry made into the buſineſs, he deſir'd them to ſit down, and gave them this Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Gentlemen, I went out in hopes to be inform'd by ſome friends of <hi>Sevil,</hi> now here, whether that which is imputed to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> were true, and I could not meet with them: but if I had found them, it's poſſible they might know nothing of the buſineſs, for <hi>Sevil</hi> is a great City, and ſome parts of it lye at ſuch a diſtance from others, that they may well be accounted different places. What I found moſt certain is, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> hath made a promiſe of Marriage to a Lady of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him at a Country-houſe of hers, after he had been robb'd by certain Thieves; and what is yet more to be conſider'd, ſhe thought it not much to ſecure his affection by the forfeiture of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I have it from the Lady her ſelf, who ſent for me, and ſhew'd me the promiſe under his hand, which ſince we all know, there can be no evaſion.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>He thereupon ſhew'd it to both the Couſins, who were both at ſuch a loſs that they knew not what to ſay, eſpecially <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who ſufficiently betray'd his guilt by his aſtoniſhment, but ſwore withall that he had not made that promiſe under his own name, but under a feigned. But <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> knowing all the circumſtances of the buſineſs, was moſt liberal of his reproaches to his Couſin, which raiſing a certain compaſſion in <hi>Don Juan,</hi> forc'd this diſcourſe from him. <hi>Signor Don Pedro,</hi> 
                           <q>We find by many expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, that a young Man, once fallen in Love, will do any thing to obtain his deſires. That Love ſhould overcome you, I wonder not at all; but what occaſions my aſtoniſhment, is, that you ſhould have the confidence to addreſs your ſelf to a perſon
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:58823:143"/>
of the quality this Lady is of, and diſhonour her, without ever conſidering, that, in time, ſhe might acquaint her friends therewith, who would be ſure to revenge the affront. And what adds to this aſtoniſhment, is, that you durſt do ſuch an action when you were coming hither purpoſely in order to your matching with my Daughter, for whom, if any credit may be given your Letters, you preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have a paſſionate affection. I ſee not how your heart could be capable of ſuch a competition of paſſions, that you ſhould pretend the greateſt inclinations imaginable for one, and treat of a marriage with another. Being a perſon of Honour, I doubt not but you will make it appear in your actions, and that is, that you ſtand to the promiſe you made to the Lady <hi>Victoria,</hi> though it were onely out of this conſideration, that it argues a more generous nature to do that willingly, which muſt otherwiſe unwillingly be done. The Lady is not ſo deſtitute of Friends as you haply imagine; ſhe is now at <hi>Madrid,</hi> come expreſly to recover her debt, which no doubt ſhe will; and her cauſe being ſo juſt, 'tis not likely ſhe will want aſſiſtance. My advice is, that you endeavour to prevent the ill reports which the buſineſs muſt raiſe of you; perform what you have promis'd, and let not your Love to my Daughter blind you any further, for I am reſolv'd to ſhut her up in a Cloiſter, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her Life, rather than ſhe ſhall ever be your Wife.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With that he roſe up, and, without any comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, went into another room. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, and the two Couſins, without ſo much as a word exchang'd, went home, where <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi>
                           <pb n="278" facs="tcp:58823:144"/>
fell into bitter expoſtulations with his Couſin, for his engaging himſelf in ſo unworthy an action. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had nothing to reply, but that he was aſtoniſh'd how that promiſe came to be ſign'd with his own name, having made it onely under a ſuppoſititious.</p>
                        <p>Leaving them in that confuſion, making ſeveral reflections on the adventure, let us return to the feign'd Waiting-woman, who was got back to <hi>Don Juan</hi>'s, and had deliver'd <hi>Don Sancho</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Donna Brianda.</hi> She was infinitely ſatisfy'd with it, as fearing he would not have been ſo eaſily retriv'd into her ſervice. <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> acquainted her, how that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and his Couſin had been there; what had paſs'd between them and her Father; and that he had abſolutely diſmiſs'd them, it being diſcover'd, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had committed another impertinence, and had made a promiſe of Marriage to a Lady of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who was come expreſs to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his pretenſions to her. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the greateſt aſtoniſhment in the world, and burſt forth into imprecations againſt <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time there came a meſſage to <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> from a She-Couſin of hers, inviting her to a Comedy which was to be repreſented at her Houſe, that night, whereto ſhe ſent Anſwer, that ſhe would come. <hi>Donna Victoria</hi> having made ſo ſucceſsful a progreſs in her buſineſs, bethought her ſelf of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention that ſhould bring it to an abſolute period, for ſhe had the management of all. She told <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> that if ſhe pleas'd to wave her going to the Comedy ſhe might have a meeting that night with <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> in a ſecure place, to wit at her Father's houſe, where ſhe might do what ſhe pleas'd her ſelf. The Lady had a great kindneſs for <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:58823:144"/>
was deſirous to prevent the reproaches he might make upon her former diſcarding of him, and ſo ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the proffer made by her Woman. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for <hi>Santillana,</hi> and gave him a Letter for <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> whereby he was deſir'd to come that night at eight to <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s houſe. He was ſent with another to <hi>Don Pedro de Ribera,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of her Father, and what ſhe her ſelf had ſaid, was reſolv'd ſecretly to marry him, and deſir'd to meet him that night, at a Houſe, whither the Bearer would bring him, and that he ſhould not fail to be there at nine. The two Cavaliers kindly receiv'd their Letters, eſpecially <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who being but a little before diſmiſs'd, was re-call'd to joyn hands with <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> and imagin'd it done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Waiting-Gentlewoman, to whom he thought himſelf infinitely oblig'd, and the preſent he had made her well beſtow'd. The two Gallants fail'd not to be there at the time appointed, and in the mean time <hi>Donna Brianda</hi> and her Woman took Coach, leaving <hi>Don Juan</hi> at home, ready to go to bed. They went to <hi>Donna Victoria</hi>'s houſe, which ſeem'd to be that of <hi>Santillana,</hi> where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by <hi>Marcella, Victoria</hi>'s maid, who went under the name of her Step-mother. While <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda</hi> was expecting the arrival of <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> ſhe ſent <hi>Albert</hi> with a Letter to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe words.</p>

                           <hi>Santillana</hi> was diſpatch'd away with this Letter, and order'd not to deliver it till half an hour after nine, which he did. In the mean time <hi>Don Sancho</hi> fail'd not to come, preciſely at his time, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his Miſtreſs, who gave him ſuch ſatisfaction as ſilenc'd all his complaints. <hi>Victoria</hi> left them together in a room, where ſhe lock'd them in. Not long after came <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> according to the time appointed him, and was receiv'd by <hi>Victoria,</hi> who diſpos'd him into a room, without light, alledging it concern'd him, that he were not ſeen; that he ſhould forbear making any noiſe, and that it would not be long ere his Miſtreſs came to him. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to obey her in all things, and ſtaid there ſo long
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:58823:145"/>
as that <hi>Victoria</hi> might ſhift her ſelf into Cloaths ſuitable to her quality. That done, ſhe went into the room, and ſpeaking very low, it was no hard matter for her to deceive <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was very much in his Miſtreſs's favour.</p>
                        <p>Leaving theſe young people thus match'd let us return to <hi>Don Juan,</hi> who receiv'd the Letter from the <hi>Duenna</hi> juſt as he was getting into bed. The old Gentleman was extreamly ſurpris'd thereat, and going out of doors, attended by <hi>Albert,</hi> he went to the Commiſſary's houſe, which was hard by. The afflicted Man acquainted him what poſture things were in; whereupon the Commiſſary taking ſome of his people about him, they went to <hi>Albert</hi>'s houſe, where, after ſome knocking, they were let in. They happily had a Lantern with them, and it did them good ſervice, for they found the Houſe without any light. They lighted a Torch, and went into ſeveral rooms, in one whereof finding <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and <hi>Donna Brianda,</hi> the Commiſſary ask'd them what they did there? <hi>Don Sancho</hi> told him he was there with his Wife, which was confirm'd by <hi>Donna Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda. Don Juan</hi> would have run him through; but the Commiſſary telling him ſhe was not with the perſon he imagin'd, that that Gentleman was <hi>Don Sancho de Leyba,</hi> a perſon of great quality and well known about the Court, <hi>Don Juan</hi> could do no leſs than approve of their Marriage, though 'twere onely out of a ſatisfaction, that ſhe was not fallen into the hands of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> whom he hated extreamly, for the ſtrange pranks he had plaid.</p>
                        <p>They went thence into another room, which they found lock'd, and thereupon threatning to break open the door, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> open'd it within, and comes out

of you, for it is impoſſible, that thoſe who have once a ſight of your divine beauty ſhould not love you: I have ſeen it, and, ſubdu'd by your charms, am become a captive thereto, my liberty and all the powers and faculties of my ſoul being abſolutely at your diſpoſal. 'Tis a Victory, Madam, which you might eaſily obtain over hearts much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious againſt Love than mine is, which became your ſlave, upon the firſt ſight of thoſe two Suns; and this is a truth I ſhall never recant while I live.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The meaning of this Preamble is, to induce you to pardon me the offence I have committed againſt you. I now ingeniouſly acknowledge, that I am not the perſon I deſcrib'd in the account you oblig'd me to give me of my extraction, though it be true I was born in <hi>Valentia;</hi> but one meanly deſcended, yet of people of good repute. My Father got his livelihood by the labour of his hands, and the ſweat of his brows, being by profeſſion a Rope-maker. Me-thought I had ſome apprehenſions above my condition; and therefore unwilling to fall to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's laborious trade, I went into <hi>Caſteel,</hi> having before been in <hi>Andaluſia,</hi> and I made thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of my Travel and the converſation I met with, and improv'd the natural Talent I had ſo well, that I never wanted either friends or mony. I came to this City in the company of a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who had been a priſoner ſome time at <hi>Malaga,</hi> for ſome crime he would by no means acknowledge to me. The perſon hath oblig'd me, having born my charges all the way; nay more, he hath lent me mony, out of a confidence of the reality I had to ſerve him, in the ſecret trade we drove together. He declar'd his mind to me one
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:58823:147"/>
day, and advis'd me, by ſome pretence or other, to get into your houſe, for he knew you had good ſtore of mony, and was deſirous to disburthen you of ſome part of it. From the diſcourſe he made, I inferr'd, that he had been a priſoner at <hi>Malaga</hi> for ſome robbery. Now to compaſs our deſign, we pretended a quarrel, which ſhould oblige me to take refuge in your houſe: and in the mean time, you have entertain'd me with ſuch extraordinary kindneſs, and have ſo nobly oblig'd me, that I find the favours you have done me will fruſtrate <hi>Crispin</hi>'s intention. And therefore now that I acquaint you with the trick we deſign'd to put upon you, aſſure your ſelf I will endeavour to retort it upon himſelf, and get out of him what mony he hath, to chaſtiſe him for his folly. For heaven forbid I ſhould prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to a perſon who hath oblig'd me ſo highly as you have done. I have diſcover'd my Soul to you, diſpoſe of me now as you think fit, for I am reſolv'd to periſh, ere I ever conſent you ſhall receive any injury, though I have diſclaim'd the quality, I had unjuſtly aſſum'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rufina</hi> was extremely exaſperated againſt <hi>Criſpin,</hi> not ſo much for his deſign to be reveng'd on her for the prank ſhe plaid him at <hi>Malaga,</hi> but upon an apprehenſion that he might have acquainted <hi>Jaimo</hi> what kind of perſon ſhe was, and what trade ſhe drove. Whereupon conſdering that he had ſo inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly diſcover'd himſelf to her, and acknowledg'd even to the meanneſs of his birth, ſhe thought her ſelf oblig'd to do the like, and to give him a ſincere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her deſcent, courſe of life, friends, in a word, all her adventures, to her arrival at <hi>Toledo.</hi> But Love and Wine make people talk more than they ſhould.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:58823:148"/>
               <hi>Jaimo</hi> was glad that <hi>Rufina</hi> was no better deſcended than himſelf: that equality of condition not onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd a greater kindneſs, but begat thoughts of a match, between them. They reſolv'd to leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> and to take up their habitation at <hi>Madrid;</hi> but <hi>Rufina</hi> told him, ſhe would firſt be reveng'd of <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who intended to ſerve her ſuch a baſe trick. <hi>Jaimo</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took it, telling her, that under pretence of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and friendſhip, he might eaſily bring him into the nooſe, and not onely leave him mony-leſs, but alſo find him a good ſecure lodging, leſt he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to revenge himſelf.</p>
            <p>With this reſolution, leaving <hi>Rufina</hi>'s he went to <hi>Criſpin,</hi> whom he found at his lodging, not expecting to have ſeen him ſo ſoon. He was over-joy'd to heat how his Companion had inſinuated himſelf into <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina</hi>'s favour, whereupon the other telling him, that to make ſure work of her, he wanted a ſumme of mony, as well for expence, as to gain rhe Servants, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Hermite anſwered he ſhould not want it. By this means <hi>Jaimo</hi> thought to oblige him to a greater confidence of him, heightning the intended cheat with a thouſand oaths of an inviolable Friendſhip. Thus was that old experienc'd Turn-key of villany brought into a Fool's paradiſe; for, that <hi>Jaimo</hi> might live ſutably to the relation he had made of himſelf, he gave him a hundred pieces in gold, to be diſpos'd of as he pleas'd, hoping to have them return'd, attended with ſix times as many. He took them out of a bag where were five or ſix hundred more, ſome part of his former atchievments. <hi>Jaimo</hi> obſerv'd the place, where he put up that treaſure, and ſwore to himſelf, that he would not ſleep heartily till be had alter'd the property of that bag. While <hi>Criſpin</hi> was gone out
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:58823:148"/>
to give the Hoſteſs order for a brace of Partridges and a Rabet for his, and his Camerade's ſupper, he went to the port-manteu, wherein the mony was gariſon'd, and opening the chain (a thing he could do as clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly as any of his profeſſion) took out the bag, and diſpos'd it into a place, whence he might eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it at his departure. They ſupp'd very merrily, which ended, <hi>Jaimo</hi> tooke leave of <hi>Criſpin,</hi> putting him over head and ears in hope, that he would bring his deſign to a period.</p>
            <p>He went ſtraight to <hi>Rufina</hi>'s, who it may well be preſum'd, receiv'd him very kindly. He gave her an account what had paſs'd between him and <hi>Criſpin,</hi> and how he had with his own mony promoted the deſign he had to chouſe him. Being alone with her, he ſhew'd her the goodly pieces, for ſhe had a great affection to mony of that colour. <hi>Jaimo</hi> repreſented to her, how much it concern'd them to leave <hi>Toledo,</hi> before <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpin</hi> ſhould take notice of the loſs of his mony. <hi>Rufina</hi> told him, that ſhe knew an expedient for that, which was, to ſerve <hi>Criſpin</hi> such a trick at <hi>Toledo,</hi> as ſhe had done at <hi>Malaga.</hi> Having thereupon writ a large Letter to the Magiſtrate, whoſe province it is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſuch people, they ſet things in order for their departure, and met with two Wagons, then going for <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein they put their goods, taking onely the She-ſlave to wait on them. They went to the Court, where, as in a Sea, ſo many Rivers meet, having reſolv'd that <hi>Rufina</hi> ſhould not appear, till they had ſome news of <hi>Garay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving them there, let us ſee what was the effect of the Letter ſent to the Provoſt. As ſoon as he had read it, he went, according to the directions therein receiv'd, attended by ſome of his Officers, to <hi>Criſpin</hi>'s
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:58823:149"/>
lodging, who, impatiently expecting, that <hi>Jaim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> ſhould make his way into <hi>Rufina</hi>'s houſe, and thereby put him into poſſeſſion of all her mony, was taken in his chamber, and thence conducted to priſon. Not long before, one of the Judges of <hi>Malaga,</hi> had been at <hi>Toledo,</hi> to look for him, and not finding him, had left with the Provoſt ſome obſervations on his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy, by which, though the habit he then was in diſguiz'd him very much, it was more then preſum'd, that he was the perſon. They ſeiz'd on what he had in the houſe, among which he thought the Gold, which <hi>Jaimo</hi> had eas'd him of, had been, for he knew nothing of its departure, which happen'd well for the two Lovers, who were already diſlodg'd. The iſſue of his impriſonment, was, that, being put to the Torture, he could not keep his own counſel, and ſo was ſentenc'd to receive the reward of his confeſſions, Hanging. 'Twas Heaven's kindneſs towards him, that he ſhould end his days with ſome remorſe for his ſins, for though that be the ordinary <hi>exit</hi> of ſuch as engage themſelves in that wretched kind of life, yet are there many of them whoſe guilty ſouls, are, by ſword and piſtol, diſpatch'd into the other world, without the leaſt act of contrition. This was the end of poor <hi>Criſpin,</hi> who made a publick acknowledgment of all the robberies and villanies he had committed, while he was a Hermit, to the great edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He was alſo obſerv'd to have this generoſity, that he named not any perſon who had been engag'd with him in his deſigns; nay though he knew, the preſent misfortune had been procur'd him by his Friend <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> yet he Chriſtianly forgave him and all the world at his death.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Rufina</hi> and <hi>Jaimo</hi> were married
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58823:149"/>
as ſoon as they came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> but kept out of <hi>Garay</hi>'s fight. He went ſoon after to <hi>Alcala,</hi> where he had been told his Wife was, but finding her not, he ſtruck in with ſome of his own Profeſſion, and the reſult was, that being ſurpris'd in a Robbery, they were all condemn'd to the laſh, and ſix years recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Galleys. He was brought to the chain at <hi>Toledo,</hi> which eas'd his mind a little, for, thinking <hi>Rufina</hi> had been there ſtill, he writ a Letter to her, deſiring her, in regard ſhe had gotten all ſhe was worth by his co-operation and aſſiſtance, that ſhe would have compaſſion on him, and exempt him from that penance, by buying a Slave in his ſtead, a thing commonly practis'd. The Beater enquires for <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina,</hi> where he had directed, but the Neighbours told him, that ſhe had left <hi>Toledo;</hi> ſo that honeſt <hi>Garay,</hi> burthen'd with Iron, Years, and Hardſhip, came to have that relation to his Catholick Majeſty, which he and many others, though they juſtly deſerv'd it, little expected to be preferr'd to.</p>
            <p>On the contrary <hi>Don Jaimo</hi> liv'd like a Prince at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he ſoon met with ſome of his own Conſtitution, a ſort of people, who, like Foxes, never fare better than when they are moſt curſt. They committed ſome ſecret Robberies, with ſuch caution and induſtry, that the Authors thereof could never be diſcover'd, whereby they were ſo fleſh'd and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd, that they daily found out new deſigns. There was ſtarted up about this time at <hi>Madrid</hi> an excellent Company of Players, brought together by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive charge and liberality of a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> a perſon of vaſt Wealth. What his deſign was in it, I know not, whether he did it out of charity, or for his particular divertiſement, or upon ſome other account
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58823:150"/>
to me unknown; but he made it his buſineſs to ſee it furniſh'd with all things requiſite. He was deſirous they might have the advantages of the Feaſt of the B. Sacrament, at which time, the Players of the City may, during all the days of the <hi>Octave,</hi> repreſent their Plays in the open ſtreets, where all are welcome without paying; and this is done every year at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> at the time of that Feaſt. To effectuate his deſign, he bought them ſome new Plays of the beſt Poets in <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he paid well, and put upon ſome other pieces, for the accompliſhment of that famous Company. So that another Company, which was then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> being too weak to ſtand in competition with this, was forc'd to leave the City, and go to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had, from that Imperial City, the ordinary Salary for repreſenting the beſt pieces they had, at the ſame Feaſt. This new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had the whole Court to it ſelf, and the ſaid Grandee gave them by way of advance four thouſand Crowns, to provide Cloaths ſuitable to the Pieces they intended to repreſent. This ſum of money was brought into the Houſe of one of the Players, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and underſtanding perſon, for whom the reſt had ſuch reſpect, that all things paſs'd through his hands; he alſo took care for all things, and gave a very faithful account thereof. He diſpos'd this money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Cheſt, whereof he always carried the Key about him. <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s company ſoon had an inkling of it, and thinking it a noble prize to hook in that money, they propos'd ſeveral ways to compaſs it, but at laſt referr'd all their deliberations to <hi>Jaimo,</hi> whoſe advice they had, upon other occaſions, found the beſt. He deſir'd time to conſider till the next day. That night he ſpent in communicating the buſineſs to his Wife,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58823:150"/>
whom he acquainted with the ſeveral propoſals of his Camerades. She gave him infallible directions how the buſineſs ſhould be effected. <hi>Jaimo</hi> had the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being able to do ſomewhat in Poetry, upon which they laid the Plot, and it was approv'd by his Companions.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>Jaimo</hi> was clad like a Scholar newly come from the Univerſity, in a Caſſock and long Cloak very bare, and ſpotted in many places. Thus accoutred, he ſmelt as ſtrongly of the Poet as if he had fed on nothing but Verſes from his Mother's milk. They fitted his Noſe with a good large pair of Spectacles, which were faſten'd to his Ears with a Lute-ſtring, a thing very common in <hi>Spain,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd him with a huge broad-brimm'd Hat; in fine he had all things requiſite, to act the part of a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and extravagant Poet, which was the way they conceiv'd moſt likely to compaſs their deſign.</p>
            <p>He went thus to the Comedians, who were met at their Theatre, and upon the rehearſal of a piece, which was to be repreſented within three days. He addreſs'd himſelf to the perſon who had the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the Company, for he had enquir'd out his name, and coming to him with a great many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees, (after he had ask'd him how he did.) <q>I am a Poet, Sir, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> ſo you take it not ill.</q> The Comedian, as we told you, was a very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive perſon, and often had to do with ſuch phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms of extravagant Men, ſuch as <hi>Jaimo</hi> ſeem'd to be by that abrupt introduction. <q>Many years may you be ſo, Sir, <hi>repli'd he,</hi> aſſure your ſelf, it ſhall not trouble me at all. The deſign of my ſtudies, <hi>ſays the other,</hi> was to become eminent in Divinity, that ſo I might be capable of a good Benefice, in order
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58823:151"/>
to which I have already taken the degree of Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Divinity, in the Univerſity of <hi>Iracha,</hi> with the great applauſe of all my Country-men; for I am a <hi>Biſcayan,</hi> to ſerve God, and your illuſtrious Company. I was born at the Town of <hi>Ordugna,</hi> and I have the advantage to be alli'd to the moſt honourable families of that ancient place. I am known by the name of the Batchelour <hi>Dominico Joancho,</hi> and my fame is great in my own Country, which I told you is <hi>Biſcay.</hi> There it was (not ſlighting the Talent, which it hath pleas'd Heaven to give me <hi>gratis,</hi> by cauſing me to be born a Poet) that I addicted my ſelf to the ſtudy of Poetry, wherein I have been wonderfully fortunate; and finding that all people admir'd my works, and many were importunate with me to publiſh them, I would needs make a trial what kind of fancy I might have in the writing of Plays. Thoſe I have made are not ſuch as are now in Vogue, written by ſome Novice Poets as I may call them; No, I thank <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Muſes,</hi> mine are of a kind of extraordinary ſtile, and I can furniſh you with a dozen at leaſt ready for the Stage. I am come to this Court, where there are excellent Wits, and I have had the honour to be eſteem'd here according to my worth, and I may without vanity affirm it, that the moſt humorous Judgements have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that my perfections are more than ordinary. But I think it my greateſt happineſs, Sir, that I flouriſh in the ſame Age with ſo noble and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious a Company, which may be called the Flower of all thoſe that ever were in <hi>Spain,</hi> in whoſe ſervice I would employ the Talent God hath beſtow'd on me, if your ſelf, and the reſt of your honourable
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58823:151"/>
Company be ſo pleas'd. What number of Plays I have promis'd you, all of my own Writing, you need but call for. As to the price, you are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that we ſhall not diſagree: Be pleas'd, Sir, to honour me ſo far, as to make me acquainted with the reſt of your Company, that they may give me their ſence, as to what I propoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Comedian was of an humour much different from many others of that Quality, who, when a Poet, whom they know not, comes to preſent them with a Comedy, ſlight him ſo far as that they will not ſo much as give him audience, as if that Divine Power, which hath inſpir'd thoſe that are in Vogue, had confin'd his gifts to them, and had nothing left to beſtow on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But this Comedian, I ſay, was of a very jovial and pleaſant humour, and was glad of any ſuch occaſion to divert himſelf. So that meaſuring the inſide of the perſon by his out-ſide and diſcourſe, he told him, that he did them a tranſcendent honour, and that he gave him thanks in the name of the whole company. Then turning about to his Companions, <q>Gentlemen, <hi>ſaid he to them,</hi> be pleas'd to take notice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Batchelor <hi>Dominico Joancho,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Biſcay</hi> and moſt excellent Poet, whoſe produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the Theatre are beyond all admiration, and who proffers to exhauſt his precious vein for our's, having already finiſh'd at leaſt a dozen pieces, which he hath a deſire to ſhew us.</q> The other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians, by the diſcourſe of their Camerade, and by the ill equipage, and worſe looks of the perſon, eaſily diſcover'd, that he and his wits were at a little diſtance, which oblig'd them to pretend, that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly engag'd to him, and ſo they all gave him, one after another, a very civil ſalute, which he very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomely
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58823:152"/>
return'd. He who had firſt ſpoken to him, ask'd him, whether he would have the patience till they had done rehearſing, which would not be long, in regard they had gone over it three or four times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had now but ſome particular Scenes to look over, and then they would ſee ſome of his Pieces, if he would be pleas'd to communicate them; which he promis'd to do. He took a chair and ſate very quietly till the Rehearſal was over. By that time they had made an end, it was ſo near night, that they could not well do any thing without candles. They call'd for ſome, and ſitting all about him, they deſir'd him to read the titles of the twelve Comedies, which he ſaid were ready for the Stage. The counterfeit Author, who acted his part very pleaſantly, took a Paper out of his Pocket, and read to them, as followeth.</p>

               <q>Theſe, <hi>ſays he,</hi> are the twelve Comedies I have already finiſh'd: I would not willingly have any of them repreſented before the laſt, becauſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is of my own Country, and it is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Comedy, the contrivances of it are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I need give you no further commendation of it, than that it hath coſt me abundance of oil and time, and that I bit my nails above a hundred times at the writing of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Comedians had much ado to keep their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, for they could hardly forbear laughing at extravagant Titles of the Comedies, and wiſh'd they had had more time to enjoy the converſation of the <hi>Biſcain</hi> Poet. He who had ſpoken to him firſt, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thanks in the name of the whole company; <q>I am infinitely glad, Sir, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that I have had the honour of coming to the knowledge of you, from your own ſelf, for till now, I muſt, to my ſhame, acknowledge, that I had not ſo much as heard of your illuſtrious name: you will injure your ſelf extremely, if you do not make the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> ſenſible of your excellent parts. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to intreat you, in the name of our whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that you will be pleas'd to honour us with that Piece of yours, which you conceive moſt likely to take, though we queſtion not but your reputation is even beyond your own expreſſions of it. You know the cuſtom of Poets, when they are firſt to appear on the Stage, which is, to preſent it with the firſt Piece <hi>gratis;</hi> for what we ſhall receive from you afterwards, you ſhall be ſatisfi'd according to our agreement, and it is poſſible, they may pleaſe ſo well, that we ſhall act onely yours, for one year at leaſt; and rather than we ſhall be behind-hand

with you, we ſhall not ſtick to borrow mony, though at ever ſo great intereſt. 'Tis now late, and ſupper-time calls us away, which ended, we ſhall have more leiſure to diſcourſe further, if you pleaſe to give me and my Companions the meeting at my chamber. There we hope you will communicate to us your thoughts of that Comedy, which you ſhall be pleas'd to recommend to us. If you leave it to my choice, as it is fit you ſhould, <hi>repli'd he,</hi> the <hi>Seignoreſs of Biſcay</hi> ſhall be the firſt I will read to you, for I have a confidence, by that, to raiſe my ſelf into the reputation of a good Author, and to acquire the eſteem of this Court.</q> He who was the Speaker of the Company, ſaid to him, <q>Will you be pleas'd, Sir, to give me a little ſatisfaction as to the Title of that Comedy; you call it, <hi>The Seignoreſs,</hi> whereby me-thinks it ſhould rather have been <hi>The Lady of Biſcay,</hi> that being a more uſual tearm. </q>
               <q>You are very much in the right, <hi>replies the feign'd Poet;</hi> but I do it purpoſely, for the King entitles himſelf onely Seignor of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and not Prince, Duke, Earl, or Marqueſs: beſides I have another reaſon, why I do not call her <hi>Lady,</hi> but <hi>Seignoreſs,</hi> which is, that it rhimes with <hi>Princeſs,</hi> and all other words of the like termination. To this I may adde, that the word is new, and you know the times are ſuch now, that all the world runs after Novelties, even to the very loweſt ſort of people, who expreſs a certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt towards things common and trivial.</q>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58823:153"/>
ſome others here preſent may be glad of ſuch dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as I onely am able to give them. </q>
               <q>Your moſt humble Servant, <hi>ſays the Comedian,</hi> then for their better information who you conceive may want it, give me leave to tell you, that I am not ſatisfi'd as to the title of one of your Plays, I mean that which you call <hi>Noah's Ark,</hi> I cannot imagine how you can accommodate that Piece to the Theatre, nor who can be the Actors, for I ſee but very few can be brought to ſpeak in it. </q>
               <q>I muſt pardon your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of my deſign, <hi>replies the Poet,</hi> for if you knew it, you would admire the invention, which is wholly new. I bring in as Actors in that Piece all thoſe Creatures that are taught to ſpeak, as Parrats, Mag-pies, Jays, Starlings, Daws, and others, a thing never ſeen before, and which, for its novelty, muſt needs be admir'd.</q>

            <p>They could hardly forbear laughing at his former diſcourſes, but this humour was ſo pleaſant, that it was impoſſible to hold, which oblig'd the Author to ask them very ſeriouſly what they laugh'd at. <q>You ſee, Sir, <hi>ſays the Speaker,</hi> how likely this Novelty is to take with the people, ſince it makes us ſo merry, out of a conceit, that we ſhall make a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby. </q>
               <q>No doubt of it, <hi>ſays the Poet.</hi> But no more, of the titles of my other Pieces, let us talk onely of that which I would have repreſented firſt. I ſhall hereafter, at more leiſure, ſatisfie the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties you have to propoſe concerning the other titles, whereof I ſhall give you the explication. </q>
               <q>It ſhall be ſo, <hi>ſaid he who had ſpoken to him;</hi> to which purpoſe, we ſhall deſire your company at my houſe anon after ſupper, where we ſhall all be ready to entertain you. </q>Whereupon he took his leave, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing he would not fail to be with them.</p>

Having made this progreſs in his buſineſs, he went and gave his Camerades an account thereof, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to wait about his houſe where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was. He undertook to keep the Company in play, while they ſhould do their work, which they would not be long about, having all the implements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for men of their profeſſion. The Comedians, on the other ſide, prepar'd all things to ſhew him ſuch a trick, as his extravagance deſerv'd, getting ſome ſquibs and crackers made, to frighten him, if 'twere poſſible, out of the little wit he had.</p>
            <p>His hour being come, he went to his houſe who had invited him, to read the <hi>Seignoreſs.</hi> He who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him had provided what he thought requiſite to make ſport enough that night for the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The chief Comedian, ſeeing they were all met, told them that the Room was too narrow for the whole Company, and that they were better to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their meeting at the Theatre, where they ſhould not be diſturb'd. The feign'd Poet was glad to hear the propoſition, and ſeconded it, inaſmuch as, the coaſt being clear, his Camerades might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpatch their buſineſs. It happen'd according to his wiſhes, for the Miſtreſs of the houſe, who had heard her husband and others of the Company talk of the extravagant Poet, and how they intended to ſerve him, would needs ſee the ſport, and leſt it might be late ere they return'd home, ſhe took all the ſervants, both men and maids, along with her; ſo that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was clearly diſmantled. They brought the Poet to the Theatre with a great deal of ceremony, and plac'd him at the end of a Table, on which there were two candles. Having taken the Comedy out of his pocket, and the Company ſilently expecting, after
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58823:154"/>
two or three grave Hems, he began to read thus.</p>

                        <p>Well, Sir, <hi>ſays the Comedian,</hi> I have ſeen many Comedies in my time, but never any that had ſuch extraordinary particulars as yours. How do you imagine I ſhould find ſeven young Maids, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo near the Court? Sir, <hi>ſays the Poet,</hi> no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit comes in without charge; but you need not be ſo ſcrupulous, they will not be ſearch'd, to try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they really be ſuch or not, though 'twere more convenient they ſhould. Nay there is yet another expedient, which is, to have them in Perſpective, or in Scenes, and artificially mov'd to dance the Ball; but to do well, they ſhould be alive. There you give us ſome comfort, <hi>ſays the Comedian,</hi> for we may make up that number out of our Company, if thoſe will ſerve who appear not upon the Stage: but I ſhall not undertake they will be ſuch as you would have them. Now, Sir, if you pleaſe, let's have a little of your way in carrying on the deſign of this Piece.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt Scene, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> comes out <hi>Don Ochoa,</hi> Sutor to the Seignoreſs, and <hi>Gozenego,</hi> Tom-Ladle, his man, in country cloaths, with each of them a good thick riding hood, or Capouche, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Umbrello. How, <hi>ſays the Comedian,</hi> what need is there of the Paraſol, or Umbrello, if they have Capouches? I ſee, <hi>ſays the Poet,</hi> you are not much acquainted with the temperature of the climate of <hi>Biſcay.</hi> In ſummer, Sir, there are ſuch furious deluges of waters, as if the sky were broken to pieces; preſently after, there comes ſuch a ſcorching Sun, as will ſet a man's brains a boiling in

            <p>He then began to read the verſes, but after ſuch a ridiculous and extravagant manner, that when he had gone over about an hundred of them, the Players per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the Piece contain'd many ſheets, cloſe written, and tir'd with the impertinence of what they had already heard, and withall that they had ſpent moſt part of the night ſo trivially, interrupted the Reciter with a kind of a buzzing noiſe. That was the Cue which the feign'd Batchelor expected, yet ſeeming to be angry at it, he clapp'd both hands on the Table with ſuch violence, that he ſhook the two Candleſticks, and cri'd out with a loud voice, <hi>Tacete, Tacete.</hi> But the Players and others that were preſent, not underſtanding the Latine, the noiſe increas'd, the table was over-turn'd, and the Candles were put out, and then all retiring from him, they ſet fire to the train they had laid for the poor Poet. He found himſelf encompaſs'd by a number of ſquibs and crackers, and long bags full of ſand like ſnakes, all in open hoſtility againſt him. He was in a very ſad pickle, for there was nothing but confuſion on the Theatre, beſides the flames of roſin which came up from beneath the Stage, and were ready to choke him, inſomuch that to cure him of all future thoughts of Poetry, there needed onely a gentle toſſing in a blanket. He ſeem'd to take it very unkindly, that he had been brought thither, to receive ſuch an affront, for beſides the danger his tinder Cloak and Caſſock had been in of a general conflagration, he loſt the Comedy, than whichthere could not a greater loſs happen to him. The Epilogue of the Piece was, that <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s companions, while the Company was thus
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:58823:156"/>
entertain'd at the Theatre, had found a way into the Comedian's houſe, and plaid the Ferrets in all the rooms, and examin'd the cheſts and trunks that ſtood in their way, in one whereof they found the mony they look'd for, which they cleaverly carried to <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s houſe, where it was very fairly divided; and in regard <hi>Jaimo</hi>'s wife had been the inventreſs of the Plot, ſhe had an equal ſhare with thoſe who had been emploi'd in the execution of it.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Comedian going to take up certain ſtuffs for cloaths, was not a little aſtoniſh'd to find the cheſt open, and the mony fled. He was for a while at ſuch a loſs, that he knew not where he was. At laſt, he ask'd his wife who had been in the houſe? whereto ſhe could give him no account at all. He ſent people to abroad to ſearch, and acquainted the Magiſtrate with what had happen'd. The neareſt ſtreets to the houſe were viſited, but to no purpoſe. The poor Comedian went to relate his misfortune to the Grandee, of whom he had receiv'd that preſent. But he thinking it a cheat of the Comedians, would not believe him. He fell ſick out of pure diſcontent, and kept his bed, and then began to doubt it was a trick put upon him by that feign'd Poet, for whom he immediately caus'd a ſearch to be made; but he could never be found, for he and his Companions had taken a courſe for that. Theſe things being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Lord, who had beſtow'd the mony on them, he was ſo generous as to ſupply them with the like ſum.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Officers were ſtill upon duty, to ſee, whether, ſearching for the Poet, they ſhould meet with the Author of the Robbery. The indiſpos'd Comedian recover'd upon the ſight of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58823:157"/>
Mony's return into the cheſt. <hi>Jaimo</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had a conſultation how they might trapan the Comedian of that recrute, but when it was propos'd to <hi>Rufina,</hi> who had always a voice in the Conclave, 'twas immediately quaſh'd, and ſhe prevail'd with her Husband to leave <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſince they had mony enough to retire elſe-where, and drive ſome trade therewith. <hi>Jaimo</hi> took her advice, and ſo leaving <hi>Madrid,</hi> they went into <hi>Arragon,</hi> and planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Saragoſſa,</hi> the Metropolis of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They took a Houſe, and kept a Silk-ſhop, ſpending ſome time in that employment. What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they were engag'd in during their abode their, and upon what account they were forc'd to remove thence ſhall be the ſubject of a Second Part of this work; wherein the Reader ſhall find <hi>Rufina,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in ſubtilty by experience, contriving and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing cheats much more pleaſant and more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, than any ſhe hath been hitherto concern'd in, with a little aſſiſtance from her Husband <hi>Don Jaimo.</hi>
