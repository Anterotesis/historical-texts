            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have given my thoughts in anſwer to theſe enſuing <hi>18</hi> Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſo I might give ſome ſatisfaction to thoſe doubts that may ariſe in the minds of divers good men, affected to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys Rights, and ſafeties, in theſe times of great anxiety, dangers, and animoſities, one towards another, and that truth may take place, and all may endeavour to underſtand one the other, by a faithful approaching to, and aſſerting, their Native Rights, and may not be withdrawn from them upon any pretences whatſoever; without which ſtanding for their Rights, there can be no true ground to expect Juſtice, Love, and Unity. It is true, Calamities in Nations do oftentimes fall out to be beſt diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when they are deſperate and most incurable; But however, though the difficultie be great, to amend a diſtracted Nation, yet it is all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to extend our endeavours to ſave our Countrey, and leave the ſucceſs to the Almighty; and in ſo doing, the diſcharge of a good Conſcience will offord great Comfort, whatſoever may fall out in this uncertain and tranſitory Life.</p>

               <p>It is one of the ancient and known general deſcriptions of a free <hi>PARLIAMENT,</hi> according to the Laws, and Cuſtoms of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be elected by the general and free conſent of the People (who are not legally made uncapable) and when it comes to begin its Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Ancient Law &amp; Right of the Parliament a <hi>PROCLAMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</hi> ought to be made in <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> That no man upon pain to looſe all that he hath, ſhall during the PARLIAMENT in <hi>London, VVeſtminſter,</hi> or the Suburbs weare any privy Coat of Plate, or go armed, or that Games, or other Plaies of men, women, or children, or any other Paſtimes or ſtrange news ſhould be uſed during the Parliament, and the Reaſon thereof was, that the High Court of Parliament ſhould not be thereby diſturbed, nor the Members thereof (which are to attend the arduous and urgent buſineſs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) withdrawn; And it is generally known by thoſe whom it hath pleaſed God to ſave alive in our ſad inteſtine warrs, That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often declared themſelves to be highly affected, and diſpleaſed with the nature and manner of the late <hi>KING CHARLES</hi> his demanding of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and the five Members, Mr. <hi>Pim, John Hampden, Denzil Hollis,</hi> Eſqrs.

               <p>If you ſhould eſſay to reſtore them upon a Prudential account, you thereby would make your ſelf a Judge, ſo far as to put a limitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Reſtitution, unleſſe your prudential intentions therein, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Juſtice of it requirable in the preſent caſe: ſo likewiſe to oblige them without doors, (if it could legally be) to recede from their own Votes, would continue an apparent force upon them; and ſo it would not be ſo valid, as if they ſhould after the interruption taken off, in a voluntary manner conſider and recede. And then if there be no taking of the force (which hinders their Seſſion) unleſſe they will recede from their Votes, this continues their Bondage, and that cannot be ſafe for the people, to have their <hi>Parliaments</hi> in fear, or under Force or ſervitude, no more ſafe then it can be lawful or honourable for <hi>Parliaments</hi> (the Supream Conſervators) to act above and contrary to the Righteous Fundamental, and unalterable, Laws and Liberties. But however the People do (I conceive) juſtly incline to have the face of a Civil Authority, rather then the Force of a Sword over them; which way of Force (in the Caſe) may produce innumerable evils, both at preſent and in future, peradventure greater then the chief Authors of this Force may either fore-ſee, or ought upon due conſideration to deſire or aim at; and it may not only produce evil., but hinder that good, which no good man but would deſire to be enjoyed; I mean our Fundamental Laws and Liberties.</p>

               <p>If it ſhould be effected that they ſhould be reſtored, there might be reaſon in the judgement of charity, to hope or believe that they will anſwer the ends of the good people of the land. It is poſſible they may enter into a mature grave and pious conſideration of things. It is much to me that you ſhould ſeem to have ſo great a prejudice to them, for why ſhould you judge ſo of your friends, that they ſhould not make a good ending of their Seſſion, as well as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as you do in your 6th. Queſtion that they made good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? Can it be ſuppoſed or juſtly expected they would Vote a Period to their own Seſſion, as they did, and yet reſolve to go forth without giving a ſweet ſmell and ſavour, and taking into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the blood and treaſure and their own promiſes and ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, I muſt confeſs if they ſhould not take thoſe things into conſideration; for my own particular, I who am a Member of the oppreſſed people for about eleven years ſhould have no remedy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I ſhould obtain Juſtice from another, and ſucceeding Honourable and juſt Councel of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

               <p>By any thing whatſoever I can ſee preſented from you of reaſon in the preſent caſe, <hi>this Parliament</hi> may be free if their interrption be laid aſide or the force diſcontinued, but if the force be upon them, their re-admiſſion (as you call it) may prove of little effect: And if your ſuppoſition be never ſo true, that moſt of the eminent good things you aver they did were by force ſqueezed from them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Lawe you ſay cannot be the free Repreſentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> this is an Argument to take of the force. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it doth not appear by any Act of their own confeſſion or publick Declaration, that moſt of the eminent good things you aver they did were by force ſqueezed from them. Peradventure they on the other hand will ſay they had done far greater good things then they did, if the force had not been upon them; and likewiſe paradventure they will ſay they had not done or conſented to ſuch Acts, which (in the judgement of divers good and conſciencious men even of deſtroyed or undone perſons and families) were evil and contrary to the Laws and Liberties. And as to the laſt part of your queſtion, what do you mean by ſome other number of honeſt men to ſerve a preſent exigency. If the Power by which an Election is created, is unlawful and uſurped, it would be voyd, erronious, or dangerous, both as to the Electors and Elected, and full of dſsſatisfaction, in its being, introduce Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubvert our righteous Laws, and Liberties, for defence of which there hath been ſo much precious bloud-ſhed, and Treaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; And further, whether you mean that number of honeſt men ſhould be a lawful FREE PARLIAMENT in its Election
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94877:11"/>
and Seſſion? I know not: you leave it in doubt. And whether that any number of honeſt men can, and will, hazard themſelves to ſerve an exigency, leaſt they ſhould be ſerved as others have been before, is queſtionable, not only becauſe of the unlawfulneſſe of the impoſition of thoſe your number of honeſt men (ſo called) upon us, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the inconſtancy of Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and motions in theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affairs; For in ſome part of your Queſtions, you ſeem to be for a full and Free Parliament, Then in the 4<hi>th</hi> Queſtion you account it dangerous to have one, for fear of influenced Lawyers, Prieſts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers: Then in your 10<hi>th</hi> Queſtion, you ſay or conclude ſtrongly, That the men who ſat laſt were rather admitted to ſerve a preſent exigency; which admittance (as you call it) was after the diſſolution of another Aſſembly before them. And why may not the other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of honeſt men, which you drive at be alſo admitted to ſerve an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency, or a danger foreſeen? And where are our Laws and Liberties, Fundamental, uninterruptible, ancient and undoubted Rights all the while, the poſſeſſion of which would be a lawful means to repair the wrongs, and intollerable burthens of the oppreſſed, and diſcover who are the friends of publique Juſtice, Peace and Amity? Thus I have given my thoughts concerning theſe Queſtions, intendedly to manifeſt my affections: to the juſt LAWS and FREEDOMS of our Countrey to Truth, and right reaſon, (I hope) in ſober contrariety to raſh and illegal Violence, without unjuſt reſpect or diſreſpect to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Factions; And I do apprehend, at preſent I ſhall diſpleaſe none herein, except my particular enemies, who may rejoyce in my wrongs, or ſuch as are willful oppreſſors, and reſolved in their way.</p>
