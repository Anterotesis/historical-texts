            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now this may be proofe ſufficient that ſinne is the originall and chiefe cauſe of this moſt cruell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the peſtilence.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond cauſe is attributed to an euill conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which Aſtronomers affirme to proceede by the placing of the Sunne, Moone, and Stars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the firmament or circles of the heauens by their coniunctions, oppoſitions, and other Aſpects the one to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third cauſe is attributed to the corruption of the ayre, which being corrupted is apt for infection of mans body, for all liuing creatures drawe their breath from the ayre that is round about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which if it be ſtinking, wenomous, and corrupt, the bodie of man liuing therein is in danger to be corrupted: whereby often times the peſtilence is ingendred.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth cauſe is the aptneſſe of the body of man, through corrupt and rotten humours fitte to receiue the effects of a venomous ayre, putrifying and corrupting the body whereby the peſtilence is ingendred.

            <p>Now as the true vſe of theſe things that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not naturall doth maintaine and cheriſh health, ſo the abuſe thereof is the occaſion of diſeaſe &amp; ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

               <p>Let all be made into fine powder, and make an electuarie of this electuarie, the patient ſhall take one dram, and of <hi>Andromachas</hi> treacle ſo much, and mixe them together and receiue all preſently at one Doſe, and drinke preſently after a draught of <hi>Scabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os</hi> water or ſorrell water with a little of vineger of roſes, or take the foreſaid treacle and electuarie and mixe it with the water and ſo drinke it, preſently prouoking ſweate as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And thus much I thinke to be ſufficient at this time, as concerning this cruell diſeaſe of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I know much more may be written, but for as much as I promiſed to auoyde prolixitie, I will end onely with aduice vnto ſuch Chirurgious as ſhall be called, or ſhall aduenture themſelues to
<pb facs="tcp:18482:8"/>
the cure of this ſo daungerous a ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>The chiefe matter belonging to the Chirurgian is blood letting, extraction, and maturation of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles and Apoſtumes, as for blood-letting, let not the Chirurgian draw ſo much foorth as may be an occaſion of fainting, or ſowning to the patient, but let him draw foorth blood by degrees, and ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſame, as if the patient bleed in the morning <hi>5.</hi> ounces, he may bleed at three of the clocke in the after noone, <hi>3.</hi> ounces more, and ſo againe the next morning if neede ſhall require.</p>
               <p>And this is to be noted, that this blood letting is to be vſed at the beginning of infection and not otherwiſe; prouided alwaies that there with ſome one or other of this Antidots or electuaries before declared be vſed.</p>
               <p>And whereas I haue obſerued that the patient infected with this diſeaſe hauing <hi>abſeſſus tumor</hi> or Carbuncle ariſing either in the groyne, Armeholes or vnder the eares, or in ſome emunctuarie or clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing place of the body weyting the ſuppuration and ripening of the ſame either by nature, or medicine, they haue dyed, which if the Chirurgian would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by extirpation, or inciſion, with preſent appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome ripening and attractiue plaſter, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would thereby be eaſed &amp; the venomous and corrupt vapours by nature expelled, for nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weake, and not able to expell the venome faſt enough, if by inſenſible tranſpiration, the venome returneth backe to the hart, and ſo preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth nature. But if the Chirurgian or the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient himſelfe doe follow my aduiſe, he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb facs="tcp:18482:8"/>
either with inciſion, knife, or other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remooue that turnor where nature may haue way made to expell that venomous and cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt matter which is noyſome vnto it.</p>
               <p>And thus by the grace of God and his bleſſing, whoſoeuer ſhall follow the foreſaid precepts, and rules, ſhall preſerue both himſelfe and his familie from the Peſtilence. And I beſeech the Almightie to hold his holy hand ouer this Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land which by ſinne hath deſerued farre greater puniſhments.</p>
