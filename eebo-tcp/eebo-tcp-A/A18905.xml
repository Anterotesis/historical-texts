            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and earth.</head>
               <p>BEleife is manifold, according to the
thing beleiued, be it true or false: for
false beleife, it is compared to a man
dreaming of Gold, but being awaked,
he findeth a lye in his right hand. As
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19142:3"/>
for true beleife, it ouer-reacheth <hi>Fancie</hi>
and <hi>Opinion,</hi> and is a perswasion setled
vpon Trueth; as when one beleiueth
rightly on God, and the thinges <hi>of</hi> and
<hi>from</hi> God: And so, Beleife or Fayth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
considered, is a true assent to
that which is, be it a thing of <hi>Promise</hi> or
<hi>Narration.</hi> For much haue they erred,
that teach, how all Fayth respecteth a
promise.<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11. 3</note> 
                  <hi>Through Fayth we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that the world was ordained by the
word of God,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> declareth in the
first of <hi>Genesis;</hi> which is a thing of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
not of Promise, seeing the world
had his existence before man, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be promised to man.</p>
               <p>Touching Fayth apprehending a
Promise, it is twofold, according to the
nature of the Promise, and that is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
or <hi>Temporary;</hi> as it apprehendeth
thinges of eternall abyding nature, or
things that be but momen taine.<note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 18.</note> This

<hi>Moses</hi> describeth in the sixe dayes

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19142:3"/>When I say, <hi>I beleeue in God,</hi> (for
euery soule must beleeue for it selfe) it
is, as if in moe words I should say, <hi>I rest
and build vpon God in all my thoughtes,
words, and deedes.</hi> The Latine therefore
is not, <hi>Credo in Deo,</hi> but <hi>in Deum,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<hi>vpon</hi> God. Which God, <hi>Moses</hi>
deliuereth vnto vs in his first speach,

the one God: and in the Noune <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
of plurall Nomber, signifiyng
<hi>Mighties,</hi> he insinuateth the Trinitie
of Persons; as if the words should run
thus: <hi>Hee, the Mighties, did create.</hi> Which
Trinitie was not obscurely represented

With curious Scholastique poynts,
touching the sacred <hi>Trinitie in vnitie,
Moses</hi> dealeth not to open view, neither
doth this auncient Creed of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. The first Churches were
satisfied with that measure of Fayths-confession,
which our times will not
admit: So wrathfull &amp; vncharitable be
our times, learned of the man of Sinne.
The first most notorious Schisme in
the Church, did grow from the curious
search, which curious spirits did make
after the bottomlesse depth of this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in Trinitie; thereby adding to the
Creed: But, <hi>the secret things</hi> (sayth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29.) <hi>belong to the Lord;</hi>
and to the Lord I leaue the secrets of
the Godhead; as the auncient Church
of God hath done before me.</p>
               <p>Touching this one God, it is to be
beleeued, first, that he is a Father: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
an Almighty Father. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood
is twofold: First, as he hath
<hi>Created</hi> man; secondly, as he hath Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
man after his backsliding from
the excellencie of his Creation: Both
these, <hi>Moses</hi> doth remember in <hi>Deut.</hi>
32. 6. when as he sayth, <hi>Is he not thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19142:4"/>
that hath purchased thee? He hath
made thee,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 3. 17.</note> and proportioned thee.</hi> These
two Fatherhoods are to be Pillers to

for bringing to passe, whatsoeuer he

               <p>AS the first part of Beliefe touched
God the Father; so, the second
toucheth his Sonne, the <hi>Word;</hi> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he made all things. Which Sonne is
tearmed <hi>Jesus;</hi> that is, Sauiour: and
<hi>Christ</hi> or Messiah; which signifieth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted;</hi>
because he was of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
annoynted to be the Sauiour of
<hi>Adam</hi> and his chosen-seed, which in
<hi>Adam</hi> had sinned (through the meanes
of <hi>Satan,</hi> an Apostate Angell) and so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19142:6"/>
could not be saued, but by him that
could abace himselfe as low, as <hi>Adam</hi>
and the seed of his loynes, had sinned
hie: seeing Contraries must cure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.
Mankind had sinned highly,
in that being but earth, he laboured
proudly to be a God. The cure then
must be wrought by God on high,
humbling himselfe (in the behoofe of
man) so low as the earth. The Sonne
of God did this: first, by assuming or
taking vpon him the very nature of
man, body and soule. Secondly, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
the smart of our sinnes, and
dying in our nature for vs. Thirdly, in
rysing againe from vnder the decreed
death. Fourthly, in ascending vp to the
Father, carying our sinnes captiue: And
fifthly, by shewing himselfe the Iudge.
As the latter Scriptures (being but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
vpon <hi>Moses)</hi> doe plainely
shew all this; so <hi>Moses</hi> taught this as
truly, though not so openly.</p>
               <p>1 That the Sonne of God should
assume our nature for such purpose,
<hi>Moses</hi> doth intimate in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. when
he sayth, <hi>That the womans seed should
breake the Serpents head.</hi> And of him the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19142:7"/>
Apostle<note n="*" place="margin">Galat. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth it: As it is
said, <hi>The womans seed</hi> (not mans, because
mans hand should not <hi>cut this Stone from
the Monntaine)</hi> it should triumph ouer
the Serpent of Hell,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> which then had
acted the Serpentine beast of the fielde:
So, the Womans seed, being onely pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
could not doe that otherwise, then
it should receiue life from some actiue
power: which if not Mans, then needs
it must be of God; seeing Angels could
not vndergoe the waight of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
the Fathers infinite iustice being
so to be satisfied in mankindes nature,
which had so offended. Neither is
such conception strange in <hi>Moses,</hi> when
as <hi>Sarah</hi> (Arch-mother of beleeuers)
doth by vertue of the Lords promise,
conceaue and bring foorth <hi>Isaac,</hi> after it
ceased with her to be after the manner
of women.</p>
               <p>2. 3. Neither any nature, but that
which is infinite (namely God) could so
liue and die for satisfaction, and rayse
vp our assumed nature for our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
All which, <hi>Moses</hi> hath prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically
deliuered<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 19.</note> in the parable of

hath his <hi>onely Sonne Isaac</hi> (one with

And whereas some vrge from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
<hi>Holy,</hi> that by holy Catholique
Church, is meant <hi>onely</hi> that part of the
Church which is inuisible, knowen
onely vnto God, each member wherof
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19142:12"/>
is Holy <hi>indeed,</hi> I take it to be an errour.
First, for that the auncient Writers,
(who best vnderstoode their owne
terme, <hi>Catholique</hi>) do vnderstande it of
the visible Beleeuers wheresoeuer; as
may be seene, specially in their forme
of prouoking Heretiques. Secondly,
the tearme <hi>Holy</hi> giuen vnto it, doth no
more proue, that therefore euery soule
in the Catholique Church is indeede
Holy, then the same tearme proueth all
therefore in <hi>Israels</hi> people to be Holy
indeed, when as they be called, <hi>an holy
Nation:</hi> For who in the Scriptures shal
not perceiue, that <hi>Israel</hi> (howsoeuer
<hi>Called to be Sainctes)</hi> prooued still in fact
and Fayth (for the most part) very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and Idolatrous? And that is in
deed a Sonne of perdition mounted in
the Temple: a body of Tares ouergro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
the Wheat-field: Which not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
of many, it hath been cause of
much errour in disputation, about the
visibilitie of the Church. Euen as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not, because <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is a liuing
man, therefore euery member in him is
liuing, or hath life in it: for his hand,
and some other parts, may be dead
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19142:13"/>
and senslesse.</p>
               <p>Then will some further obiect, It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
that as the Nationall Church
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Prouinciall Church
of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> had one visible Hie-priest
ouer the whole; so, the Catholique
Christian Church is to haue one visible
Pastor ouer it. I answere, it followeth
not: First, for that <hi>One</hi> may better rule
ouer a Prouince or Nation, then ouer
the whole world. Secondly, for that
God commaunded that people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
three times a yeare to that <hi>One</hi>
place, where that Hie-priest was to
continue with the Arke of God: but
no such commaundement to vs. Nay,
God hath taken away that <hi>One</hi> place,
because in euery place he will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.
Our <hi>Melchi-esedek</hi> in repect
of his Diuinitie, is euery where; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be sacrificed too euery where:
and his Mandood is in the Heauens;
therefore <hi>Sur sum corda,</hi> thither lift we
vp our heartes.</p>
               <p>As Christ is the onely head of this
Church, and this Church is the whole
Corporation of Beleeuers, of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Kindreds, and Tongues, standing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19142:13"/>
before his Throne: so, the life of this
Church is his Spirit; and the Spirit she
receiueth<note n="*" place="margin">Galat 3. 2. 5. 8.</note> by the preaching of Fayth.
<hi>Moses</hi> teacheth this euidently enough,
in not only introducing the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
preaching the doctrine of Fayth
to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Heuah</hi> in Paradise, and
to other Patriarchs after; but also, in
his giuing to auncient Mother <hi>Zion,</hi> the
whole Tribe of <hi>Leuj,</hi> for discharging
Ministeriall duties for information of
Fayth: besides that in desperate times,
he stirred vp Prophets of what Tribe
soeuer (without all Priestly forme of
<hi>Ordination)</hi> for informing Priest and
people. All which (taking away Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall

               </p>
               <p>In the meane time, as the Church of
<hi>Israel</hi> had her Captiuities, vnder the
which was an exercise of her patience;
and for gayning of libertie, might vse
no bodyly resistance: euen so, the
Church of Christians hath her Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities,
which exact at her hands much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19142:14"/>
more patience. But as <hi>Jsrael</hi> deliuered

to such orderly established
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19142:15"/>
Churches, are of two sorts, <hi>Bishops</hi> and
<hi>Deacons;</hi> as for Deaconistes, they are
rather to be serued, then to serue. <hi>Bishop,</hi>
is a terme corruptly deriued from the
Greeke word <hi>Episcopus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim 3.</note> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an <hi>Ouer-seer,</hi> namely, of soules. In
him is required <hi>Aptnes to teach,</hi> which
includeth <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vtteraunce:</hi> as
also, the spirit of Gouernment for his
sufficient ruling of that Corporation.
Else-where he is called a <hi>Pastor,</hi> in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
a <hi>Shepheard</hi> or <hi>Feeder;</hi> for that he
is called to feed and guide that Flocke
of Christes pasture. In other places,
these Bishops or Pastors, are tearmed
<hi>Elders,</hi> in respect of the many yeares
they were ordinarily possessed with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they attained such orderly place of
ouersight. To haue one or moe of these
in one particular Church, is not of
<hi>Substaunce</hi> but of <hi>Circumstaunce:</hi> and
therefore to be caryed, as edifying Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
require: But with this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiso:</hi>
that where moe then one be, there
one for order and comlynesse sake, be
called before the rest, to ouersee; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
whom the burden of Doctrine
and Gouernement may rest; as it did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19142:15"/>
in the Churches of<note n="*" place="margin">Reuel. 2. &amp; 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Asia,</hi> written
too by <hi>S. John,</hi> where one vnder the
terms <hi>Angel</hi> (or Embassadour) is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
principally, with the Churches
occasions.</p>
               <p>As for the terme <hi>Doctor</hi> (in English
<hi>Teacher)</hi> if it be considered apart from
the Pastor, it can imploy no other then
him that is speciall attendant vnto the
Schoole of<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> Prophecie: that is the
Schoole of Christian learning, wherein
people are trayned vp for supplying
the Churches necessitie.</p>
               <p>The terme <hi>Deacon</hi> is deriued from
the Greekes, and is in English <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
or Seruitour: First, for the seruice
he was to doe to the Church: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
towardes the Ouer-seer, or Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers.
To the first, in cases of helping
the poore. To the second, in assisting
by his spirituall guiftes, as necessitie
shall call for it. For the performance
of all which duties, it is required that
they be full of the Holy-ghost,<note place="margin">Act. 63. &amp; 1. Tim. 3.</note> and of
Wisedome, hauing the mysterie of
Fayth in a pure Conscience; such as
can rule their owne Househouldes
well. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:19142:16"/>The conclusion then of all this, is;
that for the wel &amp; orderly gouernment
&amp; preseruation of euery particular <hi>esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished</hi>
Communion of Saincts, there be
some of best qualificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> set apart so to
attend on the sayd duties; whilest the
common people on the other hand, do
attend the duties of their common
callings. This being all, and easie to
be learned and obserued (if people
were not bent to contend about <hi>Words</hi>
and <hi>Termes,</hi> rather then <hi>Thinges)</hi> what
is there in it, which <hi>Moses</hi> taught not
<hi>Israel</hi> long since? In the place of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
<hi>Israel</hi> had Priestes, all their lippes
bound to preserue Knowledge, and
equally attending the Alter: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
one Priest principall, as the Angell
of the congregation. In stead of our
Deacons, they had Leuites vnder the
Priestes, and for the businesses of the
congregation. The Bookes of <hi>Exod.
Leuit. Numb.</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> doe
largely declare this. So Ceremonie and
Circumstance is changed; but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
and equitie abide still.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Word</hi> which they are to teach,<note place="margin">1 <hi>VVord.</hi>
                  </note>
is the pure Word of God, which was so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19142:16"/>
perfect in <hi>Moses,</hi> as it was a curse to
him, that should detract from it, or add
vnto it; as reason euinceth, when man
shall alter Gods Word. <hi>Deut</hi> 12. 32. All
inuentions of men herein, be but as the
strange Fire of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu:</hi> or as
the Leauen of the Pharises, which poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
the hearers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sacraments</hi> in common to be
administred,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sacraments.</hi>
                  </note> are <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>Lords
Supper.</hi> Baptisme in <hi>Moses,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by Ceremoniall washinges
&amp; Purifications, intending the Lambes
blood whereby we are clensed. The
<hi>Supper</hi> was represented in the <hi>Paschall</hi>
Supper, and other Ceremoniall eatings;
intending the body and blood of <hi>Christ
Jesus,</hi> (the Lambe that taketh away the
sinnes of the worlde,) whereby the
Church is nourished by Faith, in vnity.
So farre is it from being to be ministred,
(as Antichrist doth) for binding people
in and to Rebellion, and blood-shed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Discipline</hi> to be administred,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Discipline.</hi> Markes of an orderly established Church.</note> is,
either brotherly <hi>Admonishments</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes,</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19142:17"/>
All these, <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth,

from our first Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah:</hi>
for out of such a bitter Fountaine,
we can draw no sweete water. Besides,
we are Sinners <hi>Actually,</hi> that is, by our
owne immediate act; wee hauing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to the law of sinne in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
both by thought, word, &amp; worke:
One of these Actions (much more both)
are sufficient for our arraignement and
condemnation.</p>
               <p>2 The <hi>Meanes</hi> whereby we are
freed of both these Criminations, are
onely the sufferinges of the <hi>Just</hi> for the
vniust; and that is, the sufferings of
<hi>Christ Jesus</hi> for vs: seeing hee alone is
the Lambe of God that taketh away
the sinnes of the world, we by his blood
(and by no other) haue our garmentes
and conuersation made white. Our
sinnes in the Law being resembled co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouslie,
by sundry pollutions; and his
cleansing of vs by his blood, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled

sprinkling the Tabernacle and Alter,
there beeing without blood no Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Which cannot otherwise be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by the penners of this Creed;
seeing no Angell or Man is in this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife
introduced for a Sauiour in whole
or in part: but the Sonne of God sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who became <hi>Jesus</hi> the Sauiour, and

               <p>The Manqueller in the Law <hi>(Num.</hi>

worketh in our hearts, is, <hi>Loue</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned;
whereby we are ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
to our brethren the sinnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they haue transgressed against vs,
euen as God hath freely forgiuen vs.
Our sinnes towardes God being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to <hi>Talents;</hi> and our brethrens

Which Forgiuenesse at Gods hand, as
it is dayly, and oft in a day; so, we are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19142:19"/>
thereby inuited to do the like towards
our neighbour. To God we are to
pray for their Remission, though them
selues doe it not: and we are in Gods
name to pronounce it vnto them, so
oft as they shall turne backe and say,
<hi>It repenteth mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herevpon it is, that <hi>Moses</hi> introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
<hi>Josephs</hi> brethren, saying, <hi>Forgiue
now the trespasse of thy brethren, and their
sinne:</hi> Whereto <hi>Joseph</hi> replyed; <hi>Feare
not, for am I not vnder God?</hi> as if he
should say, Feare not my laying of your
sinne vnto your charge; for as I am
subiect vnto God, so, I as freely forgiue
you, as he hath forgiuen to mee my
trespasses. <hi>Genes. 50. 17. &amp;c.</hi> Nor did the

               <head type="sub">¶Resurrection of the Flesh.</head>
               <p>THe Church being considered (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
with the mayne benefite she
reapeth at Gods hand in this life, which
is, Remission of sinnes; now follow
two benefites after this life. The first
is, <hi>Resurrection of the body:</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, Life eternall ensuing.</p>
               <p>The Resurrection of the body, is
that, which the <hi>Sadducies</hi> denied, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milistes
amongst vs. And how doth
our Sauiour prooue it? From these
wordes of <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 6. where
the Lord sayth, <hi>I am the God of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, &amp; the God of Jaakob.</hi> From whence
he thus concludeth,<note place="margin">Math. 22. 32</note> 
                  <hi>God is not the God
of the dead, but of the liuing:</hi> as if he had
sayd in moe words, neither <hi>Abraham,</hi>
nor <hi>Isaac,</hi> nor <hi>Jaakob,</hi> was onely soule,
but also body: and therefore the Lord
saying, hee is their God, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
follow, that he was the God both
of body and soule. Which neither
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19142:20"/>
could be, except the body liued to him
in the assuraunce of Resurrection, for
being vnited to the soule in endlesse
glory. This stopped the mouthes of
them <hi>Sadducies;</hi> and I pray God also
the consideration thereof, may stoppe
the mouthes of our <hi>Semi-atheistes,</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the bodyes resurrection, flowted
of naturall Philosophers in <hi>Athens,</hi> but
prescisely taught of the Apostle; and
that with a difference of Glory in the
resurrection, as there is a difference of
glory betweene the Sunne, Moone, and
Starres. As for the<note n="*" place="margin">Compare Math. 20. 1. with Chap. 21. 33.</note> Parable of the

and each receiuing a penny, that med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
nothing in <hi>proprietie</hi> with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Glory, but with the kingdome
of Grace in this life; where the last,
(namely, the <hi>Gentile)</hi> so well as <hi>Israel</hi> the
first, receiueth the earnest-penny of
saluation, which is the spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the spirit of our Mediatour <hi>Jesus,</hi>
a sufficient recompence to the first and
last: by the vertue of which<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> spirit, our
bodyes are raysed vp vnto Glory.</p>
               <p>As for the Rising of the misbeleiuer,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19142:21"/>
it is but a rising to fall: for as God will
be none of their God; so, to the Diuell
and his Angels they be referred: and
this is the finall <hi>Curse</hi> pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               <p>THe first benefite to the Church af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>Some (like craftie smooth-faced

doth not also as necessarily prooue
<hi>Eternall life?</hi> If <hi>Jehouah</hi> be the God of

life fitly, necessarily, and plainely taught
of <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Genes.</hi> 5. when as it is sayd,
that God translated <hi>Henoch</hi> from this

in <hi>Exod</hi> 32. 32. doth in his Zeale for

rase mee out of thy Booke, which thou hast

               </p>
               <p>If he reply, these places and many

but his meaning was, that the phrase of
<hi>Eternall life,</hi> was not vsed of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereto I answere: so, the <hi>Sadducie</hi>
may denie all the artificiall tearmes of
Diuinity, which the Prophets, Apostles,
&amp; all haue introduced in the wisedome
of Gods spirit. And so he may carpe at

contending about <hi>Tearmes,</hi> till he haue

When <hi>Satan</hi> sayd, <hi>Yee shalbe as</hi> Aelohim,

Reader.</head>
               <p>OVr Sauiour hauing to doe with the
<hi>Sadducies,</hi> who admitted no other
Scripture for Canonicall, sauing the
writinges of <hi>Moses;</hi> hee by <hi>Moses</hi>
answereth them, as being sufficient for
proouing any Article of Fayth, which
had in after times been taught by the
Prophets, Himselfe, or his Apostles;
seeing Himselfe came but to fulfill the
Law (which caused <hi>Isaiah</hi> to bid his
Hearers, <hi>Goe to the Law)</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were interpretours of Law and
Prophets. Nor for other purpose was
it, that our Sauiour sayd thus to the
<hi>Jewes, Had yee beleeued Moses, yee would
haue beleeued mee;<note place="margin">John. 5. 46. 47.</note> for he wrote of mee.
But if yee beleeue not his writinges, How
shall yee beleeue my words?</hi> The matters
of Saluation were perfect in <hi>Moses,</hi>
howsoeuer there was more light in the
expositions of the Prophets, and most
light in the labours of the Apostles.
Wherevpon I conclude, that nothing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19142:23"/>
is to be held for an Article of Religion,
as essentiall vnto Saluation, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be made good out of <hi>Moses.</hi> Which
one lesson, if it had been well learned,
it had preuented the manifold Schismes
which a number run into; partly, about
<hi>Quiddities</hi> touching the Godhead; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
about Externall forme of Church
discipline; and partly, about Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of order and comlynes: by such
meanes violating the Fayth, breaking
the bondes of peace and loue; wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
eger about circumstaunces (euery
Sect in their humour) till substaunce
of Fayth, and the groundes of Charitie
be neglected; tything (with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises)

neglecting meane times <hi>(Barútera tou
