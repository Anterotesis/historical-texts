            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Judg. 5. 23.</bibl>
               <q>Curse yee <hi>Meroz,</hi> said the Angel of the Lord, Curse the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof, because they came not to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mighty.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Verse containes a Curse against a whole City, and all in it, wherin we may consider these particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A dutie that should have beene performed, and that was, a comming out to the helpe of the Lord <note place="margin">1.</note> against the mighty, the omission whereof was the cause of the Curse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The persons cursed and they were the inhabitants of <hi>Meroz.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The commander of the Curse, <hi>The Angel of the Lord,</hi> to wit, Christ Jesus himselfe, who is the Angell of the Covenant, and Captaine of the Lords Hoast.</p>
            <p>In the duty that should have beene performed, we may consider, first, the parties they should have helped, <hi>the Lord:</hi> secondly, against whom they should have helped the Lord, and that is, <hi>against the mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the persons cursed, wee may consider, first, what the curse was; and that I do confesse I cannot tell, whether it was fire or pestilence, but this is most certaine, Gods curse is the ruine of those people on whom it lights: secondly, wee may consider what this city <hi>Meroz</hi> was, and for that, I shall tell you, I cannot find in the whole Booke of God this city mentioned once againe, and therefore cannot certainly tell you where it was situated, onely this we may certainly conclude, that it was neer unto the place where the Lords people were in danger of their enemies.</p>
            <p>I have begun this Text in another Congregation, I will therefore give you the briefe heads of what I have elsewhere more largely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and so come to that which remaines.</p>
            <p>First, from the consideration of the parties against whom they should have holpen, <hi>the Lord,</hi> it is said they were mighty; whence wee have observed this point.</p>
            <p>That the mighty ones of the earth do many times oppose the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from thence we have also observed: <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That Gods people should not be afraid to oppose the mighty, when the cause is the Lords. <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61880:3"/>
Secondly, from the consideration of the parties whom they should <note place="margin">2.</note> have holpen, they were the people of God, and yet the Lord calls it his owne people, whence I observe:</p>
            <p>That to helpe Gods people, is to helpe the Lord. <note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the consideration of this neerenesse to the people of <note place="margin">3.</note> God in regard of habitation I observed:</p>
            <p>That the neerer a people are to Gods people in distresse, the more is <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> their helpe required, and the greater is their sinne, if they doe not helpe them: this I applyed to our selves, in regard of that case of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the Consideration that the curse extends to all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the city, I observed: <note place="margin">4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That there is neither man nor woman, but they may afford some <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> help to Gods people in distresse, if they have grace in their hearts; thus farre have I gone already and now the maine point that I intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon at this time, is this.</p>
            <p>That they are all cursed that helpe not the Lord, that is, that helpe not the Lords people in the time of their distresse; for the proofe of this <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> point, observe but that reprehension of <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 32. 6. to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Gad</hi> and the children of <hi>Ruben, Shall your brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>goe to warre, and yee tarry here? no by no meanes.</hi> And so our Saviour, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. will say, <hi>Goe yee cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Divell and his angels; for I was hungry, and yee gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and yee gave me no drinke.</hi> But I will stand no longer on the proofe of the point, but come unto the use of it, which I doe principally intend to stand upon.</p>
            <p>And first of all, is it so, that they are all cursed that help not the Lord against the mighty? then surely they are cursed with a heavie curse, that <note place="margin">Vse.</note> help the mighty against the Lord: but I hope there be few or none such in this Congregation, and I desire not to speake much to them that be absent; yet if any of you that heare me have any friends that are guilty of it, I pray you tell them what a fearefull condition they are in, that set themselves against the Lord.</p>
            <p>But there are others, who are not so bad as to help the mighty against the Lord and yet not so good as to help the Lord ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inst the mighty, but stand as neuters at such times when it is hard to say, whether the Lord or the mighty will prevaile; and of these there are two sorts.</p>
            <p>The first sort doe it out of policy, as now at this time, the Church of God in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the mighty, hath beene long under tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> government, and the Lord, we hope is now at warres with them, why there are some politicians that stand looking on to see which side will prevail. And if the Lord should now reforme this government, and so prevaile, why then they would be on the Lords side, but if the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should prevaile, which the Lord forbid, then they would be on the mighties side. But as <hi>Gideon</hi> said to the men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> when they refused to give morsels of bread to his people that followed after <hi>Zebab</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61880:3"/>
               <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> Kings of <hi>Midian,</hi> when the Lord hath delivered them into <note place="margin">Iudg. 8. 7.</note> mine hand. <hi>I will teare your flesh with thornes of the wildernesse, and with bryers,</hi> so say I to such, if the Lord prevaile against the enemies of his Church the Lord will make them smart, be sure of it, for that you will now afford him no help against them.</p>
            <p>The second sort are such as refuse to help the Lord, not so much out of policie as out of sloth and negligence, like unto the men of <hi>Iabesh Gilead,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> that went not to warre with their brethren against the <hi>Benjamites:</hi> but let such consider, what the <hi>Israelites</hi> did unto them, by reason of this their sloth and negligence, as you may reade, <hi>Iudg. 21. 8. &amp;c.</hi> to wit, how they fell upon them and destroyed them, because they came not up to <hi>Mizpeth</hi> to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The next use shall be for exhortation to you all, is it so, that they are <note place="margin">Vse.</note> cursed that help not the Lord against the mighty? why then brethren, as you desire to be freed from this curse, and to obtaine a blessing at the Lords hands, be exhorted to put forth your hands now to the help of the Lord, I pray you looke on me as on one that commeth amongst you this day to beat a drum in your eares, to see who will come out to follow the Lambe. Now then beloved, so many of you as are willing, come, and I will give you direction what to doe, that you may all of you afford some help to the Lord at this time.</p>
            <p>And first let me tell you, that the Lord doth not require your help so much for any need he hath of it, as for to honour you thereby; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, you are to know, that it is an honour to help the Lord, the Lord, as I may say, scornes to have help from every one, no, you must be fitly qualified before you be meet to helpe the Lord, and that with these three things.</p>
            <p>First you must be godly, or else you are unfit to be helpers of the Lord; <note place="margin">1.</note> the Lambes followers must be such as are chosen and called, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they must be holy men, and holy women; therefore, you that are ungodly persons, believe it, you are not called to this help of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you must be selfe-denying persons, you must deny your <note place="margin">2.</note> owne profit your owne ease, your owne friends, yea and all that you call your owne; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> saith, <hi>hee hath no man like minded to Timotheus,</hi> and in the next verse hee gives the reason, saying, <hi>for all seeke their owne, and not the things of Iesus Christ</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 20. 21. Ruth 1. 16</note> Therfore I say, you can never be fit to helpe the Lord, untill you put off all that is your owne, and say to Christ, as <hi>Ruth</hi> said unto <hi>Naomi; Whither thou goest I will goe, and where thou dwellest I will dwell, thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, you must be such persons as have a love to the Church; for <note place="margin">3.</note> beloved, you shall meet with so many rubs in the way, so many discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to flesh and blood, that if you have not a great love to the cause of Christ, you will be subject to turne backe from the Lords
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61880:4"/>
cause when there is most need of your helpe, therefore, alluding to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. I say unto you, the most excellent way is love, it is that which constitutes a man to be a meet follower of Christ; you know it is said of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 29. 20. that the seven yeeres he served for <hi>Rachel,</hi> seemed unto him but a few dayes, because hee loved her; even so brethren, if you get a love to Christ and his Church, you will willingly help the Lord, though you meet with some difficulties, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never rest, untill thou hast so much love, as to say, as I remember a godly Minister said, I praise God, I am not troubled at any crosse, but at the afflictions of Gods Church, nor I care for no welfare so much, as for the welfare of Christ Church.</p>

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> godly <hi>Nehemiah, Daniel,</hi> and old <hi>Eli</hi> did, that is, enquire <note place="margin">Answ.</note> diligently what the state of the Church is, and let me tell you, brethren, I am perswaded that it is a great fault of many of us here in <hi>England,</hi> that wee doe not performe this dutie as we ought, wherefore be exhorted to labour at this time to find out the state of Gods Church, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and in <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when thou hast sound out the state of the Church, and so consequently what it wanteth, then in the next place, consider what <note place="margin">2.</note> thou hast in thine hands to supply the want thereof: thou must observe this rule, that whatsoever good God hath put into thine hands, thou art but a Steward of it, and thou art to imploy it for the good of Gods Church; all Gods people have an interest in that talent that God hath committed to thy imployment.</p>
            <p>Now, there is one talent which I am sure every childe of God that is effectually called hath, though they be never so poore, and that is the talent of prayer; for indeed, it is the surest evidence to witnesse unto them, that the spirit of Christ is in them, when they can cry <hi>Abba</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: according to the lawes of our Kingdome, a child cannot be proved to be borne alive, except there be witnesse that it was heard to cry; even so we say in Divinity, that every one that hath the new birth can cry to God his Father in prayer; so that I say, every child of God hath this talent of prayer.</p>
            <p>And this talent the Lord requires they should use and imploy for the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61880:4"/>
good of his Church and people, according to that Scripture, <hi>Pray for the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> and that in <hi>Isay 62. Yee that are the Lords remembrancers, give him no rest, till he set up Ierusalem, the praise of the world;</hi> and beloved, let me tell you, the exercise of this talent of prayer, is charged upon all ranks and conditions of men, for that the exercise of no other talent can doe any good without this, neither the governing of the Magistrate, nor preaching of the Minister, nor fighting of the souldier, nor the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the rich man, will doe any good without prayer, it is prayer that brings a blessing downe upon all; yea, the exercise of this talent of prayer many times doth more good than all the rest. A praying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian (let me speake it with holy reverence) can doe all that God can doe, and therefore, in 1 <hi>King. 8. Salomon</hi> reckoneth up all the hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Church of God can fall into, and alwayes concludes, then heare thou in heaven, &amp;c. and then God answers, <hi>I have heard thy prayers and supplications that thou hast made before me;</hi> with this talent of prayer the servants of God have overcome God, and held his hands, in so much that the Lord, if I may so speake, hath been glad to intreat them and command them to hold their tongues, and let him alone. Beloved, as God onely can remove the Churches troubles, so prayer onely can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with God to doe it; it is prayer that bringeth all Gods promises into performances; there is not any part of the world, but a Christian can reach it by prayer; there is not a blessing in heaven, but prayer can fetch it downe; prayer can knocke downe enemies; when <hi>Moses</hi> held up his hands, <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed; <hi>David</hi> by prayer choked <hi>Achitophel; Hester</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. 17. 11</note> and her people by prayer hanged <hi>Haman.</hi> So that I may say of prayer, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> saith of the faith of those worthyes there mentioned, the time would be too short, to reckon up all that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can doe by prayer.</p>
            <p>And yet alas, I feare me, there are some Christians who have grace in their hearts, that have not imployed this their talent for the good of Gods Church, whose conscience will witnesse unto them that they have not spent an houre in their closets, in exercising this talent for the good of Gods Church: O, be humbled this day, for this your selfe-love, and want of love to Gods Church. And I am perswaded, that the want of this hath beene the cause that the enemies prevaile so in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, and that things goe on so heavily at <hi>Parliament</hi> here at home.</p>
            <p>Wherefore you that feare God, I beseech you be humbled for your omission of this duty; and be exhorted to set upon the practice of it, O pray, pray for the Parliament, O pray, pray for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and call upon others to pray; there is no man so meane in his estate, or weake in his body, but if he be a Christian, he may contribute something towards this great worke, though he be not able to lend a peny, yet he may give a subsidie of prayers. Beloved, if all Christians would exercise this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aright, their prayers would be as a thundring Army against the enemies of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61880:5"/>
But how shall I doe to exercise this talent aright? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin"> Answ.</note>First be sure that prayer be prayer, let it not onely be in speech, but powre out thy desires before God; and to this end, get a heart truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the thing thou prayest for.</p>
            <p>Labour to get an humble and selfe-denying spirit, remember <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he came before the Lord in prayer, confessed he was but dust <note place="margin">2. Gen. 18. 17.</note> and ashes, and <hi>Icob;</hi> when he came before the Lord in prayer confessed himselfe unworthy of the least of all Gods mercies; and <hi>David</hi> cryes out, <hi>Heare me O Lord, for I am peore.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Alwayes when thou goest to prayer, be sure to carry thy Mediator along with thee, by faith in the promises, and begge earnestly for the <note place="margin">3.</note> Lords sake, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, that so thy prayers may be fervent; O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Christians, if you would pray, and pray thus, you would be the <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 17.</note> most usefull people in all the world, yea, you would be the very props to these united Kingdomes; marke it then you men of the world, you sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> that have beene wont to scoffe at praying Christians, and to wish them all packed hence, and at new <hi>England,</hi> alas, you know not what an evill you wish unto your selves therein, if they were gone, woe be to you.</p>
            <p>And thus much shall suffice to have beene spoken of the talent of prayer; in the next place what outward abilities soever thou hast, thou must also imploy for the good of Gods Church; for hee that is a rich man, if hee pray and hold his purse, hee cannot expect that his prayers should be availeable.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if God have given thee both grace and money, I doe in the name of God beseech thee, to imploy both for the good of Gods Church and people, else it is to be feared, it may be as truly said to thee, as the poore man said to the Bishop, who asking him a penny for Christ his sake, the Bishop answered, I will not give thee a peny, but I will give thee my blessing; the poore man answered, ah Master, if you loved your blessing as well as your penny, you would not give mee that neither. Wherefore then to conclude, whatsoever God hath given thee that may do the Church good, be willing to part with it for the Churches good.</p>
