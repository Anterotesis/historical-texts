            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is not my purpose to intermeddle in the Controversie concerning the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of <hi>Phalaris, Themistocles, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> and <hi>Euripides.</hi> Whether they be genuine or no, I shall not trouble my self to enquire; nor yet whether <hi>AEsop</hi> was such a Monster for Vgliness as some make him, or whether the Fables that go under his Name are his, or whether we have any thing now Extant of <hi>AEsop</hi>'s own Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. I remember a Passage in <hi>Quintilian Instit. Orat. l. 5. c. 11.</hi>
               <q>Illae quoque Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae quae etiamsi originem non ab AEsopo acceperunt (nam videtur earum primus auctor Hesiodus) nomine tamen AEsopi maxime celebrantur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
By which it may seem that he was of Opinion that <hi>Hesiod</hi> was the first Author of the Fables, which bore <hi>AEsop</hi>'s Name in his time. But I shall not interpose in any of these Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;
<pb facs="tcp:59486:3"/>
that which I design is (if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not) a Matter of much greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>There are many that have set themselves highly to Extol and Magnifie the study of Chronology, and seem to have thought that they could never exceed in their Encomiums of it. And it is not my purpose to rob it of its due Praises. So far as there are hopes of attaining any certainty in it, it is without doubt a very laudable Study; and therefore the acquainting our selves with Scripture Chronology is very necessary, and no less profitable than it is pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. For whatsoever is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd in Sacred Writ, relating to Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is no less certain, than it is that the Author of the Scripture is Truth it self. Therefore when I speak of the uncertainty of Chronology, I am to be understood of Heathen Chronology. I grant also that even that was of good use to <hi>Josephus, Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Eusebius,</hi> and other Ancients, for destroying the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens pretensions to Antiquity.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, That I do not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to dissuade Men from all study of Chronology; but there are sundry things which (I think) are greatly to be dislik'd in
<pb facs="tcp:59486:3"/>
many of our modern Chronographers, that I would have Men caution'd against. There are who cannot contend more earnestly for the most necessary and fundamental Article of Religion, than they do for a Chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Trifle. They cannot endure that any should dissent from them, and fall foul upon those that do, treating them many times with very rude and unbecoming Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. There are also who will presume to assign not only the Year, but the Month, yea, perhaps the very Day, in which such or such things were done; <hi>Qui horas &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula annotarunt momenta, cum de inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris seculis nihil certi adfirmare potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint,</hi> as one saith. But that which is most to be lamented, is Men's Expence of so much time and pains in this Study, and after all, leaving their Reader as unsatisfi'd as they found him. Some have spent a great part of their Life in it (as appears by the large Volumes writ upon this Subject) and these Men of extraordinary Parts, great Learning and Diligence; so that they might have been serviceable both to the Age in which they liv'd, and to Posterity, if they had set themselves with the like Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to more useful Studies.</p>
            <p>These are some of the things which I could not but dislike in our modern Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers,
<pb facs="tcp:59486:4"/>
and a serious Reflection upon them hath made me often desire, that some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son fit for so great a Work would make it his business to convince the World of the uncertainty of Chronology. But not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any that did apply himself to so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary a Work, I thought it not amiss to lay hold of the Advantage offer'd me by the late Dissertation upon the Epistles of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, Themistocles,</hi> &amp;c. wherein I found many Passages in which the Reverend and Learned Author doth plainly bear Testimony to the uncertainty of Heathen Chronology, and more which may be made use of in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the manifesting of it. If Men were fully satisfy'd of this, methinks there should need no more to prevent their falling into the foremention'd Errors. We might hope that they would not contend so earnestly, nor be so impatient of contradiction, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in which they are convinc'd, that it is impossible to attain to any certainty; and that they would not throw away so many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hours in the Study of them, nor lay so much stress upon the Arguments that are built upon them, as many do. They would consider that it is not easie to build certain Conclusions upon a sandy Foundation. How little <hi>Plutarch</hi> was mov'd with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from Chronology, is apparent from those Words of his, which I have
<pb facs="tcp:59486:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Transcrib'd in the Title Page; and also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to in <hi>Part II.</hi> when I enquire after the time of <hi>Solon</hi>'s Death. If others had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd upon such Arguments no more than <hi>Plutarch</hi> did, it is probable that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Controversie about <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles had never been started.</p>
            <p>The View of the Dissertation was finish'd not long after it was Publish'd; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to wait till I saw what Answer would be made to it, believing that I should have more assistance from the Answer, than I have had from the Dissertation it self. And my Expectation was not frustrated; for I found that the Honourable the Author of the Examination, had not only more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, but also more plainly and directly born Testimony to the uncertainty of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, than the Reverend Author of the Dissertation had done. So that I am now apt to flatter my self with the hope, that the Authority of two such great Names will be of force effectually to persuade Men, not to throw away so much time upon the Study of Chronology, nor to rely so much upon it, as some have done.</p>

            <head>A VIEW OF THE DISSERTATION UPON THE EPISTLES OF <hi>Phalaris, Themistocles,</hi> &amp;c. PART. I.</head>
            <p>
               <q>THE Time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny cannot be precisely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; so various and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective are the Accounts of those that  write of him.</q> Thus the <hi>Dissert. p.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59486:6"/>Here it is plainly acknowledg'd, That the Time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Tyranny is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and the reason that is given, is, because <hi>The Accounts of those that write of him are so various and defective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then it appear, That the Accounts given by those who write of the other Persons mention'd in the <hi>Dissertation,</hi> are no less various and defective, we may as firmly conclude that the Time of their Flourishing or Reign is uncertain. The same may be apply'd to the Cities spoken of in the <hi>Dissertation.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Eusebius</hi> sets the beginning of it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 31. 2. <hi>Phalaris apud Agrigentinos Tyrannidem exercet</hi>; and the end of it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 37. 2. <hi>Phalaridis Tyrannis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structa.</hi> By which reckoning he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd 28 Years. But St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> out of some unknown Chronologer (for that Note is not Extant in the Greek of <hi>Eusebius</hi>) gives a different time of his Reign, above 80 Years later than the other, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 53. 3. or as other Copies read it, 52. 2. <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Tyrannidem exercuit annos</hi> 16.

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59486:6"/>Here the Doctor declares the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the time of the beginning, continuance, and end of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. It begun <hi>Olymp.</hi> 31. 2. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but according to St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Olymp.</hi> 53. 3. or (as other Copies have it) 52. 2. so that there is above 80 Years difference. It continu'd according to <hi>Eusebius</hi> 28 Years; according to St. <hi>Hierome</hi> only 16. It ended according to <hi>Eusebius, Olymp.</hi> 37. 2. according to St. <hi>Hierome, Olymp.</hi> 57. 3. Thus the Doctor.</p>
            <p>But the time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Government is still more uncertain, because the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s <hi>Chronicon</hi> do here ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much vary. It seems that the Copy which the Doctor follow'd sets the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 31. 2. But other Copies set it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 31. 4. <hi>Vid. Edit. Paris.</hi> A. D. 1512. <hi>Edit. Basil.</hi> A. D. 1570, and <hi>Edit. Pontaci.</hi> A. D. 1604.</p>
            <p>Likewise his Copy sets the end of his Reign, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 37. 2. but in <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1606. it is set, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 38. 2. and <hi>Pontacus</hi>'s Edition, together with that at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that at <hi>Basil</hi> placeth it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 39. 3. So as to the later ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which we have in <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon,</hi> and which the Doctor ascribes to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59486:7"/>
St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> his Copy refers it to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 53. 3. and yet he himself tells us, That other Copies place it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 52. 2. as <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Edition sets it, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 53. 4. and the Edition at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, Olymp.</hi> 51. 4. From all this I may conclude, That it is most-certainly true which the Doctor saith, that <hi>The time of</hi> Phalaris<hi>'s Tyranny cannot be precisely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd.</hi>

            <p>By <hi>That supposed Time of</hi> Phalaris<hi>'s Death,</hi> the Doctor means, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 37. 2. so that the Authors whom the Doctor follow'd, make <hi>Stesichorus</hi> to have been 6 Years old at that time and no more. But according to <hi>Suidas</hi>'s account, he could not be of the Age of 6 Years at that time, for he says expresly, That <hi>Stesichorus</hi> was born in that very <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, viz. Olym.</hi> 37. And <hi>Eusebius</hi> seems not to agree very well either with the Doctor's Authors, or with <hi>Suidas.</hi> For he sets <hi>Stesichorus</hi>'s Death, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 55. 1. and we are told by <hi>Lucian,</hi> in his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobii,</hi> That he liv'd to the Age of 85 Years, according to which account he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59486:7"/>
must be born, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 33. 4. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (not 6 only, but) 14 or 15 Years old at that suppos'd time of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi>'s Death. And we may here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That <hi>Suidas</hi> neither agrees with <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as to the time of <hi>Stesichorus</hi>'s Death, nor with <hi>Lucian,</hi> as to the Age to which he liv'd. For <hi>Suidas</hi> makes him to have died, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 56. (not <hi>Olymp.</hi> 55. 1. as <hi>Eusebius.</hi>) And whereas <hi>Lucian</hi> says, That he liv'd 85. Years, according to <hi>Suidas</hi> (who placeth his Birth, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 37. and his Death, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 56) he did not reach 80. Add hereto, That <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> makes him to have been famous, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymp.</hi> 42. 1. at which time he was but 20 Years old (if he was that) according to <hi>Suidas</hi>'s account of him; but it is not probable that he should be so fam'd a Poet at that Age. Tho' they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the relation of <hi>Pliny, Nat. Hist. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 29. That a Nightingal sung in his Mouth when he was an Infant, may perhaps not think it strange, that he should be so celebrated a Poet so Young. But what shall we say to the <hi>Marmor Arundel.</hi> which according to Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> refers <hi>Stesichorus,</hi> to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. 3.? Or to <hi>Conon,</hi> who <hi>ap. Photium Cod.</hi> 186. <hi>Sect.</hi> 42. makes him Contemporary to <hi>Gelon,</hi> of whom hereafter? If these speak of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59486:8"/>
the same <hi>Stesichorus,</hi> that <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> do, there needs no more to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the uncertainty of <hi>Stesichorus</hi>'s Age at that suppos'd time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Death, <hi>i. e. Olymp.</hi> 37. 3.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Three,</hi> of whom the Doctor speaks this are, <hi>Phalaris, Stesichorus</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> And it is true, that <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rhetor. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 21. makes <hi>Stesichorus</hi> to be Contemporary to <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and <hi>Iamblichus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> shews, That he and <hi>Phalaris</hi> were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries. But if <hi>Pythagoras</hi> liv'd in the Time of <hi>Numa,</hi> he could not be Contemporary to the other Two, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account that is given of them. Now <hi>Livy, l.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 18. acquaints us that there were who gave out that <hi>Numa</hi> was <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Scholar; and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onys. Halicarnas. l.</hi> 2. says, That there were many that had writ thus. I grant that these two celebrated Historians do not approve of that Opinion concerning the Time of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Flourishing; but it shews however, that it was not certain then at what Time he Flourish'd,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59486:8"/>
as it is uncertain still. Those that agree that he was not so early as <hi>Numa</hi>'s Time, differ much among themselves about the Time when he liv'd. <hi>Livy</hi> says, That he was in <hi>Italy</hi> when <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> Reign'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Cicero Tuscul. Quaest. l.</hi> 1. and <hi>A. Gellius, l.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 21. say, That he came into <hi>Italy</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus.</hi> According to <hi>Pliny, Nat.

For having acquainted us that some affirm'd that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> convers'd with <hi>Numa,</hi> but that others made him almost 5 Generations later, he adds, That 'tis difficult exactly to adjust the Times; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which seem to leave it uncertain whether <hi>Thericles</hi> liv'd at the same time that <hi>Aristophanes</hi> did, or only in the Times near it. But let it be granted, that he liv'd at the same
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59486:9"/>
time that <hi>Aristophanes</hi> did, still it will not be certain that he was above 120 Years after the Death of <hi>Phalaris.</hi> It must be confess'd that, if that was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true which <hi>Suidas</hi> hath concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> that he liv'd, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 114. this would make something to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Proof of this, That <hi>Thericles</hi> was above 120 Years after <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Death. But the Authority of <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> doth utterly destroy the certainty of this account of <hi>Suidas,</hi> for <hi>l.</hi> 12. he affirms, That <hi>Aristophanes</hi> was about the Age of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and withal, that <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> died, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 87. 4. so that according to him, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> liv'd before <hi>Olymp.</hi> 87. 4.

Whence it follows, that it cannot be certain, That <hi>Thericles</hi> was above 120 Years after the Death of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> for from <hi>Olymp.</hi> 57. 3. to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 85. 4. are not 120 Years.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59486:10"/>
                  <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> besieg'd <hi>Zancle,</hi> and took it, and call'd it <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sana,</hi> from the <hi>Peleponnesian</hi> City of that Name, the Place of his Nativity.

            <p>Here are many Things very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as 1st. It is uncertain whether <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition was <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. for according to <hi>Eusebius, Xerxes</hi> begun his Reign, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. 3. and if he came not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59486:10"/>
to the Empire till that time, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, as by the account given by others, so by the relation of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that his Expedition into <hi>Greece</hi> was not <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> says, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 7. That in the second Year after the Death of his Father <hi>Darius,</hi> he made an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into <hi>Egypt</hi> to reduce it, and <hi>c.</hi> 20. that having done this, he spent Four Years compleat in Preparation for the War against <hi>Greece,</hi> and set forward in the Fifth Year. I know that there are considerable Writers who do not agree with <hi>Herodotus,</hi> as to the Time that was taken up in Preparation against <hi>Greece</hi> (<hi>Diodorus Sic. l.</hi> 11. making it but Three Years, <hi>Iustin. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he spent Five Years in it, which number of Years, <hi>Iulian Orat.</hi> 1. <hi>in laudem Constantii,</hi> doubles, making it to have taken up Ten Years) but this only renders it more uncertain in what Year <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Greece</hi> was: To return to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> he sets his Reduction of <hi>Egypt, Olymp.</hi> 74. 1. and his making a Bridge over the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont, Olymp.</hi> 74. 4. <hi>(Vid. Edit. Paris. &amp; Basil. &amp; Pontaci) Diodorus Sic. l.</hi> 11. refers the Expedition into <hi>Greece</hi> to the Year following, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. 1. with whom <hi>Dionys.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59486:11"/>
the <hi>Marmor Arund.</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and others agrees with <hi>Eusebius,</hi> for they make the <hi>An.</hi> 217. to which the Marble refers <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s making a Bridge over the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> to answer to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 74. 4. <hi>Clemens Alex. Stro.</hi> 1. sets this Expedition 297 Years after the first <hi>Olympiad,</hi> as <hi>Thucydides, l.</hi> 1. placeth it in the Tenth Year after the Battle at <hi>Marathon,</hi> so that if that Battle was, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 72. 1. (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> sets it) <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s coming against <hi>Greece,</hi> was <hi>Olymp.</hi> 74. 3. But <hi>Plato de Legibus, l.</hi> 3. says, That it was but <hi>almost</hi> Ten Years between <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>'s coming into <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Fight at <hi>Salamis.</hi> It must then be confess'd, that it is not certain in what Year <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Greece</hi> was, nor yet that it was, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. as the Doctor sets it, unless <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. be the Printers Mistake.</p>
            <p>2dly. It is uncertain when <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> Reign'd, and when <hi>Zancle</hi> was call'd <hi>Messana.</hi> For the Doctor acquaints us, That <hi>Pausanias</hi> is so far from agreeing with <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Sic.</hi> about the time of <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> and of his changing the Name of that City, that their Accounts differ about 180 Years. It may perhaps be said, That if the three other eminent Historians
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59486:11"/>
plainly agree upon the Time, <hi>Pausani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>'s Dissent will not make it less certain; for we may conclude that it was his Mistake. The Question then will be whether <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Sic.</hi> do plainly agree about the Time. And I shall grant that <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> seem to agree as to the time of <hi>Anaxilas,</hi> or <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> or <hi>Anaxileos,</hi> (for the Name is written thus differently,) <hi>Herodotus, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 23, 24. signifying that he Reign'd in the Time of <hi>Darius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> saying, That having Reign'd 18 Years, he died <hi>Olymp.</hi> 76. 1. But of his changing the Name of <hi>Zancle</hi> into <hi>Messana, Diodorus</hi> in that place hath not a Word, and tho' <hi>lib.</hi> 4. he doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the change of the Name, yet there he doth not tell us either when, or by whom it was changed. <hi>Herodotus, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 164. speaks of the change of the Name from <hi>Zancle</hi> to <hi>Messene,</hi> as <hi>Eustathius</hi> upon <hi>Dionys. Alex.</hi> also doth, alledging <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>; but they do not mention <hi>Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> as the Author of the Change, nor inform us when that Change was made. I grant that <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks of it upon occasion of his mentioning one <hi>Cadmus,</hi> who liv'd at the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against <hi>Greece</hi>; but he does not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59486:12"/>
say that the Change was made then; yea, he seems to signifie that <hi>Zancle</hi> had chang'd its Name before: His Words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>which had chang'd its Name to</hi> Messene. To come to <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides, Herodotus</hi> and he seem not to agree very well in that which they say of the King of <hi>Rhegium.</hi> By the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s <hi>Anaxileos,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> possess'd themselves of <hi>Zancle,</hi> but <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s <hi>Anaxilas,</hi> cast the <hi>Samians</hi> out of it, not long after that the <hi>Samians</hi> had driven the <hi>Sicilians</hi> out of it; so that perhaps it may be question'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those two Historians speak of one and the same Person. Besides, tho' the Doctor says, That <hi>Thucydides, l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 414. <hi>relates, that at the time of</hi> Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes<hi>'s Expedition into</hi> Greece, Anaxilaus <hi>took</hi> Zancle, <hi>and call'd it</hi> Messana; yet the truth is, That <hi>Thucydides</hi> doth not there make any mention of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. He tells, That the <hi>Samians</hi> who had driven the <hi>Sicilians</hi> out of <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, fled from the</hi> Medes, but we cannot infer hence, that the Name of that City was chang'd at the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Greece,</hi> much less that <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> relates it. The Conclusion is, That <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Sic.</hi> leave us uncertain as to the Time
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59486:12"/>
of <hi>Zancle</hi>'s changing its Name, and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias</hi>'s Testimony alledg'd by the Doctor seems to make the Matter still more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
            <p>3dly. It is not certain, that <hi>Chionis</hi> was Victor, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 29. tho' <hi>Pausanias</hi> doth affirm positively that he was; for in the <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>The Doctor having said, That <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromachus persuaded the</hi> Naxians <hi>to fix

            <p>Here the Doctor plainly bears Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the uncertainty of <hi>Simonides</hi>'s Age, acquainting us, that some say that he was but Seven Years old, others that he was unborn when <hi>Phalaris</hi> died. Whereto I add, That it is not certain that he was either but Seven Years old, or unborn at the time of <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Death. In <hi>Eusebius,</hi> we have four different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Time when <hi>Simonides</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd. It is set first, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 28. 4.

for <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s being slain, <hi>viz. Olymp.</hi> 57. 3. And according to the first account he was famous above 100 Years sooner. <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> says, That <hi>Simonides</hi> liv'd <gap reason="foreign">

Plutarch Themist.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59486:16"/>
p.</hi> 225.) relates, That when <hi>Hiero</hi> had sent Race-horses, and a most sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tent to the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games; <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi> advis'd the <hi>Greeks</hi> to plunder the Tyrants Tents, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and not to let his Horses run. 'Tis evident then, if <hi>Theophrastus</hi> speak properly, that <hi>Hiero</hi> was Monarch of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> when <hi>Themistocles</hi> was at <hi>Olympia</hi>; but it is most certain he never came thither after his Exile. But to deal fairly, it must be confess'd that <hi>AElian</hi> (<hi>Var. Hist.</hi> 9.5.) in telling this Story va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from <hi>Theophrastus</hi>; for he says <hi>Hiero</hi> himself came to the Games: But that he would go thither in Person after he got the Government is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable. So that if <hi>AElian</hi> be to be believ'd, this Business must have been done before <hi>Hiero</hi> came to the Throne. For even in <hi>Gelo</hi>'s Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, who left him the Monarchy, he kept Horses for the Race, and won at the <hi>Pythian</hi> Games. <hi>Pythiad</hi> the 26. (<hi>Pind.

But besides, that <hi>Theophrastus</hi> is of much greater Authority, the other refutes himself in the very next Words. For he says, That <hi>Themistocles</hi> hindred <hi>Hiero</hi> on this pretence, That <hi>he that did not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59486:17"/>
share in the common Danger, ought not to share in the common Festival:</hi> Where its certain by the <hi>common Danger,</hi> he means <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition, when <hi>Gelo</hi> either refus'd or delay'd to give the <hi>Grecians</hi> his Assistance: This Affront then was put upon <hi>Hiero,</hi> after that Expedition. But the very next <hi>Olymp.</hi> after <hi>Hiero</hi> was in the Monarchy, <hi>Diod.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 29. Besides these Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Deductions, we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Verdict and Declaration of most of the Chronologers (<hi>Schol. Pind. Pyth. Diod.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 29, 41. <hi>Euseb.</hi> in <hi>Chron.</hi>) who place the beginning of <hi>Hiero</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. 3. and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>'s Banifhment seven Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 77. 2. The <hi>Arundelian</hi> Marble indeed differs from all these in the Periods of <hi>Gelo</hi> and <hi>Hiero,</hi> which would quite confound all this Argumentation from the Notes of Time. But either that Chronologer is quite out, or we can safely believe nothing of History. For he makes <hi>Gelo</hi> first invade the Government two Years after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> spends half a dozen Pages in the account of an Embassy to <hi>Gelo,</hi> from <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> to desire his Assistance against the <hi>Persian.</hi> And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59486:17"/>
'tis agreed among all, That <hi>Gelo</hi>'s Victory over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> was got the very same Day with the Battle at <hi>Salamis; Herodot. l.</hi> 7. and <hi>Diod. l.</hi> 11.</q>

            </p>
            <p>It is here plainly acknowledg'd, That the Chronology of this part of History which concerns <hi>Themistocles</hi> and <hi>Hiero,</hi> is not clearly setled and agreed. And not only so, but the Doctor in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin also sets down the Words of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in <hi>Themist.</hi> wherein that Great Man plainly declares, That the Annals or Chronicles are not so exact, that they can be depended upon, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The Doctor moreover confirms the Truth of that Observation, That the Chronology of this Part of History is not clearly agreed. For First, he says, That <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> if he speak properly, makes <hi>Hiero</hi> Monarch of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> at that time when <hi>Themistocles</hi> advis'd the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> not to permit his Horses to run at the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games. Whereas (says he) if <hi>AElian</hi> be to be believ'd, this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness must have been done before <hi>Hiero</hi> came to the Crown. Secondly, he says,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59486:18"/>
That the <hi>Arundelian</hi> Marble differs from all those whom he had nam'd, (<hi>viz. Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liast. Pindar. Diodorus Sic.</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi>) in the Periods of <hi>Gelo</hi> and <hi>Hiero.</hi> The Doctor perceiving that it was not very easie to loose these two Knots resolv'd to cut them, by diminishing the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>AElian,</hi> and the <hi>Arundelian</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and going about to prove that the former refutes himself, of which At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Doctors I shall only say, That I humbly conceive that he hath undertaken a difficult Task.</p>
            <p>We have seen how plainly the Doctor doth acknowledge, that this part of Chronology is not clearly setled and agreed, and yet there are some Passages in him that seem to say, That it is at least pretty well adjusted and agreed. As,</p>
            <p>First, He says, That <hi>we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Verdict and Declaration of most of the Chronologers, who place the beginning of</hi> Hiero<hi>'s Reign,</hi> Olymp. 75. 3. <hi>and</hi> Themistocles<hi>'s Banishment Seven Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Olymp. 77. 2. But we may observe, First, That he only says, That we have the Verdict <hi>of most of the Chronologers,</hi> he doth not say <hi>of all.</hi> Secondly, Tho'
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59486:18"/>
he say <hi>of most of the Chronologers,</hi> he names only three, <hi>Schol. Pind. Pyth.</hi> 1. <hi>Diod.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 29, 41. <hi>Euseb.</hi> in <hi>Chron.</hi> And as to the first of these, the Scholiast. upon <hi>Pindar,</hi> he <hi>Pyth.</hi> 1. places the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Hiero</hi>'s Reign, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in <hi>Olymp.</hi> 85. not 75. Possibly some bold Critick will tell us, That 85 is by the Scribes or Printers mistake put for 75, but still it will not well agree with that which the same Scholiast hath, <hi>Pyth.</hi> 3. where he makes <hi>Hiero</hi> to begin his Reign, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As to the time of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s Banishment, I have not found that the Scholiast gives any account of it. <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> is the next, and it is true that he speaks of <hi>Hiero</hi>'s beginning his Reign in <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. 3. and of <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>'s Banishment in <hi>Olymp.</hi>

In that Year <hi>Diodorus</hi> gives an account as of <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Banishment, so also of his

going to <hi>Argos,</hi> his Flight from thence to <hi>Admetus,</hi> and afterward from <hi>Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> his Journey from thence to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and what befel him there, and lastly of his Death. Not that all these happen'd within the space of one Year (for there was a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time from his Banishment to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time again from his coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Death,) but the Historian thought it best to dispatch all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd <hi>Themistocles</hi>'s Fall at once. <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>'s <hi>Chronicon</hi> only remains, in which it is left uncertain whether the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Hiero</hi>'s Reign is to be refer'd to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. or <hi>Olymp.</hi> 76.

from <hi>Thucydides, l.</hi> 1. who informs us, That his living some time at <hi>Argos,</hi> and going into other Parts of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> his flying thence to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> and thence to King <hi>Admetus,</hi> and from him to <hi>Asia,</hi> did all intervene between his Banishment and Flight into <hi>Persia.</hi> By this which hath been said it may be judg'd, whether we have the express Verdict and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of most of the Chronologers, that <hi>Hiero</hi> begun his Reign, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. 3. and that <hi>Themistocles</hi> was Banish'd <hi>Olymp.</hi> 77. 2.</p>

            <p>And as to <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> he is so far from agreeing to this, that he says, That <hi>Gelo</hi> overcame on the same Day that <hi>Leonides</hi> fought <hi>Xerxes</hi> at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi>

            <p>Concerning this <hi>Gelo,</hi> I may observe, That the accounts of the Time both of the beginning and continuance of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are so various, that we cannot think it strange that it is so uncertain, when his Successor <hi>Hiero</hi> came to the Crown.

(the Year of <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>'s Birth) to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 87. 4. are no more than Fifty One Years, which are far short of <hi>about Seventy,</hi> or <hi>above Sixty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that the Doctor says, That <hi>according to the most Chronologers,</hi> Euripides <hi>was about Seventy when</hi> Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus <hi>came to the Crown,</hi> yet after all, in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59486:25"/>
his Margin he only names <hi>Diod. Sicul. &amp; alios apud Athen. l.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 217. But he had done well if he had directed us to the place in <hi>Diod. Sicul.</hi> where he gives this account of <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Age; for my part I despair of finding any such. And as to <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> in all that <hi>p.</hi> 217. to which we are refer'd there is no mention of <hi>Euripides.</hi> I grant that there is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the time of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Perdiccas</hi>; but it is such as makes not for the Doctor's purpose, but wholly against him, as I have just now declar'd. And now that I name <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> what can make more toward the manifesting the uncertainty of Chronology, than that which <hi>Athenaeus</hi> in that very place observes, touching the wonderful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that there is about the number of Years that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> Reign'd? <hi>Nicomedes Acanthius</hi> (says he) <hi>gives him Forty One Years,</hi> Theopompus <hi>Thirty Five,</hi> Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes <hi>Forcy,</hi> Hieronymus <hi>Twenty Eight,</hi> Marsyas <hi>and</hi> Philochorus <hi>Twenty Three:</hi> Thus <hi>Athenaeus.</hi> The accounts of the Time that <hi>Perdiccas</hi> Reign'd being so various, it must be more difficult to assign the Time of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59486:25"/>I know that a Learned Critick takes upon him to correct <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> making him to set the Time of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi>'s coming to the Crown much later than it is in our Copies. But if this was so that he set it later, it would make the difference greater between <hi>Eusebius</hi> and him. Withal, I am not satisfy'd with this Criticks Correction or Alteration, for First, I find that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> agrees exactly with our Copies of <hi>Athenaeus,</hi> placing the beginning of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Reign in the 3d Year of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, when <hi>Epamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was <hi>Archon.</hi> Secondly, He doth not produce the Authority of any approved Copies to warrant his Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Thirdly, He doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any ancient Historian, that says expresly that <hi>Archelaus</hi> begun his Reign that Year which he pitcheth upon, <hi>viz. Olymp.</hi> 93. 3. He only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this from the Words of <hi>Diodorus Sic. l.</hi> 14. whom he makes to say, That <hi>Archelaus</hi> dy'd <hi>Olymp.</hi> 95. 2. having Reign'd Seven Years; and if both these be true, that he Reign'd Seven Years and no more, and dy'd <hi>Olymp.</hi> 95. 2. the beginning of his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59486:26"/>
Reign must be placed <hi>Olymp.</hi> 93. 3. But not to take notice that this Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick mistakes the Year of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Death (for <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> sets it not <hi>Olymp.</hi> 95. 2. but 95. 1.) the same <hi>Diodorus l.</hi> 13. relates, That <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> besieg'd <hi>Pyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Olymp.</hi> 92. 3. therefore he was King then, and how long before that time we know not.</p>
            <p>It appears then that there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, either as to the time how long <hi>Perdiccas</hi> Reign'd, or as to the time when <hi>Archelaus</hi> succeeded, or as to <hi>Euripides</hi>'s Age at the time of his succeeding, but they are all uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

            <p>The Doctor doth well in using this cautious Expression <hi>About</hi> 2000 <hi>Years,</hi> for unless we could be assur'd both when <hi>AEsop,</hi> and when <hi>Planudes</hi> lived, we cannot be certain how long the one lived after the other. The Doctor in his Margin (from good Authority without doubt) makes <hi>Planudes</hi> to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59486:26"/>
have lived <hi>A. D.</hi> 1370. but others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to <hi>A. D.</hi> 1340. and have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as good Authority for so doing. And as we are thus uncertain how long <hi>Planudes</hi> lived after Christ, so there is no certainty how long <hi>AEsop</hi> was before him. <hi>Suidas</hi> says, he was before <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> but <hi>Heraclides de Politiis</hi> makes him to have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous at the Time when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was. <hi>Plutarch in Vit. Solon. &amp; in sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Sapientum convivio,</hi> relates, That he was very much in the favour of King <hi>Croesus,</hi> as also what pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Solon</hi> and him, when <hi>Solon</hi> had incurr'd <hi>Croesus</hi>'s Displeasure; but <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> will have him to have been slain before <hi>Croesus</hi>'s coming to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. For according to <hi>Eusebius, Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> came to the Crown <hi>Olymp.</hi> 54. 2. and <hi>AEsop</hi> was slain either <hi>Olymp.</hi> 54. 1. (for so <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Edition hath it, and that account seems to be follow'd by <hi>Suidas</hi>) or <hi>Olymp.</hi> 53. 4. as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Editions. And as to the Birth of Christ, he sets it <hi>Olymp.</hi> 194. 3. so that according to him, <hi>AEsop</hi> dy'd not much above 560 Years before it. But if we follow <hi>Plutarch,</hi> we must place <hi>AEsop</hi>'s Death later, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59486:27"/>
of <hi>Croesus</hi>'s Reign, and then there were not so many Years between it and our Savious's Birth; and if we follow those Eminent Chronologers that will not allow that there were above 490 Years between the first Year of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and our Saviour's Death, we must still diminish the number of Years from <hi>AEsop</hi>'s Death to the Birth of our Saviour, and say, That there were not compleat 500 Years from the one to the other. By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That there is not any certainty how long <hi>AEsop</hi> lived before Christ, any more than there is how long <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudes</hi> lived after him; but tho' we take the extream accounts, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the one to have lived somewhat more than 560 Years before our Lord's Nativity, and the other 1370 Years after, yet the whole time will fall considerably short of 2000 Years.</p>

            <p>Here (if I mistake not) are two false Prints, one in Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> another in Dr. <hi>Bentley.</hi> In Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> the Printer hath put Page 13 instead of Page 24, for it is in his <hi>Dissert. p.</hi> 24. that Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> speaks of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. In Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> I conceive, That by the Printers fault, <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. is put instead of <hi>Olymp.</hi> 75. I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what suspected this before, but am now fully confirm'd in it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, First, That I cannot meet with any Author that refers <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 73. and then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59486:29"/>
Secondly, That the very same Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, who is alledg'd by Dr. <hi>Bentley, Diss. p.</hi> 85. to prove that <hi>Hiero</hi> was in the Monarchy the very next <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymp.</hi> after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition (<hi>viz.

Sic. Hiero</hi> was in the Monarchy the very next <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad</hi> after it, <hi>viz. Olymp.</hi> 76. And it is to be observ'd, That Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> here (<hi>Diss. p.</hi> 85.) doth not take <hi>Olympiad</hi> for the space of Four Years, but for the time when the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games were celebrated; and if we understand it thus, <hi>Hiero</hi> according to <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> was not in the Throne in any <hi>Olympiad</hi> before the 76th. To conclude this, from Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s quoting <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> I infer that his meaning is, That <hi>Hiero</hi> was in the Monarchy <hi>Olymp.</hi> 76th, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to him the very next <hi>Olympiad</hi> after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition, it follows that with <hi>Diod.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59486:30"/>
then I have shew'd in the former part of this View, that there are who differ from <hi>Diod.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59486:31"/>
Story, that it contradicts it; for he says, not that <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> expell'd the <hi>Samians</hi> from <hi>Zancle,</hi> but that he assisted 'em to take it. That <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> chang'd the name of <hi>Zancle</hi> into <hi>Messana,</hi> is agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> and me; the only Question is about the Date of this Change. <hi>Thucydides</hi> fixes upon no Date: <hi>Diodorus</hi> places the Death of one <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> in the 76th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but does not say this was the <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> that nam'd <hi>Messana. Herodotus</hi> in the place cited, says nothing about the change of the Names, but tells a story of the <hi>Samians</hi> seizing <hi>Zancle,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after <hi>Miletus</hi> was taken; and all the ground that we have from this Passage of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the change of the Name <hi>Zancle</hi> into <hi>Messana,</hi> to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd after this Time, is his calling the City <hi>Zancle,</hi> and not <hi>Messana</hi> throughout this Story: Which, I think, proves nothing more, than that the old Name was not yet so utterly abolish'd, but that it was call'd indifferently either <hi>Zancle</hi> or <hi>Messana</hi> still. So that hitherto we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59486:31"/>
have had no direct and positive Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony about the Time of <hi>Zancle</hi>'s changing its Name.</q>

            <p>All this manifestly declares how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus Sic.</hi> leave us, as to the Time of the name <hi>Zancle,</hi> its being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd for <hi>Messana</hi>; so that there is no need of making any Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> is the only Author, that speaks fully up to the Point: and he expresly affirms this to have happen'd in the 29th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and tells the story with a great deal of Solemnity and Circumstance.— Against an indirect and dubious Proof, built chiefly on a disputable Passage in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> we have the express and full and undoubted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Pausanias.</hi>

            <p>Tho' <hi>Herodotus, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Diod. Sic.</hi> leave us uncertain as to the Time of the change of the Name, yet it seems in Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Judgment,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59486:32"/>
we may rely upon the undoubted Authority of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and conclude certainly that it was <hi>Olymp.</hi> 29. But I crave leave to question, whether we can rely so certainly upon <hi>Pausa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>'s Authority in this case. For, First, Tho' <hi>Thucydides</hi> doth not fix the Time of the change of the Name any otherwise than by saying, That <hi>it was not long after the</hi> Samians <hi>flying from the</hi> Medes, <hi>possess'd</hi> Zancle: Yet this is sufficient to make us doubt of <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s Assertion, that it happen'd <hi>Olymp.</hi> 29. unless some Records can be produc'd, which may certifie us, That the <hi>Medes</hi> made any Incursion upon <hi>Greece</hi> so early as before that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad.</hi> Secondly, when <hi>Herodotus, l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 165. mentions the change of the Name, he is speaking of things done about the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; now is it not strange that he should speak of it so late, if the change was made (as <hi>Pausanias</hi> sets it) <hi>Olymp.</hi> 29. <hi>i. e.</hi> about 180 Years before? Especially when he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to speak of <hi>Zancle</hi> before. Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 130. makes <hi>Pausanias</hi> to differ from <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and to reject his Testimony concerning
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59486:32"/>
the Age of <hi>Anaxilaus</hi>; now if the Name was chang'd from <hi>Zancle</hi> to <hi>Messana</hi> in his Time (as they say it was) from their differing as to the Age in which <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> liv'd, it must follow, that they also differ'd as to the Time when the change of the Name was made. Now whatever <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s Authority may be in other things, I question whether it is such, as that we can certainly rely upon him, when two such Historians as <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> differ from him. I may add, That if <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi> who places the Death of one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxilaus Olymp.</hi> 76. speaks of the <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilaus</hi> that nam'd <hi>Messana,</hi> he also dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from <hi>Pausanias.</hi>

               <q>In the 29th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> when <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi> won the Prize the second time.</q> 
               <bibl>Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 129.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Pausanias</hi> in <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senicis, p.</hi> 134. hath these very Words, and yet afterward in the same Page he says, That <hi>Xenophon</hi> the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> won the Prize in the 29th <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad</hi>; so that I know not how to reconcile him to himself, unless by

putting a difference between <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. He useth the former Words concerning <hi>Chionis,</hi> the later concerning <hi>Xenophon</hi>; and the later we must translate (not <hi>In,</hi> but) <hi>About the</hi> 29<hi>th</hi> Olympiad. But then what is the meaning of <hi>About the</hi> 29<hi>th</hi> Olympiad? If it be said that his meaning is, That <hi>Xenophon</hi> was Victor in the next <hi>Olympiad</hi> to it, <hi>viz.</hi> the 30th, I ask why did he not plainly say so? Besides, <hi>Pausanias</hi> in <hi>Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, p.</hi> 269. says (not that <hi>Xenophon,</hi> but) <hi>Chionis</hi> was Victor the third time in the 30th <hi>Olympiad.</hi> Here I might also observe, That <hi>Pausanias</hi> agrees not with himself as to the Time when <hi>Miltiades</hi> was <hi>Archon.</hi> In <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senicis, p.</hi> 134. he says it was in the 29th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in which <hi>Chionis</hi> won the Prize the 2d time; but in <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, p.</hi> 269. he says it was in the 2d Year of the 30th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in which <hi>Chionis</hi> won it the 3d time.</p>

            <p>Such Eminent Chronologers fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s account of the time of the change of the Name from <hi>Zancle</hi> to <hi>Messana,</hi> some Persons may be apt to look upon it as certain: But on the other side, I say, First, Suppose it true, That they do all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his account, yet if they do not alledge some other ancienr Historian that agrees with it, it signifies little; for it depends upon <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s sole Authority still. Secondly, It doth not appear that they follow it. <hi>Vbbo Emmius,</hi> in his first Book mentions <hi>Messana,</hi> but of the change of the Name from <hi>Zancle</hi> to <hi>Messana</hi> (as far as I perceive) he says nothing. In his 7th Book, he speaks of the change of the Name, but is wholly silent as to the Time of it. I add, that in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59486:34"/>
his first Book he quotes <hi>Pausanias,</hi> when he is speaking of the <hi>Arcades,</hi> and the second <hi>Messenian</hi> War; but certainly we cannot conclude hence, that he follow'd <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s account of the Time, when the new Name <hi>Messana</hi> was given to the City, which was before call'd <hi>Zancle. Scaliger</hi> both in his Ammadversions, <hi>p. (mihi)</hi> 21. and in his <gap reason="foreign">

Olymp.</hi> 27. See him, <hi>de Doctrina Temporum, l.</hi> 13. and in <hi>Rat. Temp. par.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Meursius</hi> is so far from agreeing with <hi>Pausanias,</hi> that he plainly shews how little <hi>Pausanias</hi> is at agreement with himself; and he takes upon him to correct <hi>Pausanias,</hi> instead of following him. <hi>Lydiat</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remains, and if by his Notes on the <hi>Chronicon Marmoreum,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> means the <hi>Notae Historicae ad Chronicon Marmoreum,</hi> I grant that he doth fall in with <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s account.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59486:34"/>
Chronologers (except <hi>Lydiat</hi>) do agree with <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and since the ancient Historians, <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> do less agree with him, what certainty can we have as to the Time when the City had the new Name <hi>Messana</hi> given it?</p>

               <q>There was a River <hi>Tauromenius</hi> (if <hi>Vibius Sequester</hi> is to be credited, who says the Town had its Name from thence) before there was a <hi>Tauromenium.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here the Time when the Town was first call'd <hi>Tauromenium,</hi> is made still more uncertain; for if it had its name from the River <hi>Taurome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> it might have it long before the former of the Times mention'd by <hi>Diodorus Sic.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>All this tends directly to manifest the uncertainty of the Time when Comedy was invented. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> with the other

But then suppose it was certain, That it was not invented before <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarion</hi>'s Time, and that he was the inventer of it, what certainty have we of the Time when <hi>Susarion</hi> liv'd? All that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> can say of it, is, That according to the Marble, his erecting a Stage at <hi>Athens must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tyranny of</hi> Pisistratus, and that <hi>those Learned Men, who have taken pains to illustrate that Chronicle, have by the concurrence of other Histories plainly shewn, That the Time of</hi> Susario <hi>must fall between the</hi> 610<hi>th and</hi> 489<hi>th Year before Christ.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 140, 141. But by the Printers fault 489 is put instead of 589.

makes <hi>Susarion</hi> to have flourish'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 610th, and 589th Year (not before Christ, but) before the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the Time of the first Preaching, or Publishing of the Gospel.

according to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> the beginning of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Reign was not till <hi>Olymp.</hi> 55. 1.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59486:39"/>
other, but this difference between <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclides</hi> and <hi>Phanias</hi> only shews how uncertain it is, how long it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solon</hi>'s Death, that <hi>Pisistratus</hi>'s Tyranny began. <hi>Phanias ap. Plut.</hi> says, That <hi>Pisistratus</hi> siez'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment when <hi>Comias</hi> was <hi>Archon,</hi> and that <hi>Solon</hi> dy'd when his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Successor <hi>Hegestratus</hi> was <hi>Archon</hi>; but it is not agreed in what Year ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them was <hi>Archon.</hi> Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Comias</hi>'s <hi>Archonship</hi> to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 53. 3. others to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 50. 1. in the <hi>Marm.

(if the Learned Men who have taken pains to illustrate that Marble, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it rightly) as it also makes <hi>Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> to have begun his Tyranny then. But the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> refers the Government of the <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidae</hi> or the Sons of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> to <hi>Olymp.</hi> 50. 1. as both <hi>Tatianus Orat. con. Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alex. Stro.</hi> 1. say, That the Time of their Government was <hi>about the</hi> 50<hi>th</hi> Olympiad: So that, if these be in the right, the Time of the Fathers siezing the Government must be set much higher. For <hi>Iustin, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. says, That <hi>Pisistratus</hi> Reign'd 33 Years, with whom agrees <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59486:39"/>
de Politiis,</hi> and also <hi>Aristotle de Republica, l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 12. if I dot not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake his meaning, when he says, That <hi>in Thirty three Years</hi> Pisistratus <hi>Reign'd only Seventeen Years,</hi> i. e. (if I understand him rightly) tho' there were Thirty three Years in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Pisistratus</hi>'s invading the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and his Death, yet he enjoy'd it only Seventeen Years, the other Sixteen Years he liv'd in Exile. After all, I freely confess, That, if it could be made out, that the Word <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidae</hi> is not always used strictly as it denotes the Sons of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> but sometimes in a more comprehensive Sense, as including <hi>Pisistratus</hi> and his Sons too, this Argument from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Tatianus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> would lose all its force: But till that be made appear, it plainly Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates how little certainty there is of the Time when <hi>Pisistratus</hi> first seiz'd the Government. Nor is it more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when he was turn'd out of it. Dr. <hi>Bentley, Diss. p.</hi> 41. says, It was in the Days of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> will have it rather to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Reign; both which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts leave us uncertain when he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59486:40"/>
was driven out, unless it could be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known what time <hi>Phalaris</hi> Reign'd. Besides <hi>Herodotus, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. informs us, That <hi>Pisistratus</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out twice, and as often recover'd the Tyranny; therefore we should have been inform'd of whether turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out they speak, otherwise we cannot so well judge of the Time of it.</p>

               <q>It is not to be doubted, but the <hi>Alcestis</hi> of <hi>Phrynichus</hi> (that <hi>Phryni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who was <hi>Thespis</hi>'s Scholar) was acted before <hi>Olymp.</hi> 67.</q> 
               <bibl>Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 168.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>But (craving this Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons leave) I cannot but doubt of it, for as I know not that any Author affirms it, so he doth not declare what ground he hath for such assurance. I know that <hi>Suidas</hi> affirms, That <hi>Phrynichus</hi> won the Prize in that very <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and mentions <hi>Alcestis</hi> as one of his Plays; but it cannot be infer'd hence, That <hi>Alcestis</hi> was acted before that <hi>Olympiad</hi>; Yea, if I should say that it was one of those Plays of his that were acted then, and by which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59486:40"/>
he won the Prize, or that it was acted after that Time, it would not be easie to disprove it.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Tragedy is of ancient Vsage in this Country, nor did it take its Rise from</hi> Thespis <hi>and</hi> Phrynichus, <hi>as some imagine; but if you consider the thing well, you find that it is extreamly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>; Plato in Minoe.</q> 
               <bibl>Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 170, 171.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Plato</hi> bears Testimony to the uncertainty of the Antiquity of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, in telling us his own Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and yet withal, that others were of a contrary Opinion, that it took its Rise from <hi>Thespis.</hi> Besides, he doth not tell us how ancient he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd Tragedy to be. I know Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> says, That <hi>he</hi> (i. e. Plato) <hi>thought it almost as ancient as</hi> Minos, and that <hi>the reason of his introducing the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shews it</hi>; but, if we consult <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> we shall find that the reason of his introducing it shews no such thing. Whether <hi>Plato</hi> thought Tragedy more ancient than <hi>Minos,</hi> or only as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or but almost as ancient, cannot
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59486:41"/>
be determin'd from the reason of his introducing the Reflection. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> knows not what to make of a Passage of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Solon,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>Thespis</hi> now beginning to move or set on foot the Play called Tragedy; but (says he) <hi>he could not mean, That there was no such thing as Tragedy of any kind before the Days of</hi> Thespis, <hi>and be consistent with himself; for he expresly tells us in another place (the Life of</hi> Theseus<hi>) that the acting of Tragedies was one part of the funeral Solemnities which the</hi> Athenians <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd at the Tomb of</hi> Theseus: Thus Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 176. But I do not find any such thing in the Life of <hi>Theseus.</hi> Indeed, in the Life of <hi>Cimon,</hi> there is a Passage which some Ignorant or less considering Persons may possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue to such a Sense, but Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> could not. I add, that if there be any such Passage in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> it doth not contradict this, That Tragedy took its Rise from <hi>Thespis,</hi> for <hi>Theseus</hi> had no Tomb at <hi>Athens,</hi> before the Days of <hi>Thespis.</hi> So that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, <hi>Plutarch</hi> by those Words in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59486:41"/>
the Life of <hi>Solon</hi> might mean, That there was no such thing as Tragedy of any kind before the Days of <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis.</hi> To proceed, Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 171. brings <hi>Diog. Laertius</hi> as a Witness, That Tragedy is more ancient than <hi>Thespis</hi>; but on the other side, <hi>p.</hi> 177. he speaks of Authors in the Plural Number, who make <hi>Thespis</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of it, and <hi>p.</hi> 176. he calls them old Writers; so that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that there are ancient Writers for the one Opinion, as well as the other. I know that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us, That when these Authors make <hi>Thespis</hi> the Inventer of Tragedy, their meaning is, That he was the Improver of it, or that he was the Inventer of <hi>that sort of Tragedy which consisted in Imitation, and</hi> a Fable, (See him, <hi>p.</hi> 174.) whereas there was Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy (tho' not of that sort) before: But he himself is not very confident that this was their meaning, for he says, <hi>p.</hi> 177. <hi>In this Sense it is that we must understand those Authors who make</hi> Thespis <hi>the Inventer of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, or allow that they spake inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately.</hi> We are left (you see) to our liberty whether we will
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59486:42"/>
understand those Authors in the forementioned Sense, or allow that they spake inconsiderately. But for my part, I am not forward to pass such a Censure upon ancient Writers, that they spake inconsiderately and unwarily, particularly I am not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to believe either that <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi> spake inconsiderately, or that he spake of this or that sort of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, but of it in general, when speaking of the Inventers of other things he comes at length to Tragedy, and says, That <hi>Thespis</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd or invented it. But it may be said, If <hi>Thespis</hi> was the Inventer of it, then the Date of Tragedy is not uncertain. To which I answer, That this would follow, if we were certain of the Time when <hi>Thespis</hi> liv'd and flourish'd; but Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> sufficiently makes it appear how far we are from being certain of that. For <hi>p.</hi> 166. he says, That Plutarch <hi>and</hi> Diog. Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>expresly affirm, That</hi> Thespis <hi>was Contemporary with</hi> Solon, <hi>telling us very particularly what pass'd between</hi> Solon <hi>and</hi> Thespis, <hi>in relation to the Plays of the later</hi>; and adds, That Solon <hi>dy'd at the end of the</hi> 53, <hi>or the beginning
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59486:42"/>
of the</hi> 54 Olympiad. In <hi>p.</hi> 167. he says, That <hi>the</hi> Arundel <hi>Marble fixes the acting of</hi> Alcestis, <hi>one of</hi> Thespis<hi>'s Plays as low as the</hi> 60<hi>th</hi> Olympiad. And <hi>p.</hi> 170. he tells us, That <hi>Suidas</hi> says, <hi>Thespis flourish'd in the</hi> 61<hi>st</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> further tells us, That taking our account at the lowest, we must make him to have written according to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and <hi>Diog. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius two or three Years before</hi> Solon'<hi>s Death</hi>; but we may take it higher, and make him to have begun to write Plays near the time of <hi>Solon</hi>'s <hi>Archon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> which according to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> was <hi>Olymp.</hi> 46. 3. and we may the rather do this, because <hi>Eusebius Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon placeth the Rise of Tragedy at the</hi> 47<hi>th</hi> Olympiad, as Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> observes, <hi>p.</hi> 166. Now between <hi>Olymp.</hi> 47. and <hi>Olymp.</hi> 61. are above Fifty Years. Thus it fully appears from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors alledg'd by Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle certainty we have of the time of the Rise of Tragedy; those that say it is more ancient than <hi>Thespis,</hi> not ascertaining us how much more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient it is, and those that make <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi> the Inventer of it, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed about the Time when he liv'd,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59486:43"/>
and begun to write Tragedies. Need I after all this take notice of that which <hi>Suidas</hi> hath to this purpose, acquainting us, That some make <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi> the first Tragedian, but others <hi>Epigenes Sicyonius</hi>; some saying, That <hi>Thespis</hi> was the 16th from <hi>Epigenes,</hi> and others that he was the 2d? An old Scholiast alledg'd by <hi>Iul. Caesar Bulenger de Theatro, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2. mentions one <hi>Theomis,</hi> who <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> first found out Tragical Melodies, and was admir'd for them among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in the time of <hi>Orestes</hi> (they that please may see his Words either in <hi>Bulenger,</hi> or in the <hi>Tractatus de Tragaedia,</hi> prefix'd to the late <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Edition of <hi>Euripides</hi>) but of what Authority that Scholiast is I know not.</p>

                  <hi>Eustathius</hi>'s Time was about 200 Years before <hi>Planudes</hi> was born.</q> 
               <bibl>Mr. <hi>Boyle, p.</hi> 270.</bibl>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicetas Choniat. Annal. l.</hi> 1. <hi>vers. fin.</hi> makes <hi>Eustathius</hi> to have liv'd in the Time of <hi>Andronicus Commenus,</hi> and he came to the Empire (as we are told) in or about <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1182. As
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59486:43"/>
to <hi>Planudes,</hi> when he was born I know not, but as to the Time of his flourishing, Dr. <hi>Bentley, p.</hi> 149. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1370. but other Learned Men set it <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1340. And it must be allow'd, That he was born at least 20 Years before: And so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to one account, he was born at or before <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1320. according to the other, at or before <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1350. If then we make <hi>Eustathius</hi> to have liv'd about <hi>An. Do.</hi> 1182. the interval between his Time, and the Birth of <hi>Planudes</hi> will fall conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably short of 200 Years; so that the Account which Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors follow'd differs from these; but which is the truest cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</p>
            <p>Thus I have taken notice of most of the Passages in the <hi>Dissertation</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> of it which relate to Chronology, and conceive that with the assistance of the Learned and Worthy Persons, the Authors of them, I have manifested the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Time, when the Persons lived, or the Cities were built, or the Things were done, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59486:44"/>
in those Passages. And we may believe that other parts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Chronology being strictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, would be found to have no juster pretensions to Certainty, than these which have been now consider'd are found to have.</p>
