            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The firſt of theſe Relations was written at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Italian</hi> by an Agent there to one of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> at the time that the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke <hi>de Olivarez</hi> was baniſht the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> I have pruned off ſome ſuperfluous branches, and ingrafted a few neceſſary Cions borrowed from other trees.</p>

                  <p>Being the third Son of his Family, he be took himſelf to the ſtudy of the Law at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> where he was Corrivall with three Learned perſons for a Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary at <hi>Sevill,</hi> which he obtained.

                  <p>As for the <hi>Queen,</hi> whom the the Laws of God and Man forbad to bee ſeparated from her Husband; ſhe was kept in ſuch awe and ſubjection by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> her firſt Lady of

                  <p>Now although ſome rigour ſhould bee uſed in the examination of all the actions of the <hi>Conde Duke,</hi> it will not be denyed but that he had moſt rare endowments for a Miniſter of State; for the zeal and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had for to Aggrandize his Maſter and his Dominions, knew no bounds; He gave himſelf wholly to the tranſaction of publique Affairs; inſomuch that he would not allow himſelf one hour of Recreation; He was the declared enemy of all Preſents, not ſuffering any of his ſervants to ſell his Favor, or their Credit with him: But on the contrary ſpent of his own Revenues for the ſervice of the King, profeſſing that all he had was devoted to the publique good, and that hee did nothing but to augment the grandeur of the King, and to ſerve the State. Yet ſome that would

ſeem to ſee farther then vulgar eyes, ſay, That the reaſon why hee received no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, was, becauſe hee conceived that to be the only way to continue in favor; and that by other ways being as covetous as cruell, hee found out the true ſecret of heaping up treaſure, without appearing ambitious. To this end he got into his hands! <hi>Commanderies</hi> of all the three Orders of Knighthood, which were worth to him 40000 Crowns <hi>per an';</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf great Maſter of the Kings Wardrobe; Maſter of the Horſe; &amp; Great Chancellor of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which three Offices were worth him 200000 Crownes <hi>per annum;</hi> but much more conſiderable were the vaſt ſums received from the <hi>Indies;</hi> for when the Fleet ſet ſail from <hi>Sevill</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> he cauſed to be ſhipt abundance of Corn, Wine, and Oyle Cuſtome-free, which he ſent from his County of <hi>Olivarez;</hi> and ſelling the ſame in the <hi>Indies</hi> at four times their worth in <hi>Spain,</hi> cauſed the Moneys to be employed in Spices, Jewels, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, &amp;c. which are there at a low price, bur of great value in Europe; ſo that

without couſening the King hee hath this way gained many Millions which Wiſe men perſwade themſelves were never ſpent in the Kings ſervice.</p>
                  <p>As for his zeal to augment his Maſters greatneſs; ſome are of opinion, That the exceſs of ſo eminent a Vertue was in him a Vice which produced great Miſchiefs; for he was ſo paſsionate in the purſuance of that deſigne, that he feared not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content the People, the Nobility, the Princes, the Queen her ſelf, ſo hee might content the King, and carry on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the People, whoſe Love is the main foundation and ſtrongeſt prop of Monarchies: This blind paſsion carryed him away ſo far, as to endevor to aboliſh in Spain divers priviledges and Liberties, to the end hee might render the King more abſolute over his Subjects: Hee extorted from the Laity and Clergy, by the <hi>Mediannates,</hi> an invention of his own, which was the Payment of half an years Revenues of all Offices and Benefices that were bestowed; alſo by abaſing and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40725:8"/>
the value of Coyne, an intollerable grievance to the Subject; and by many other Impoſitions, raiſed above Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixteen Millions of Gold.</p>
                  <p>Such like endeavours were the firſt ground of the totall revolt of the <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who together with the people of <hi>Aragon,</hi> had ſo great Priviledges and Liberties, that they paſſed rather for a people recommended then ſubject to the Kings of Spain; whence it hath ever been <hi>Arcanum Imperii</hi> amongſt the Kings of Spain to endeavor to infringe thoſe Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that rendred ſuſpitious the Loyalty of thoſe people: Inſomuch, that in all the Wars with France, the Kings of Spain durſt not ſuffer their Armies to march that way. Thoſe of <hi>Aragon,</hi> in that notable buſineſs of <hi>Don Antonio Perez,</hi> were by <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, not without much craft and force, brought into abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſubjection: but the <hi>Catalonians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſt in the maintenance of their Priviledges, and very difficult to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch ſubjection; becauſe being borderers upon France by ſea and land,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40725:9"/>
they could commodiouſly receive thence aſſiſtance or ſuccour. Nevertheleſs the ſaid zeal of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke put him upon that attempt, ſo that at a Parliament holden at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> the chief Citie of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the jealous <hi>Catalonians</hi> took no ſmall diſtaſte that the <hi>Duke</hi> endeavoured to invade their Privileges, by not ſuffering their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to be covered in his preſence, which had uſed to be covered in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. After this the <hi>Duke</hi> proceeding in the like attempts to diminiſh their Priviledges, &amp; yet to keep them in obedience, quartered Souldiers upon them after the faſhion of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> but the <hi>Catalonians</hi> not being able to endure the inſolence of the ſoldiers, took Arms, killed &amp; drave away their sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, killed alſo their Vice-Roy, the <hi>Conde di Coloma,</hi> &amp; put themſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>French.</hi> Thus was loſt the moſt populous part of all <hi>Spain,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey above 800 miles in compaſs, and the onely Countrey of all <hi>Spain</hi> wherein is to be found all materials neceſſary for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and rigging ſhips: The Caſtles, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Villages, great Towns, and Cities ſtand ſo thick, that they ſeem rather one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40725:9"/>
continued Citie then a Province.</p>
                  <p>To this may be added the inexpreſſible loſſe of the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> with all the dependencies upon that Crown in the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi> Iſlands, by the miſcarriage of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke in diſcontenting that Nation, which ſhall be related at large as a moſt remarkable Hiſtory. There have ever been a certain Antipathy &amp; enmity betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> as great as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> But ſince they have been ſubject to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> have been ſo averſe from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that the Pariſh Prieſts and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at the end of their Maſs and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were wont to exhort the people publickly to ſay two <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> to the end that it would pleaſe our Saviour and the bleſſed Virgin to deliver them from the Tyranny (as they termed it) of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillians,</hi> expecting always ſome favourable occaſion to make an univerſall Revolt.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, in the year, 1636. the new Tax called the Fifth part, was generally impoſed, that is Five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40725:10"/>
upon all Eſtates and Merchandiſe; which being judged not only very grievous, but alſo moſt unjuſt, gave occaſion to all the Southern part of <hi>Portugall</hi> to riſe in arms, and had no queſtion ſet the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on fire, had it not been quencht by the great care of the <hi>Infanta Margarita</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Kings Aunt, then Governeſs.</p>
                  <p>The Court of Spain obſerving here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the inclinations of that people to an univerſall revolt, reſolved to uſe the beſt means to ſecure it: In the firſt place, to allure forth the great Duke of <hi>Briganza,</hi> who for Riches, power, number of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, affection of the people, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, was the chief Nobleman not onely of Portugall, but of all Spain, and (which was more then all had an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted right to the Crown of Portugall, and therefore certainly it was a cruell pity in <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, to ſeiz upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and yet to leave the pretender to the Crown, not onely alive, but greater and higher then ever he was: It being an infallible Maxime, That <hi>nothing can bee ſufficient to ſecure his Loyalty, who hath</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40725:10"/>
                     <hi>power enough to juſtifie diſloyalty</hi> To make ſure of the Duke, they firſt offred him the Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> which he modeſtly refuſed, reſolving not to ſtirre forth of <hi>Portugall.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Conde Duke</hi> was reſolved to try all ways imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; to which the Rebellion of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> ſeemed to offer a fit opportunity for this deſign; for the <hi>Conde Duke</hi> politickly gave out that the King was to goe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the <hi>Catalonians;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all the Nobility in the Kings do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions were to appear within 4 Months at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to wait upon the King in this Expedition. But the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> wel knowing the affection of the <hi>Portugals</hi> and ſuſpition of the <hi>Caſtillians;</hi> to the end that hee might take off the one, and aſſure the other, retires himſelf to his Countrey houſe, there to follow his hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, excuſing himſelf to the <hi>Conde Duke,</hi> that his affairs at preſent were in ſo bad a condition, that hee could not appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with that ſplendor and dignity that became a perſon of his Quality; and that he was confident he could doe his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40725:11"/>
better ſervice by ſtaying at home when all the reſt of the Nobility were gone forth. This anſwer much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the former ſuſpitions of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke: wherefore he reſolved to make uſe of the moſt exquiſite diſſimulation that ever he had done in all his life; and becauſe it was a moſt tickliſh affair, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caution and ſubtilty was neceſſary: Firſt then, the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke by Letters aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> he was well ſatified with his reaſons, and of his good inclination to his Majeſties ſervice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to make a ſhew of true amity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be very compaſſionate of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Dukes Intereſt. Thirdly, he aſſured him that the King was very well content that he ſhould continue there, &amp; to reſtifie unto him the confidence and truſt was repoſd in him, made him General of all the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> leaving it to his choice to reſide in what place he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed neer <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and to ſupply his preſent neceſſity, ſent him 60000 Crowns.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Intrigue</hi> of the <hi>Conde Dukes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to thoſe that ſaw onely the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40725:11"/>
of the buſineſs, ſo ſtrange and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the Kings intereſt, that they cryed out, This was the very way to loſe all, the rather becauſe by calling back the Duke from his retired life at his Countrey Houſe, he was now expoſed to the view of the <hi>Lisbonians,</hi> in whoſe thoughts the Houſe of <hi>Braganza</hi> hath ever been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as right heir to that Crown, that his preſence muſt needs augment the hopes of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and new kindle their deſires to have a King of their own.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> was put into thoſe very hands that aſpired to the Scepter: but this kind of dealing was the <hi>Conde</hi> Dukes ordinary courſe, who was oft heard to brag, that he gained much more by ſuch counterfeit <hi>Careſſes,</hi> then with downright threats. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Olivarez</hi> intention to truſt the Duke, but to carry the buſineſs ſo, that the Duke might truſt him. And indeed what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtimony of confidence could have been imagined, then to ſend the Duke neer <hi>Lisbon,</hi> give him the command of all the Forces, and ſupply him with moneys.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40725:12"/>
All theſe crafts and ſubtilties no doubt would had bin enough to have charmed the Dukes ſpirit, and to have made him to confide in <hi>Olivarez,</hi> but that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acquaintance hee had with his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, had inſtructed him to ſtand upon his guard. In the mean time the <hi>Infanta Margarita</hi> upon whole ſhoulders all the good and bad events of <hi>Portugall</hi> was like to fall, amazed at theſe manifeſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Revolt were offered to the Duke, advertiſed the King thereof by divers Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereunto ſhe received cold anſwers full of Riddles and darkneſs; the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whereof a little after ſeemed much greater; For, without giving her any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, all the Spaniards that kept Gariſon in Saint <hi>Johns Caſtle,</hi> which commanded <hi>Lisbon,</hi> were drawn forth, at a time when the ſafety and ſecurity of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom depended upon that Caſtles ſtrength, and that ſtrength upon the fidelity of thoſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſouldiers; but it was a ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme wherein conſiſted the laſt attempt of <hi>Olivarez</hi> to ſecure the Duke; and that his cunning might not be diſcovered, but lie
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40725:12"/>
hid for a time, ſtaid till Summer, 1640. before he would invite afreſh the Duke to come to Court, which he did at length by a large Letter; wherein after ample teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of affection, he much commended the Loyalty of the Duke, his vigilance and diligence in his Office of <hi>Generall;</hi> and the happy effects of his authority over the <hi>Portugals;</hi> then repreſented unto him the ſad condition of the Monarchy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſorders of <hi>Flanders,</hi> diſaſters of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the great preparations of the <hi>Turk;</hi> but chiefly becauſe of the moſt powerfull Enemies the <hi>French,</hi> already entred into <hi>Spain</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Catalonians:</hi> that the onely way to ſave the Kingdome, was to chaſe away theſe laſt, but that this could not be well effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted but by a vigorous aſsiſtance of all the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> of which he was the chief; He might by his preſence, and with a good number of his Tenants, give example to others; and that to this end his Majeſty expected him every moment, with deſign to Honour him, and conferr upon him priviledges and dignities of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40725:13"/>
high concernment. Now although the Duke was reputed a man not very well verſed in the world, yet he carried himſelf with ſo much wiſdom and diſcretion, that after he had ſupplied the King with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of his Tenants and Friends, he refuſed to goe in perſon; but uſing craft againſt craft, retired himſelf to his Countrey houſe, that ſo he might take off all ſuſpition of jealouſie, that he plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing againſt the State. The <hi>Conde</hi> Duke in all this uſed all fair means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw there was no hope of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe, inſomuch that by reciprocal diſſimulation each of them laboured to give teſtimonie of ſingular affection and perfect confidence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infanta</hi> vigilant upon all ocaſions, obſerving theſe proceedings, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing what would be the iſſue, wrote to the King and to <hi>Olivarez</hi> very urgent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, proteſting that if ſpeedy remedy were not taken, the Kingdome muſt needs be loſt; The King hereunto gave no anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Olivarez</hi> in his Letters uſeth her like a ſilly woman, fitter to govern a Family
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40725:13"/>
then a Kingdom, bidding her, that if ſhe comprehended not the myſteries of State, at leaſt ſhe ſhould not diſcover them. In the mean time <hi>Olivarez</hi> ſent ſecret Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to <hi>Don Lopez de Oſsis,</hi> and <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Oquendo,</hi> after they had relieved <hi>Flanders</hi> with men and money, to put in with his whole Fleet upon the Coaſt of <hi>Portugall;</hi> and ſo ſoon as the Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza</hi> ſhould come aboard the ſhips, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the duty of his place, and new office, they ſhould ſet ſail and bring him away to <hi>Cales;</hi> but that great Fleet was ruined by the <hi>Hollander</hi> upon the <hi>Downs</hi> in the year 1639. Hereupon it being thought neceſſary to weaken the <hi>Portugals</hi> by draining the Kingdom of ſuperfluous humours, a great number of Souldiers were drawn forth, which inflamed more thoſe ill humors, that had been much ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the divers diſcontents and diſtaſte which generally was taken againſt <hi>Vaſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zellos</hi> chief <hi>Secretary</hi> of State, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him the manage of all affairs, leaving to the <hi>Infanta</hi> onely the bare Title of <hi>Vice-Queen,</hi> governed abſolutely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40725:14"/>
to his own will and pleaſure, being a man of unſufferable petulancy, and ſet as controller of his Miſtreſs actions, and in <hi>Madrid</hi> the Principall affairs of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> were menaged by <hi>Don Diego Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> father in law to <hi>Vaſconzellos:</hi> Theſe, with ſome other miſcarriages, were the true occaſions of that generall revolt, which was contrived in few days, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in fewer hours. For as ſoon as ſome of the chiefe Nobility privatly met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, began the diſcourſe of the many grievances, intollerable taxations, pride and arrogancy of the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> that were Officers of State, in particular of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>Vaſconzellos,</hi> their Liberties vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, their Clergy impoveriſhed, their Nobility deſtined for the ſlaughter, their Countrey ruinated, and all their Privileges engraven upon a Marble pillar, expoſed to the publick view, violated and infringed, &amp;c. It was propoſed at the ſame privat meeting to change it into a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with powerful reaſons made abortive that deſigne, and ſet their thoughts upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40725:14"/>
endevouring to win the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to accept of the Crown, the Dukes name was <hi>John</hi> ſon to <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſon to <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> who was daughter to <hi>Edward,</hi> ſon to <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugall:</hi> ſo it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that one Don <hi>Gaſton Cotigno</hi> ſhould make this Overture to the Duke, who went immediatly to his Highneſs at His Country houſe, and there told him of the generall diſcontent of the people, of the generall conſent of the Nobility and Clergy to receive Him as their King; and that the preſent conjuncture of affairs ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to invite Him to embrace without delay ſo profitable and neceſſary a deſign, for that now the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was at a low ebb, diſtracted with Wars on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, all the Forces of <hi>Spain</hi> employed againſt <hi>Catalonia;</hi> that they could not want aſsiſtance from <hi>France,</hi> and others that were jealous of the greatneſs of that Houſe; that now was the time for him to recover that Right which hath been ſo long detained from his Anceſtors; that Fortune ſeldome offers a man a Kingdom; that this opportunity being let ſlip, in vain
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40725:15"/>
might He hereafter hope for the like, or for ſuccor from the <hi>Portugals,</hi> when Hee ſhall be clapt in priſon at <hi>Madrid;</hi> that if He would not take it upon Him, the whole Kingdome was reſolved to change it into a <hi>Republick,</hi> and then He ſhould not only be equalized with the reſt of low Condition, but hated by all, and looked upon as one who refuſed to bee an inſtrument of His Countries Liberty, and ſo ſhould bee the moſt unappy man amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>After a long ſilence, the Duke told him He thanked him and the whole Nobility for their affections toward Him, but that this was a buſineſs of ſuch weight, that it required a more mature deliberation; That he knew well, that this was an Affair of that kinde, that knew no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt the Crown and the Halter. The next night communicating the whole buſineſs to his Wife, who is ſiſter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a Woman of a Manly courage, fit for ſuch a bold Enterpriſe; and wavering with Himſelf whether Hee had better conſent to the Nobility, or fly to <hi>Madrid,</hi> his Wife thus briefly ſpake to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40725:15"/>
him; My Friend, if thou goeſt to <hi>Madrid,</hi> thou runneſt the hazard of loſing thy Head; if thou accepteſt the Crown, thou runneſt the ſame hazard; If then thou muſt periſh, better dye nobly at home, then baſely abroad: At which words the Duke was ſo animated, that he came forth of his Cloſet, and bad one of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents goe and acquaint the Nobility, that he was reſolved to undertake the ſame En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and run the ſame hazard with them all; whereupon, immediatly, (for this buſineſs could not ſuffer delay) the Nobility about Midday diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeverall places of the City, as they had agreed, ſome amongſt the guard of <hi>Swiſſes;</hi> ſome towards the lodging of the <hi>Infanta;</hi> ſome to the <hi>Caſtle;</hi> others to the Spaniſh <hi>Fleet</hi> in the Haven; others to the Spaniſh <hi>Corps de Gard</hi> before the Kings Palace; and others to the Lodgings of <hi>Vazconzellos:</hi> And at the hour appointed, a Piſtoll being ſhot off near the Palace, the next fell upon the Swiſſe guard; and others hearing the noiſe of them, fell on in their appointed ſtations, made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40725:16"/>
of all in a moment, without killing but one <hi>Swiſſe</hi> who made reſiſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Vaſconzellos,</hi> who was killed in his chamber, and thrown down out of his window to be a publick ſpectacle to the people. Others preſenting themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Vice-Queen,</hi> ſhe told them, That if this inſurrection had no other aim but to revenge themſelves upon <hi>Vaſconzellos,</hi> ſhe aſſured them upon returning to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to gain a generall pardon from the King. But ſhe was anſwered, That as for their moſt unjuſt grievances they had now received ſatisfaction upon <hi>Vanſconzellos,</hi> and had no other King but <hi>Don John</hi> the fourth. Hereupon the cry went all over <hi>Lisbon, God ſave King John;</hi> and from one of the clock till three all ſhops were ſhut; but then all were again ſet open with ſo great joy and content of the Citizens, that all rancor and malice ſet a-part, the moſt inveterate enemies embraced one another with tears of joy. The <hi>Infanta</hi> for more ſecurity they removed away from the Palace to the Houſe where an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the <hi>Infanta's</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> were wont
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40725:16"/>
to dwell, leaving her ſome Souldiers to guard her. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> went in ſolemne proceſſion through the Citie, and to encourage the people, and fix them the better in their reſolutions in chuſing a new King, made uſe of one of the nails wherewith Chriſt was nail'd to the Croſſe, which he carried in his hand, thereby authorizing this inſurrection with an act of Religion, to intimate to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all was ordained by the ſpeciall providence of heaven, and that in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the cauſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> they ſhould defend the cauſe of God: To corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate which conceit, they made uſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain old <hi>Propheſies</hi> and new <hi>Prodigies,</hi> that in the perſon of this <hi>Duke</hi> was verified a certain apparition of Chriſt to King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo</hi> juſt as he was ready to give battell to the five Kings of the <hi>Moores,</hi> by which he was promiſed not onely victory, but that he and his generations ſhould reign to the <hi>ſixteenth</hi> Generation, at which his Race ſhould be thought extinct, but ſhould flouriſh again when it ſhould be leaſt of all thought upon: They made
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40725:17"/>
their obſervations alſo upon the day, being the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> on which day the Citie was recovered out of the hands of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſeized upon by <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, ſo that it was a day fatall to <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon.</hi> Amongſt other prodigies that were given out to keep the common people the better in their loyalty to their new King, one was, that the next day in the chamber where <hi>Vaſconzollos</hi> was killed, there were found ſo great a number of <hi>Bats,</hi> that none could enter into the room. Alſo, that the plot ſhould be kept ſecret ſo long time, for it was plotted ſome weeks before it was executed, was reckond as a great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that among ſo many perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees, kindred, age, rich and poor, the deſign ſhould be kept undiſcovered. Another as great a wonder was that <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> a Citie ſo wonderfully populous, and the whole Kingdome ſhould with one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall acclamation accept of the <hi>Duke,</hi> not one perſon gain-ſaying, That all the Forts and Caſtles garriſon'd by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhould be delivered up without reſiſtance, and that all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo ſhould be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40725:17"/>
ſent away, and the quiet of the Kingdome ſetled without the effuſion of more bloud then of two or three perſons. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de la Puebla,</hi> kinſman to the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke, with ſome other of the principall <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were ſecured as Hoſtages for thoſe <hi>Portugals</hi> that ſhould be found at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or elſe where in the Catholique Kings dominion. Thurſday following the Duke made his entry into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with the generall acclamations of all ſorts, crying, <hi>God ſave King John,</hi> all the Canons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging, Bells ringing, with Bonfires and Fireworks for three nights following. And the more to gain the peoples affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, divers impoſitions were taken off, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſet at liberty, and Offices confer'd upon the Race of thoſe whoſe Anceſtors had enjoyed the ſame under the naturall Kings of <hi>Portugall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All ſorts of Men, Clergy or Laymen or women, brought in their Plate, Gold, Jewels, &amp;c. to make money for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenace of this new Kingdome. The Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy brought in as a gift ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, the Nobility four hundred
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40725:18"/>
thouſand, and the people one Million of Gold.</p>

he was proclaimed King, affecting always a plain Garb and ſober diet, often ſaying, that great perſonages ought to be affable, and that any clothes becom them, and any diet nouriſheth them; he is very active of body, few there are that can outrun him; and indeed he hath run wel that hath gained a Crown.

                  <p>It happened that the King going in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to his Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the Queen was left Governeſſe at <hi>Madrid,</hi> where ſhe had opportunity to employ and make known her rare qualities and endowments; for abateing the auſtere gravity of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard,</hi> and mixing it with the courteſy of the <hi>French;</hi> ſhe oft viſited the ſouldiery about <hi>Madrid,</hi> diſcourſed with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, took order for their pay, encouraged them to ſerve faithfully the King, cauſed Juſtice to be adminiſtred with integrity, gave often audience to all ſortes, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented none in the rayſing moneyes, and in all affaires behaved her ſelfe with ſuch an heroick diſcretion; that all men eſteemed

                  <p>The King conſidering their diſcourſe, began to be perſwaded at length that if the Duke had any longer the Managery

In the mean time it was noyſed abroad that the favour of the Duke was ſo ſhaken that one ſhock more would down with it to the ground, all men bleſſing and commending the Queen, crying that the <hi>Iſabells</hi> were ever fortunat to the Monarchy of <hi>Spain, Iſabell</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> wife of King <hi>John</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew the inſolent favour of <hi>Alvares de Luna,</hi> and diſcharged her husbands King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the tyranny of that favorite: <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella de Caſtile</hi> demonſtrated to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> her Husband that in the Kings Court, the Kings favourite ought to be none but the Queen that the ſubjects were born only to obey and the King to command: and that the happy removall of this moſt puiſſant

                     <hi>When a Tree is falling, every one cryes Down with it.</hi> A Lady that was once the Kings Nurce, <hi>Donna Anna de Guevara,</hi> partly out of zeal to the Kings ſervice, and partly to be revenged on the Dutcheſs, as the King was to paſs by night from his Lodgings to the Queens, ſhe put herſelf in the paſſage, caſting herſelf at the kings feet, &amp; having proteſted that ſhe was not there to demand any grace at his Majeſties hands, but to render to the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> the greateſt ſervice that it could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſhe ſaid that her motherly affection enforced her to diſcover to his Majeſty what perhaps many others durſt not for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reſpects. The King giving her leave to ſpeak freely, ſhe repreſented unto him the generall affliction of his people, the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Kingdoms, the abuſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in his Revenues, the many loſſes on every ſide, and the ſad condition of the whole Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhewing him, that theſe evils were the judgments of <hi>God</hi> upon him, for ſuffering the government of his Kingdoms which God had appointed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40725:24"/>
for him onely, to continue in the hands of another, that now it was high time that his Majeſty ſhould be out of his minority, and that he ſhould not incenſe the wrath of God againſt him, by ſuffering his poor ſubjects to be abuſed,; at leaſt that he would have compaſſion on the Prince his Son, who ran an hazard to be ſimple King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> or leſſe; concluding, that if ſhe had offended his Majeſty by her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech, ſhe was ready to receive puniſhment, being well content having given her milk for the good of her King, to ſacrifice her blood for the good of the Realms of her Prince. The King having hearkned unto her with much attention, anſwered, <hi>Haveis hablado verdades,</hi> You have told me the truth.</p>
                  <p>After this appears upon the Stage (for perfecting the Cataſtrophe of the Dukes Tragedy) the <hi>Infanta Margarite de Savoy</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had been ſo roughly handled by the Duke both before &amp; after her leaving <hi>Portugall,</hi> being ſecretly come from <hi>Ocania,</hi> where ſhe had been in a manner confined, and arrived at Court, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40725:25"/>
Duke did his utmoſt to debar her audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the King, and to diſcredit her in the Councell of State, and would not vouchſafe to viſit her. Nevertheleſſe the Queen invited her to come to her Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and took order that ſhe ſhould have opportuity to ſpeak with the King for two hours ſpace.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Infanta</hi> gave God thanks for her ſafe deliverance out of the hands of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that after ſo great ſufferings, ſhe might once more appear in the preſence of his Majeſty, to make known her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the failings and errors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, made a brief Relation of all things paſt in <hi>Portugall,</hi> making it appear that ſhe was innocent, and that the loſſe of <hi>Portugall</hi> was to be attributed to the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and negligence, if not to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Duke. The Queen in the mean time failed not to help out the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in all her diſcourſe, which left ſo deep an impreſſion in the heart of the King, that it may truly be ſaid, That the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound was given that very day to the favour of the Duke. To diſpatch him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40725:25"/>
the ſooner, it was repreſented to the King what little reſpect the <hi>Grandees</hi> bare now to his Majeſty, not waiting upon him as they were wont, but all retiring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The King asked the Marqueſs of <hi>Carpio</hi> what was the reaſon hereof? Who replied, That being little accounted of by the Duke, they judged it more meet to forbear the ſervices they owed to his Majeſty, then to lie under the ſuſpition of the Duke, and to give him occaſion by their reſidence at Court, to make them feel the effects of his jealouſie. To help forward, there happened a memorable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in <hi>Segovia,</hi> where ſix men masked entring by force into the Governors houſe, who imagining them to be Robbers, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them money, and all that he had, ſo they would not defile his wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floure his daughters: One of them anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That they were not come to rob him, but to ſerve the King, and delivering a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into his hands, told him, that if he would ſave his life, t he ſhould go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to <hi>Madrid</hi> and preſent this Writing, not to the Duke, but to the King
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40725:26"/>
himſelf, that it contained affairs very ſecret, and of great importance to the State, and to the ſervice of his Majeſty; and would not depart till they ſaw him upon his way to <hi>Madrid,</hi> threatning to kill him if he performed not that whereto he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged as a ſubject, and as a Miniſter of the Kings. Being arrived, he had audience of the King, and ſo was ſent back to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It was judged by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that the contents of the Writing was very prejudiciall to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be added one thing more that might probably have a ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the ſpirit of the King for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of his Favourite. The Marqueſs of <hi>Grana,</hi> Ambaſſador in <hi>Madrid</hi> for the Emperour, bringing with him the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary valour of the Houſe of <hi>Caretti,</hi> the courage, prudence, and conduct of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs whereof he hath given ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies in the military imployments which he hath had many years in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> together with his great gift of five Languages, which he ſpeaks as if they were all naturall, hath
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40725:26"/>
gained him a great eſteem with all men. And the liberty which he uſed in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the affairs of the State (although it proceeded from the natural ingenuity and zeal towards the intereſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) rendring him odious to the Duke, whoſe ears had been accuſtomed to hear onely applauſes full of flattery, and not the plain ſincere truth, having now an opportunity to revenge himſelf with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, did it to the purpoſe: For having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from the Emperour to the King, that the affairs of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> grew worſe and worſe every day, ſo that if ſpeedy order were not taken, all would be ruined, that his Majeſty ought to conſider wel the quality of the perſon that had made him loſe <hi>Portugall, Catalonia,</hi> and ſo many other Dominions, &amp;c.

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:40725:27"/>The King having before been earneſt to have formed a Family and Officers for the Prince, the <hi>Conde Duke</hi> alwayes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſame; becauſe firſt, hee feared that the Prince, who was of a moſt lively ſpirit, would then finde out that abroad, whereof the King was kept ignorant at home. Secondly, to gain an opportunity by prolonging the time, for Don <hi>Henry</hi> his Baſtard to faſhion himſelf for the Court, and by his Match and Honours conferred upon him, be at length reputed fit to bee Governor to the Prince, and ſucceed in the grace and favour of the King. At length the King being earneſtly ſollicited by the Queen, formed a Liſt of the Servants that were to ſerve the Prince in his Court now to be erected, becauſe he was of the Age of Fourteen years; giving notice to the <hi>Duke</hi> that proviſion might be made of al things neceſſary for a Court: The <hi>Duke</hi> tooke the Liſt and changed a great number in the ſame, which diſpleaſed the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, having been before for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſufficiently moved; after the King ſpake of the Princes Lodgings, deſiring to

The Duke was with this ſtruck dumbe, perceiving well that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace drew neare: for certain it is, That his extreme inſolence haſtned as much as poſſible the Reſolution that the King had taken: For that very Evening his Majeſty wrote him a Billet with his own Hand, whereby hee forbad him to meddle any more in the Government; and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward hee ſhould retire to <hi>Loeches,</hi> not farre from <hi>Madrid,</hi> untill farther Order ſhould bee given.

                  <p>The Queen gave her a ſhort anſwer, <hi>Lo que han hecho Dios los vaſallos y los malos ſuceſſos no lo puede deſhazer el Rey in ye.</hi> What God, the people, and evill ſucceſſes have done, the King nor I can undoe. This buſineſſe was not known Friday and Saturday to any but <hi>Don Lewis de Haro,</hi> of whom the King made uſe to talk with the Duke about ſome ſecret affairs.

his Majeſty could permit. The King hereupon granted that the Duke ſhould continue three days in his Palace; that hee ſhould aſſiſt at the Councels and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and give Audience for his particular affairs: Alſo, it was permitted to the Duke, that in preſence of the chief Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and of Secretary <hi>Carnero,</hi> hee ſhould review all his Papers, and burn what hee pleaſed; which he did: Though the King were thought too indulgent therein.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, as ſome came to have Audience of the Duke, he bad let them know, That he was a little indiſpoſed, and ſuffred none to enter.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40725:31"/>
himſelfe between two Ieſuits, as if he had been going to execution, he took his way by the ſtreet of <hi>Atocha,</hi> at the ſame time that his Family in his velvet Coaches paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ordinary way, where they were met with a company of Boyes, that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duke was there, diſcharged a ſhowre of ſtones at the Coaches; but being ſhewn that the Duke was not there, they ceaſed; ſo that the Duke by this ſubtilty arrived ſafe at <hi>Loeches,</hi> a place whereof he had the Royalty.</p>

                  <p>Now the conſequences of this diſgrace of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> are many, and thoſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.

Whereto the Cardinall <hi>Borgia,</hi> as head of that Councell, anſwered, That they would
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40725:32"/>
give obedience to theſe his Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as to Laws Divine.</p>
                  <p>Next day his Majeſty having called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all his Gentlemen of his Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whereof moſt are <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> he demanded the aſſiſtance of their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Friends and Kindred, for the ſpeedy ſettlement of the kingdom: Which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other teſtimonies of prudence and care that his Majeſty manifeſted, made all men ſay, It was now the time that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the fourth deſerved the ſurname of <hi>Grand,</hi> which had been given him by the flattery of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> at that time when he cauſed his Majeſty to loſe his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Reputation.</p>
                  <p>Next day the King cauſed all his plate to be coined into money, by whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo the Nobility and Commons ſent theirs to the Mint, and all contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſerved in earthen ware.</p>
                  <p>The next conſequence of <hi>Olivarez</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace was the advancements of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Noblemen to their dignities, and the pulling down of the Favorites of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40725:33"/>The third effect, and perhaps that which <hi>Olivarez</hi> reſented moſt of all, is the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition of his Baſtard ſon, a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſtrange and extraordinary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that it is worthy a large Treatiſe, but was briefly thus: The <hi>Conde</hi> Duke being at <hi>Madrid</hi> twelve years before he was in favour at Court, fell in love with <hi>Donna Marguerita Spinola,</hi> whoſe Father was a <hi>Genoway,</hi> and mother a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> This Lady, though noble and rich, yet was not free from temptations, amongſt which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and honour are the moſt efficacious. Don <hi>Franciſco de Valeaſar, Alcalde</hi> of the Court and Palace, one of the higheſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judicature in <hi>Spain,</hi> although he had a wife, one <hi>Donna Marguerita</hi> to his luſt, maintained her and her family at his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and with profuſe preſents and Iewels, kept her wholly to himſelf. At length <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> with much difficulty, got a ſhare in her alſo; and ſhe ſoon after had a ſon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Julian,</hi> which none then made doubt to be the ſon of the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe underſtanding that others had had a finger in the pye as well as himſelf, took no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40725:33"/>
affection to, nor care of the child; ſo he was brought up idly by the mother untill the age of 18 years; at which time his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying, and he finding himſelf without father or mother, went boldly to the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde,</hi> and beſought him to declare him his ſon, that ſo he might not be expoſed to the world without Father and without Name; proteſting that he would never lay claim to any thing, but onely under the name of <hi>Valeaſar</hi> he would get his living with his Sword. The <hi>Alcalde</hi> wholly uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he was his child, would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to declare thus till upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and then rather out of charity then belief that he was his ſon. So then by the name of <hi>Julian Valeaſar</hi> he went firſt into the Indies, where for ſome Roguery he was condemned to be hanged; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Vice-king there was a great friend to the <hi>Alcalde,</hi> he gave him his pardon. Thence he went into <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where he ſerved as a common Souldier, but was very deboſht and of rude behaviour. In the mean time <hi>Olivarez</hi> having no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope of children, ſent to ſearch out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40725:34"/>
this vagabond <hi>Valeaſar,</hi> who he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred was born at the time that he had to do with his mother; but before <hi>Valeaſar</hi> could be found, he had married <hi>D. Iſabella de Azueta,</hi> a common Strumpet; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>November</hi> 1641. to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men, <hi>Olivarez</hi> owned him for his ſon, and declared him ſo by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick act by the good will and pleaſure of his Majeſty, wherein he names him, Don <hi>Henry Philipe de Guzman,</hi> heir apparent of the Count <hi>de Olivarez,</hi> and of the Dutchy of St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty in acknowledgement of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to make him a Grandee of <hi>Spain;</hi> becauſe the Title of <hi>Duke</hi> in <hi>Caſtile</hi> is not given but to thoſe that may ſtand covered in the Kings preſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Olivarez</hi> advertized all Ambaſſadors and Grandees hereof, to the great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all his Family and Kindred; then reſolves to marry him with one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Ladies of <hi>Spain:</hi> To which end he caſt his eye upon the firſt: Lady of the Court, <hi>Donna Juana de Velaſco,</hi> daughter to the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40725:34"/>
of blood is not to be equalled by any the Subjects of that Kingdome. For he ſhews in the Arms of his Predeceſſors, five Royall Quarrers. To accompliſh this match, it was neceſſary to annull the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer marriage by an order from <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope deputes the Biſhop of <hi>Avila</hi> with full power, who notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts of the woman, gave ſentence againſt her, becauſe ſhe was not married by her own Parſon, although ſome more conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Divines gave their opinions in favour of the woman, and that the marriage was good and valuable; but the authority of the Favourite prevailed over theſe reaſons, and the marriage was ſolemnly broken. In purſuance whereof <hi>Olivarez</hi> treated for a match with the ſaid Lady, and in ſpite of her Father and Kindred, obtained her for his Baſtard. And here one might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the baſe ſpirits of Flatterers, for all the Grandees, all the Nobility of the Court, all Officers of State, went to give Don <hi>Henry el para bien,</hi> or joy of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, treating him by the Title of <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,</hi> and giving him reſpect fitter for a

In the mean time he became ſo rediculous a perſonage in his carriag, that not being accuſtomed to ſuch ceremonies he often fell into great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which made ſome <hi>Italians</hi> ſay, <hi>Don Harrigo era un Facchino veſtito da ReSpag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuolo.</hi> That Don <hi>Henry</hi> was a plowman dreſſed like a King.</p>

                  <p>Next, it was alledged againſt the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> that preſcription of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 years (whereas Lawyers allow 100 years a ſufficient Title for any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) lay moſt evidently againſt her.</p>

                  <p>But the main Argument whereby King <hi>Philip</hi> confuted theſe and all other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, was his ſword, wherewith like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Alexander,</hi> he cut that <hi>Gordian</hi> knot; wherefore not to loſe time nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, whilſt the Univerſity invented

the moſt powerful Arguments, he made all preparations poſſible for a powerful Army to be ready, in the mean time wrought ſo effectually with Father <hi>Leon Henriques,</hi> a Jeſuit, and Confeſſor to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and Frier <hi>Ferdinando Caſtillo</hi> a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican, that all intentions prejudicial to King <hi>Philips</hi> deſignes were craftily diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as from declaring the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza</hi> next heir, whereunto King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was moſt inclinable; alſo from marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hopes of iſſue, whereto he was once ſo farre perſwaded, as to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a diſpenſation from <hi>Rome;</hi> but his hopes and intentions were ſoon after cut off by death: the newes whereof arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to King <hi>Philip,</hi> he marched away immediatly with an Army of above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand old Souldiers towards <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> where he found no other reſiſtance but <hi>Don Antonio,</hi> one of the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pretenders in the head of a popular tumult, rather then a regular Army, which being ſoon diſcomfited, and the ſuburbs of <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſacked, to gratifie the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he eaſily made himſelf Maſter of the

by the return of D. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> whom they would not yet believe to be dead; others believing that he was indeed killed in the battell of <hi>Africa,</hi> yet that he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored miraculouſly. Some gave great credit to old Propheſies, eſpecially to that of an Hermit to King <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the firſt, that he ſhould overcome the <hi>Moors</hi> with their five Kings, and that in the ſixteenth Generation his line ſhould fail for a time, but that then God ſhould have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them. And to a letter of St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> wrot to the ſame King <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> the originall whereof was by the laſt King of <hi>France</hi> given to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugall,</hi> 1641. the tenor of it was, that he rendred thanks for the lands beſtowed upon him to build a Monaſtery, that in recompence thereof God bad him declare unto him, that there ſhould not fail a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Portugal</hi> to ſit upon that Throne, unleſſe for the greatneſs of their ſins God would chaſtiſe them for a time: but that this time of chaſtiſement ſhould not laſt 60 years.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40725:58"/>
penſions out of the Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical promotions, were alſo given to ſtrangers; the governments of Caſtles and Towns were put into the hands of <hi>Caſtilians:</hi> new Impoſitions were laid upon the people, the Revenues of the kingdome were imployed for the uſe of the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And that this deſign of <hi>Olivarez</hi> might be no way hindred, the Nobility, and ableſt men of the Kingdome were drawn forth ſome to Court, ſome to employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Warre, and ſome to priſons, where they were deſtined to ſlaughter, as appeared by a Letter written from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> to <hi>Vaſconzellos</hi> his Agent at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>por los cuernos de los Fidal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos que ya ſtan aqui, bien puede</hi> V.

forth of the kingdome, and the calling for more gave the firſt occaſion to ſome of the Noblemen to aſſemble together where they reſolve <hi>Not only to ſtay at home, but to have a King at home;</hi> whereupon the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> Grandchild of the fore-mentioned <hi>Katherine,</hi> by the name of Don <hi>John</hi> the Fourth now raigning, was advanced to the Crown, as is at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the life of <hi>Olivarez,</hi> and therefore needs not here to be repeated: Only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhall be annexed the moſt memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages that have happened ſince hee came to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> having been poſſeſſed by three Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſucceſſively from the yeare 1580. untill the year 1640. not full ſixty years, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prophecy of St <hi>Bernard;</hi> for before <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond was received and ſworn their King, it was <hi>April,</hi> 1581. whereas the preſent king of <hi>Portugall,</hi> Don <hi>John</hi> the fourth was proclaimed on the firſt of <hi>December,</hi> 1640. being then at <hi>Villavicioſa</hi> his Country-houſe; upon the fifth of the ſame Month, without any

pomp or guard, he entred into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> yet with ſo great ſecurity, as if he had been guarded with a moſt invincible Army; whereupon he ſaid, <hi>That to be King and Soveraign of the Portugall Nation, there was no neeed off any other Guard or Armes then the hearts of the people.</hi> So ſoon as it was known in <hi>Lisbon</hi> that the King was arrived, the concourſe of People was ſo great before the Palace, and the joy ſo extreme, that for a time they ſeemed to be tranſported out of themſelves, ſome leaping, others dancing, ſome kiſſing the Kings hand, others throwing themſelves down at his Foot; all ſhouting and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Viva viva el Rey Dom Joam el quarto noſſo Senhor;</hi> God ſave the king D. <hi>John</hi> the fourth, our Soveraigne Lord. That Evening all the Cannons were diſcharged, and ſo many Fireworks and Lights, that the Night was turned into Day, whereat a Spaniſh Gentleman ſaid, <hi>Es poſsible que ſe quita un Reyno a el Rey</hi> D Felipe <hi>con ſolas Luminarias y vivas ſin mas exercito in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

king <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be deprived of a whole kingdome with only Lights and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works without a powerfull Army. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is an evident token of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties power.</p>
                  <p>Upon the fifteenth following was the King ſolemnly crowned, in the great place before his Palace, upon a Theater, wheron was raiſed a great Scaffold, and upon that a leſſer, whereon was placed three ſteps higher a Chaire of State under a Canopy all covered over with cloth of Gold; about Midday came forth his Majeſty in a Suit of Cheſnut-coloured Velvet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Gold and Buttons of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; about his Neck a Collar of great value, whereunto hung the habit of the chief order of Knighthood, called, <hi>El Orden de Chriſto;</hi> He was girded with a gilt Sword; his Robe was cloth of Gold lined with White, wrought with Gold flowers; his Train was born up by the Lord Chamberlain D. <hi>John Roderiguez;</hi> before his Majeſty was the Sword borne by D. <hi>Francis de Mello</hi> Marquis of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reira</hi> high Conſtable of the kingdome;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40725:60"/>
and before him the kings Banner diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Fernando Telles de Meneſes</hi> as knight Marſhall, and before him the Marquis of <hi>Govea</hi> D. <hi>Manrique de Sylva</hi> Steward of the kings Houſe, with all the Grandees, Nobility and Gentry; before all went <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> king at Arms, with the Heralds, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevants, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>His Majeſty being ſate in his Chaire with a Cryſtall Scepter in his right Hand, whereon ſtood the high Conſtable, and behind the Chair the Lord Chamberlain: There was placed before him a Table co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with cloth of Gold, with a Cuſhion thereon, and upon the cuſhion a Croſs of Gold with a Miſſall; then the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Lisbon</hi> and <hi>Braga,</hi> with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor-Generall, kneeling down upon a Cuſhion, made his Oath to the kingdome as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WE ſwear and promiſe by the grace of God, to Rule and Govern you well and juſtly, and to adminiſter unto you Juſtice as far</hi>

                     <hi>as Humane frailty will permit; to maintain unto you your Cuſtomes, Priviledges, and Liberties granted unto you by the Kings our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi> So God help Us, and this his holy Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>After this taken by the King, the three Eſtates, Clergy, Nobility and Commons ſwore Allegiance to his Majeſty in theſe words; One for every Eſtate ſaid:</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Swear by this holy Goſpell of God toucht corporally with my Hand, that I receive for our King and lawfull Soveraign, the High and Mighty King Don</hi> John <hi>the Fourth our Soveraigne, and doe Homage unto him according to the uſe and cuſtome of his Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Ceremony being paſt, <hi>Francis de</hi>

                     <hi>Lucena,</hi> Secretary of State, ſtanding in the middle of the Scaffold, with a lowd voyce declared, That his Majeſty accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Oath and Homage which they had made. Then the King at Arms ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cried <hi>O yez</hi> thrice, <hi>Ferdinando Telles de Meneſes,</hi> knight Marſhal, with a lowd voyce ſaid, <hi>Royal, Royal, Royal, for the high and mighty Lord King John the fourth our Soveraigne;</hi> and the Heralds with all the people ecchoed, <hi>Royal, Royal, Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:</hi> Then all the Drummes, Trumpets and Fifes ſounding, his Majeſty came off the Theater, and mounting on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, rode under a moſt rich Cloth of State towards the great Church, with all his Grandees and Nobles before him bare headed on foot. By the way in a great open place were preſented unto the King, together with an eloquent Harangue, the keyes of the Citie; which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, his Majeſty rode forward with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible acclamations and applauſe, the Ladies out of the Windowes throwing down Flowers and ſweet Waters upon their heads with a thouſand benedictions,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40725:61"/>
&amp;c. In this pomp his Majeſty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Cathedral Church by the Archbiſhop in his <hi>Pontificalibus;</hi> whence (his devotions being ended) he returned to his Palace with the like ſolemn magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>
                  <p>The kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> being thus eſtabliſhed, care was taken to give timely notice hereof to all places under their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in all parts of the world, ſo that not long after the King was with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible joy proclaimed in the Iſland <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera,</hi> in <hi>Porto Santo,</hi> in <hi>Mazagan</hi> and <hi>Aer</hi> upon the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> in the Iſland of St <hi>Michael,</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Angola,</hi> in the <hi>Tercera</hi> Iſlands, (although the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor there made ſome reſiſtance at firſt) in <hi>Braſile,</hi> in all the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> and as far as <hi>China.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 8 of <hi>January</hi> following, with the like pompous ſolemnity the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates took an oath to the Prince in theſe words: <hi>We acknowledge and receive for our true and Naturall Prince, the high and excellent Prince D.</hi> Theodoſio, <hi>Son, Heir, and ſucceſſor of our ſoveraign Lord the</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40725:62"/>
                     <hi>King, and as his true and naturall ſubjects and vaſſals, we doe him homage in the hands of the King; and after the death of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord the King, we will acknowledge and receive him for our true and naturall King and Soveraign of thoſe kingdomes of</hi> Portugal <hi>and</hi> Algarbe, <hi>and beyond ſea in</hi> Africa, <hi>Lord of</hi> Guine, <hi>of the Conqueſts, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations, and Commerce in</hi> Ethiopia, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Perſia, India, &amp;c. <hi>we will obey his Commands and Decrees in all and through all both high and low, we will make war and maintain peace with all thoſe that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhal command us. And all this we ſwear to God upon the holy Croſſe, and the holy Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next day the King being placed on his Royal Throne, there was an Aſſembly of the three eſtates in their rich Robes, where D. <hi>Emanuel de Acugna,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elvas,</hi> made a moſt eloquent ſpeech, the ſubſtance whereof was, That one of the firſt Laws of Nature was, the uniting of men together, from whence Cities and kingdomes had their original, and by which they after defended themſelves in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40725:62"/>
warres, and maintained themſelves in peace; that for this cauſe his Majeſty had called this Aſſembly to conſult for the better ſervice of God, defence in warre, and government in peace, that there could be no ſervice of God without union in Religion, no defence without union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, no Regular government without union of Councels: That his Majeſty did expect to be informed by his loyal ſubjects, what was for the good of the State; That they were to render thankes to the Almighty, who had given them a King that would govern by the known Laws: That his Majeſty did not eſteem thoſe Tributes lawful that were paid with tears, and therefore did from this preſent take off from his ſubjects all tribute that ever have been impoſed by the kings of <hi>Caſtile;</hi> becauſe his Majeſty will not reign over our goods, nor over our heads, nor over our priviledges, but over our hearts, hoping that you will find out a more ſweet expedient to defend your Countrey againſt your potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who threatneth to make us all ſlaves,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40725:63"/>
and to deſtroy and annihilate our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let us therefore conſidering his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties goodneſſe, and our own honour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt at once unto the whole world, that <hi>as never ſubjects had ſuch a gracious king, ſo never king had ſuch loyal ſubjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſtanding up the moſt ancient officer of the Chamber of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the name of the three Eſtates (who all ſtood up likewiſe) returned humble thanks to his Majeſty for his gracious bounty, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing withall, that they did not onely offer up their goods, but conſecrate their lives to his Majeſties ſervice, that his Majeſty might freely diſpoſe of the one and the other to his ſervice, according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance whereof they voted, that two millions ſhould be preſently levyed by the kingdome; but his Majeſty not being willing that any money ſhould be impoſed upon the ſubject as a tax, all men ſtrove who ſhould advance moſt freely, ſo that in few dayes, there were brought in 4 millions of gold, not to pay ſouldiers (for all offered their ſervice to purſue the war
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40725:63"/>
gratis at their own charges) but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſplendor of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>The next reſolution of this Aſſembly was to diſpatch Ambaſſadors to all States of Chriſtendom to enter into confederations for the better eſtabliſhment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and reputation of the King.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place his Majeſty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how much it did import to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with <hi>Catalonia,</hi> that ſo they might joyntly not only defend themſelves, but alſo moleſt <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which being as it were between the two arms of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> muſt needs be eaſily incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by them both at Sea and Land; thither was ſent Ambaſſador Father <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Maſcarenas</hi> a Jeſuit, with another Father of the ſame Order, to offer them all aſſiſtance and ſupplies for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and defence againſt the Catholick King, which Ambaſſy did ſo incredibly rejoyce and encourage the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> that the very next day they obtained a moſt ſignal victory by couragiouſly defending themſelves againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:40725:64"/>
Army of 25000. men under the conduct of the Marquiſs <hi>de los Veles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next was a moſt ſolemn Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. for which high employment were choſen two perſonages of great worth, D. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco de Mello</hi> and D. <hi>Antonio Coello de Caravallio,</hi> the one for his exquiſite judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and experience in State affairs, and the other for his noble ſpirit and eminent knowledg in the Civil Law, moſt fit to undertake ſo important a charge. Theſe two perſonages attended with a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent train landed at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and upon the 15 of <hi>March</hi> made a moſt ſolemn entrance into <hi>Paris,</hi> being met and conducted by 134. Coaches, beſides much Nobility on Horſeback unto the Palace appointed for Extraordinary Ambaſſadors, where they were entertained in a ſumptuous manner at the Kings charges, from thence were they carried by the Duke of <hi>Cheureuſe</hi> and the Count of <hi>Brulon</hi> in the Kings Coaches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſty then at St <hi>Germains</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their firſt Audience, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with extraordinary reſpect, for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40725:64"/>
upon the Ambaſſadors entrance into the preſence chamber his Majeſty roſe out of his Chair and came forward three ſteps to receive them, nor would the King ſuffer them to deliver their Ambaſſy vncovered, or to kiſs his hand at their departure, but inſteed thereof embraced them in his arms with a chearfull countenance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing them all the aſſiſtance that lay in his power: From the Kings preſence they were conducted to a Dinner provided for them, and after that to the Lodgings of the Queen, who ſitting in a chair without armes roſe up, and coming forward two or three ſteps received them moſt courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, not permitting them to ſpeak untill they were covered: Amongſt other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, D. <hi>Franciſco de Mello</hi> told her Majeſty, that he feared his Embaſſy would not be acceptable, for that his Maſter had deprived her brother of one of his Kingdoms, whereto her Majeſty replyd, that <hi>although ſhe was ſiſter to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>yet ſhe was wife to the King of</hi> France, and thereupon began to ſpeak Spaniſh, which the Ambaſſador obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40725:65"/>
demanded wherefore her Majeſty had not vouchſafed them that favour ſooner, it being a language better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them? the Queen anſwered, for fear they ſhould be daunted to hear her ſpeak Spaniſh; the Ambaſſador to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the jeſt replyd, <hi>Como a tam grande Senora, ſi, pero como a Caſtillana, no. It was true conſidering her greatneſs, but not her Countrey,</hi> whereat her Majeſty ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling went on promiſing them all favour, and wiſhing many happy dayes to King <hi>John</hi> and the Prince his ſon: thus having delivered to her Majeſty a Letter from the Queen of <hi>Portugal,</hi> they took leave to go viſit the moſt Eminent Cardinal <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu,</hi> who being advertiſed of their coming, came forward to the third cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to meet them, and there received them with expreſſions of great affection, after which he conducted them into his own Chamber, where all three being ſate his Eminence (a perſonage for his moſt admirable abilities worthy to live many ages) diſcovered divers affairs of impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance to the Ambaſſadors, and they o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:40725:65"/>
the other ſide made his Eminence underſtand how highly it imported that the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould be united by an indiſſoluble league and amity, conſidering that the primary and principal aim of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (whoſe branches were ſpread over <hi>Europe</hi>) was not only to be the greateſt, but the only Monarch of Chriſtendom, for which end it never made ſcruple to uſurp Kingdoms and States upon the weakeſt pretences imaginable, as have appeared in the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other States more lately in <hi>Germany,</hi> the ſeizing upon the <hi>Valtelline,</hi> that ſo (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſter of that paſſage) he may upon any opportunity lead an Army of high <hi>Germans</hi> into <hi>Italy:</hi> Moreover conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vaſt power and intereſt this Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath, not only in all the other States of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but alſo in almoſt all <hi>America;</hi> it muſt be confeſſed that they have a large foundation of their imaginary univerſal Monarchy, yet no one thing gave them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40725:66"/>
ſo great hopes as the poſſeſſion of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal:</hi> Firſt becauſe by the addition of that Kingdom, they became abſolute Maſters not only of all <hi>Spain,</hi> but of all the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> of all the Eaſtern Trade, of <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia, Perſia, Arabia, China, Iapan,</hi> and all that incredible wealth that was raiſed out of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Traffique, whereby the Auſtrian greatneſs (if not their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy) was principally ſuſtained, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it much concerned all States to endeavour not only to put a ſtop to the growth of that monſtrous tree, but to cut off ſome arms thereof that it may the leſs damnify and annoy the leſſer trees that grow by it: that to do this none was more concerned or more able then the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> united with the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which having bin reputed the right arm (as <hi>Catalonia</hi> was the left) of that huge <hi>Auſtrian Coloſſus</hi> and now ſeparated from it and joyned with <hi>France,</hi> will be able to do as great ſervice againſt it, as ever it hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do for it, not only by aſſaulting the <hi>Spaniard</hi> at home in his own houſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40725:66"/>
but by intercepting the Plate-Fleet which coming from the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily paſs by the gates of their Enemies (the <hi>Tereera</hi> Iſlands) and ſo run a hazard to be loſt, or elſe be at the charges of an extraordinary Convoy. Having thus diſcourſed with his Eminence of thoſe and other weighty affairs, he was pleaſed to offer not only all the aſſiſtance of the moſt Chriſtian King, but that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe of his own for the Service of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> that he would preſently ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Fleet of twenty Sail with his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews Admiral and Ambaſſador extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: whereupon the Ambaſſadors taking leave, they were accompanied by his Eminence as far as the ſtairs, which the Ambaſſadors endeavouring to hinder, the Cardinal told them that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>Portugal</hi> were to be treated with no leſs reſpect then thoſe of the Emperor or Pope. Some few days after in the houſe of the Grand Chancellour, there was appointed a Junta of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors with his Majeſties Commiſſioners, together with the Secretary <hi>Chavigny,</hi>

                  <p>It very much concerned the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> to maintain amity and peace with the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> not only for the Navigation and Commerce of both States, but alſo for other particular ends in the preſent conjuncture of affairs, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to break the good correſpondency that was at preſent maintained between the Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> For this purpoſe in <hi>March</hi> 1641. were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht for <hi>England Don Antonio de Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <hi>King</hi> Henry <hi>was Uncle, equally neer to both, but with this difference,</hi> Catherine <hi>was the daughter of a ſon named</hi> Edward, <hi>and</hi> Philip <hi>was ſonne of a daughter named</hi> Iſabella, <hi>brother and ſiſter to King</hi> Henry.</p>

                  <p>The Commerce and correſpondence that have always been between the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> induced King <hi>John</hi> to ſend Ambaſſadors thither; but the greater correſpondence with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and ſome dependence upon the Emperour, hindred the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Ambaſſage,; yet the King, and all the principal of the kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring not to break with Portugal, gave all other ſatisfaction poſſible by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courteſies and reſpect to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who from thence went into <hi>Swethland,</hi> where they were received with much ſolemnity and rejoycing by the whole kingdome.

Gold, and her Majeſties portrait in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Gold. With the like readineſs did the States of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> receive the Ambaſſage brought thither by that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſonage, <hi>Triſtano de Mendoza Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tada,</hi> and a Truce of ten years made with Portugal; not a peace becauſe the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> having conquered many places in <hi>Braſil, Angola,</hi> &amp;c. whilſt thoſe countries were under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that neither ſide might be prejudiced, the King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> would not approve of the conqueſts, becauſe they were places depending on the Crown of <hi>Portugal;</hi> nor could the States promiſe reſtitution, becauſe they now belonged to their <hi>Weſt Indy</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who ſince have often violated the Articles of this Truce, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of the States, to whom (ſo long as they neglect to puniſh the tranſgreſſors of their own Capitulations) no State will treat or truſt for the future, ſeeing them ſo ſhamefully break their word without the leaſt occaſion given</p>
                  <p>It was long debated in the Court of <hi>Portugal,</hi> whether an Ambaſſage ſhould
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40725:70"/>
be ſent to his Holineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe a more opportune conjuncture of time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Some were of opinion that an Ambaſſage was to be ſent thither without further delay, becauſe thereby they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifying their duty and reſpect to his Holineſs, as he was Head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould gain his good favour, and an acknowledgement that his Majeſty <hi>Don John</hi> was rightfull King of Portugall, which would be of very much importance to the affairs of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But theſe conſiderations ſeemed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers rather things deſirable then feaſable. Firſt, becauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was at preſent powerful at <hi>Rome</hi> to oppoſe the reception of their Ambaſſador. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Pope, although he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in heart a Spaniard, yet he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeeld to ſhew himſelfe an enemy to the Catholick King. Moreover, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard cunningly fomenting the opinion which all the world had entertained, That his Holineſs did in all things incline to the French intereſt, would from ſuch a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40725:71"/>
draw as much as they could ever ask or deſire; for this cauſe the Pope (that he might not ſeem their enemy) alwayes granted them what ever they demanded: Therefore it was alledged, That it would be better firſt to ſound the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of his Holineſs, then to run the hazard of ſome diſgrace and afront to his Majeſty and the whole Nation. And in caſe the Pope ſhould reſolve not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Ambaſſage, to whom could they appeal for the injury done to the Crown? We ſee many Popes ſo bewitched with the intereſt of their own families, as to give occaſion to the world to believe, that their aim is not what is abſolutly the beſt, but what is beſt for themſelves. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof we have in Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, ſo affectionate to the kingdom of Portugal at firſt, that he imployed the utmoſt of his power to hinder King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the ſecond from uſurping it; yet ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, for the intereſt of his own fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, approved all that was done by the ſame King. Who hath more to give, or at leaſt to promiſe, then the Catholick King?
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40725:71"/>
Therefore in any buſineſs of competition, he muſt neceſſarily have the advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all others.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>French</hi> promiſing their aſſiſtance at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their interceſſion with his holineſs, it was at length reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the major part, that an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſhould be ſpeedily ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty hereupon made choyce of <hi>D.

that the reception of theſe Ambaſſadors would be very much prejudiciall to the Catholick King, by giving encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to others to attempt the like Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The Emperor having heard this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Mello,</hi> was at firſt ſo farr from being perſwaded, that he anſwered him, he abhorred the breach of publick Faith, and the violation of Hoſpitality, that this would be againſt the Liberties of the

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40725:76"/>
Imperial Majeſty at firſt very unſatisfied in the buſineſs, was reſolved not to do it, but by the importunity of <hi>Mello</hi> and the ghoſtly perſwaſions of <hi>Quiroga,</hi> he was at length induced to alter his reſolution, and to give order to D. <hi>Lewes Gonzaga</hi> that he ſhould go to <hi>Leipen</hi> the Princes quarters, and to ſummon him to <hi>Ratisbon:</hi> in the mean time to prevent the ill impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that this would cauſe in the minds of all men of honor and honeſty; it was reported abroad that D. <hi>Duarte</hi> was fled for ſome miſdemeanor, and thereupon propoſal was made of ſixteen thouſand crowns to any man that could bring him alive or dead; of which the Prince being ignorant eſcaped very narrowly the hands of ſome of thoſe people that went ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him in hopes of the propoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; when he was com to <hi>Ratisbon</hi> he was caſt into a vile priſon appointed only for perſons of mean quality, and all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants impriſoned, D. <hi>de Franciſco de Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> not content herewith, now ſollicites the Emperor afreſh that he may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the Spaniards hands, and ſent

But his ill uſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, D. <hi>Duarte</hi> made all the means poſſible to get audience of the Emperor, which would never be granted, nor was it any wonder, for <hi>there is no face mere ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or more terrible to the offender tehn the face offended;</hi> hereupon the Infante made his proteſtation, calling God and man to witneſs the wrong and injurie done unto him by the Emperor, to whom he was neither ſubject by any obligation or birth, that when his brother was made King of <hi>Portugal</hi> he was in the Emperors ſervice, wholly ignorant of any deſigne of his brothers, that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was offended, he might revenge himſelf upon the perſon offending that that buſineſs no way concerned the Emperor: All which particulars were acknowledged by his Imperial Majeſty, by a meſſenger ſent to <hi>Don Duarte</hi> in priſon, aſſuring him again
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40725:77"/>
that he ſhould not be delivered into the hands of his enemies, yet that his liberty could not be granted for ſome reaſons of State, whereupon D. <hi>Franciſco de Soſa Coutigno</hi> Ambaſſador extraordinary from <hi>Portugal</hi> to <hi>Swethland</hi> in the name of the King his Maſter, repreſented at large to the Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> the whole procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, requiring juſtice and libirty for the Infante; But <hi>nothing can prevail againſt Intereſt,</hi> the effects of all Manifeſto's, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and Interceſſions were that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fante was removed from place to place, and ſent farther off where he had ſtill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der uſage, only the Emperor ſeemed yet immutable in his reſolution not to deliver him into the hands of the Spaniard untill the moſt powerfull means in this world to conquer all difficulties was uſed, which is money; for upon promiſe of forty thouſand crowns the Emperor (contrary to the immunities of the Empire, to the rules of hoſpitality, to the priviledge of free Princes, to the Law of Nations, and contrary to his word and promiſe ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reiterated) yeilded that the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

Prince ſhould be ſent whether the Catholick King ſhould think meet: ſo he was hurried away towards the State of <hi>Milain</hi> to remain priſoner in that Caſtle; by the way as he entred into the Spaniſh Territories he was received by the Count <hi>de Siruela</hi> the Governor of that ſtate, wherethe Commiſſary of the Emperor took his leav to return, to whom <hi>D. Duarte</hi> ſaid openly, <hi>Tell thy Maſter that I am more ſorry that I have ſerved ſo unworthy a Prince, then to ſee my ſelf a priſoner ſold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of my enemies, but that the juſt Judg of the World will one day ſuffer the like dealing towards his children, who are no more privildged for being of the houſe of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>then my ſelf that am of the blood royal of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and that poſterity will judg of him and of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor in his inſtructions to thoſe that convoyed the Infante, gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order that in caſe their priſoner made any attempt to eſcape, they ſhould kill him upon the place.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40725:78"/>
to be kept, with a guard in the ſame cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo rude that he could hardly take any ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Any man of honor would have been pierced to the very ſoul with this harſh treaty, how much more a Prince of ſo high blood, who knew himſelf deſcended from ſo many glorious Kings, and allyed to the greateſt Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> for which cauſe the Kings ever treated the houſe of <hi>Braganza</hi> much different from the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> giving them the reſpect due to ſoveraign Princes, in ſo much that <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond who deſired to a baſe that Family, always received the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> under the ſame cloth of State within the Royal Curtain in all publick Aſſemblies, allowing him always a chair with a cuſhion, and as oft as he went to viſit his Majeſty, he would go to receive the Duke as farr as the middle of the chamber: Beſides, the Princes of this Family had always a guard of their own to wait upon them even in the Kings Court.</p>
                  <p>This then was the reward of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40725:78"/>
prince, for having left his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, Kindred, Friends, Intereſt, fot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſerved the Emperour eight yeares at his own proper charges, for having ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his life upon all occaſions with the formoſt, expecting no other pay then thanks, and no other recompence then honor.</p>
                  <p>Yet there wanted not ſome to defend the Emperour in this action, alledging that it was no new thing, for that <hi>Charls</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner delivered up the Count <hi>de St. Paul</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who put him to death; whereunto it was anſwered, That all the misfortune of that Prince is by <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> and others, attributed to that foul fact, <hi>Ex iſto tempore,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>nihil Carolo proſpere ſucceſsit, ſed calamitati ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsit calamitas, donec victus ab Helvetiis ad Nanecium miſerrime trucidatus eſt.</hi>

                  <p>When D. <hi>John</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> had been fully informed how his brother was treated, he was reſolved to revenge himſelfe by Arms; but the <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> beginning to make incurſions upon

all the borders of <hi>Porougal,</hi> diverting his thoughts, made him look neerer home to put the kingdome into a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to fortifie his chiefe Townes, and to train up all the people to the uſe of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Caſtilians</hi> in the inroads that they made into <hi>Portugal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> laid all waſte before them, ſpared neither ſex nor age upon the taking of any place, which ſo inraged the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that to revenge themſelves, they did the like in an incurſion into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During theſe extremities of Barbariſme upon the confines of the kingdome, there was wonderful tranquillity and unanimity at home; onely ſome few thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo farre obliged to the Catholick King, as to re-eſtabliſh him in his Throne, amongſt whom D. <hi>Sebaſtian de Matos</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> a creature of the <hi>Count de Olivarez</hi> was the principal, who at the beginning of the revolt oppoſed himſelf ſo much, that divers Gentlemen were once reſolved to ſend him after <hi>Vaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conzellos.</hi> This Prelat having imparted
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40725:79"/>
his deſigne to <hi>D. Lewis de Meneſes</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Villa Real,</hi> an ambitious man, and to his ſonne the Duke <hi>de Camigna,</hi> both diſcontented becauſ they thought themſelvs not preferred according to their merits, perſwaded them that it was a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing to ſuffer themſelves to be ſubject to a fellow-ſubject, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the obedience and loyalty of their ancient Soveraign, who is able to beſtow upon a deſerving man more in one day, then the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> in an hundred years, &amp;c. Inſomuch that they were ſoon gained. Next, the Archbiſhop draws in D. <hi>Auguſtine Manuele,</hi> a man of noble blood, excellent parts, neceſſitous, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet employed in any buſineſs; all notable motives to make a man embrace deſperate deſignes. After him was aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Pietro de Baeza,</hi> an upſtart Chriſtian (as they call thoſe Chriſtians whoſe ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were once Jewes:  this Gentleman famous for his vaſt riches and his great intimacy with that eminent Favourite, the Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> was wont to ſay, That <hi>Olivarez</hi> favour would one day advance
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40725:80"/>
him either to high honor or elſe to a high gallows; which proved preciſely true, as will appear anon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, with ſome few other Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, oft aſſembled themſelves privatly to conſider how their deſigns might be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily put in execution; for which purpoſe ſome were of opinion, that many more were to be drawn into the plot: But then it was feared on the one ſide, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the deſign might be diſcovered; on the other ſide that there was a neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for that without communicating to others, the buſineſs reſted onely in the <hi>Idaea.</hi> Others adviſed that the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was to be got in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but that then the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> would make as great preparations, and ſo render that way difficult; yet ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that thereby the Spaniard by way of intelligence might be the more eaſily let in, but that ſeemed as difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole <hi>Militia</hi> was in the hands of perſons moſt truſty to the King. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time they had thoughts of taking the King out of the way by ſome ſudden vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

death, which by ſome more moderate was oppoſed, and that rather ſome way was to be invented to cauſe his Majeſty to renounce his title to the Crown, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelf out of the danger repreſented unto him. In this wavering condition moſt of them inclined to a mediocrity, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſame in all eminent attempts is the very ſtepmother of good ſucceſs. Moderate reſolutions are the moſt of all pernitions where a deſigne is to begin with execution: Yet ſome more valorous and leſs wary then the reſt, were of opinion that they ſhould preſently ſet upon the the work, and leave the ſucceſſe to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Fortune, inſomuch that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Irons that were in the fire, none was yet hot.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the conſpirators, divers of them (notwithſtanding his Majeſties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs prohibition) kept ſecret correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> by the means of divers perſons much ſuſpected. The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> (who had alwayes an eye upon the Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Villa Real,</hi> knowing their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40725:81"/>
diſaffection from the beginning) at length intercepts ſome of their Letters, wherein was diſcovered the names of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the whole treaty; wherefore his Majeſty deſiring to ſecure all their perſons at once, without any noyſe, gave order that by ſound of Trumpet and Drum (as the cuſtome is) it ſhould be proclaimed, That his Majeſty intended to goe abroad forth of the Citie; whereupon all the Nobility (out of their great affection to his Majeſty) were ſoon aſſembled to wait upon him. When the King ſaw them all ready, he commanded firſt to call a Councell of State, where ſome of the conſpirators aſſiſted; being there ſate, he cauſed them all to be arreſted one by one without the leaſt diſturbance, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly could otherwiſe have been hardly prevented; for if the conſpiracy had been known before the perſons were in cuſtody, there would not have been ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their eſcape, as to have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly (without expecting the courſe of juſtice torn in pieces by the people. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the wiſdome of his Majeſty would,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40725:81"/>
that by the uſual forms of Juſtice their crime might be as manifeſt to the world as their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>So ſo on as theſe were ſafe in priſon, his Majeſty proclaimed a pardon to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of this conſpiracy that ſhould come in within four days and confeſs their fault, but the diligence of the King had been ſo exquiſite, that there was not one man left to take the benefit of that grace.</p>
                  <p>Not many days after, they were all ſolemnly arraigned, found guilty of high Treaſon, condemned and executed in manner following.</p>
                  <p>Upon the laſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1641. the Marquis <hi>de Villa real,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Camig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> his ſon, the Count <hi>de Armamac</hi> and <hi>D. Auguſtin Manuele</hi> were led along a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery made of purpoſe to the Scaffold, whereupon were built two ſtories one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, upon the uppermoſt there were placed two chairs, upon the ſecond ſtory one chair, and upon the Skaffold it ſelf another.</p>
                  <p>Firſt was led forth the Marquiſs in a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40725:82"/>
long black baies cloak, and his ſervants in mourning, who after he had prayed for a good ſpace upon his knees, roſe up, and having made a long ſpeech, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if there were no hopes of pardon; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all the people cryed out, <hi>let him die, let him die for a Traytor,</hi> then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner according to the manner, with a loud voice proclaimed, <hi>This is the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that the King our Soveraign Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be executed upon the perſon of</hi> Don Lewes de Meneſes <hi>ſometime Marquiſs of</hi> Villa Real, <hi>that his throat be cut as a Traytor to his Majeſty, Nobility, and people of this Kingdom, that for his crime his goods be confiſcated, and his memory baniſhed out of the world.</hi> Whereat all the people cryed <hi>Juſtice;</hi> which the Marquiſs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with much gravity demanded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all the ſpectators, deſiring them to aſſiſt him with their prayers to God for a pardon of this and all his other ſins, then turning to a father Jeſuit his Confeſſor, prayed him that in his behalf he would preſent himſelf at his Majeſties feet, and beſeech him out of his goodneſs that he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40725:82"/>
would vouchſafe to forgive him this hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence committed againſt him and the whole Kingdom: after which, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in the chair, his arms and legs were tied to the arms and legs of the chair, then leaning his head over the back of the chair, the Executioner with a knife cut his throat, after covering him with a black ſilk.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner upon the ſame Skaffold appeared his ſon the Duke of <hi>Camigna,</hi> attended with all his ſervants in mourning: paſſing by his fathers corps, he kneeled down and ſeveral times kiſſed his feet, begging of the people the ſuffrage of one Pater noſter for his fathers ſoul; then ſitting down in the other chair af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the proclamation of the Executioner, received the ſame puniſhment. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es would have had both their necks to be cut behind, but his Majeſty would not give way thereunto, being a puniſhment too ignominious in <hi>Portugal</hi> for perſons of their quality.</p>
                  <p>After theſe appeared the Count of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamac</hi> attended with one only ſervant,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40725:83"/>
who in the chair placed in the lower ſtory received the ſame puniſhment: as alſo <hi>D. Auguſtin Manuele</hi> upon the skaffold below.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day <hi>Pietro de Baeza,</hi> and one <hi>Melchior Correa de Franca</hi> being drawn at an horſe tail to the place of execution, were hanged upon a gallowes extraordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nary high.</p>
                  <p>Upon a lower gallowes in the ſame place were hanged <hi>Diego de Brito Nabo,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Valente:</hi> the quarters of theſe four laſt mentioned were hung up at the gates of the City, and their heads ſet up near the frontiers of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>September</hi> following, for the ſame crime, were likewiſe executed, <hi>Antonio Cogamigno,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Correa,</hi> the later of which, all the time of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was an example of penitence, feeding only upon bread and water, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himſelf every day, with continual prayers to God for pardon of that and his other ſins.</p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Martiria,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Malacca,</hi>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:40725:83"/>
and Fryer <hi>Emanuel de Macedo</hi> (although they were complices in the ſame conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, yet becauſe they were Eccleſiaſtical perſons) were not put to death as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but reſerved in priſon untill the Popes pleaſure were known concerning them.</p>
                  <p>The Archbiſhop during his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did oft acknowledg his offence by Letters to his Majeſty, deſiring that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might ſuffer, ſo that the others might be ſpared, in regard that what they had done was rather in obedience to him, then ill will to his Majeſty. Upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in priſon (which happened about three years after the fact committed) he gave order that ſo ſoon as he was dead, his laſt Will and Teſtament ſhould be carried to the King, wherein he beſought his Majeſty that he would vouchſafe of his goodneſs to pardon him the Treaſon committed by him againſt his Majeſty and his native Country, and that he would let his body be buried without the Church of any pariſh of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or tombe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtone, that ſo there
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40725:84"/>
might remain no memory of a man that had been a Traytor to his King and to his Country. A good example of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an humility, and of admonition to others not to meddle with the like affairs; for attempts of this nature are like hot irons, which inſteed of heating, ſcorch the hands of thoſe that handle them. This ſo exemplary puniſhment and rigorous juſtice inflicted upon the forenamed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, did not only eſtabliſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſecure the Family and Perſon of the King, but alſo ſtrook a terror into all the Kings Enemies (if there were any left) and excited the Kings friends to love him and watch over him the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</p>
                  <p>The mutual incurſions upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers between the <hi>Caſtillians</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> ſtill continued with great animoſity and violence.</p>
                  <p>About this time (although there was a truce concluded, between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> as afore expreſſed, and a great Navy ſent from <hi>Holland</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) yet there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>In the mean time the Catholick King was very ſollicitous for the recovery of <hi>Portugal;</hi> for the effecting whereof, he did not conſult only with his greateſt Statiſts at home, but alſo with thoſe abroad, from

The Grandees and Nobles at home, the people not at all cruſhed, and (which is more then all) the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the hands of natives, and all his Majeſties other Subjects excluded from all places of power, honor or profit. Sir, the holy Scripture which is the mirror and rule of our actions, teacheth that when</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manaſar <hi>conquered the Kingdon of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he did carry away not only the Royal Family,</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:40725:85"/>
                     <hi>but tranſported all the Nobility and People into divers Provinces of his own kingdoms, and into the new Conqueſts ſent new inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; yet the Iſraelites were never ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemies to the Aſſyrians, as the</hi> Portugals <hi>with Divelliſh madneſſe have ſhewed themſelves againſt the intereſt and conveniences of this Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, in the ſame Scripture it is read, That</hi> Nebuchadonoſor <hi>having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>tranſplanted all that he found in that kingdom, leaving onely a few miſerable inconſiderable people to remain there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So</hi> Athalia <hi>Queen of</hi> Judah, <hi>ſaw no other way to preſerve a kingdom newly conquered, but by extinguiſhing all the generation upon whom the Jews could caſt their eyes in hopes of revolt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Jehu <hi>King elected by God, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht all the family of</hi> Ahab, <hi>together with all his dependents, friends, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not ſparing ſo much as the Prieſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe, Sir, are the Rules that the holy Scripture teacheth to be practiſed upon the Families and People that abhor the dominion</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:40725:86"/>
                     <hi>of their own</hi> Soveraignes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was, Sir, very fatall to ſtand expecting and hoping for better times and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the ſecuring of</hi> Portugal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the year 1638. obſerving the ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Nation, my advice was, that without any delay that kingdome was to be ſecured by force of Armes: others were of the ſame judgements, but Fate would have it that (for fear of new troubles) by delayes way ſhould be made for a Rebellion, then which there could not have been a greater, although that form of Government which was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Monarchy, and was alwayes held neceſſary for preſerving that Crown, had been put in execution with the greateſt violence imaginable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But when a Jewel is gone, the main inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be by what means it may be found again, not how it came to be loſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt means then of recovering that Crown, may be (what your Majeſties Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father made uſe of) to buy your rights of your own subjects by Gifts and Promiſes, wherein your Majeſty is to be as prodigall as the</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals <hi>are inſolent in expecting and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:40725:86"/>
                     <hi>and indeed experience teacheth, that that Nation is ſo addicted to their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that more may be effected this way then by a powerfull Army; to him will they be ſubject who wil give moſt, or from whom moſt can be expected; herein prodigality wil be good husbandry: For when</hi> Portugal <hi>ſhal be returned to the obedience of your Majeſty, all that wealth which hath been beſtowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, wil return likewiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond means is by force of Armes; but this wil be difficult at preſent by reaſon of the ſeverall engagements of this Monarchy elſewhere. I ſuppoſe, Sir, that in caſe</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal <hi>ſhould be conquered by force, all their conqueſts in the Indies, &amp;c. wil remain in their hands; for thither wil they all fly, and from thence they wil be alwayes ready to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt our enemies: wherefore it would be very expedient for your Majeſties ſervice, that a Truce were firſt made with the</hi> Hollanders <hi>upon condition that they make warre upon the</hi> Portugal <hi>in the Indies, and have what ever they can conquer: Whence will ariſe this commodity, that they will want the wealth of their conqueſts; your Majeſty being</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:40725:87"/>
                     <hi>diſengaged with the</hi> Hollander) <hi>wil the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conquer them at home, and the</hi> Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>wil onely come to receive to day at the hand of your Majeſty, what to morrow the</hi> Portugal <hi>muſt deliver up unto them. At the ſame time the</hi> Hollanders <hi>and</hi> Flemings <hi>may ſcour the Coaſts of</hi> Portugal, <hi>and the</hi> Engliſh <hi>be invited to a more frequent navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation into the Eaſt Indies and</hi> China, <hi>whereby the</hi> Portugal <hi>Trade there may eaſily be ruined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third way is, That the Pope be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to thunder his Excommunications againſt the Houſe of</hi> Braganza, <hi>and againſt the whole Kingdom as perjured, and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bators of the publick peace, animating all Christian Princes to aſsiſt in the regaining that kingdom, upon pretence of advancing the Catholick Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, diffidencies and jealouſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke of</hi> Braganza <hi>and the people, may eaſily be fomented by the means of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, ſtrangers, and by</hi> Flemings <hi>and</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians, <hi>under the name of</hi> French. <hi>And to effect theſe diffidencies the better, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may really be begun with the Duke, which</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:40725:87"/>
                     <hi>being diſcovered by the people (though it be before the Duke could know therof) they will deſtroy him and all his Family; and in ſuch caſe the civill diſſentions will open a way for your Majeſty to recover your right: Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate evils muſt have Deſperate remedies, the kingdome of</hi> Portugal <hi>is the canker of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Monarchy: therefore,</hi>

                  <q>Enſe recidendum eſt ne pars ſyncera trahatur.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let not your Majeſty defer the right reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the greateſt rigor is here the greateſt charity, and to have no charity is to have much prudency: to bury this</hi> Hydra <hi>in its own aſhes, will be triumph enogh: to live without this arm is better then to have it employed againſt its own head: Let your Majeſty never believeor hope better of that nation, then you have ſeen theſe 60 years paſt; never think to keep that Countrey if not planted with other people, the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt your Majeſties government is hereditary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The intereſt of the King, Sir, it very ample, and hath no bounds againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, every action is juſt and honourable</hi>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:40725:88"/>
                     <hi>that tends to the recovery of the Kings right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover, a Truce is to be made with the</hi> Catalonians, <hi>wherby they being freed from the tumultuous courſes of warre, will have time to take notice of the</hi> French <hi>inſolencies, and growing weary of that yoke, wil at length eaſily embrace the next opportunity to return to their obedience; which once effected, will make the whole people of</hi> Portugall <hi>waver between hopes and fears, and beget variety of opinions amongst them, which for the conquering of kingdoms (the Emperour</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian <hi>was wont to ſay) is much more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous then the power of an Army, as the Grandfather of your Majeſty found in the ſucceſsion of</hi> Portugal. <hi>To this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it will be very expedient, that your Majesty name Biſhops to diſpoſe of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments and Offices of that Crown to the the moſt confiding perſons in that kingdom; for this will beget diſtruſt amongst them all, and the ignorant people not knowing whom to trust, will put all into confuſion, whereby your Majeſties ſervice will be more eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</hi>
