            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Grammer should not bee

for the Arts founded in it;
yet many thinke them very

Greeke and Latin, and the

but as a dish to serve up the
sence.</p>
            <p>Hee that meddles with

            <p>when I consider mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how life in these lower
things is disposed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
by the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and ordainer of all
things; I finde in the most
centrall and Terrestriall,
(that is) the metalline bodies
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62990:31"/>
their life is termined, shut,
and imprisoned within
themselues; in the vegetable,
that they haue their spring,
station, and dissolution. And
then their life is breath'd vp
into the common aire, the
instrument from whence it
came, insused by the Sunne,
Moone, and Starrs &amp;c. In
the Animall, that they eate,
drinke, steepe, moue, and
dye; and their lives are given
up into the generall spirit
of the world; But in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
that he hath a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
soule, and according to
his desert, is adjudged by him
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62990:31"/>
that infused it. O then, how
precizely ought we to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our courses here!</p>
            <p>If there were not a hope
for vs in the goodnesse of
God, the better sort of Men
which are most afflicted in
this life, were more wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then ether vegetable or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall
creatures.</p>
            <p>The prosperity, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
felicitie of this life, is
but Animall happines.</p>
            <p>Few men attaine true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
heere in this world;
that have not seene Fortunes
both faces, that is, adversitie
before a rich estate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62990:32"/>
Riches is a muffler, and
makes many in this life, play
at blind-man buffe with
their soules.</p>
            <p>The minde that lookes
too vehemently upon the
goods of this world, makes
its thoughts a slave; yet wee
ought not to let passe an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
necessary care, or due oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>Those Arts wherein young
men most excell by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie,
should not bee an old
mans practise or election; for
it fits age to excell in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; judgement, not in
delights and pastimes, but as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62990:32"/>
a moderate hearer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.</p>
            <p>The earth even to our
comprehension is but a point
or centrall pricke in regard
of the universe, a mole-hill
in Gods sight, and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Ants, to whom he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a sparke, droppe, or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of reason, thereby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne
his Almighty great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and prayse his holy
name; The rest are but as
creeping vermine in his
sight; the difference is, of us
he will take a seuere account,
as of those to whom he hath
given that Talent of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62990:33"/>
how we have dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of it.</p>
            <p>When I consider the great,
good, &amp; generall providence
of the Almighty, who hath
opened his hand of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and throwne downe
his goodnesse upon the earth,
for every man by his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to obtayne; some I see
florish and wallow in all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and plenty; others by
labour gaine a mediocrity:
many are poore, indigent,
and miserable; and which is
note-able, none fully content,
as if they all had too short
measure; then in my thoughts
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62990:33"/>
I say; O you full and rich in
these earthly blessings, have
you Quayles and Manna, and
yet doe you murmure? You
that labour, doe you not see
you are well and happy? for
man is borne to labour, as
the birde to fly, the fish to
swimme, the horse and oxe to
beare and draw. And you
poore and indigent, consider
how your poverty comes,
or by your sloth, or love of
idlenesse or vice; blame not
then the bounteous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God. And to you
lame, blinde, deformed, and
diseased, repine not, O doe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62990:34"/>
not; for the punishment fals
justly upon you, if you doe
well and wisely waigh it, <hi>viz.</hi>
either for your parents, or
your owne sinnes; for God is
goodnesse it selfe, and cannot
joyne with evill.</p>
            <p>A forc't conceite is like a
press't Souldier, who for the
most part serves not so well
as a voluntary.</p>
            <p>Most men being arived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
yeares, by experience see
many of their youths acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
appeare in fooles habits.</p>
            <p>To be rid of many knaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts, it is not amisse
to imitate old Raynard the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62990:34"/>
Fox, that by standing in the
water by degrees, drave all
the fleas nipt his pelt, into
the locke of wooll he had in
his mouth, and then left it in
the river; so when thou art
opprest with byting worldly
cogitations, take some good
booke or holy meditation,
and therein drowne all thy
worldlings.</p>
            <p>Hee that is over carefull;
showes distrust in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
and hee that is too
carelesse, showes an idle
minde.</p>
            <p>It is not well spoken to say,
I will do this or that, because
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62990:35"/>
thou canst do nothing of thy
selfe, neither art master of
one minute of thy time: but
better to say, by Gods leave
and permission I will, &amp;c.
which if thou utterest not,
yet at least thinke.</p>
            <p>To truly Sabbathize is not
onely to keepe reverently to
God his service the seaventh
day or Sonday, but every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
to retyre thy thoughts
from these worldly occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him-wards: as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
thy fraylty, his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse;
thy poverty in all
good actions, his bounty in
all good blessings, &amp;c. And
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62990:35"/>
this is true Sabbathizing.</p>
            <p>In God his <hi>Speculum</hi> all
men are alike, onely those
who truly &amp; heartily love &amp;
serve him, are taller &amp; fairer
then the rest. But in man
his glasse, there are many
differences in estates, and the
respects betweene the one
and the other, is in outward
things, as bodily feature,
strength, riches and hauing
power &amp; princelike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
&amp;c. But these poore
Mundaine accounts termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
in themselues as smoake
into aire: for the best and
most perdurable, last heere
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62990:36"/>
but in breath.</p>
            <p>Choller falling into passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ouer of a pot.</p>
            <p>To speake or name all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in one diction or word,
is to say ingratitude.</p>
            <p>I protest my experience is
yet short in true knowledge
of a crafty companion, for
he hath so bred himselfe up
in base and customarie cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of subtiltie, that the Iack
will turne the spit round of
his owne endes, to which he
will make my credulity but
the fire.</p>
            <p>If wee would conceive
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62990:36"/>
that the wrong and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
we doe to others had
impetration so with God's
justice, to still afflict us by
Apparition or Genius, it
would deterre a good mind
from offering any, and give
cause of feare to a bad.</p>
            <p>Although the causes of
mens intentions passe for the
most part under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ordained provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, yet in the best
achivements, and things, I
perceive wee are stopt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the particular blessing
admit us to it; the meanes is
prayer and good life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:62990:37"/>
be not too familiar with thy
servants, nor with people of
base condition; for then thou
shalt find the proverbe true:
familiarity breeds contempt;
but a generous spirit is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
most flexible.</p>
            <p>All Alchymists can doe
well, till they come to doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Some praise nothing but
what is their owne, and they
give few others cause to doe
that deseruedly.</p>
            <p>when I encline my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to musicke, I listen to
the sweetnesse of Cadence,
Choice of Choardes, &amp;c.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62990:37"/>
when to words or discourse,
then I hearken after sence;
for a tale that is sencelesse or
dull is like a plaine-fac't wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with a flat nose, or
one that's like the Ace of
Clubs.</p>
            <p>Leave not thine owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
fashion (if good)
to follow the guize, fashion
or habit in manners of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for what sitts comely
in another is questionable
whether, it will do so in
thee. Euery man weares his

is euer short.</p>
            <p>Religion is the fairest flower

            <p>To flatter a friend is to
play false in the game of
friendship: to neglect thy

is to throw the

            <p>He that breakes his word
and promise with men, is
like him that receives cutts
and wounds in his skinne,
the greater the deeper, and
are seldome cured without

that esteemes not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse

            <p>A man rich and highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
is like a Sun Diall
regarded so long as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
shineth on him; but
poore, no more look't on

being in a Cloud; so by man
hee is regarded, as regarded:

be his estate poore

I haue heard many seafare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men pray for diverse
windes, as their way was
bound, North, South, East,
West, which <hi>Lucian</hi> in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogues
laughs at, husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for raine, and at the
same time travellers for faire
wether, so in all a confusion.
As if the Sunne, Winde and
Raine were to bee fitted to
the measure of our sensuall
occasions; so doth selfe-loue
blind most men, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Sunne, Wind, and
Raine, are God his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not ours, but by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his goodnesse, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62990:43"/>
however it blowes, shines,
or raines, wee ought to bee
content and thankfull, (not

but reverence so great crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
however to our endes
contrary.</p>
            <p>To desire of another any
thing without valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
is foolish selfe-love
and childish craving.</p>
            <p>It is honourable to ayd
honest investigation; for
though not suddainly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
yet the intent was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

&amp; with every one praysable.

When we winke at a friends
faults, our judgment turnes

            <p>A drunkard is a mad man

            <p>When we meditate or act

but when wee eate, drinke,
spend time vainly, and sleep,
wee are dying.</p>

Animalls suffer; and labour,
and therein shew us our
duty; And we were worse
then them all, if wee doe
neglect withall humiliation
to still laude, and thanke
his bounteous goodnesse; to
whom hee hath onely given
a reasonable and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive

the better hee loves us; the

disesteemes us.</p>
            <p>Iudgment pearceth into

Conceit hath taken but a

Hold thy selfe then up in
God, who is not onely the
Creator but preserver of all
his workes: and if thou beest
one of his, thou neede not
feare but that thou art in the
eye of his providence. And
examine thy selfe closly if

            <p>Povertie is not amisse to

            <p>All earthly and corporall

            <p>Warre the child of injury

it is pride in a soldiers

a monster to heaven, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aedie

            <p>So speake of all men, and

bee thy enemies and shame
thee to their power; for men
are various, and by nature

of others: it is not what thy

that God respecteth (for,

            <p>The principall cause as

            <p>It is a care every man

            <p>When extreames oppresse

            <p>Goe not to a covetous man

            <p>Musicke breathd by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,

of our selves (who are
by <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Genesis</hi> said to be
Gods Image) to prove or as
it were see, the Trinitie in
Vnitie, and Vnitie in Trinity;
for is not <hi>Deus pater anima

bodies to the great world,
our bodies and flesh shall
turne to dust or earth, so shall
the world to his <hi>pristine Chaos;</hi>
our soules shall endure for
ever; God is eternall; our
minds affects this or that,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62990:86"/>
God the Son came downe,
was incarnate, showed and
taught his Fathers will mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously,
suffered, descended,
rose againe; and ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his first place. The mind
of man circuits, but still it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
the mind, conclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
as the Soule and mind
setts the spirit to organize in

that all, who is three in parts
or persons; who moves this
all, making all things obay
and serve this one God, as
his instruments or organons:
wherefore <hi>Plato</hi> sayed well,
<hi>Caput eius est Coelum, oculus eius

            </p>
            <p>Thicke fire was the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

of the Sacred virgin; the

of Christ and us.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ethnicks, Atheists, Turkes,
Iewes &amp;c.</hi> making question
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62990:87"/>
why an Eternall should have
a Sonne? answere is, God's
power and word tooke flesh
of the Sacred virgin, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his justice by the order
of his mercie; and since it
was for man, hee served it
in the same livery; which no
Angell, or creature, could
doe, no more then the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
can worke alone.</p>
            <p>Hee gave <hi>Moses</hi> lawes in
Tables of stone, which <hi>Moses</hi>
brake in anger of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
Idolatrie: but hee gave
us precepts in our owne
similitude, which was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
likewise by our Sauiour
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62990:87"/>
his death on the Crosse, but
renewed by his resurrection,
as the other by <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting.</p>
            <p>If there were 100000000
millions of people on the
earth's surface, more then
there is; every one having a
burning glasse, yet all might
use it to effect by one Sunne;
In which there are excellent,
cogitations to bee medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The glory of the Almighty
shines in all good things, as
his relucent creature the
Sunne, spreades his beames
in the universe: but when it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62990:88"/>
pleased him to contract him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to his word, then as a
burning glasse; gathers the
rayes of the worlds Sunne: so
hee kindled a fire on Syon
hill, and a bright flame in
the wombe of the blessed
Virgin, which the proud
malice of the Iewes striuing
to extinguish, made this
Gods Son our soules lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
shine the brighter.</p>
            <p>Whensoever thou seest the
Moone goe into a Clowde,
thinke of the glorious ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Saviour, and how
hee is in the Sacrament or
Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:62990:88"/>God is one in himselfe,
but as hee appeares to the
world and us, is three, <hi>viz.</hi>
God the Creator, and our
Father; God the Sonne, as he
wore our humanitie, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and redeemed us: God
the holy Ghost, as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth,
gouerneth, and
Consolateth us. Yet all is
one God, to whom bee all
prayse.</p>
            <p>The exceeding difference
betwixt us and our Saviour
Iesus Christ, is very apparent
in our disposition; for we are
bent to the Humanitie, and he
bent it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62990:89"/>When we contemplate in
the feruour of Prayer to find
an Idea of the all-Creator,
the utmost wee arive vnto is
a light, which our limited
thoughts cannot so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
as belongs to his ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie:
and so wee are set up
as with a period. Therefore
O wonderfull bounty and
goodnesse of God, that hath
sent downe his Sonne,
and cloathed him in the
shape of our humanitie,
whereby he is our <hi>speculum,</hi>
and through whom we see
Gods mercie, power, love
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:62990:89"/>The word Godly or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and it's <hi>Econtra,</hi> hath
great signification, denoting
some vertuous action, or
contemplation, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The whole universe is
but as a bowle in the hand of
the Almightie; but no mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
can containe him that
made space and place.</p>
            <p>As the luminous carbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Firmament, whose
presence makes the Day joy,
and the Night mourne his
absence, is the guide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our bodies in this world:
So the incomprehensible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62990:90"/>
glorious Sunne of Heaven is
the presence of our day in
God, and our guide to his
presence.</p>
            <p>All the workes of God
are essentiall &amp; concreate; not
as man looking on his
face in a glasse, a vanishing
shaddow: for God from all
eternitie could not but know
himselfe, and looking upon
himselfe, doubled the beames
of his glorious essence, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
his similitude or <hi>(quatenus

of which resemblance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the holy Ghost or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
three individuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62990:90"/>
in one Godhead to
whom bee prayse, honour,
and glory, in one thankes.</p>
            <p>Let God his studie, bee
the cheefest place; in thy
Soules house.</p>
            <p>The highest orbe for our
station, is the earth, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
orbe to God's vision is the
earth, what hee hath done
above is for us to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and admire, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine:
but what hee hath by
his Commandements, and
his Sonnes precepts, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to doe, and beleeve,
wee ought carefully to looke
unto, (that is) by our Saviour
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62990:91"/>
his words thus in breefe:
Loue God above all things,
and thy Neighbour as thy
selfe.</p>
            <p>God is a spheare whose
Center is every where, whose
circumference is no where:
A light which through too
much claritie becomes invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
a greatnesse containing
all magnitude, a power go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
all potencie, and
a goodnesse inexplicable.</p>
            <p>To beleeve things fall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under our sences compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
requires no reward,
for reason payes it: but things
beyond our reach and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62990:91"/>
by two double Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
engrosseth our blisse of
faith in heavenly Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>The miracles of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
being so supernaturall,
showed the stony Jewes,
had beene Gorgonized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his comming.</p>
            <p>All sacred words and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
figures, denote unto us,
what wee ought to know,
and knowne to hold invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably
and strongly.</p>
            <p>The Humillitie of our
Saviour, is th'exaltation of
our hope to salvation; the
foote of which Ladder was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62990:92"/>
his humanitie, the top his
deitie; the Angels going up
and downe, figures of his
Passion, Death, resurrection,
and ascention; <hi>Iacob's</hi> sleeping
our let hangie in sinne.</p>
            <p>God who containes all
glorious formes within him,
cannot be comprehended in
any figure by man: therefore
hee sent his Sonne in man's
owne figure, to bee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilier
cogitated by man.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Ethnique
world, were ever too apt
and busie, in Deifying men;
if they were but a litle taller
in their deserts then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62990:92"/>
pitch of others, as in
Saturne, Iupiter, Hercules
&amp;c. And this was but a tricke
of that evill and malignant
intelligent spirit, that aped
in them before hand, what
he knew would really fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in our Saviour Christ
Iesus; thereby thinking to
stopp his reputation with
such communitie.</p>
            <p>By our pronenesse to evill
and penetrative sorrow after
the fact; it declares that our
Nature is depraved from the
first purity we were plac't in;
for goodnesse cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
euill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:62990:93"/>Doubtlesse the conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some intelligent evill
and depraved spirit through
envy instigated, enticed and
contaminated man's Soule;
which was the fruite forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or that Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in good and evill; even
as coyture with an uncleane
woman contaminates the
body of a man.</p>
            <p>It hath beene questionable
in my thoughts, why that
displaced &amp; dejected spirit
should so greedely seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mans ruyne: I can cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
no further, then that his
nature being depraved, his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62990:93"/>
burthen of torments great,
his despaire of release despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and greevous; his enuy
therefore is strong upon
those are in way to obtaine
his place, whom he seekes to
hinder &amp; ensnare in the nets
of their owne sensuallities,
which hee knowes and see's
by their proceedings and life.</p>
            <p>Paradise was created and
the man in it, of pure and
incorruptible Elements, and
the corruptible World for all
other things; but by mans
breach of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the puritie being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, man became
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62990:94"/>
Companion with the other
Creatures, and by feeding on
those Corruptible things, by
little and little was so thrust
out of Paradice; that is, out of
Incorruptibilitie or tree of
life, into Corruptibilitie, and
death.</p>
            <p>As by ill enclined will man
fell, and was depraved: so by
God his good enclined will,
man may rise and be saved.</p>
            <p>God could easiler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the power of his will
by his owne Essence, then
by any under or subordinate
power: and because no man
can see him and live (he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62990:94"/>
in his pure Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie)
hee therefore Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himselfe under the flesh
of the Holy Virgin.</p>
            <p>I have noted many care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to stoppe the wast of fire,
and but carelesse in the wast
of their time, the ravenous
consumer of the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iewell <hi>viz</hi> Salvation.</p>
            <p>Mans Soule is a sparke of
the pure Fire circuits God
his Seate, strucke into the
Tinder of the flesh by the will
of the great Creatour, and
life disposer; which if here
contaminated by variation,
and sensualitie, cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62990:95"/>
to his puritie till pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
but obaying God his
will, and acting to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the precepts given by his
Sonne, it becomes a glorious
Essence, and shall resuscitate
and illustrate the body into
the same spirituall substance.</p>
            <p>When I heare in some
great Cittie, many Clocks
strike neare together, I then
judge the howers are neare
true telling: so when I see,
reade and heare the unitie of
many ancient and moderne
judgements agree in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
I deeme their expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and declaration to bee
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62990:95"/>
next the truth in all science.</p>
            <p>The best manner of meanes
for us to know our owne
soules, and immateriall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof it was made, is
to come neare unto God by
fasting, prayer, humillitie,
good deeds: and for that
which is his seate and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
his glorious Majestie, is of
the same substance; and if
worldlings knew their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
they would not bee
so bold with their follie.</p>
            <p>God his seate (as sayeth a
Philosopher) is in the purest
of pure and invisible Fire,
which he by his gracious free
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62990:96"/>
Spirit onely hath distributed
to man in his first infusion
of life, whereby man is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmos,</hi>
(with reverence
be it spoken to the Deitie)
and as in the Threds of a
Spiders webbe the Spider
being centrall, the least touch
in circumference gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so all the actions of man
are by infinite wayes, percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
unto God, and hee nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
unto us, then wee to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>I conceive Heaven to bee
repleatly filled with all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
delights, as the best and
most excellent musicke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62990:96"/>
with a Homonimall
Congruence of well chosen
Chordes, and ayerie with the
precedents tones.</p>
            <p>The ende whereto wee
were Created was to serve,
love and honour God, who
doth by blessed soules still
encrease his kingdome, in
lieu of those delapsed Angels
once fell. Seeke to bee one of
those Citizens by good and
holy life.</p>
            <p>When thou prayest to God,
conceive thou speakest to the
whole Trinitie, when by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Father, then to
thy Creator; when to the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62990:97"/>
Sonne, then to thy Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
when to the holy Ghost,
then to thy Sanctifier: So
thanke thy Creator, through
thy Saviour by thy Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and so in all thou thankest
God, for all.</p>
            <p>Prayer is a speaking to God,
in which let us regard what
it were for a poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
worthlesse person, to
come before the presence of
some great Prince or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of a Kingdome; and so
stretch or enlarge thy conceit,
how then before the king of
all Potentates Coelestiall and
Terrestriall, what a reverence
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62990:97"/>
and awfull respect ought to
bee used? No fashion or
words can expresse it, but
an humble heart, and minde,
voyde of all earthly cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is the best oblation, if
done with all sinceritie.</p>
            <p>Pictures of sancteous
histories are but notes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
actions in humane cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
            <p>Hee that doth not beleeve
the <hi>Credo</hi> or <hi>Symbolum Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
hath little to doe with
the <hi>Pater-noster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pater-noster</hi> denotes
hee is our Father by Christ:
<hi>qui es in Coelis,</hi> that is, above all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62990:98"/>
things in place, power and
glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanctificetur nomen tuum,</hi>
the dutie of our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
and due thankes
to his goodnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aedveniat regnum tuum,</hi> that
all things and wee are in
and under his regiment, and
so desire to bee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiat voluntas tua,</hi> that we
(as we ought) do lay downe
all our affections and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
under his will and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sicut in Coelo &amp; in Terra,</hi>
that we may bee as obedient
to his heasts and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62990:98"/>
here, as his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
host high blessed is there.</p>
            <p>The rest are all plaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
petitions for our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
good.</p>
            <p>The ancient use of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on both knees, signifies,
in my judgement that wee
should offer up all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and strength to God; for
a man in so kneeling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth
himselfe of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to act, is unpassible,
and as fixt to that hee came
from, and to which he must
returne: The lifting up of
the hands, denotes hee is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a dreadfull judge, craves
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:62990:99"/>
mercie, showes the cheefe
actors of evill and wronges,
and the receivers of many
benefits; But the standing up
when the Creed is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
denotes, we should bee
ready to justifie, stand too,
and maintaine those Canons
of our Faith against all
<hi>Turkes, Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Infidells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Circle drawne
about the list of mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and by God prescribed;
out of which if any exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly
goe, they fall into the
Divels lash, who haunts
there as the whippe of God
his just justice, whereby wee
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:62990:99"/>
see many punished in this
life, and by straying out of
the fold, fall into the wolfes
jawes.</p>
            <p>The stars and second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
predominate but upon
and in our earthly part and
humours, for the Soule of
man was inspired by God,
and hee is above all: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accidents are but as
stumbling blocks, which
wise men sees, and stepps
ouer, but fooles (as sayth
<hi>Salomon</hi>) goe in the darke:
And the Kingly Prophet
<hi>David</hi> prayed saying, Set up
thy selfe above the heavens,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62990:100"/>
and thy glory O God above
all the earth, and so (in my
opinion) <hi>Sapiens dominabitur
Astris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee many times idlely
blame Fortune, a meere i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
or Idea, when
our owne follies and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
is the reall cause of
disasters. For suppose a tyle
fall's on the head, and hurts:
Why fortune therefore! you
might have kept at home;
but you must by necessitie
goe that way! blame the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
then. Fortune is a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to expresse chaunce by,
unto which we are all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:62990:100"/>When stormes, inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
Earthquakes, Circuite
us, wee then aptly confesse
our selves under Creatures,
and that with terror and
miserable feare; but by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfullnesse
wee againe
clime aboue <hi>Ela;</hi> nay further
into Gods closset, to his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
and predestination.</p>
            <p>The Chaos of all things,
may bee compared unto the
flint and iron; the striker
God, the lint or tinder, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
substance, the sparkes,
life, or soule.</p>
            <p>In speaking to God by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62990:101"/>
prayer, although thou canst
not give the reverence is
due; yet give what thou
owest and canst duely: Let
thy breath first laud him in
his goodnesse; secondly,
crave mercy for thy offences;
thirdly, give him thankes for
thy received benefits; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
humbly crave the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of thy estate here, and
life of blisse to come.</p>
            <p>It is not the mouth or lip-labour
God respects so
much, as the heart or mind in
an intelligent orator; yet the
resurrection of the body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
that our prayers
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62990:101"/>
should not bee meerely
mentall, but conjoyned with
corporall action: for shall
wee not with Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
hope to see God even with
the same eyes? Lift them up
towards Syon hill then,
bend the knees, reach up the
handes, offer the calves of
the lipps, make all thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
powre forth the prayse
of him that made thee.</p>
            <p>Meere worldlings in
Iudgement, are blind in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
divine mysteries; for
did not <hi>Festus</hi> and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Athenians</hi> deeme Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> preaching foolishnesse?
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62990:102"/>
but an over stupid devotion
ladeth out of the lighter of
the fantasie more into the
Arke of the Church then shee
should carry; but Sectaries
would throw the Churches
treasure over boord.</p>
            <p>All our life heere is but
an entertayning of vanities;
what good doth capps and
reuerences really any man?
The satisfaction of appetits,
is but the uncouering of our
wants; heaping of Riches,
but as ill servants, that will
runne to others from us, and
lagge behinde us: nothing
heere permanent or true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62990:102"/>
let us therefore bee
carefull to purchasse by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and good deedes, treasure
for heaven, that wee may
have wherewith to satisfie
our reckoning there with
the great Host, who hath
forgiven us one score alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and therefore let us not
presume too much on the
next.</p>
            <p>When I consider the
weakenesse of our humane
nature, I wonder mankind
can bee proud, for wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist a little time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the props of meat and
drinke, sleepe, rest, &amp;c.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62990:103"/>
which the Angells, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
need not nor use: but
when I cogitate our frayltie
and vanitie, I breath with the
Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Lord, what
is man that thou shouldst be
mindfull of him!</p>
            <p>The best use of dreames
is to cogitate that as by full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or coldnesse of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
Crudities causeth
fearefull apparitions to the
wakeing and working fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie;
and as good and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
heate, digestion and
humours, cause pleasant and
delightfull passages; yet all
but shaddowes and vanish
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62990:103"/>
like darknesse from the
Sunne, when we rise; So
when the soule is freed from
this terrestreietie, which
clowdeth the judgment and
reason; then the evill workes
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted essentially, casteth
the soule most really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
those are indeed
evill, not in apparition, but
deformed Divells indeed:
And the good &amp; vertuous
deeds amongst the blessed
pleasures of holy spirits and
Angells. Wherefore let us
take heed wee goe not to
the bed of our grave with
a stomacke over-charged
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62990:104"/>
with Sinnes.</p>
            <p>It much matters not, what
Religion a foole or a knave
is of, for their babling is but
vaine prating, and the tree is
best knowne by the fruit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dis</hi> the god of Mony
now laughs out right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

            </p>
            <p>Th' Almighty God, is the
Soule of the universe, and
the rayes of his splendour, is
the quintessence in every

the quintessence, which is

            <p>Quintessence is not as

of pure from impure,
but must be taken from both

the thinne and thicke, the
spirituall and corporall. It is

            <p>What is it to mee, what is

when there is a law set
downe for me, <hi>viz.</hi> to

what I can lawfully finde
heere, he hath given me leave

            <p>What thou speakest. <hi>i. e.</hi>

            <p>Not by eating, drinking,

hand; and the universe his
Instruments; Man his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is a sparke of that flame,
a droppe of that Sea, a moate
in that sunne, his soule with
her powers, are his Spirits
faculties, his body is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganon.</p>
            <p>God made man and the
whole, world to his glory,
prayse, and use; yet without
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:62990:107"/>
his needing them, as we doe
neede, <hi>viz.</hi> garments, houses,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>God is within all things,
but not included, without
all things, but not excluded.</p>
            <p>There are some of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that each man hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Genious, a good Angel
and a bad, as they please to
tearme them; which I hold
no other but the Animall
spirit and the intellectuall;
The Animall desireth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
contentment, the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall
the soules: if the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
hath the domination,
the man is given to mundane
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62990:107"/>
lights which perish with the
life: if the intellectuall hath
the predominance, the soule
rejoyceth in spiritual pleasure,
and affects things good, and
eternall. Every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
for the most part
showes who carieth the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the will, how, and
when.</p>
            <p>Those that worke on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
terminations, resemble
them who swallow the
nut, shell and all, for the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
sake: for no man can
further reach the determinate
ordination of God in his
handmaide Natures house,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62990:108"/>
then by exuberation of the
seeds; for, as sayeth the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
<hi>Species in Speciem non
transmutation nisi reducantur
ad primam materiam,</hi> and that
ordinately digested, doth in
Philosophie worke beyond
Natures Creatures wee see;
wherefore let no man despise,
or condemne that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not.</p>
            <p>God almighty, being the
fountaine of all wisedome,
as wee call excellent <hi>Sapiens,</hi>
cannot be without the poore
riveret of reason, which hee
hath given to man.</p>
            <p>As our Saviour suffered the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62990:108"/>
afflictions of humane nature,
as hunger, thirst, sorrow,
feare, anger, weeping, absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
paines &amp;c. So ought
wee in soule and life to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him to our powers, <hi>viz.</hi>
to abstayne from Ebrietie, to
avoyd vayne mirth, and to
greeve for our sinnes, to bee
valiant in his defence, to bee
meeke &amp; humble, to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our carnall affections &amp; to
endure afflictions patiently.</p>
            <p>He that will duly waigh &amp;
consider the great and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
sufferings of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>par le menu</hi> as the
French Phrase is; <hi>viz.</hi> his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62990:109"/>
blowes, whippings, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,
the contumelies of the
deryding and reioycing of
his tormenters, his griefe for
the lamenting of his friends,
his burthen of the crosse, his
stretching, nayling, drinking
vineger and galle, his rayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
spectators, &amp;c. And
withall consider his patience
therein, and lamblike endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
not opening his
mouth to a murmur, but in
prayer, &amp; that even for them
were his grievous afflicters:
and then poyze thy ability
to these endurances, and thou
must by force confesse him
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62990:109"/>
not onely God but thy
wonderfull good God, thy
exceeding pittifull redeemer;
and stand confounded in thy
weakenes, saying, Glory and
immortall thankes bee to the
Lambe, that so tooke away
the heavie burthen of our
sinnes.</p>
            <p>God his iustice is much to be
feared, for as he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of all wisdome and our
loving creator and father,
yet to show his detestation
to willfull finners, like a
wise schoolemaster hee did
not much afflict <hi>Adam</hi> and his
seed, so long as they stood
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62990:110"/>
but poore and weake man;
but when his justice, mercie,
word, and promisse, tooke
flesh and cloath'd it selfe in
our durty garments, then
God to punish man and
<hi>Adams</hi> fault showed forth the
length of the Arme of his
Iustice in our meeke and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
inocent Saviour; then
did his anger burne, nay
flame, against disobedience,
and that so extreamly, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
had hee not beene God also,
that beare the burthen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
flesh nor humane spirit,
could have endured the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
part of the torments hee
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62990:110"/>
suffered; which patiently
borne and suffered, his iustice
was satisfied, and man resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
&amp; directed by a new law,
which we are all bound to
keepe heedfully; and to take
heed of rebellion heer eafter.</p>
            <p>When I observe a cruell
Carter yerke and slash but a
poore over-toyld Iade, or a
hasty foole spurre him to the
guts, I cogitate then, if our
godlesse dainty gallants were
but so pythagorized, how
they would wish they had
lived better.</p>
            <p>Hast thou a great estate,
and a great sparke of Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62990:111"/>
fire; a larger capacity,
a quicker wit, a more solid
judgement, a more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
understanding, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others? art thou not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by thy selfe love? &amp;c.
then remember our Lords
parrable of the Tallents, to
whom much is given, of him
much is required.</p>
            <p>It is not the bare letter of
sacred Scriptures men vary so
much in, as the sence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to sayle safely in such an
immense and profound Sea
of mysteries, where the gusts
of selfe conceit will bee puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing,
it is wise warynesse to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62990:111"/>
waigh up the Anchor of faith,
and set sayle of Christian pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
by the direction of the
wisest and best experienced
Masters &amp; Pilots, who have
made happy voyage before
us; and such are the Ancient
Fathers.</p>
            <p>As the Iewes used our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
so do Sectaries the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
first they see and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then question &amp; traduce;
then turne them up &amp; down,
at last torture &amp; crucify them.</p>
            <p>Reporters of disputations
in these latter times, resemble
such Painters that make all
the figures and houses accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62990:112"/>
to their Country forme
and fashion; but a true relater
should give every sillable his
due by report, however hee
affect.</p>
            <p>There is no Creature but
loves themselves most, and
others to themselves, else
looke for no love in this
lower world.</p>
            <p>As addition and too apt
Credulitie are motives to
superstition, so diminution
and incredulitie, is the way
to Atheisme: keepe therefore
right in the apostolique path
of faith.</p>
            <p>Hee may according to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Athanasius Creed, be well

that hold's and beleeves
the Trinitie in vnitie, and the
Vnitie in Trinitie: that is our
mayne, &amp; all other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
should not (in may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
make Christians
shed the others blood, if the
Divell were not too busie in
the envious hearts of place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders;
for wee ought not
to doe evill that good may
come thereof.</p>
            <p>In all thou doest intend,
make God still thy chiefe
materiall and end.</p>
            <p>This life is worne away
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:62990:113"/>
as a winter day, which to the
happy worldlings, seemes
faire and pleasant; but is
short and variable: to the
good and godly (if afflicted)
it is foule, and windie; but
the night of death brings
them rest, and a home in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
when the wicked then
lye without dores.</p>
            <p>God is the Father of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
