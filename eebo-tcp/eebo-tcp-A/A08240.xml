            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your pure and yer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt zeale toward gods truth and paynefull laboures infendeynge innocentes is not vnknowne to a great menye. But would to God it were farther knowne, euen tho rowe out.

Conſideringe alſo your yerneſte deſier to thys my ſmal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure in writing to maiſter Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyne a ſimple letter, for aſmuch as I perceyued that you were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly mynded to put it in print I thought I coulde not beſtowe my laboure better, then to ſet it furthe in your name chiefely to purg me from that euel ſuſpicion that is lyke to enſue the printinge of it. For ſeinge they begin to byte me priuilye all redye, for exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge certayne Articles preached of oure learned men, and woulde perſwade men that I dyd it of a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced malice, ſekeinge their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: I knowe well they ſhall ſaye much rather, that it was my ſuite to haue this my letter ſpread a broad, and that I dyd it to ſeeke prayſe, as they alwayes ſeeke moſt preiſe to them ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt deſerue it, or that I ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Which if they had the matter in handlyng: theſe men myght haue been a ſhamed to ſhew their faces in a pulpit, to declare any ſuche matter agayne Nowe to preuente theſe biteinge ſerpentes of thys poiſone the lord knoweth whether it be my faute or no to haue it printed, and you partly can teſtifie. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſhal not greue me to haue it prynted, but rathere I ſhalbe glad of it thoughe it were but for thys cauſe onelie. To declare vnto all other contreis, that deuenſher lacketh not ſome well wyllers (at the leaſte) as well amonge the pore creatures, as the riche and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſier the glorye of God and furdraunce of hys word. As touchinge the articles offerred to
<pb facs="tcp:4362:5"/>
the viſitours, which they ſay to be done of malice, hatered, and manie other good morowes, let ſuche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowe that I hate theyr doctrine in dede. As for any malice that I owe to the men: I axe no more grace and fauour of the Lorde, to be geuen to my ſelfe, then I wyſh to the vileſt of them all, if it might ſo come to paſſe and pleaſe God. For I knowe there can no ſuche ranckor and malice dwell in any chriſten herte, as they iudge other men by them ſelues.</p>
            <p>And thys I ſaye more ouer, that I am aſſured of theſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and of the kynges counſayle alſo: that they be no ſuche bloude thurſtye tirantes, as haue pleaſur in ſhedynge of bloude. For if they were but as cruell in puniſheinge the blynde wycked and ſedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe. I nought ſaye, preachers, as the popes miniſters haue beene in tormentyng innocentes: I take
<pb facs="tcp:4362:5"/>
God to wytneſſe, I woulde neuer haue declared ſo muche as I haue vnto them, though I ſhould haue ſmarted for it. This much haue I ſayde, to declare vnto all honeſte hertes myne innocencie in ſuche thynges as they begin to laye to my charge: and to ſtope the mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of them, that can do naught elles but ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, flatter, and diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, euen with theyr frindes, that they mought holde theyr tongues leſt if they paſſe theyr boundes.

Neithere let them thynke this ſpoken of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice, for I ſpake it for theyr hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and quietneſſe, as wel as mine owne commoditie.</p>
            <p>Now, to conclude in fewe wordes I haue added to thys my letter, a little appologie or defence, the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter to wythſtande theyr cruel and ſubtyle deceite. And becauſe, they lye alwaye lurckynge in bulwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb facs="tcp:4362:6"/>
and wyll not come furth into the open fielde, I haue in the ende made a little bulworke, out of the whyche I haue ſhotte a fewe of theyr owne pellettes.

            <p>The ſecond queſtian is. If one ſhoulde denye Mathewes Goſpel or ſay Mathewe wrote it not: how can it be proued by ſcripture? It can not you ſay, for ſcripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of it,</p>
            <p>The thyrd queſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd deceiue the ignorante people, which haue litle or no knowledge, which is. If ther be diſſenſion or ſtrife aboute the vnderſtandeynge of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and both alledge ſcripture, as the Areans dyd, whoe brought to places of ſcripture for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of theire errour, in ſuche caſe you aſke whoe ſhalbe iudge: or by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4362:8"/>
ſhall this be determined. Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vſe your veri wordes: wher is Luthers touch ſton? The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can not be touche ſtone you ſaye, for boeth bringe forth ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore ther muſt nedes be an other touch ſtone. Where is Luthers now? quoth you.. What anſwer can be made to theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans? For Luthers touch ſton wyll not ſerue. Your anſwer was ther fore, that Luther muſt gyue place and ſaye wyth you, that it is the holye goſt that muſt be touchſton.</p>
            <p>Thus you triumphed vpon Luther and hys diſciples, meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge by Luthers diſciples, ſuche, (I ſuppoſe) as holde thys, opinion as though you had ouer come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they coulde anſwere nothing</p>
            <p>Thys is eaſye to do, when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath all the talke hym ſelfe. But for as muche as you wyſhed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there at your ſermon or ſome of his diſciples, to anſwere to your
<pb facs="tcp:4362:8"/>
queſtians? I thynke verelye you wylbe contented to heare a pore man anſwere, though yet but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye. But I do you to wyt, that I am none of Luthers diſciples, for I knowe not Luther. But that I thynke hym to be a man as you be and therefore of hym ſelfe a lyer. But if Luther ſpake the truth, I woulde beleue him as ſone as you or any other that ſpeake the truth For the trueth, by the whiche I meane gods worde, can not be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken wyth out holye gooſte, if it be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the glorye of God. But in dede, you or any other maye wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedlye alledge the ſcripture of your ſelfe wythout the ſpirite, to the defaceinge of the glorie of god and hinderaunce of hys worde, as the deuyll dyd to Chriſte Mathe. iiii. But I wyl reſorte to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wyth thys proteſtacion, that if I haue by any meanes myſſe reported your wordes, or
<pb facs="tcp:4362:9"/>
other wyſe vnderſtanded them, then you ment: I hertelye deſire you that you wyll charitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme me what were your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, what ye ment in them, and howe you lyke thys my rude anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were. In ſo doinge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I wyll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmable to your counſayle, or elſe I wyll ſhewe you my mynde why I ought not.</p>
            <p>Nowe to your fyrſte queſtian, whyche is thys. If ther aroſe any diſſention of hereſie before the goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell was writen, as it happened in dede betwene Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Magus and Simon Peter. Alſo ouer the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſicion, where had ben then the touche ſtone?</p>
            <p>To this queſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. by your leaue mayſter Chripyne, I wyll in this maner anſwer, wyth Luther, and ſay the ſcripture muſt be the touch ſtone. If you ſaye it was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: I anſwer. The worde was in the begyninge. You wyl ſaye that
<pb facs="tcp:4362:9"/>
Chriſte came accordynge to the ſcripture, to finiſhe a newe teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whiche he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wyth his bloude and when the newe was come, the olde vaniſhed awaye as Saynte Paule affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Hebrues. And you wyll ſaye peraduenture, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo meaneth the newe teſta: mente, whiche was not written, when the queſtian of circumſicion was moued, wherefore it coulde not be the touche ſtone. To make many wordes about this queſtian in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyt, wer but loſſe of time. But I aſke you, Maiſter Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, what difference is betwene ſcripture written and ſcripture ſpoken, if boeth be ſcripture? You wyl graunte I am ſure, that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul and Iames wordes wer ſcripture, when they preached or taughte the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>Then if anie man had aſked for ſcripture it mought haue ben an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd.
<pb facs="tcp:4362:10"/>
Go to Peter, Paul, &amp; Iohn wyth thother Apoſtles. For theyr preaching and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle was ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So lacked not at that tyme Luthers tucheſtone, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wryttinges and preachinges agreed, and all was ſcripture. Wherefore thys queſtian is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlye anſwered to the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it</p>
            <p>To your ſecond queſtian which is. It any man ſhould denye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwes Goſpell, you aſke howe it coulde be proued by ſcripture, that Mathew wrote it. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that if it be agreinge to the other ſcriptures, and diſſent in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge from it: what daynger is it to call it Mathewes Goſpell, who ſo euer wrote it? And though you coulde denye Mathewes Goſpell to be Scripture: yet there is Scripture. For Marke, Luke and Iohns Goſpell, Peter, Paule and Iohns Epiſtles, be ſcripture
<pb facs="tcp:4362:10"/>
But I doubt not you wyll grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Mathewes Goſpel to be ſcripture. But you wil aſke me how I know it. I anſwere, by the reporte of the elders, holye fathers, mother ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye churche. Howe ſaye you nowe? Haue I anſwered you wel? Doth not thys anſwere pleaſe you? I thynke yes. But if I ſhoulde are the turkes howe they knowe that Mahomete was an holye prophet whoe deuiſed and cauſed to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, the Alcaron, what anſwere ſuppoſe you they coulde make? I thynke none other but as I haue made you before. That is we knowe it by oure elders or holye prophetes and fathers before vs. Nowe I wyll aſke you a queſtian whiche ſhall not be impoſſible, nor verie vnlyke. If it pleaſed God to moue the herte of a Iewe whiche wer neither chriſtian nor turke, to ſeke in the worlde here, the moſte perfecte religion. He goeth to the
<pb facs="tcp:4362:11"/>
Turkes and cometh to the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Wherwyth woulde you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwad hym to thys perfect religion? Woulde you preache to hym con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelles and cuſtomes of the elders? He mought then as well beleue the turkes as you. For they haue many thynges in their lawe, that ſeme to be verie godlye. And theyre authoritie, wythout authoritie of ſcripture, is euen as good as yours. But I knowe you wyl ſaye, what ſo euer you thinke, that you woulde preache the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vnto hym. Then muſt you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des graunte, that the ſcripture is of greater efficacie and ſtrength, them oure fathers elleders and counſayles. If you wyll yet wyth your queſtians affirme, that the fathers whyche deſcended frome tyme to tyme frome the Apoſtles hither to: haue greater authoritye then the ſcripture: I wyl axe you an other queſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4362:11"/>The Apoſtles of Chriſt, forſoke the ceremonies, cuſtomes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of theyr elders, forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of as holye mother ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye churche in the iudgemente of the worlde at that tyme, as yours is w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the world at thys houre, and of as longe continuaunce of tyme. Yet folowed they Chriſtes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, who was named of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye fathers, a ſediciouſe felowe, a newe tidinges bringer and an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike.

Ther were at that tyme auncient fathers which had great learneing, both byſhopes and prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes. The tradions, ordinaunces and ceremonies whiche they vſed, receyued they of theyr elders, lyke as you woulde haue vs to receiue
<pb facs="tcp:4362:12"/>
the conſtitucions of oure elders. Tell me nowe, how can you excuſe the Apoſtles? They were but pore fiſher men and net makers, they wer not brought vp in the ſcholes, they hadde not the leiſure toturne and toſſe thoſe greate volumes to be made doctours of deuinitie nor law.</p>
            <p>And yet within a whyle, they toke vpon them to teach the great doctours, and what mought thoſe holye fathers haue ſayed to theſe fiſhers? Take hede to your fyſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge. What haue you to do wyth the ſcripture? It is not mete for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie coblarde to be talkeynge of ſcripture. Howe were theſe men ſo lyghtlye perſwaded?</p>
            <p>What toucheſtone I ſaye had they? But ſeynge you woulde ſo fayne haue the name of the holye fathers and holye churche. I axe you thys queſtian.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Apoſtles and Diſciples

of Chriſte whyche were in hys tyme wyth hym preſente, whyche preached and wrote the ſcripture: were holy fathers and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte true churche.</p>
            <p>If the fathers ſyeth theyr tyme haue diſſented frome them in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne, maners, cuſtome, lawes, or in anye thynge partayneynge to Chriſtes relygion: whyche fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers woulde you folowe? If you denye that the fathers haue deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as is a fore ſayed, I refer the proue of it tyll a tyme of more leaſure.

            <p>Wherfore I wyl come to your thyrde queſtion, whyche in dede in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cludeth the matter of all the reſte whiche is thys.</p>
            <p>If ther aryſe anye contention in vnderſtandeynge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wherein, boeth the parties

bringe ſcripture for them: whoe ſhall nowe diſcuſſe the matter? Where is nowe the toucheſton? The ſcriptures can not. For boeth bring ſcripture. And the ſcripture you meane cauſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſye. But I aſke you whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures be deuided or no? If they be deuided: then accordinge to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes worde, they muſte be confoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded. But that is an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience and I knowe well you wyll not graunt that If the ſcriptures be not deuided, but agre in one, as they do in deede, for one place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repugnaunte to an other, thoughe it ſo ſeme: then haue not boeth parties ſcripture for them, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one partie muſt nedes falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledge ſcripture.</p>
            <p>But you will aſke me who ſhal geue ſentence, or by whom the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſye ſhalbe appeaſed, and where is Luthers touchſtone? In dede at your ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no man made

anſwer. Wherefore you made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and ſayde, the holye gooſte muſt be tuchſtone. As who ſhould ſaye, Luthers anſwere were not the very ſame. When he ſayeth gods worde muſt be the touchſton as you reporte of hym. And I praye you maiſter Chriſpyn, what difference is betwene gods worde and godes ſpirite? Is not goddes worde the breath of gods mouthe? And call you not that the holye goſte? Howe be it, it is eaſilye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued what ye meane. Ye put in the holye goſt for a cloke to deceiue vs wyth albeit ye meane nothing leſſe then the holye gooſte If you aſke me how I proue it: I anſwer thus I proue it. Wythout fayeth it is not poſſible to pleaſe God, but fayeth cometh by the word of god Ergo, wythout the worde of God nothyng can pleaſe God. But you exclude the word of God from the ſpirite of God, and in ſtead of that
<pb facs="tcp:4362:14"/>
ioyne vnto it, fathers, counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and oure mother holy churche for you ſaye the worde of God can not be touchſton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onelie beare wytneſſe, but the holye gooſte is the touch ſtone, whoe was and is in the holye fathers, that haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes gathered counſayles by whyche all thynges muſte be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and dermined. To proue thys ye alledge theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>Where ſo euer two or three be gathered together &amp;c. Theſe holye fathers, you affirme to be the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopes and prelates. But thus to include the holye gooſte into by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopes, you exclude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god.</p>
            <p>If this be not to be diſceiued, ſure I am deceyued. But it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for you to proue the chur, that you ſpeake of to be the true-holye, and catholyke churche, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you perſwade men ſo erneſtye to belyeue and ſtycke vnto it. But I ſaye, the churche that taketh
<pb facs="tcp:4362:14"/>
awaye the authoritye of goddes worde, or diminiſheth it by anye meanes, is not of Chriſte.</p>
            <p>But you mayſter Chriſpyne, graunte youre ſelfe to be of thys churche, Ergo etc. And in myne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, you do naught to ſay that all holy fathers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt to thys time, wer of the ſame opinion that you be of concernynge goddes worde. For I dare ſaye Auguſtine (whome you admytte to be of the verye holye church wyll not hold wyth you in thys matter.</p>
            <p>But if he woulde, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye of Chriſte is greater. Whoe is it that wyll not ſuſpecte your churche, ſeynge you ſet it ſo high in Lucifers place aboue Chriſte, and ſeparate the hollye goſte from Chriſte, where as Chriſte ſayeth, I am that I ſay vnto you? What is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpake vnto vs? Is it not his word? He ſaith moreouer, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſpeake, are ſpirite &amp; lyfe. I
<pb facs="tcp:4362:15"/>
praye you, maſter Chriſpine, what ſpirite ment Chriſte here? What lyfe ſpeaketh he of? Can ther any man bring out of hys breaſt, either by writting, preachinge or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe teacheinge, or ſpeakeinge, the ſentence of the holie ſpirite wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out goddes worde? Is not the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or worde of the holye gooſte the worde of God? Is it not to be vnſterſtand of the lyueynge fayth that the holy goſte worketh in the ſoule of man in beleuing the word Is not the ſcriptur called the two edged ſworde? Is it not alſo called the ſworde of the ſpirite? Maye ye ſeparate the ſpirite from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſeynge he calleth them ſpirit and lyfe? I thynke not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No more than heate can be ſeparated from fire. Why then in the name of the holye gooſte, do you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Chriſte? The churche, you ſaye, muſt be iudge, and the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſte be wytneſſe onlye. So
<pb facs="tcp:4362:15"/>
muſt Chriſte be inferioure to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For I am ſure you wyll not denye but theſe holye fathers, which you cal the church, were &amp; be men. And thoſe you ſaye muſt be the iudges. And Chriſte to be the worde and promiſe of the father, he hymſelfe wytneſſeth ſayeinge. I am that I ſaye vnto you, and hym you make but a witneſſe or iudge. Therefore I ſaye your churche is to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. As toucheynge the true ſpoſe and catholyke, churche of Chriſte, which are verye membres of hys bodye, and he the head: this churche hath ſo muche authoritie as the ſcripture geueth them, and take vpon them no more for the ſcripture and they are one, and for the ſcripture they ieoparde theyr liues, as many haue done, whome you and your forfathers, biſhopes and prelates haue alwayes put to dath. Who perſecuted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets and put them to death. Who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb facs="tcp:4362:16"/>
Chriſte to the croſſe? Whoe the Apoſtles wyth manye othere holy men? Were they not byſhops and prelates of the churche? Howe manye godlye preachers wyth other good ſoules, hath the byſhop of Rome put to death by the helpe of prelates in diuers contries ſyth he came to the ſupremitye, and beareynge a rule ouer kynges and emperours? Hath there not ben ſome put to death here in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wythin theſe .xx. yeres, for ſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge agaynſte the Pops pardons and pylgrymages, wyth ſuche lyke abuſes? Was not the Pope chiefe of theſe holye fathers, whom you cal holye churche, and woulde haue them iudges? But I knowe what you meane. You would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwad the multitude, that you and youre churche, be the verye true churche, and haue the holye gooſte and that what ſo euer you do is well. But whereby do ye perſwad
<pb facs="tcp:4362:16"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? By olde cuſtome (for you haue nothynge elſe) and longe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of tyme, the whyche if you coulde beate in to the heades of the communaltye: your reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of thynges that are amyſſe, ſhoulde be as you luſte. But mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſpyne, if you were not in darckeneſſe you coulde not refuſe the light. Chriſt ſayth, if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in my worde: then are you mi verye Diſciples, and ye may know the trueth, and the trueth ſhall make you fre.</p>
            <p>But he that refuſeth me, and receyueth not my wordes hath one alredye that iudgeth hym the worde that I haue ſpoken, ſhall iudge hym in the laſte daye. Beholde, Chriſte ſayeth hys worde ſhal be iudge. All that be of Chriſt, heare Chriſtes wordes.</p>
            <p>Mayſter Chriſpyne, my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere is longer then I thoughe it ſhould haue ben, howe it ſhal lyke

            <p>But if he were able to defend it that he hadde preached, whye ſhoulde he feare to wryte to the defence of the ſame? Wherfore, ſeinge he hath receyued my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, kepeth it, and wyl not write agayne, and yet blameth and fyndeth diuers fautes in it: why ſhoulde he be greued wyth me, for ſpreadeynge a broode myne owne doynges, to vtter myne owne ſecretes. And where as he was offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded wyth me (although I haue not, nor wyll laye anye ſuch priuate communicacion to anye mans charge, ſpecially of myne owne ſeekynge) yet I ſaye I muſte declare my meaneinge more playnely, in thoſe thynges

whyche he is ſo muche offended wythall, to thentente that no ſtublynge ſtocke be purpoſely layed in my brothers waye, that he ſhoulde not vnderſtande the trueth and prayſe God.

For in thys he put me to my trumpe, becauſe I aſked him in my letter what difference was betwene ſcripture wrytten, and ſcripture ſpoken. Nowe truth it is, that accordyng to the Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the word, which cometh of Scribo, and ſo to <hi>Scriptura</hi>: it can not be called Scripture, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be written. And ſo euerye thynge written, maye be called

And in that ſentence, we ſhall fynde no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the bible and Robyn hod, by this name ſcripture, for both maye be called ſcripture I ſaye, after the verie nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word Lo heare haue you an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of ſophiſtri.

The ſcribes and phariſes in Chriſtes tyme (by lyke) had not learned their ſophiſtrie or els thei wer not ſo curiouſe as our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be.
