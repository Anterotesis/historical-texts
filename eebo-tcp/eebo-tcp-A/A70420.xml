            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have of late been in a woundy pudder and tattle about
your Election of <hi>Sheriffs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Reaſon why the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try applauds the Cities Choice.</note> The <hi>King,</hi> we thank him,
chuſes ours to our great content and quiet; but it zeems
it's your <hi>right</hi> and <hi>property</hi> to chuſe yours; and we
commend you for being ſo ſtout and ſtickling to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
your <hi>Priviledges:</hi> Nor was it a little joy to us to hear how ſucceſsful
you were in carrying the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and that your <hi>Battel</hi> and <hi>Victory</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſuch <hi>Houting</hi> and <hi>Shouting,</hi> and <hi>flouriſhing</hi> of <hi>Handkerchiefs,</hi>
that the Gyants in Yeild-Hall never ſaw the like in all their born.</p>
            <p>We know not well what men you have choſen,<note place="margin">It is no matter who the City chooſes for Sheriffs, ſo they are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and wealthy.</note> nor do we much care
what they <hi>are,</hi> or what they have <hi>been,</hi> or what they will <hi>be;</hi> or what
Party they are <hi>of,</hi> as long as they have money enough to qualifie them
for the <hi>Office:</hi> But this we hope, <hi>they are</hi> men <hi>for</hi> the <hi>purpoſe, and will
ſtand</hi> ſtiffly up to preſerve our Kings <hi>Life,</hi> Property, and Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And then bleſs <hi>me,</hi> and my <hi>Dun Cow,</hi> we care not a Fig for all
the Papiſts in the World.</p>
            <p>For as ſilly a <hi>Clown</hi> as <hi>I</hi> am,<note place="margin">It is very irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to change Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſm for Popery.</note> I love my <hi>Liberty</hi> and my <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
and would the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Agents had been Poxt and bepiſt when
they ſeduced any of our <hi>Volk</hi> to <hi>Popery:</hi> And were I <hi>Heir</hi> to a Crown,
the old Canting Rogue the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be <hi>hang'd</hi> before he ſhould <hi>wheedle</hi>
me out of it, with the promiſe of giving me a <hi>Heavenly</hi> one for it, becauſe
I know he hath nothing to do there. And if I were the <hi>Son</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> that
was murthered by his <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Contrivance,</hi> I would ſee him at the
Devil, before he ſhould bubble me into his Religion, for then I muſt believe
that his killing my <hi>Father</hi> was no murder, and that they <hi>died</hi> wrongfully
who were <hi>Executed</hi> for having a hand in his <hi>Death.</hi> For our <hi>Parſon</hi> hath
often told us, that the Pope and his Jeſuits hold it lawful to poyſon or ſtab,
or make away Kings, that are Hereticks or Excommunicate. <hi>The Duce
take ſuch a Religion,</hi> and a <hi>Bots</hi> on all <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Traytors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hang me like a Dog if I am not as great a lover of my Proteſtant
Religion as any of you all.<note place="margin">Eſpecially if a man have been bred up in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and is heir to a good Eſtate.</note> For my <hi>Grand-father,</hi> and my <hi>Father</hi> which
begot me, and bred me up in it, were very good <hi>Scholards,</hi> and could
write and read, and they always told me, that <hi>I could not have learnt a
better</hi> Religion in the World, for it taught me to be a true Chriſtian, a good
Man, and a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> to the King, <hi>God bleſs him.</hi> Beſides, I am poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of vour or vive Cloſes, which formerly belonged to an Abby, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will loſe my Londs, I will cut the Popes throat. <hi>Zookes,</hi> I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
change my Religion for that, which will kill my <hi>King,</hi> and rob me of
my <hi>Eſtate.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104219:2"/>
But now Mr. <hi>City</hi> I muſt tell your Worſhip,<note place="margin">The impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the City in calling the Church of <hi>England</hi> men Proteſtants in Maſquerade Or ſaying that they are Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that ſome <hi>Gentry-Volk</hi> of
your Town tell us ſtrange Stories of you, how that you make a woundy
noiſe and buzzle in glorying of your late gained <hi>Victory,</hi> and that you
Proudly and Inſolently call all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that go to <hi>Church,</hi> by the
names of <hi>Church-Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Popiſhly affected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zump!</hi> what do you mean to do? Are you for running down the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot, and will you now diſoblige and loſe the beſt <hi>friends</hi> that ever
you had, or will have, for carrying on ſuch a Cauſe. Did ever men <hi>Write</hi>
and <hi>ſpeak, Preach</hi> and <hi>Diſpute</hi> againſt the Whore of <hi>Babilon</hi> at that Rate,
and with ſuch Succeſs as the <hi>Parſons</hi> of our Country do? And will you call
theſe men <hi>Church-Papiſts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would a <hi>Bliſter</hi> had been on that worſhipful <hi>Godfathers</hi> tongue, that gave
the name of Proteſtants in <hi>Maſquerade</hi> to our honeſt Church of <hi>England</hi> men.
I am ſure whatever the word ſignifies, he meant no good by it: And you
cannot imagine how much we <hi>ſtomach</hi> the Word, ſince we now underſtand
it; for ſay the Learned, the firſt Syllable of <hi>Maſquerade</hi> is <hi>Maſs,</hi> and <hi>Maſs</hi> is
a Popiſh word, <hi>Ergo, Maſquerade Proteſtant</hi> is a <hi>Popiſh Proteſtant:</hi> a moſt
ridiculous nonſenſical Invention, to render odious all thoſe that worſhip God
in their Pariſh Churches. What if we in retort ſhould ſay, that a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> is
a <hi>Popiſh Presbyterian,</hi> and a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is a <hi>Proteſtant Jeſuit?</hi> I think this
would not be ſo abſurd, as your calling the Church of <hi>England-men Popiſh
Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner did our <hi>Church-wardens</hi> and <hi>Zideſmen</hi> hear that you,<note place="margin">Country Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Sidemen can prove out of the Book of Martyrs, and the Statute Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are the beſt and trueſt ſort of Proteſtants.</note> Mr. <hi>City,</hi>
called all them that went to Church, by the names of <hi>Popiſhly Affected,</hi> and
<hi>Proteſtants in Maſquerade,</hi> but preſently they went and ſearched the <hi>Book</hi> of
<hi>Martyrs</hi> that was chained to a Desk in the corner of the Church, and there
they found, that the people that were <hi>burnt,</hi> and <hi>hang'd,</hi> and <hi>executed</hi> in the
bloody Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were thoſe that firſt <hi>modell'd</hi> and <hi>compiled</hi>
our Proteſtant Religion in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, or which profeſſed
and practiſed the outward Form of it in their Publick Churches or private
Families.</p>
            <p>Nay one of our <hi>Zideſmen,</hi> a <hi>parlous</hi> fellow at the Statute Book, hath often
told our Pariſhioners, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi>
were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and that in their Reigns the ſtrongeſt and beſt <hi>Laws</hi> againſt
Popery, and for the Eſtabliſhment and Preſervation of the true Proteſtant
<hi>Religion</hi> were made by ſuch men, that went conſtantly to our <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi>
to worſhip God in the ſame manner that we do in our <hi>Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And were theſe men then, both <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>honeſt</hi> Proteſtants,
and now muſt we be call'd <hi>Popiſhly Affected,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants in Maſquerade,</hi>
becauſe we worſhip God after their Example, and according to the Laws
which they made? A <hi>Peaſcod</hi> on theſe villanous <hi>Nicknames;</hi> for you could
not have done a greater <hi>injury</hi> to your ſelves, nor a greater <hi>kindneſs</hi> to the
Popiſh Plot, than by vilifying that Church which the Papiſt <hi>hates,</hi> and
would rejoice to ſee <hi>ruined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Advice to leave off Nicknames.</note> 
               <hi>come,</hi> leave your madneſs and fooling, and learn to be ſober and
wiſe: for a <hi>Gentry man</hi> in our <hi>Town</hi> hath often ſaid, that they are the true
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, who profeſs and practiſe that Proteſtant Religion which
was eſtabliſhed by Law in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and
King <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be <hi>true</hi> which we hear,<note place="margin">Or elſe your Sheriffs Elect are Proteſtants in Maſquerade and Popiſhly Affected.</note> that your <hi>Sheriffs Elect</hi> have lately been
at one of your Pariſh Churches, to hear <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and receive the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
according to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> then by your leave, Mr. <hi>City,</hi>
and according to your own Argument, you have choſen two Sheriffs that are
<hi>Popiſhly Affected,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants in Maſquerade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, Sir, If you have a mind to weaken the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Proteſtantiſm in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104219:2"/>
cutting off from you the beſt and greateſt part of the Nation by ſuch <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous

<hi>blows</hi> and <hi>bloody Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you have a longing after a <hi>Holy War,</hi>

keep your Armies within your Lines of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> as we call them.
You have a <hi>Magazine</hi> of Arms, and a <hi>Bank</hi> of Money within your ſelf. And
therefore if you have a mind to fight, Draw your <hi>Parties</hi> out every morning
to <hi>Mile-End-Green, Moorfields,</hi> or <hi>Iſlington;</hi> there let them <hi>combat</hi> all day, and
at night receive them that come off <hi>alive</hi> into your own <hi>quarters:</hi> But be
ſure you march not one foot out of the Lines of <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſhould you come once more into our Parts with your <hi>Eſſex</hi>-Garters,<note place="margin">The Country unfit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Army.</note>
               <hi>Orange</hi> coloured Scarfs, with great <hi>Gold Fringe</hi> at the end of them, you are
like to have cold <hi>Entertainment,</hi> and no <hi>Lodging:</hi> for now we have no

            <p>Nay our very <hi>women</hi> are grown ſtark mad to hear that there is any cauſe to

               <note place="margin">The Country unwilling.</note> becauſe that they know upon experience that they ſhall

            <p>And I have heard three or vour of our <hi>Gentry Volk</hi> that wear <hi>Velvet

And then the Stile of our <hi>Petitions</hi> will be, <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty,

            </p>
            <p>Nor will your Worſhip,<note place="margin">The City utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done if they ſet up an Army.</note> Mr. <hi>City,</hi> fare any better, for you ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

and <hi>Sequeſtrators,</hi> and thoſe that were concerned in <hi>Crown</hi>

            <p>Perhaps Mr. <hi>City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The City per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps doth not intend Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> you are not now deſigning ſuch a <hi>thing</hi> as this, and

            </p>
            <p>No doubt,<note place="margin">But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts will drive them to it, unleſs ſpeedily and prudently prevented.</note> but very good and honeſt men were concern'd in thoſe unhappy
affairs of <hi>Vorty,</hi> and <hi>Vorty one;</hi> and had no other inteniton at firſt, but to
remove or redreſs ſome grievances which they then zaid were in Church
and State: Yet when theſe good men went to <hi>Reformation,</hi> how ſoon were
they carried off from the Jack they aimed at, by an <hi>undiſcernable</hi> byaſs that
was in the <hi>Bowl,</hi> and <hi>unexpected rub</hi> in the way. And then by the wiles
and ſtratagems of <hi>Jeſuited Polititians,</hi> how ſtrangely were they carried to
all manner of <hi>extravagancies;</hi> inſomuch that they found they could not be
ſafe, without being the monſters of Wickedneſs and Villany? And the ſame
