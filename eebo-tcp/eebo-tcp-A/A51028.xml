            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. ROTHERHAM's Caſe AT THE Committee of Elections and Priviledges, the Eighth of <hi>December,</hi> Concerning the Election of St. <hi>EDM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDS-B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT was agreed, that if all the Burgeſſes had right to Elect, then Sir <hi>Thomas Cullum</hi> deceaſed, and Mr. <hi>Rotherham,</hi> were duely Elected; but if a ſelect number onely, [had right by a Grant 12 <hi>Jac.</hi>] then Sir <hi>Thomas Harvey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jermyn</hi> were duely Elected.</p>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion was, Whether St. <hi>Edmunds</hi> is a Burrough by Preſcription?</p>
            <p>To prove it ſo, was urged, That <hi>H.</hi> 1. granted to the Burgeſſes of the Burrough of <hi>Bury</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Four Writs to chuſe, upon which St. <hi>Edmund</hi> is indorſed among other Burroughs which ſend Burgeſſes, and a <hi>Mandavi Ballivo</hi> returned upon one, in 30 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and upon another 34 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Prec. Edm.</hi> among other Burroughs, and the like 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and the like 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. but no Return; and Chriſt-Church in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Heydon</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> had but one Precept to either, and no Return till lately, and yet they ſend Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>A Writ directed to the Alderman of St. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> which recites, That the <hi>Guild-hall</hi> was uſed for chuſing the Aldermen <hi>per communitatem villae,</hi> and for collecting the Kings Tenths and Fifteens.<note place="margin">1 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The King by his Letters-Pattens recites, That it is an ancient Burrough and had divers Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by Preſcription.<note place="margin">12 <hi>Jac.</hi>

               </label> Precepts (to chuſe) are Evidence of Right, and they could not chuſe after 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. for in that year there was an Agreement between the Abbot and the men of <hi>Bury</hi> which recites, The Abbot had recovered 140000<hi>l.</hi> againſt them in three Writs, of which at the Kings Entreaty, he forgave 122333<hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and forgave 10000<hi>l.</hi> more upon condition they ſhould never reverſe the Judgments, nor implead the Jury, nor any others, by reaſon of the Premiſes; And if they nor their Succeſſors neither claim nor maintain any communality in the ſaid Will, then he forgave the Reſidue, being 7666 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> otherwiſe Execution might be ſued of 17666 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and thereupon they acknowledge and grant for them and their Succeſſors, That they neither have nor claim, nor might for the future claim any Community: after which they durſt not meet as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, much leſs chuſe Burgeſſes. But this was reſolved in the Negative by 54 againſt 48.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> Admitting it be a Corporation newly created, whether the King by his Grant can reſtrain the number of Electors?</p>
            <p>The King recites, That <hi>Bury</hi> is an ancient Burrough, and they ſhall be known by the name of <hi>Alderman</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi>; and that there ſhall be 12 capital Burgeſſes, and named them, and 24 of the Common-Council, and named them, and calls them <hi>Primos &amp; Modernos,</hi> &amp;c. and upon the death of any of them, the major part of the Survivers to chuſe others.<note place="margin">4 <hi>Jac.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The King grants to the Alderman and Burgeſſes, That there ſhall be two Burgeſſes in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough of St. <hi>Edmunds,</hi> and that the major part of Aldermen and capital Burgeſſes, and Burgeſſes of the Common-Council, ſhall chuſe them; and the Burgeſſes ſo choſen ſhall ſend, and they ſhall ſtay at the Parliament at the charges of the Burrough and Inhabitants.<note place="margin">12 <hi>Jac.</hi>
               </note> It was urged that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive Clauſe is void, and the whole Burrough which is to bear the Charge, ought to chuſe; for though as to private concerns of Corporations created by the King, he may reſtrain them as he pleaſes, yet he cannot in their Choice of Burgeſſes, which concerns the Legiſlative power: for if he can make new Corporations with ſuch Clauſes, then admit the King ſhould create 300 ſuch, and one of his naming to chuſe them, there would be 600 in effect of the Kings naming, then the King can make as many Lords as he pleaſes; the conſequences whereof is plain: but it was agreed, that by Preſcription Freemen, owners of Burgage-houſes, or other ſelect number of men, may chuſe, and do ſo legally:
