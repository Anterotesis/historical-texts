            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been allowed the Liberty of Peruſing the following <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> at my own Lodging; I found my ſelf ſtrongly tempted, by the Strangeneſs of the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in it, to venture to Releaſe it: The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I had of the <hi>Author's</hi> Inclination to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> forbidding me to deſpair of his pardon, if the ſame diſpoſition prevail'd with me, to make the Curious Partakers with me of ſo Surpriſing a Piece of <hi>Philoſophical

News.</hi> And, though it ſufficiently appear'd, that the inſuing Conference was but a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of a larger <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> yet, conſidering, that this Part conſiſts chiefly, not to ſay only, of a <hi>Narrative;</hi> which (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſtands upon its own legs, without any need of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any thing that was deliver'd before; I thought it was no great Venture, nor Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, to let it come abroad by it ſelf. And, I the leſs ſcrupled to make this Publication, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found, that the Honorable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> confeſſes himfelf to be Fully Satisfied of the Truth, of as much of the Matter of Fact, as delivers the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of the Tryal; the Truth whereof was further Confirm'd to me, by the Teſtimony, and Particular Account, which that moſt Learned and Experienc'd <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,</hi> who was Aſsistant to <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Experiment, and with whom I have the honor to be Acquainted (being now in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> gave me with his own Mouth, of all the Circumſtances of the Tryal. And, where the
<pb facs="tcp:42645:3"/>
Truth of that ſhall be once Granted, there is little cauſe to doubt, that the Novelty of the thing will ſufficiently Indear the Relation: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe that are ſtudious of the <hi>Higher Arcana</hi> of the <hi>Hermetick Philoſophy.</hi> For, moſt of the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> here mention'd, will probably ſeem wholly new, not only to vulgar <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> but alſo to the greateſt part of the more knowing <hi>Spagyriſts,</hi> and <hi>Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> themſelves: none of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Authors, as far as I can remember, having taken notice of ſuch an <hi>Anti-Elixir.</hi> And, though <hi>Pyrophilus's</hi> Scrupulouſneſs (which makes him very unwilling to ſpeak the utmoſt of a thing) allowes it to be a Deterioration into an Imperfect Mettal onely; yet, to tell the truth, I think it was more Imbas'd than ſo; for the part left of it (and kept for ſome farther Diſcoveries) which I once got a ſight of, looks more like a <hi>Mineral,</hi> or <hi>Marchaſite,</hi> then like any <hi>Imperfect Mettal:</hi> and therefore this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation is not the ſame, but much greater,
<pb facs="tcp:42645:4"/>
than that which <hi>Lullius</hi> doth intimate in ſome places. Theſe Conſiderations make me preſume it will eaſily be granted, That the Effects of this <hi>Anti-Philoſophers Stone,</hi> as I think it may not unfitly be call'd., will not only ſeem very <hi>ſtrange</hi> to <hi>Hermetick,</hi> as well as other <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> but may prove very <hi>Inſtructive</hi> to Speculative Wits; eſpecially if <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> ſhall pleaſe to acquaint them with that more odd <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> which he Mentions darkly in the Cloſe of his <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>

            <head>AN Hiſtorical Account OF THE DEGRADATION OF GOLD BY AN Anti-Elixir.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the whole Company had, as it were by Common Conſent, continued ſilent for ſome time, which others ſpent in Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Preceding <hi>Conference,</hi> and <hi>Pyrophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> in the Conſideration of what he was about to Deliver; this <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> at length ſtood up, and Addreſſing himſelf to the reſt, <q>I hope, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> ſayes he, that what has been already Diſcourſed, has Inclin'd, if not Perſwaded you to Think,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42645:5"/>
That the Exaltation, or Change of other <hi>Metals</hi> into <hi>Gold,</hi> is not a thing Abſolutely Impoſſible; and, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I cannot remove all your Doubts, and Objections, or my own, by being able to Affirm to you, That I have with my own hands made Projection (as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are wont to call the Sudden Tranſmutation made by a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Admirable <hi>Elixir)</hi> yet I can Confirm much of what hath been Argued for the Poſſibility of ſuch a ſudden Change of a Metalline Body, by a Way, which, I preſume, will ſurprize you. For, to make it more credible, that other Metals are capable of being Graduated, or Exalted into Gold <hi>by way of Projection;</hi> I will Relate to you, that <hi>by the like way,</hi> Gold has been Degraded, or Imbaſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Novelty of this <hi>Preamble</hi> having much ſurpriſed the Auditory, at length, <hi>Simplicius,</hi> with a diſdainful Smile, told <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> 
               <q>That the Company would have much thanked him, if he could have aſſured them, That he had ſeen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mettal Exalted into Gold; but, that to find a way of ſpoiling Gold, was not onely an Uſeleſs Diſcovery, but a Prejudicial Practice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> was going to make ſome Return to this <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> when he was prevented by <hi>Aristander;</hi> who, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to <hi>Simplicius,</hi> told him, with a Countenance and Tone that argued ſome diſpleaſure; <q>If <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> had been Diſcourſing to a Company of Goldſmiths, or of Merchants, your ſevere Reflection upon what he ſaid would have been proper: but, you might well have forborn it, if you had conſidered, as I ſuppoſe he did, that he was ſpeaking to an Aſſembly of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> who are wont to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Experiments, not as they inrich Mens Purſes, but their Brains, and think Knowledge eſpecially of uncommon things very deſirable, even when 'tis not accompanyed with any other thing, than the Light that ſtill attends it, and indears it. It hath been thought an Uſeful Secret, by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42645:5"/>
a kind of Retrogradation to turn Tin and Lead into brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, like the Ores of thoſe Metals. And if I thought it proper, I could ſhew, that ſuch a change might be of uſe in the Inveſtigation of the Nature of thoſe Metals, beſides the practical uſe that I know may be made of it. To find the Nature of Wine, we are aſſiſted, not only by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of obtaining from it a Spirit; but by the ways of readily turning it into Vinegar: the knowledge of which ways hath not been deſpiſed by Chymiſts or Phyſitians, and hath at <hi>Paris,</hi> and divers other places, ſet up a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Trade. 'Tis well known that divers eminent <hi>Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts</hi> have reckon'd amongſt their higheſt <hi>Arcana</hi> the ways by which they pretended, (and I fear did but pretend) to Extract the Mercury of Gold, and conſequently <hi>deſtroy</hi> that Metal; and 'twere not hard to ſhew by particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that all the Experiments wherein Bodies are in ſome reſpects deteriorated, are not without diſtinction to be rejected or deſpis'd; ſince in ſome of them, the Light they may afford may more than countervail the Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſmall quantity of matter, though it be Gold it ſelf. And indeed, (continues he) if we will conſider things as Philoſophers, and look upon them as Nature hath made them, not as Opinion hath diſguiſed them; the Prerogatives and uſefulneſs of Gold, in compariſon of other Metals, is nothing near ſo great as Alchymiſts and Uſurers imagine. For, as it is true, that Gold is more ponderous, and more fix'd, and perhaps more difficult to be ſpoiled, than Iron; yet theſe qualities (whereof the firſt makes it burthenſom, and the two others ſerve chiefly but to diſtinguiſh the true from counterfeit) are ſo balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the hardneſs, ſtiffneſs, ſpringineſs, and other uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful qualities of Iron; that if thoſe two Metals I ſpeak of, (Gold and Iron) were equally plentiful in the World, it is ſcarce to be doubted, but that Men would prefer the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42645:6"/>
more uſeful before the more ſplendid, conſidering how much worſe it were for Mankind to want Hatchets, and Knives and Swords, than Coin and Plate? Wherefore, (concludes he) I think <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> ought to be both deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and incouraged to go on with his intended Diſcourſe, ſince whether Gold be or not be the Beſt of Metals; an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that it may be degraded, may prove a Novelty very Inſtructive, and perhaps more ſo than the Tranſmutation of a baſer Metal into a Nobler. For I remember it hath long paſs'd for a Maxim among Chymical Philoſophers, That <hi>Facilius eſt aurum conſtruere quam deſtruere:</hi> And whatever becomes of that, 'tis certain that Gold being the cloſeſt, the conſtanteſt, and the leaſt deſtructible of Metals, to be able to work a notable and almoſt <hi>Eſſential change</hi> in ſuch a Body, (though, by detereorating it) is more than to work a <hi>like change,</hi> (though in popular eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the better) in any Metal leſs indiſpoſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit alterations, eſpecially in ſuch an one as <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, by telling us, that 'twas made by <hi>Way of Projection,</hi> and conſequently by a very ſmall proportion of active matter; whereas the deſtructions that vulgar Chymiſts pretend to make of Gold, are wont to be attempted to be made by conſiderable proportions of Corroſive <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums,</hi> or other fretting Bodies; and even theſe, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews to be uſually too weak to <hi>ruine,</hi> though ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times they may much <hi>diſguiſe</hi> the moſt Stable Texture of Gold. <hi>Cuncta adeo miris illic complexibus haerent.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> perceiving by ſeveral ſigns that he needed not add any thing of Apologetical to what <hi>Arriſtander</hi> had already ſaid for him, reſumed his Diſcourſe, by ſaying, <q>I was go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, Gentlemen, when <hi>Simplicius</hi> diverted me, to tell you That looking upon the Vulgar Objections that have been wont to be fram'd againſt the poſſibility of Metalline Tranſmutations, from the Authority and Prejudices of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42645:6"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the School-Philoſophers, as Arguments that in ſuch an Aſſembly as this need not now be ſolemnly diſcuſs'd; I conſider that the <hi>difficulties</hi> that really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be call'd ſo, and are of weight even with Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Philoſophers, and Judicious Naturaliſts, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the great change that muſt be wrought by the <hi>Elixir,</hi> (if there be ſuch an Agent) is effected upon Bodies of ſo ſtable and almoſt immutable a Nature as Metals. <hi>Next,</hi> That this great change is ſaid to be brought to paſs in a very ſhort time. <hi>And thirdly,</hi> (which is yet more ſtrange) That this great and ſuddain alteration is ſaid to be effected by a very ſmall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps inconſiderable, proportion of the tranſmuting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To which <hi>three</hi> grand difficulties, I ſhall add <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> that to me appears, and perhaps will ſeem to divers of the new Philoſophers, worthy to be lookt upon as a <hi>fourth,</hi> namely, The notable change that muſt by a real tranſmutation be made in the Specifick Gravity of the matter wrought upon: which difficulty I therefore think not unworthy to be added to the reſt, becauſe upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tryals of my own and other men, I have found no known quality of Gold, (as its colour, malleableneſs, fixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the like) ſo difficult, if not ſo impoſſible, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into any other Metalline Matter, as the great Specifick Gravity that is peculiar to Gold.

               <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> having at this part of his Diſcourſe made a ſhort pawſe to take breath, <hi>Crattippus</hi> took occaſion from his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ſay to him, <q>I preſume, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed by very few of theſe Gentlemen, if I tell you that the company is impatient to hear the Narrative of your Experiment, and that if it do ſo much as probably make out the particulars you have been mentioning, you will in likelyhood <hi>perſwade most</hi> of them, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>oblige</hi> them <hi>all.</hi> I ſhall therefore on their behalf as well as my own, ſollicite you to haſten to the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of a Diſcourſe that is ſo like to gratifie our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Company having by their unanimous ſilence, teſtified their approbation of what <hi>Crattippus</hi> had ſaid; and appearing more than ordinarily attentive,</p>
            <p>As I was one day abroad; ſaith <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to return vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits to my Friends, I was by a happy Providence (for it was beſide my firſt Intention) directed to make one to an Ingenious Foreigner, with whom a few that I had received from him, had given me ſome little acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this Gentleman and I were diſcourſing together of ſeveral matters, there came in to viſit him a ſtranger, whom I had but once ſeen before; and though that were in a promiſcuous company, yet he addreſſed himſelf to me in a way that quickly ſatisfied me of the greatneſs of his Civility; which he ſoon after alſo did of that of his Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42645:7"/>
For the <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> in whoſe Lodgings we met, having (to gratifie me) put him upon the diſcourſe of his Voyages; the curious ſtranger entertained us an hour or two with pertinent and judicious Anſwers to the Queſtions I askt him-about places ſo remote, or ſo much within Land, that I had not met with any of our Engliſh Navigators or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers that had penetrated ſo far as to viſit them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found by his diſcourſe that I was like to enjoy ſuch good company but a very little while, (ſince he told me that he came the other day into <hi>England</hi> but to diſpatch a buſineſs which he had already done as far as he could do it, after which he was with ſpeed to return, as (to my trouble) he did to his Patron that ſent him) I made the more haſte to propoſe ſuch Queſtions to him, as I moſt deſired to be ſatisfied about; and among other things, enquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Eaſtern parts he had travers'd, he had met with any Chymiſts; he anſwered me that he had; and that though they were <hi>fewer,</hi> and more <hi>reſerved</hi> than ours, yet he did not find them all leſs <hi>skilful.</hi> And on this occaſion, before he left the Town to go aboard the Ship he was to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; he in a very obliging way put into my hands at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little piece of Paper, folded up; which he ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all that he had left of a rarity he had received from an Eaſtern <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> and which he intimated would give me occaſion both to Remember him, and to exerciſe my thoughts in uncommon Speculations.</p>
            <p>The great delight I took in converſing with a Perſon that had travelled ſo far, and could give me ſo good an account of what he had ſeen, made me ſo much reſent the being ſo ſoon deprived of it, that though I judg'd ſuch a <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> would not, as a great token of his kindneſs, have preſented me a trifle, yet the Preſent did but very imperfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoal me for the loſs of ſo pleaſing and inſtructive a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42645:8"/>
Nevertheleſs, that I might comply with the curioſity he himſelf had excited in me, and know how much I was his Debtor, I reſolved to ſee what it was he had given me, and try whether I could make it do what I thought he <hi>Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> by the help of thoſe few <hi>hints</hi> rather than <hi>directions</hi> how to uſe it, which the parting haſte he was in (or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome other reaſon beſt known to himſelf) confin'd him to give me. But in regard that I could not but think the Experiment would one way or other prove Extraordinary, I thought fit to take a Witneſs or two and an Aſſiſtant in the trying of it; and for that purpoſe made choice of an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Doctor of Phyſick, very well vers'd in the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and copelling of Metals.</p>
            <p>Though the Company (ſays <hi>Heliodorus)</hi> be ſo confident of your ſincerity and warineſs, that they would give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit even to unlikely Experiments, upon your ſingle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; yet we cannot but approve your diſcretion in taking an Aſſiſtant and a Witneſs, becauſe in nice and uncommon Experiments we can ſcarce uſe too much circumſpection, eſpecially when we have not the means of reiterating the tryal: for in ſuch new, as well as difficult caſes, 'tis eaſie even for a clear-ſighted Experimenter to over-look ſome important circumſtance, that a far leſs skilful by-ſtander may take notice of.</p>
            <p>As I have ever judged, (ſaith <hi>Pyrophilus)</hi> that cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a very requiſite qualification for him that would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily make curious Experiments; ſo I thought fit to imploy a more than ordinary meaſure of it, in making a tryal, whoſe event I imagined might prove odd enough. And therefore having ſeveral times obſerved that ſome men are prepoſſeſſed, by having a particular Expectation rais'd in them, and are inclined to think that they <hi>do ſee</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen which they think they <hi>ſhould</hi> ſee happen; I reſolved to obviate this prejudication as much as innocently I could,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42645:8"/>
and (without telling him any thing but the <hi>truth,</hi> to which Philoſophy as well as Religion obliges us to be ſtrictly loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) I told him but thus much of the truth, that I expected that a ſmall proportion of a Powder preſented me by a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> would give a Brittleneſs to the moſt flexible and malleable of Metals, Gold it ſelf. Which change I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he judged ſo conſiderable and unlikely to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was greedy of ſeeing it ſeverely try'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus prepared him not to look for all that I my ſelf expected, I cautiouſly opened the Paper I lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but was both ſurprized and troubled, (as he alſo was) to find in it ſo very little Powder, that in ſtead of two differing tryals that I deſigned to make with it, there ſeem'd very ſmall hope left that it would ſerve for one, (and that but an imperfect one neither.) For there was ſo very little Powder, that we could ſcarce ſee the colour of it, (ſave that as far as I could judge it was of a darkiſh Red) and we thought it not only dangerous, but uſeleſs to attempt to weigh it, in regard we might eaſily loſe it by putting it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and out of the Balance; and the Weights we had were not ſmall enough for ſo deſpicable a quantity of matter, which in words I eſtimated at an eighth part of a Grain: but my Aſſiſtant, (whoſe conjecture I confeſs my thoughts inclin'd to prefer) would allow it to be at moſt but a tenth part of a Grain. Wherefore ſeeing the utmoſt we could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope to do with ſo very little Powder, was to make <hi>one</hi> tryal with it, we weighed out in differing Balances two Drams of Gold that had been formerly Engliſh Coyn, and that I cauſed by one that I uſually imploy to be <hi>cupell'd</hi> with a ſufficient quantity of Lead, and <hi>quarted,</hi> as they ſpeak, with refin'd Silver, and purg'd <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> to be ſure of the goodneſs of the Gold: theſe two Drams I put into a new Crucible, firſt carefully neal'd, and having brought them to fuſion by the meer action of the fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42645:9"/>
the help of Borax, or any other Additament, (which courſe, though ſomewhat more laborious, than the moſt uſual we took to obviate ſcruples) I put into the well-melted Metal with my own hand the little parcel of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lately mentioned, and continuing the Veſſel in the fire for about a quarter of an hour, that the Powder might have time to defuſe it ſelf every way into the Metal, we poured out the well-melted Gold into another Crucible that I had brought with me, and that had been gradually heated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to prevent cracking. But though from the firſt fuſion of the Metal, to the pouring out, it had turn'd in the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible like ordinary Gold, ſave that once my Aſſiſtant told me he ſaw that for two or three moments it lookt almoſt like an Opale; yet I was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd to find when the matter was grown cold, that though it appear'd upon the Balance that we had not loſt any thing of the weight we put in, yet in ſtead of <hi>fine Gold,</hi> we had a lump of Metal of a dirty colour, and as it were overcaſt with a thin coat, almoſt like <hi>half vitrified Litharge;</hi> and ſomewhat to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the wonder, we perceived that there ſtuck to one ſide of the Crucible a little Globule of Metal that lookt not at all yellowiſh, but like courſe Silver, and the bottom of the Crucible was overlaid with a vitrified ſubſtance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one part was of a tranſparent yellow, and the other of a deep brown, inclining to red; and in this vitrified ſubſtance I could plainly perceive ſticking at leaſt five or ſix little Globules that lookt more like impure Silver than pure Gold. In ſhort, this <hi>ſtuff</hi> look ſo little like <hi>refin'd,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>ordinary, Gold,</hi> that though my Friend did much more than I marvel at this change, yet I confeſs I was ſurpriz'd at it my ſelf. For though in ſome particulars it anſwered what I lookt for, yet in others, it was very differing from that which the Donor of the Powder had, as I thought, given me ground to expect. Whether the cauſe of my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42645:9"/>
were that (as I formerly intimated) this <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s haſte or deſign made him leave me in the dark; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were that finding my ſelf in want of ſufficient dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, I happily pitcht upon ſuch a proportion of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and way of operating, as were proper to make a new Diſcovery, which the excellent Giver of the Powder had not Deſign'd, or perhaps thought of.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at all wonder, ſaith <hi>Cratippus,</hi> either at your Friends amazement, or at your ſurprize, if your further tryals did in any meaſure confirm what the <hi>ſuperficial change</hi> that appeared in your Metal could not but incline you to conjecture.</p>
            <p>You will beſt judge of that (replies <hi>Pyrophilus)</hi> by the account I was going to give you of what we did with our odd Metal. <hi>And Firſt,</hi> having rubb'd it upon a good Touchſtone, whereon we had likewiſe rubb'd a piece of <hi>Coyn'd Silver,</hi> and a piece of <hi>Coyn'd Gold,</hi> we manifeſtly found that the mark left upon the Stone by our Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the marks of the two other Metals, was notoriouſly more like the Touch of the Silver than to that of the Gold. <hi>Next,</hi> having knockt our little lump with a Hammer, it was, (according to my prediction) found brittle, and flew into ſeveral pieces. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (which is more) even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides of thoſe pieces lookt of a baſe dirty colour, like that of Braſs or worſe, for the <hi>fragments</hi> had a far greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to <hi>Bell-Metal,</hi> than either to Gold or to Silver. To which we added this <hi>fourth,</hi> and more conſiderable, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amen; that having carefully weigh'd out one dram of our ſtuff, (reſerving the reſt for trials to be ſuggeſted by <hi>ſecond thoughts)</hi> and put it upon an excellent now and well-neal'd Cupel, with about half a dozen times its weight of Lead, we found, ſomewhat to our wonder, that though it turn'd very well like good Gold, yet it continued in the fire above an hour and an half, (which was twice as long as we expected) and yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42645:10"/>
almoſt to the very laſt the fumes copiouſly aſcended, which ſufficiently argu'd the operation to have been well carried on; and when at laſt it was quite ended, we found the Cupel very ſmooth and intire, but ting'd with a fine Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh Red, (which did ſomewhat ſurprize us) and beſides, the <hi>refined Gold,</hi> there lay upon the cavity of the Cupel ſome dark-coloured recrements, which we concluded to have proceeded from the deteriorated Metal, not from the Lead. But when we came to put our Gold again into the Balance, we found it to weigh only about <hi>fifty three Grains,</hi> and conſequently to have loſt <hi>ſeven;</hi> which yet we found to be fully made up by that little quantity of recrements that I have lately mention'd, whoſe Weight and Fixity, compared with their unpromiſing Colour, did not a little puzzle us, eſpecially becauſe we had not enough either of Them, or of leiſure, to examine their nature. To all which circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I ſhall ſubjoin this, that to prevent any ſcruples that might ariſe touching the <hi>Gold</hi> we imploy'd, I cauſed a dram and a half that had been purpoſely reſerv'd out of the ſame portion with that that had been debaſed; I cauſed this (I ſay) to be in my Aſſiſtants preſence melted by it ſelf, and found it (as I doubted not but I ſhould do) fine and well-coloured Gold.</p>
            <p>I hope you will pardon my curioſity, ſaith <hi>Arriſtander</hi> to the Gentleman that ſpoke laſt, if I ask why you take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the effect of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> upon your <hi>imbaſed Metal?</hi> Your Queſtion, replies <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I confeſs to be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and I am ſomewhat troubled that I can anſwer it but by telling you that we had not at hand any <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> we durſt relie on; which yet I was the leſs troubled at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heretofore ſome <hi>tryals</hi> purpoſely made had inform'd me, that in ſome <hi>Metalline Mixtures</hi> the <hi>Gold</hi> if it were much predominant in quantity, may protect another Metal; (for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Silver)</hi> from being <hi>diſſolved</hi> by that <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> though not from being at all <hi>invaded</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42645:10"/>
There yet remain'd, ſaith <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> one examen more of your odd Metal, which would have ſatisfied me, at leaſt as much as any of the reſt, of its having been notably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd: for if it were altered in its <hi>ſpecifick gravity,</hi> that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity I have always obſerv'd (as I lately perceiv'd you alſo have done) to ſtick ſo cloſe to Gold, that it could not by an additament ſo inconſiderable in point of bulk, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably altered without a notable and almoſt Eſſential change in the texture of the Metal.</p>
            <p>To this pertinent diſcourſe, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> with the reſpect due to a perſon that ſo worthily ſuſtain'd the dignity he had of preſiding in that <hi>choice company,</hi> made this return: I owe you, Sir, my humble thanks for calling upon me to give you an account I might have forgotten, and which is yet of ſo important a thing, that none of the other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of our Experiment ſeem'd to me to deſerve ſo much notice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall now inform you, that having provided my ſelf of all the requiſites to make Hydroſtatical Tryals, (to which perhaps I am not altogether a ſtranger) I carefully weighed in water the <hi>ill-lookt</hi> Maſs, (before it was divided for the coupelling of the above-mentioned dram) and found, to the great confirmation of my former <hi>wonder</hi> and <hi>conjectures,</hi> that in ſtead of weighing about nineteen times as much as a bulk of water, equal to it, its proportion to that liquor was but that of fifteen, and about two thirds to one: ſo that its <hi>ſpecifick gravity</hi> was leſs by about 31/<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>3 than if it had been pure Gold it would have been.</p>
            <p>At the recital of this <hi>notable circumſtance,</hi> ſuperadded to the reſt, the generality of the Company, and the Preſident too, by looking and ſmiling upon one another, expreſs'd themſelves to be as <hi>well delighted</hi> as <hi>ſurpriz'd;</hi> and after the murmuring occaſion'd by the various whiſpers that paſs'd amongſt them, was a little over, <hi>Heliodorus</hi> addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> and told him, I <hi>need not,</hi> and therefore <hi>ſhall

not,</hi> ſtay for an expreſs order from the Company to give you their hearty thanks: for as the <hi>Obliging Stranger</hi> did very much gratifie <hi>you</hi> by the Preſent of his <hi>Wonderful Powder,</hi> ſo you have not a little gratified <hi>us</hi> by ſo <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> a Narrative of the effects of it; and I hope (continues he) that if you have not yet otherwiſe diſpos'd of that part of your <hi>deteriorated Gold</hi> that you did not cupel, you will ſometime or other favour us with a ſight of it.</p>
            <p>I join in this requeſt, ſaid <hi>Crattippus,</hi> as ſoon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Preſident had done ſpeaking, and to facilitate the grant of it, I ſhall not ſcruple to tell <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> he may be confident that the <hi>Degradation</hi> of his <hi>Gold</hi> will not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate</hi> it amongſt Us: ſince if it be allowable for Opinion to ſtamp ſuch a value upon <hi>Old Coyns</hi> and <hi>Medals,</hi> that in the Judgment of good Antiquaries, a ruſty piece of <hi>Braſs</hi> or <hi>Copper,</hi> with a half defaced Image or Inſcription on it, is to be highlier valued than as big a piece of well-ſtampt <hi>Gold;</hi> I ſee not why it ſhould not be lawful for Philoſophers to prize ſuch a lump of <hi>depraved Gold</hi> as yours, before the <hi>fineſt Gold</hi> the Chymiſts or Mintmaſters are wont to afford us. And though I freely grant that ſome old <hi>Copper Medals</hi> are of good uſe in Hiſtory, to keep alive by their <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> the memory of the taking of a Town, or the winning of a Battel; though theſe be but things that almoſt every day are ſome where or other done, yet I think <hi>Pyrophilus</hi>'s imbas'd Metal is much to be preferr'd, as not only <hi>preſerving</hi> the <hi>memory,</hi> but <hi>being an effect</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Victory of Art over Nature, and the conquering of ſuch generally believ'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulties, <hi>as</hi> no Story that I know of gives us an example of.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever <hi>Crattippus</hi> had made a pawſe, <hi>Pyrophilus</hi> to prevent complimental diſcourſe, did in few words tell the Preſident, That his part had been but that of a Relator of matter of Fact, and that therefore he could deſerve but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42645:11"/>
               <hi>little thanks</hi> and <hi>no praiſe</hi> at all; though a good meaſure of both of them were due to the <hi>Obliging Virtuoſo</hi> that had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him the Powder; and in that, the opportunity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with his duty, and his inclination, to ſerve that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Company.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen (ſaith <hi>Arriſtander)</hi> are not perſons among whom modeſty is either <hi>reſtrained</hi> from expreſſing it ſelf, or <hi>conſtrued</hi> according to the Letter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever you have been pleas'd to ſay, the Company cannot but think its ſelf much obliged to you; and I know the obligation would be much increas'd, if you would favor us with your reflections upon the extraordinary Experiment you have been pleaſed to relate to us.</p>
            <p>If, replies <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I had had wherewithal to repeat the Experiment, and vary it according to the hints afforded me by the firſt tryal, I ſhould be leſs unfit to comply with <hi>Arriſtander</hi>'s motion: but the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> are too new and too difficult for me to attempt to unriddle them by the help of ſo ſlender an <hi>information</hi> as a perſon ſo little ſagacious as I could get by a <hi>ſingle tryal;</hi> and though I will not deny that I have had ſome <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I confeſs, ſaith <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> that I think <hi>Pyrophilus</hi>'s wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſerves not only to be <hi>allow'd,</hi> but <hi>imitated;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by my conſent the further diſcourſe of ſo abſtruſe a ſubject, ſhall be deferr'd till we ſhall have had time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly of <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that will be ſure to <hi>imploy</hi> our moſt ſpeculative thoughts, and I fear to <hi>poſe</hi> them too: only we muſt not forget that <hi>Pyrophilus himſelf</hi> ought to be not barely <hi>allow'd,</hi> but <hi>invited</hi> to draw before we riſe, what Corrollaries he thinks fit to propoſe from what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42645:12"/>
The inference, ſaith <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> I meant to make, will not detain you long; having for the main been already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in what you may remember I told you I deſign'd in the mention I was about to make of the now-recited Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. For without launching into difficult Speculations, or making uſe of diſputable Hypotheſes, it ſeems evident enough from the matter of Fact faithfully laid before you, that an Operation <hi>very near,</hi> if not <hi>altogether</hi> as ſtrange as that which is call'd Projection, and in the difficulteſt points much of the ſame nature with it, may ſafely be admitted. For our Experiment plainly ſhews that Gold, though confeſſedly the moſt homogeneous, and the leaſt mutable of Metals, may be in a very ſhort time (perhaps not amounting to many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes) exceedingly <hi>chang'd,</hi> both as to <hi>malleableneſs, colour, homogeniety,</hi> and (which is more) <hi>ſpecifick gravity;</hi> and all this by ſo very inconſiderable a proportion of injected Powder, that ſince the Gold that was wrought on weighed two of our Engliſh drams, and conſequently an hundred and twenty grains, an eaſie computation will aſſure us that the Medicine did thus powerfully act, according to my eſtimate, (which was the modeſteſt) upon near a thouſand times, (for 'twas above nine hundred and fifty times) its weight of Gold, and according to my Aſſiſtants eſtimate, did (as they ſpeak) <hi>go on</hi> upon twelve hundred; ſo that if it were fit to apply to this <hi>Anti-Elixir,</hi> (as I formerly ventur'd to call it) what is ſaid of the true <hi>Elixir</hi> by divers of the Chymical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who will have the virtue of their Stone increas'd in ſuch a proportion, as that at firſt 'twill tranſmute but <hi>ten</hi> times its weight; after the next rotation <hi>an hundred</hi> times, and after the next to that <hi>a thouſand times,</hi> our Powder may in their language be ſtil'd <hi>a Medicine of the third order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Computation, ſaith <hi>Arriſtander,</hi> is very obvious, but the change of ſo great a proportion of Metal is ſo wonderful and unexampled, that I hope we ſhall among other things

learn from it this leſſon, That we ought not to be ſo forward as many men otherwiſe of great parts are wont to be, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing narrow limits to the power of Nature and Art, and in condemning and deriding all thoſe that pretend to, or believe, uncommon things in Chymiſtry, as either (heats or Credulous. And therefore I hope, that though (at leaſt in my opinion) it be very allowable to call Fables, Fables, and to detect and expoſe the Impoſtures or Deceits of ignorant or vain-glorious Pretenders to Chymical Myſteries, yet we ſhall not by too haſty and general cenſures of the ſober and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Indigators of the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Chymiſtry, blemiſh (as much as in us lies) that excellent Art it ſelf, and thereby diſoblige the genuine Sons of it, and divert thoſe that are indeed Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of Noble Secrets, from vouchſafing to gratifie <hi>our</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, as we ſee that one of them did <hi>Pyrophilus</hi>'s, with the <hi>ſight</hi> at leaſt, of ſome of their highly Inſtructive Rarities.</p>
