         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Whilst these Imaginations</hi> run strongly in
my mind, a <hi>sudden drowsiness</hi> sat heavy on
my-Eyes, and as it were compelled me to
repose on <hi>a Grassy Bed, inameld with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
sweets,</hi> and far removed from noise
and clamour, that still reign in places
Populous, where giving way to the soft
Charmer, soon <hi>I fell a sleep, and sleeping
dreamed a Dream.</hi> I dreamed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a Man stood by me, whose Eyes see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
brighter than the Morning Star, more
piercing than the sight of Eagles, on his
Brows sat <hi>Gravity and Wisdom,</hi> and in his
front in mistick Characters understanding

up his voice, and cryed, <hi>The Secreis of the

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52891:6"/>
And when he had cryed, I saw in my
Dream a light spring up, as of <hi>a Burning
Tapor,</hi> whose brightness dazled my Eyes,
<hi>which he taking in his Hand,</hi> moved a soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pace towards a <hi>Spacious City,</hi> whose

Beams, and as he moved by a strang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sympathy, methought he drew me after
him, nor was I displeased, as being much
desirous to see the end, or what the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
(for so I conceived it at first)
could make out of wonder or unusual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.
When coming to the Gates, I
heard a doleful wailing, and looking up
beheld a Woman cloath'd in raggs, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as Famine, for her Eyes were sunk,
her withered Breasts hung down, and on
her faded Cheecks <hi>want</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
their Seals, and after her cry'd
many Infants for their dayly food, but
all in vain, for I perceived she had nought
to feed them with but Tears, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Rivolets.</hi> She had it seems been
round the World to ease her mysery, but
found no relief, for every where the Door
was shut against her, by reason Avarice
her Mortal Enemy, had incenced Mankind
to cast her off, vowing her destruction,
for opposing his incroachments in the
days of old. She passed us, and I looking

continued wandring in the Air, till the

on her Garments, which were made of
the Skins of <hi>Cammelions,</hi> her name was
written in the Colour of an evening Mist,
by which I understood she was <hi>Hope,</hi> and
pondering with my self, I imagined I had
once been familiar with her, but seeing
how she lost her self, in vainly placing
her mind on things below, I thus discanted.

By this time methought we had passed the

of all <hi>Crafts</hi> and <hi>Occupations,</hi> with
every thing desireable for the support of

I was very desirous to know who
it was that like a <hi>Load-stone</hi> drew me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, which <hi>the Man perceiving</hi> by the

out <hi>a Scrole,</hi> and opening it, I read there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
many wonderful things, and conceived
them to be true, because they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
under the Seal of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and upon the
Back-side was written in Letters of Gold
DISCOVERY, which he told me
was his Name, and that <hi>Wisdom</hi> whose
Servant he was, had sent him from the
Land of <hi>knowledge,</hi> to discover the ways
of <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>folly,</hi> who have of late made
many inroads into the Region of <hi>vertue</hi>
and <hi>understanding;</hi> where assisted by <hi>Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
and <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> they have alinated
divers from ways of <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi>
paths now allmost unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and over-grown with Moss,
which in the days of old were wont

to be fill'd with <hi>Iustling Crouds,</hi> who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
contended for the way. Being
thus far satisfied, I was about to give my
opinion concerning his undertaking, and
to inform him what little satisfaction such
a discovery would give the World, as now
it stands, but had not time before in my
<hi>Dream;</hi> I beheld an <hi>Image pale</hi> as Death,
with trembling Steps and fluttering wings,
advancing towards us, deeply sighing and
complaining of the hard usage it had met
with from <hi>Ingratitude, Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,</hi>
with divers others, who for the
good Offices it attemped to do them, had
often put it to torture by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had a long time born in hopes to prevaile
by mild perswasions and meekness, against
such rash proceeding; but in the end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
used worse and worse, and beginning
to complain of such out rages to the Maker
of the World, whose Steward she is. A
Pestilent Fellow called <hi>Atheism,</hi> who has
lately <hi>Invaded Sion,</hi> councelled those with
whom I lived to turn me out of doors,
whose council they gladly Embraced, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their hearts to that degree, that they
became <hi>stones,</hi> which I perceiving and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52891:9"/>
finding I could not live on such Diet, I as
willingly consented to leave e'm, and am
now going to the <hi>Celestial City,</hi> to give an
account of my <hi>Steward-ship,</hi> where I doubt
not but I shall find better reception. Now
whilst I was wondering who this should be
<hi>Discovery</hi> whispers me in the Ear and told
me it was <hi>Conscience;</hi> how <hi>Conscience</hi> said
I, and with that I cryed out, <hi>O Ingrateful

            <p>Now in my Dream methought I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to Embrace her, but like a <hi>shade</hi> she

sease upon all my Chapmen had, and clap him
into the Bilboes to make him sell or mortgage
his Land. She would tell me of <hi>grinding

               <p>She was no fit Companion for us, for

that none of our profession cared
for living by 'em: So we together with
our Brethren of the faculty, got a decree
to banish 'em out of all places where we
were Concerned; and now I believe it

               <p>Now I beheld in my Dream, that they

conceited to be <hi>Sheep-Skin Row,</hi> where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
a man coming out of a dark place
with a Libel in his Mouth, and on it was
Written in a mixture of Letters, <hi>Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
being habited like a Scribe, for his
Coat was Laced with the defrauded Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans

Now I perceived when he Addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the man started to meet a Person at

noon day with a light in his hand, as
doubting it might be <hi>Diogenes</hi> in search of

lay sculking on the other side in a dark

altering his resolves, he came blundering

But now I think further Sir I must
bid you adieu. Oh Dear! I had almost
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52891:14"/>
forgot, I should have been at Mr. <hi>Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
two hours since, to affix a Hand and
Seal to a band of 1000 L. by way of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—Your Servant Sir.</p>
               <p>Now in my Dream I beheld he hasted
towards the Castle of <hi>Deceit,</hi> whereupon
we inquired at Mr. <hi>Simplicities</hi> as we were
directed; but instead of <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi>
we found <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in two wicker Chairs, in great State,
and about them many attendance who
waited by turns, but having no business
with them, we hasted to <hi>Papers-tree,</hi> a
place for many Letters famed through the
World, and there we found a grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sitting in a Volumnious place, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with the labours of 5000 Mortals,
Antient and Modern, here or no where
thought I we may be informed, and by the
information cease our further search, but
my expectation failed, for I found soon
after that the Mans Head was wonderous
Airey, being made up for the most part
of Romance and strange imagination, yet
<hi>Discovery</hi> would inquire, though I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
informed him, he would loose his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
Now at his approach I perceived
the Man was not a little affrighted, for

Author whom he had Hackneyd to death;
but finding his mistake, and recollecting
himself, he pull'd of his Hat, and made
a crindging congie, which gave me op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to discern <hi>Self-Interest,</hi> in large
Characters on his forehead, but <hi>Discovery</hi>
not presently perceiving it, fell to asking
him many Questions, as thus.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Discovery.</speaker>
               <p>Sir does this place call you

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Self-Interest.</speaker>
               <p>To both I answer in the

you?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Disc.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis some thing I want that makes

               <p>If wares you want of this kind

               <p>Now I perceived <hi>Discovery</hi> had a mind
to enter his Cabinet of Rarities as he
term'd it, to make some observations,
which willingness he perceiving, he lead
us into a dark entery, crouded on either
side with Leather and Past-board, where
by the light <hi>Discovery</hi> brought, I beheld
<hi>Rebellious Principles</hi> peep out at one Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Sedition</hi> at an other, <hi>false Doctrine</hi>
stood there Triumphant, and the <hi>Italian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52891:15"/>
Art</hi> of <hi>Poisoning</hi> barefaced, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was
rank'd with the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and old <hi>Hobbs</hi>
with the Evangelists, <hi>Mugletons</hi> Sermons
lurked in private, and the rank Weeds of
<hi>Atheism</hi> reached the ceeling, <hi>Debauchery</hi>
the baen of youth, took up a shelf for her
own conveniency, and <hi>Arian Heresy</hi> was
rampant, on the other side were musty
<hi>Legends,</hi> beautified with the conveniency
of a new Title, promising wonderous
things, though not one word in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
pages, and next them stood <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments</hi>
upon the proprieties of his
Breathren in iniquity, and an <hi>Additional
Impression</hi> in Partner-ship, seal'd with the
Ignorance of his <hi>Coleague.</hi> And for all this
was he taken for a Saint and a <hi>Hero,</hi> but
when as you may perceive the light of <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
came to Scrutenize him, all
prov'd otherwise.</p>
               <p>Now I dreamed that <hi>Discovery</hi> began to
ask him other questions, but especially if
he was acquainted with <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plain-dealing,</hi>
or knew the place of their aboad,
but he protested he was altogither igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, only had read that they were
many years since Familiar Companions
with divers of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and some
few of the <hi>Hermites,</hi> as for himself, he said
he managed his Trade well enough and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52891:15"/>
needed not their assistance, and finding we
were not Chapmen for his turn, he whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a drudg in Petty-coats, and telling

               </p>
               <p>Thus far travelling in vain, me thought
I began to be weary, and intreating <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
to stay a while, sat me down on a
pair of stairs to rest my self, where I had
not been long, but I heard a noise above
accompany'd with divers imperfect mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which at first I took for a <hi>Leet,</hi>
or Court of <hi>Pypouder;</hi> but hearing at the
same time a knocking, and the noise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
of <hi>two pence, three pence, who bids
more.</hi> I verily believe they were exposing
<hi>Honesty</hi> to sale by Inch of Candle, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the lowness of the rate: Desirous
to be informed I intreated <hi>Discovery</hi> to
accompany me into this place of clamour
who consenting, we no sooner came to
the top of the ascent, but we beheld a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitive
Fellow,</hi> with staring Eyes, Hair
tuckt up, and his Mouth drawn from Ear
to Ear, standing in a kind of a Tubb or
<hi>Quakers Pulpit,</hi> with a Book in his Hand,
as if he intended to edifie the People that
were grumbling out their Sentiments,
when all on a sudden opening as loud as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52891:16"/>
                  <hi>Mugleton</hi> in the height of his damning
dayes, and whilst the Auditory stood with
their Mouths at half cock, expecting the
issue of a long preamble, comes to the
Text and cryes, <hi>Here Gentlemen you have

the tediousness of a</hi> Greenland <hi>Voyage.
By this an old Woman of fourscore may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to restore her self to fifteen, and young
Gentlemen who have made over their Estates
by conveyance, find means to wrest them out
of the Hands of a griple Vserer. He that has

               <p>Now in my Dream I beheld they all

Marginal Notes, whereat the buyer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

a Cur that had lost his Tail, here I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observed that when any Book of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
through defect of bidding was likely
to go under rate, the Supervizor of these
fallacies had one at Hand to save it by
bidding higher, or inflaming the bidders
in emulation to each other, advancing it
at it's double value, and if inquiry be
made for whom he Purchases, he has a
name at his Tongues end, pretending a
commission, but all is false, for in the end the
Books return'd from whence it came: Now
in one corner of the Room, I perceived
<hi>Deceit</hi> lay lurking close, but <hi>Folly</hi> flew

prompting the eager multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

feared some danger, clap'd down a Trap-door

               <p>Dreadful! Ay, I'le warrant you

it appeared they were dreadful, for they
then shook the Islands: But I can stay no
longer, yonder comes one whose sight I
must avoid, least he correct and revise me
before I am ready for him.</p>
               <p>Now in my Dream I beheld the man
left us and slunk into a dark Entery, which
it seems was a thorowfare, leading to the
Land of Blackness, so that we saw him no
more: But as <hi>Discovery</hi> conversed with
him, I saw the word <hi>Imprinted</hi> pined on
his sleeve, from whence I conceited him
a <hi>Typographer,</hi> and from that time forward,
named him the <hi>Engin of Dissention.</hi> But
we had not gone far er'e we came into
<hi>Feigning Street,</hi> and this I perceived was
chiefly inhabited by <hi>Hypocricy,</hi> who had a
World of votarys, and a train of green
approv'd Sinners to wait on her when ever
she had a mind to take the Aire, for you
must know this is represented as a Female
Iniquity, though too frequently incident
to either Sex; She's a great enemy to
<hi>Faith,</hi> and the only Sister to <hi>Dissimulation;</hi>
she was dressed in the Habit of a <hi>Nun,</hi>
pretending to the greatest strictness ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
her Cheeks were furrow'd with

sighs she had ever at command, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
now and then would strain a gentle
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52891:19"/>
groan, and would be still reproving Vice
in those that were most vertuous and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
talk much of watching, fasting,
Prayer and Alms; but all this talk was
but in publique to gain Applause or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
for in private, and with those she
durst trust with the Secret, she would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
it all day, and in Adulterous Arms
spend many a night, counting Religion
than a Ceremony, a meer shade: She's
much in fashion w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who having so far mortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that actual sin decays in them, who
then, and not till then wou'd seem Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
But having quite forgot the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
embrace <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> Who is ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

and she serves well enough, if nature ne'r

goes that shadow of a Cloak, and to the
Trade they fall again.</p>
               <p>Whilst these representations were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, I perceived in my dream that
two in <hi>Female form</hi> approach'd us, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as they came: Their habit was grave
and countenance composed demure, their
Eyes fix'd on the ground, their gaite stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52891:22"/>
lifting up my Eyes and finding my self in
a spacious Meadow, I was fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that all that had passed was but a
Dream. The birth of Imagination Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wif'd
by fancy, proceeding from the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings
of the Soul, which in its eternal
Wake makes strange discoveries; but
long these thoughts had not travers'd my
more Capacious understanding, e're sleep
that Emblem of Death courted my Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
afresh, and in his carresses grasped
them so hard that my Sences melted in the
Arms of sweet Repose. When I Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and beheld in my Dream that sundry
Phantasius were triping round me, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting,
<hi>Folly, Iealouzie, Self-conceit, Pride,
Ambition,</hi> and a thousand such like Airey
vanities; but whilst I was making obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
on their many antick shapes and
studdied postures, the Curtain was drawn
before the Queen of <hi>Faryland,</hi> whose
Pallace is called the Castle of <hi>Delusion,</hi> a
strong place, to which many give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up voluntary prisoners, where they
wander from Room to Room; lead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
by the Spirit of <hi>Vncertainty,</hi> till
they fall into the Quagmire of <hi>Dispaire,</hi>
and there they are lost for ever. But
this Sceen being over, and it clearing up
again, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place were before I left of the search, and
fancyed it to be the Town of <hi>Vanity</hi> by
the many representations that tended to
no other effect; scarcely had these thoughts
took place, but looking over my shoulder
I beheld my old Companion <hi>Discovery,</hi> and
was not a little glad I had so luckely stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on him; yet had not time to vaile
my Bonnet and pay my Respects, e're
clapping me on the Cheeks, he whispered
in a soft tone, <hi>Why have you thus unkindly
absented your self in the Dawn of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
seeing there are many wonders in the
Mist of</hi> Deceit (A gloomy Region) <hi>that
are yet to be discovered by the light of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
I blushed at this methought,
and would have replyed, but was hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the unexpected approach of a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
laden with Mutton-Taffata, and
Calves-Skin; at first I supposed him a
Knight Arrant with Shield in his Hand,
but afterwards found him a Past-board
bearer; his Pockets ratled with Gim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracks
of divers devices, and at his Arse
hung dangling a Glew-pot, and a Pipkin
of mouldy Past, many Cording quires with
much Thread; and on the Skirt of his
Doublet stuck a hafted Bodkin, with
long Eyed Needles. Now in my Dream
I wondered who this should be, once I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52891:23"/>
thought it might be <hi>Time,</hi> but perceiving
neither Hour-Glass nor Seith, I took him
to be an Actor in some Farce, who thus
had dressed himself in Redicule to move a
Laughter; but had not guest, long before
<hi>Discovery</hi> obliged him to make a full stop,
though e're he could be steady, he start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like a Huffing Hector at the Salute of a
Serjeant. Yet recollecting himself, cryed
Sir your Business with me; whereupon I
perceived they began to Dialogue as

               <p>Their house Sir, why do you

No no, never conceit it, for I remember
twenty Years agone they were but Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

pay their Chamber rent, their gettings
were so small; and would you have 'em

my Wife lead me such a weary life, till I

               <p>Now in my Dream I beheld we passed
this insiped thing, but had scarce turned
the Corner, before a brisk Fellow bolted
out of a dark Alley, was upon us e're we
was aware on him, and was hung round
with Quires of White and Brown, and
so covered with Parchment, you would
have took him to been in Armour; round
his Neck hung Wax and Wafers; and on
his Crown Quills brustled up in Bundles,
and in his Hands were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Releases, Tickets, Warrants, and a

Pockets strutted with Sand and Ink-Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.
This thought I must be a Scribe,
and we had past inquirey there before to
little purpose, wherefore I was for jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on; but <hi>Discovery</hi> catching me by the

               <p>Heard of them, yess, but 'tis a

first set up, <hi>Plain-dealing</hi> came sneaking
to my Shop in a Thread-bare Coat, and
was for roosting amongst my stacks; but,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52891:24"/>
taking him for a Spye, I bundled him up
and sent him to the Papermill, where
they held his Nose so hard to the Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
that they quickly obliged him to
pack up his Awls and be gone.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stat.</speaker>
               <p>When I lived with my Master, I
remember I heard him talk much of him,
but do not remember he ever gave him a
visit, though it seems he had been there
formerly, as one more bold than welcom,
which I gathered from his discourse, for
he often railed against him, and called
him Names for the pretended injury he
had done him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Disc.</speaker>
               <p>That was unkind, for I am certain
he is so just, that he would not offer the least
injury to any body.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stat.</speaker>
               <p>I know not all the particulars, but
certain I am that thus he would rate him,
though absent. A Rascal, a Villain, says
he, for hindring me from gelding the
Quires, and pretending they shrunk in
wetting if they happened to be missed, a
thousand Sheets cleverly gained in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

when those that take his advice shall be

obliged to keep Lent all the year. Nay,
when I over reach'd as my manner is, and
made felse Numbers do with a little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
this sawcy <hi>Iack</hi> would be
whispring the lye in my Ear, for which
impertinency I have often snap'd him,
says he, as if I would a bit his Head off,
and cryed, what then you Slave, can a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Stat.</speaker>
               <p>Not so late Sir as you think, for
it could not be less than forty years agone,
since I heard him tell this story: Nay
further told me he was the very Eves dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

now make a hole in a Mans stock as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
as the driping rain eats into the

               <speaker>Stat.</speaker>
               <p>Ay I'll warrant you, and so has
many younger than my self. Alas Sir! I
have a Family to maintain out of hard Wax
and other Tackling, and therefore let
People talk what they will, I know what
I could write with a Pint of Ink, but won't

                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52891:25"/>
Now I perceived he had not gone far
before he slunk into his <hi>Officina</hi> like a
Snail into a Shell, and we past on to an
other quarter: And looking in at the
Mouth of an entery, beheld a Firey-faced
fellow surrounded with Glass-Bottles,
and this put me in mind it might be him,
who (as the old Wives tale has it) girt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself round with Dew Bottles, was
drawn up by the Sun into the World in
the Moon, but found my self within a
while after mistaken, for he proved to be
a Son of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and was too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with his own Terce, then to make
such a perilous expedition, for a Cup of
Nectar, which notwithstanding the Man
in the Moon Drinks Claret, for ought he
knew might prove a Cup of small Beer,
when he came to tast it, yet <hi>Discovery</hi>
would enter this place, upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than the <hi>German</hi> Proverb, <hi>viz. In
Vino veritas,</hi> here says he, or no where
we may stumble upon directions, but no
sooner were we entered, but our Ears
were saluted with the noise of: wellcom,
wellcom Sir. Boy, boy, show up Stairs,
and the confused tinckling of a Bell, with
the ratling of Quart Pots. I would have
been gone, as imagining our inquiry here
would be Fruitless, but <hi>Discovery</hi> over-perswaded
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52891:26"/>
me, and I stayed.</p>
               <p>Now in my Dream I beheld we were
shewed into a large Room, hung round
with divers fancies, wherein the Painter
had been very exact in hitting the humour,
for here sat one a spewing, there another
bleeding with his Pate broke, this had
his Face batterd with a Quart Pot, an
other his Eye struck out with a Tobacco
Pipe, an other lay decently run through
the Lungs, on this side two at Logger-heads,
on that Bottles and Pots flying like
Hail-stones, here one tearing the Cards,
there another damming the Dice, and
shaking his empty Purse, was ready to
tear his own Flesh for madness: The
Cieling blushed with Volleys of Oaths of
a Crimson dye, that spangled it like Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roses,
and on the Floor lay scattred like
sedg in Meadow Ditch, bundles of horrid
imprecations. These things confirmed
my first opinion and put me out of all
hopes of intelligence in this place, but
these thoughts had scarce taken Air, when
up comes <hi>Firefacies</hi> and <hi>Discovery,</hi> as loath
to loose any time, thus entered into Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</p>

what time of the Moon it was, which odd

desirous to know the reason of such a
demand. Why said she, I suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the matter, she stiled her self a <hi>Mid-wife,</hi>
but her real business was to betray
the honour of silly Wenches to the lust of
Bully Ruffians, to supply the City Dames

briskly, they recoild and jostling together,
decently fell, making the Channel for

though all to late, they began to Ban their

charmed by Gold to give you to an other.

and removed the Obstacle, I court afresh

upon the spoil of other Mens Tables, and
the decay of their Purses, Drunkenness

spewing and staggering all the way, twice

after him wallowed a number of fatt

on till he came to a Prison-Gate, where
giving a great reel, he burst open the
Wicket with his Head, when his Body
following, it closed upon him, and there
I left him to bethink himself when he was
sober.</p>
               <p>Now in my Dream I perceived Vertue

the Sun, who gilds the Eastern Clouds
with Purple and with Gold, and as she
flew towards the Clouds, I heard a voice
from the Earth cry after her, return, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
But it seems she had been so badly
used that she took no notice on't, but kept
on her way till she was out of sight.
Whereupon I began to consider with my
self, that although Vice had much inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Borders, yet I could not conceive
but Vertue had many fair Territories, and
made some thousands happy with her
smiles, doing every where much good,
though her reward was for the most part
slender, which urged me to believe she
might be gone for new instructions. But

they often slipt, and indangered his fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a solid substance, we let him pass, when
close at his Heels followed Ruine and
Disgrace: Being almost out of hopes of
finding any Person of whom we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
we left this Street, and struck off
into Humility-Lane, where we had yet
some hopes of retriving our lost labour,
but found our selves deceived, for Pride
and Ambition it seems had been there and
taken Hostages of the Inhabitants to be
at their devotion, which did not a little
trouble me, for I had flattered my self,
that here our search might end; but
whilst I was musing on many things, up
comes a Fellow whom I afterward under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

been a great Romancer, and understood
something of <hi>Logick,</hi> he appeared very

but true once in a hundred Guesses, and
that perhaps we gather from their own

Syllable is disbelieved, but if it be past
they think they remember something like
it, or perhaps flatter themselves 'tis true

to a <hi>Iockey ship,</hi> must be well stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Impudence, and Oaths, or he
can never arrive at the hight of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
He must in the next place be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with false Mains, false Tales, false
Ears, and false Eys, if such be required to
Beautifie an old defective or diseased
Horse, or to disguise one that is stolen, or
has been often blown upon; he must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be skilled at making Artificial Snips
stars and Blases, for the reason before
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52891:75"/>
said; he must have Saddles with Sharp-wires
in them, which as he presses for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
passing through divers holes for
that purpose, may prick the Horse, and
make him dance or caper, as if it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his mettlesome Temper. Then
must he be dexterous at Logging a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Hose with Lead, and by slitting
the flank and pits of the Eyes, blow them
up with a Quill as Butchers do Veal, to
hide the defects of Age or bad keeping;
he must likewise use to baffet a Blind
Horse, whose blindness is not presently
discernable; as likewise to blow Ginger
and Pepper into his Eys, that when he
comes to swear him sure Sighted, he may
with the least wind of his hand, hat, or
noise of his switch, vantle and toss up his
Head, as if he was as sharp sighted as
<hi>Argus.</hi> He must have Balls of Dough,
Eggs, Malmsey and Lickerish together,
with Oats boyled in new Wort, to make
a Horse that is doomed to the Dogs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Fat on a suddain, though it being
but spungy, will lose faster then it is got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
which makes many foolishly imagine
such Horses to be bewitched, when it is
only the Knavery of the <hi>Iockey.</hi> He must
likewise have the art of pricking a dull
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the Spurting place, and rub bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52891:75"/>
Glass into the Holes, to make the
Horses winch upon the least touch, that
it may be thought to proceed from his
mettlesome Temper. He must have the
art of taking up the Fetlock vein with a
Needle and a piece of Silk, so to Lame
his Neighbours Horse, that the cure
being dispaired of, he may purchase him
at an easie rate; as likewise to have a
large stone ready to thrust into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament
of any Horse he likes, to make
him seem by the trimbling and sweating
posture it will put him into, that he is
just a dying; nor can the Farrier in this
cause tell what to do to him, unless he
knew the cause of his Grief. These and
a thousand other Dexterities calculated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Meridian of Knavery,</hi> are
Ingredients that must goe to the making
of a perfect <hi>Iockey;</hi> but for this time let
this suffice, because I see a Chapman
striking my Voucher luck, I must be gone
and manage him, least he fly off, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
his bargain. Therefore if you seek
for <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Plail-dealing</hi> Friend, you
must inquire some where else, for here's
no room for them in these parts.</p>
               <p>Now I perceived in my Dream, that at
the racital of so much Knavery, <hi>Discovery</hi>
shook his head, and made no answer, but
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52891:76"/>
left this place as dispairing to be further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his search, in the very Tents of
Wickedness, and so we passed into <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyless
street,</hi> where we met a Fellow with
sharp Teeth, and long Paws, Monkey
Eyed, and Hawk Nosed, with the spoils
of a Crab-Tree in his Hand, and this I
understood to be a <hi>Catch-pole,</hi> the very
Catterpiller of the Nation; and although
we knew we should not better our selves
by his communication, yet perceiving mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in his Face, methought we were
somewhat desirous of discoursing him, if
but to divert him from evil purposes; and
therefore <hi>Discovery</hi> put the usual Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when at the name of <hi>Honesty</hi> and
<hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> he gave a Leap, which
canted him quite cross the way, crying
out, <hi>I defie ye, I defie ye.</hi> Which at first
made me imagine he took us for fallen
Angels, but after many intreats, we
brought him to a little more moderation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when I fancyed in my Dream, that thus
the talk went on.</p>

This he joyfully consents to, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesance

Then by giving themselves up to <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,

<hi>Virtue,</hi> or were not willfully blind to the

happy a Paradice to us, as <hi>Eden</hi> did to our

But whilst these things carryed me away,
perceived in my Dream, that <hi>Discovery</hi>
was making observations on many antick
figures, and Monuments with inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which represented in Hirogliphics,
<hi>Vprightness, Truth, Honesty, Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the like, to which some of the
inhabitants had great regard; but for the
Major part, I perceived they minded none

inscribed <hi>Self-ends,</hi> and to him they
payed their dayly offerings, because as I
understood, they imagined he chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
their intrest in Worldly matters;
here we found likewise the foot-steps of
<hi>Plain-dealing,</hi> which we traced till we
quite lost sight of the Village of <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi>
and arrived at the Foot of a high
Mountain, called, <hi>Fond-Imagination,</hi> on
which stood the Town of <hi>Vain-hope,</hi> and
up this Mountain, divers Persons were
Clambering, with might and main, some
made such hast, that not taking good
Footing, when near the Top, they tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
down again unto the Valley, where
falling into the Torrent of <hi>Distrust,</hi> they
were violently hurried into the Lake of
<hi>Dispair,</hi> and there for ever lost.</p>
               <p>Now in my Dream, I perceived a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

whom I conceited I had formerly
known, puffing and sweating to gain the
Ascent, which I hinting to <hi>Discovery,</hi> he
told me, if I would give him the hearing,
he would enter into a discourse with him.
Ay, gladly said I, and thereupon we soon
over took him, whose Name was <hi>Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,</hi>

Heaven and Earth at once, promising
them all the pleasures and delights of this

troublesome; when as they fondly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined

and so they supinely trifled out their days
in a secure sloath and ease. Till in my

from the Land of <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> overspread
them, whereupon they layed them down
to sleep, whilst the Bride-groom passed
by; but being a little startled at the
noise, they got up on their Feet, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52891:84"/>
upbraided them with their neglect and
folly, their slighting the Golden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Grace, Wisdorn, for
trifling Vanities, spending those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
moments wherein they should
have trod the paths of Righteousness,
at the end of which is Eternal Life,
in studying to overeach their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Circumvent, their dearest Friends,
meditate revenge, and hoard up ill
gotten gain, which cannot avail in
the day of Death, nor the hour of
Judgement; which Repremands, and
severe Reflections, tormented them to
that degree, that instead of looking
back for succor, they rushed forward
altogether, and getting out of that
Lake, entred another call'd <hi>Hardness of

At which whilst I was grieving,
I beheld at a little distance, the Town
of <hi>Presumption,</hi> to which we made with
all conveniant speed, and upon our

exceeding losty, but built upon such
Sandy foundations, that they were
threatned by every blast of Fate, to
be sunk in their own ruines. This

to their own oppinions, that they
would hearken to no instructions, yet
they pretended to a right in the <hi>Celestial
City,</hi> and would discourse as if they were
very well acquainted with it. But I soon
perceived all was but conceit, they had
it seems Dreamed something on, and
read the promises made by the <hi>Celestial
King,</hi> but were so confident in their
own strength, that they imagined they
had no need of over-shaddowing Grace,
