            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THOU hadst not now been troubled with
the following Papers, if a Relation of
part of a pretended Conference with
Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> late Lord Bishop of
<hi>Ely,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> late Lord
Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> had not been afresh
Reprinted at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and sent abroad
into the World as a piece unanswerable by these two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Prelates of our Church. In which, tho' there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
new, and which has not been long ago answer'd, yet
to satisfie the World about the Truth of that Matter, and
to remove any prejudice that some might otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
concerning these Learned and Pious Bishops, I will
give a short account, as near as I can, at this distance of
time of the Matter of Fact, and then proceed to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Answer to the several Arguments in order as they lie.
The Conference was managed in writing about 30 Years
ago, and by mutual agreement nothing was to be made
Publick without the allowance and consent of both Parties:
But such was the disingenuity and unworthiness of one of
<pb facs="tcp:101118:3"/>
the <hi>Romish</hi> Disputants, that contrary to the Faith and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
he had made, he sets forth a Book, and pretends it
to be an account of the Conference with Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> and
Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> when he had left out, changed, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
Matters as he pleased himself; insomuch that his
Partner was very much ashamed of his dishonest and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Dealing, and did utterly condemn him for what he had
done, and renounced his having been engaged in approving
or consenting to such a hase and disingenuous Proceeding,
and did openly own and acknowledge so much to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concerned. An account whereof was given to the
World by Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> of <hi>Christ-College</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
in a little Book called a <hi>Gagg for the Quakers,</hi>
with an Answer to Mr. <hi>Denn's Quaker</hi> no <hi>Papist. Lond.</hi>
Printed for <hi>J. C.</hi> and are to be sold near the North-door of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, 1659.
<q>—That which follows
in your Book about Mr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> who
disputed against the <hi>Romanists,</hi> all who know these Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
know to be superfluous and frivolous. However
I think fit to tell you, the <hi>Romanist</hi> who put forth an
Edition [of that Dispute] hath so changed, transposed,
added, diminished, and made of it what he list, that I
believe it will be as soon owned for your (I mean not <hi>J. S.</hi>
but <hi>H. D</hi>'s) Conference, as Mr. <hi>Pearson</hi>'s or Mr. <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>'s.
I must now tell you further (what you have been
oft enough told) that that Relation cannot expect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> or any sober Person which is disclaimed
and disowned by Three of the Four who were Disputants,
<hi>viz.</hi> by both the Protestants, and half the Papists. But
chiefly I must entreat you to consider whether the insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above 200 Lines at a time as a part of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which never was part of it, (besides all professed
Additions) secondly, whether the leaving out whole Sheets
of the Protestants, which the Papists thought too hard to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb facs="tcp:101118:3"/>
and thirdly, the scarce suffering any one Argument
and Answer of both to come together, but casting usually
parts of the same Paper of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> many score Leaves
asunder one from another, be not a scandal that any
Christian would desire might be cover'd with silence? And
I would gladly know from any Ingenuous Person, whether
this might not be Answer enough to a Book put out at
the charge of the <hi>Romanist</hi>'s own Purse and Conscience.
A Discourse, by being mangled, rendred so unintelligible,
that scarce any Man ever read it over or will.—Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Mr. <hi>William Moor</hi> the deceased Library-Keeper,
was perswaded by <hi>J. S.</hi> to read one Leaf, but professed
before many Witnesses he would not read another if you
would give him the whole Impression, because it was so
unintelligible for the Causes above-mentioned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This account was thought sufficient to satisfie the World,
that the Relation of that Conference ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
and that it needed no other Answer.</p>
            <p>But perhaps some will demand why was not the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
then Printed whole and intire? Now, the reason of
that was, because the Popish Adversary did run all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
into obscure and metaphysical Niceties, that few could
understand, and fewer would take the pains to read it,
and so it was not thought fit, and a needless charge to trouble
the World with it. Besides, both the Bishops did tell their
Friends, when they discoursed with them about a fuller An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that they thought it altogether unnecessary, because
though the Dispute were mangled and misrepresented, yet
that which they had Printed was still unanswered by them,
and unanswerable by any of their Party; and they were
perswaded that all Men who would carefully read the Book,
would be of the same mind. And as for this Paper that
is added, at the end of the pretended Conference, and now
Reprinted at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Author do's not so much as say,
<pb facs="tcp:101118:4"/>
that it was part of their Dispute, but a pure Addition of his
own, wherein they were no more concerned than other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and they did not think they were bound to answer
whatsoever he should afterwards write and publish to the
World; and yet this <hi>Oxford</hi> Paper would without any ground,
or the least colour, impose upon the World, that this is a
part of that forementioned Conference. Neither did the
Cause it self, or the state of Affairs then require any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Discourse upon that subject, the Books of Bishop
<hi>Fern,</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Heylin,</hi> being then in every Bodies hands, wherein they
had fully vindicated the Church of <hi>England</hi> from any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Schism; and the learned Men of that time were
so well satisfied with what they had written, that it was
needless to trouble the World upon that account. But now
'tis expected every thing that peeps out should receive a
due Answer, I have therefore endeavour'd to prove from
truly Catholick Principles (such as our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot gain-say) that not only the Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of our Church is most sound and Catholick, but
even the Order of our Succession, and the Method of our
Reformation was truly Regular and Canonical, and that
all the Author's own Arguments do return upon his own
Head, and evidently prove himself, and other <hi>English</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
guilty of Schism.</p>

frequently and learnedly proved by our <hi>English</hi> Bishops
and Divines, that the Points in difference between the
Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are so far
from being Matters of Faith, that they are modern Errors
imposed upon the Christian World, besides and contrary

and Book of Ordination, the same in substance
with those that are now in use amongst us, and the
Archbishops and a far major part of the Bishops were
consenting thereunto, not above 5 or 6 were displaced
for their disorderly behaviour and dissent from their
Brethren, and others by the Metropolitan and Bishops
of the Province ordained and settled in their Bishopricks
according to the usual custom of that time, as all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
and our very Adversaries are forced to confess.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> being thus regularly settled,
was never from that time to this very day regularly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by any Canonical Authority, but has oftentimes been
confirmed since, both by the Authority of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of our Kings and Parliaments, and consequently
the present Bishops are Lawful Pastors without any guilt
of Heresy or Schism, and all within their several char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are bound by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Councils, to live in their Communion, and to submit
to them as those that are appointed by the Holy Ghost to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101118:6"/>
direct and govern them in Matters of Religion, and all
Neighbour Churches are obliged to allow us the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Coordinate Churches, and to own us as true
Members of Christ's mystical Body The Holy Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>The only Objection, of any Moment, that is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Regular Succession, is from the interruption it
met with in the short Reign of Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> But when
the Matter of Fact is looked into, it will appear that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which was done in her Reign will be any prejudice
to our Succession, nor can by any means take off the
Regular Settlement of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the
Convocation in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, but that the Acts
thereof are still in force, except in some particulars
which have been changed by Convocations afterwards.
For the Synods which were held, and the Ordinations
that were made in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days were not carried
on in a Regular Manner by the Archbishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the Province, but by the Authority of the Pope
and those Bishops which were justly deposed and set aside,
and so had no jurisdiction nor any right or title to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Authority in this Realm, and therefore could
give no right to the Bishops, or Authority to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
they ordained; and tho' all the Art and Cruelty
imaginable was used, to cut off a future Succession, by
burning, imprisoning, and banishing the Lawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
yet it pleased God so to order it, that the major
Part of the Lawful undoubted Bishops, who were made
in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, and which lived till Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, joyned again in continuing the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Bishops, and restoring the Reformation settled in
Convocation, which has been preserved, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
to this very Day. And those Bishops that
were set aside in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, were either
justly deposed in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days, and never right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restored, or else were ordained by them who had no
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101118:6"/>
Authority to give them Jurisdiction in this Nation,
and so had no further right, than the Civil Magistrate
could give, which the same Power had again taken away.
So that the Ordination of Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> was so far
from being irregular, that it was made by those, who
only had proper Right and Title to ordain: For the
rest of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Bishops being Dead, the sole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
did Regularly devolve on the few that were left.
And the Queen, the Nobility, and Gentry, the Clergy,
and the Main Body of the Nation, were so well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of the unlawful Authority of those Bishops that
were set aside, and the undoubted Right of those who
ordained Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> that of about 9400 Clergy,
above 9200 did with great Joy receive the Bishops, and
the Reformation;<note place="margin">

               </note> and the rest of the Nation, even
those that were formerly zealous for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
did joyn with them in Prayers and Sacraments, and there

Years together; so that there was no other Penal Law,
but that of 12 <hi>d.</hi> a Sunday, to stir up lazy People to

this Day, in that happy Concord, had not the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
and deposed the Queen, and prohibited
all her Subjects, under Pain of an Anathema, to own
her Soveraignty, and submit to the Bishops of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> Upon which many separated from

our Communion, and have disturbed our Government
ever since.<note place="margin">Vid. Bull. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. apud Combd. p. 179.</note> So that it is plain, the Schism is on the side
of the Papists, who upon pretence of Papal Authority,
did withdraw themselves from the Communion of their
own Bishops, and make a formal division in the Church,
which was before united in Peace and Truth.</p>
            <p>But suppose there was some circumstantial defect in
the Succession of some of our first Bishops, as to matter
of Form, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign,
after so many of their Predecessors, had been unjustly
turned out, and destroyed in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, their
Misfortunes do not at all concern, the present Bishops of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for if the Matter of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and the Constitution of our Church be Sound
and Catholick, (as it is beyond all possible Contradiction)
and the Consecration of our Bishops was Valid, as to the
matter of Order, there being no Regular Succession of
Bishops continued on by those, who were set aside in
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign (because they knew it was in
vain, when they saw the Kingdom so well settled, and
the People so unanimously joyning with the Reformed
Bishops) after all those Popish Bishops were Dead, there
could be nothing required in Reason, to give the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
a full Right and Authority, but the Reception of
the Queen, and the whole Kingdom, and that they had
long before, and all the Bishops for many Successions
since that Time, came into vacant Places, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
that now are, were none of them Born, and come
into none but void Places, and so are as Firmly and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically
settled, as any Bishops in the World.</p>
            <p>This being the true Account of the Reformation of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I proceed now to consider the
Argument, in the pretended Conference with Bishop
<hi>Gunning,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> so many Years ago, and
lately Reprinted by <hi>Henry Cruttenden</hi> at <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first it begins, with a Definition of Schism, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101118:7"/>
this Manner. <q>Schism is a Voluntary Separation of
one Part from the whole, true, visible [Hierarchical]
Church of Christ:</q> And then he goes on to a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism
in this manner.</p>
            <p>Whoever make a Voluntary Separation of themselves,
from the whole, true, visible Church of Christ, are
Schismaticks.</p>
            <p>But all those of the <hi>English</hi> Protestant Party, make a
Voluntary Separation of themselves, from the whole,
true, visible Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>Therefore all those of the <hi>English</hi> Protestant Party,
are Schismaticks.</p>
            <p>He goes about to prove, that we separate from the
visible Church; because, we separate from the <hi>Roman</hi>
and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, and all others in Communion with
them, and this seems to be the full Substance and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the first Argument.</p>
            <p>Now to avoid all doubt, and entring into Disputes
about Foreign Churches, whose Case is in some Regard,
much different from ours of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
I shall therefore, instead of the Protestant Party, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to Answer, for the Protestants of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not go to examine, the definition of Schism,
any one that desires further Satisfaction about it, may
look into the Conference it self, as it is printed, where
it is learnedly and acutely examined, by the Bishops
themselves.</p>
            <p>In Answer therefore to the major Proposition, it is so
far from being true, that we separate from the visible
Church of Christ, that we separate from no true Church
or Society of Christians in the World.<note place="margin">Synod. <hi>Lond.</hi> An. 1603. c. 30.

               </note> But to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101118:8"/>
stating of this Matter, we must consider, that there
is a twofold Communion, one of Coordination, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Subordination. Churches Coordinate, <hi>i. e.</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Provinces, several Nations, and Countries, owe no
Obedience one to another, and are not bound to observe
the same Rites and Customs, and to agree in all School-disputes
and Niceties, concerning Theological Opinions;
no more than several Kingdoms are bound, to have the
same Laws and Constitutions. This is acknowledged by
all sober Divines, in all Ages. Accordingly several
Churches and Countries, have had their peculiar Rules
and Orders,<note place="margin">See how the Church of <hi>England</hi> does Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with all Churches in the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Gunning</hi> the late Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> in his Evangelical and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Unity, <hi>pag. 302, &amp;c.</hi> Guide in Controversy <hi>dis. 3. c. 8. n.</hi> 84.

Thus he vindicates the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> wherein it differs from the <hi>Greek</hi> and other Churches, and by the same Reason other Churches may differ from her without Schism or Fault.</note> still living in Peace and Unity, and so
might it be at this Day, did not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
by Force and Subtilty, go about to enslave all Mankind
to their private Errors and Impositions. As therefore
several Kingdoms do maintain Peace one with another,
and give all friendly Assistance if there be Occasion, for
their mutual Happiness and Defence, yet keep to their
own Laws and Customs in other Matters; so tho' we
differ in some Opinions and Practices from <hi>Rome</hi> and
other Churches, yet we retain that Christian Charity
and Respect for them, which one Coordinate Church or
Kingdom ought to have for another, and so there is no
Schism made at all by us, nor so much as any Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but what distance of Place and difference of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
do necessarily make. Neither do we send
Emissaries Abroad, to withdraw their People from their
Obedience, and set up Altar against Altar in a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
manner, and I wish they could say as much, that
they did not go about to disturb our Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>But secondly, there is a Communion of Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that which all Bishops, Priests, and all others
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101118:8"/>
owe, of submission to the Archbishops and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

set up Altar against Altar, Communion against Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,

               <p>He goes about to prove that we adhere to Schismatical

Ordained Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> and others, in Opposition
to the major Part of the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, who were then
alive, and into the Places of many of them while they
were alive, and never Lawfully Deprived. This is the

               <p>In Answer to which, I deny that the Bishops set aside
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, were Lawful Bishops of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> because they were violently and
uncanonically thrust in, or rather they invaded those
Bishopricks in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days. So that the Bishops

Reasons to refuse to comply, because they had made

possess the Sees and Offices of Lawful Bishops

such as possess them, are such Schismatical Pastors.</p>
               <p>This is our Author's Major Proposition; to which
I add this Minor. But the Popish Bishops that were set
aside in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, did possess the Places
of Lawful Bishops yet living, or united themselves to
such as did possess them, therefore they were Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and no Lawful Bishops of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
For as soon as these Lawful Bishops were turned out,
others were put into their Places, and not only so, but
contrary to all Rule and ordorly Government in the
Church. For, the most certain Fundamental Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church in all Ages; and the constant Order
of all Societies (which is always tacitly supposed, tho'
not formally observed) is, that while particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
keep to the Faith and Unity of the Catholick
Church, as ours had done, all things ought to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the Archbishop and Bishops of the Province,
and so by the Chief Governors and main Body of the
Society, or else things cannot be Regularly done;<note place="margin">Vid. Pet. de Marca. de Concord. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotii &amp; Imper. lib. 8. &amp; alibi. <hi>Jo. Launoi.</hi> Ep. <hi>Hen. Gondrino</hi> sen. Arch. T. 8. <hi>Out of Archbishop</hi> Parker.</note> but
here the Archbishop and the Major Part of the Bishops
are set aside, and others put into their Places while
they were yet alive, and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> adds that of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy, who were Sixteen Thousand, Twelve
Thousand were likewise turned out, so there could be
nothing Regularly done by the Convocation, either in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101118:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Upper or Lower House. And further, they were
not content with the present Possession, but secretly
said in their Minds, These are the Heirs come let us
kill them, and their Inheritance shall be ours; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
after they had bereaved them of their Bishopricks
and their Livings, they quickly took away many of their
Lives. And are not all these Men Schismaticks with a

other Mens Places and Government? It matters not

               <p>'Tis confessed that 14 or 15 were turned out or went
away in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, but according to our
Author's own Argument, they were Schismaticks and
no Lawful Bishops, because they came into the Places of
Lawful Bishops while they were alive, or else were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by and communicated with such Schismaticks.
I add, they usurped their Places by turning out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans
and Major Part of the Bishops of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and so could have no Lawful Authority or Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> therefore set them aside, and
so removed this Violence and Usurpation. And being
willing to restore all things as they were settled in King
<hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, she calls back the Bishops that were
still alive, which were only Five in number. Bishop
<hi>Barlow, Scory, Coverdale, Kitchin,</hi> and <hi>Thirlby.</hi> And
all but <hi>Thirlby</hi> concurred in settling the Reformation;
so we had still the Major Part of the Lawful Bishops to
renew the Succession, and they did Ordain Archbishop
<hi>Parker</hi> and others, and it has been Regularly continued
ever since. Thus the Authority of our present Bishops
as to Order and Jurisdiction is beyond dispute.</p>
               <p>One Objection was insisted upon by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and
others, to justify the Deprivation of the Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101118:12"/>
and others of the Clergy, because some of them
were married Men, and perhaps they married after Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
which was threatned with Deposition by many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Canons.</p>
               <p>To which I Answer, that living in a Married Estate is
not by Divine Authority inconsistent with the Exercise
of the Priesthood, but was always allowed in the
Church, and ever practised in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church till this
Day, and has been oftentimes dispensed withal in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church for secular Ends. So that the allowing
Marriage before or after Orders, is a Circumstance that
depends upon the Discretion of the Church; and if for
some Reasons Clergy-men were heretofore prohibited to
marry after Orders, yet in this long Interval of General
Councils, upon the great Experience of the Mischiefs
and Inconveniences that came by forbidding it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches may dispense with that Rigour; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
this Provincial and National Church, and the
Law of the Land, which had much better Authority
than the Pope, had left every body to their Liberty to
marry or not to marry, as they saw good, and so they
that did marry offended against no Law of God and
Man, and therefore were unjustly Deposed from their
Bishopricks upon that Account.</p>
               <p>But then our Author says, that they in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
Days were Lawful Bishops, and he proves it from
the Confession of Protestants, who grant that the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all those of her Communion are
true Churches of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now as to the first Part of the Argument, I Answer,
In time of great Schism and tumultuous Proceedings,
there may be so far the Remains of a true Church, that
many Pious Christians, who are not at all, or else igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
ingaged in the Schism, may be saved; but we
have no Reason to say that the Popish Bishops in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Days were Lawful Bishops, or the governing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101118:12"/>
Part were then the National Church of <hi>England;</hi>
the true Right and Authority of the Church was in
those Lawful Bishops that were made in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Days, and that was the true Church of <hi>England</hi> which
did adhere to them and their Constitutions.</p>
               <p>But then the Author does Object, that Protestants do
grant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and all those of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
are true Churches of Christ.</p>
               <p>Never was People's Charity more abused than ours of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> has been in this kind, to justify
the Errors and Schism of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all
upon a mere and generally wilful Mistake. In short
therefore 'tis true, and we do acknowledge, that the
Substance of the Christian Religion is professed by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' mingled with Errors. And so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that honestly and sincerely serve God in her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
may be saved; but yet many may be damned for
too pertinaciously maintaining and propagating the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially those that desert
and refuse Obedience to the Bishops of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> setting up Altar against Altar, and so keeping
up a Schism amongst us, where they have such plentiful
Means of being better informed, and all the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of serving God, according to the highest Perfection
of the Apostolick and Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the second Part of the Argument;
where the Author goes to prove, that the Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
did nothing whereby they became unlawful Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
for if they did, it ought to be supposed it was
that, for which they were deprived, and then he says,
all the Reasons for which they were deprived, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the pretended Reformation, and refusing the Oath of
Supremacy; and that was but proceeding in Practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the common Tenets, the holding whereof
made them not unlawful Bishops. Again, whilst they
were lawful Bishops in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, they held
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101118:13"/>
it a common necessary Point of Religion to resist the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and refuse the Oath of Supremacy.</p>
               <p>In answer to all which I say, That according to the
Author's own Argument, they were no lawful Bishops,
because they either did Schismatically invade the Places
of the lawful Bishops, or else were willingly Consecrated,
and did joyn in Communion with those Schismatical Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
When the Queen therefore did set them aside,
she did but dispossess Men who had no just Right, and
remove those by her Civil Authority, who had no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but what they had from Force and the secular Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it may be objected, that though their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
were at first defective, and they did Schismatically
usurp those Bishopricks, yet when their Predecessors
were dead, that Defect might be overlook'd, and by the
Reception of the Kingdom, their Title might be made
good, and they very well confirmed in their Possession.
It would have, I confess, been happy, if there had been
such a Catholick Disposition in those Bishops, that they
would have willingly repented and forsaken their former
Errors, that so the Kingdom might have confirmed their
Authority by the Universal Reception. But there were
many Reasons why they did refuse, and could not own
and receive them as lawful Catholick Bishops.</p>

For though it be the general Belief of most Christians

the Body of Christ is in the Hand of the Priest, or in

only that Discipline was used, to turn out those that
would not quietly submit to the Determinations of the

Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> he was Consecrated a Bishop of this

               <p>But all this is founded upon a false and groundless

from whom we derive our Succession (and might have

descend down from Divine Tradition and Apostolical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and other General

many of the Formalities that are used in the first Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

were not observed by Christ and his Apostles, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Church, and so are accidental Ceremonies
Appointed by the State to testify their good liking of the
Person, that as the Church doth think him well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
and fit to be Preferred to such a Sacred Office, so the
State is well satisfied, that he is a Man that will be Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Faithful to the Temporal Government; which is
agreeable to the Apostles Direction,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>that he should have a
good report of them that are without.</hi> But still that which
is Essential, and the Authority and Power to execute the
Sacred Office of a Bishop or Priest in their respective
Charges, is derived from the Bishops of the Province;
and after great Violence and Disorder, from as many, or
the major part of them which survive. And this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
is established and allowed by the Catholick Church,
as long as Provincial and National Churches keep to her
Faith and Unity, as Ours has done. So that every
Bishop and Priest orderly constituted in his Place, does
act by the Power and Appointment of the Catholick
Church, and they contemn the Catholick Church, that
desert and disturb them in the Performance of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Hence we may understand our Saviour's meaning,
<note place="margin">Matt. 18. 17.</note> when he says, <hi>if he neglect to hear the Church let him
be unto thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</hi> Which
in the first Place, does require us to hear our own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

that if our own Pastors turn Hereticks, or set themselves
up by undue means, and not according to the Order of
the Church, they are not to be hearkned to, but we
must according to our Saviour's Command <hi>here the
Church,</hi> and not those Pastors that will not themselves
<hi>hear</hi> and <hi>obey the Church,</hi> as the Pope and his Adherents
in <hi>England</hi> do not.</p>
               <p>So that though Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> and others,<note place="margin">Can. Apost. 1. Concil. Nicen. Can. 4.</note> were
Ordained but by Four Bishops (which is more then the
Canons do require to be present) yet it was according to
the Constitution and Order of the Catholick Church,
and so all Catholick Bishops must allow and approve of
what was done: And they and their Successors are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Christ, according to that Command and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which he gave to his Apostles,<note place="margin">Matt. 28. 19. 20.</note> to whom, as he

Succession derived down in Opposition to ours, much less
a Regular and Orderly Jurisdiction over us; and if the
Popish Bishops in the beginning had a pretended Claim,
yet they being all long since Dead, and none continued to
succeed in their Places, all Pretence is now wholly out of
Doors, and the Present Bishops are guilty of no Schism,
their Order is undoubted, and their Succession uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and so their Title and Authority is as firm and
unquestionable as any upon Earth; and they must be
Schismaticks before God and the Catholick Church, that
do not submit to them, and joyn in their Communion in
all Lawful Things, as the Service of our Church is in all
its Offices and Administrations beyond Dispute; and to
joyn in them is all that is required of any Lay-person
to be a Member of our Communion.</p>
               <p>And now I have vindicated the justness of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of the Papists, nothing but Cruelty, Murder, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

               <p>Now come we to consider how these Bishops that had
been the cause of all this Cruelty, and Bloodshed in
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Days, and were wrongfully thrust into
the Places of the True and Lawful Bishops whom they
Murthered, or forced to fly their Country, were treated
themselves by the Reformed Bishops when the Tide was
turned another way, as it was in the Days of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And one would think, that the Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus exasperated against them, by the cruel Usage
they shewed to others, they would meditate the like
Revenge, aud retaliate upon them with the like Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but it is quite contrary to the meek Spirit of
Orthodox Christians, thus to imbrue their Hands in
Blood upon the Account of Religion, or to seek to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
themselves in the like manner. They committed
their cause to God, in whom they did put their trust,
and left it to him to plead it with their Adversaries.
But they themselves did render nothing but Good for
Evil, Mercy for Cruelty: And though they did remove
the Bishops from those Sees to which they had no just
Title, because they were Men of Blood, and would not
conform to the Publick Order settled in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s
Days, and give such Security to pay due Allegiance to
her Majesty, as in justice they ought to have done,<note place="margin">

they were treated with all Civility. Archbishop <hi>Heath</hi>
was suffered to abide in one of his own purchased Houses,
never restrained to any Place, and died in great Favour
with the Queen, who bestowed many Gracious Visits
on him during his Retirement. <hi>Tunstall</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
spent the remainder of his time with Archbishop

Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> in the same House, and to <hi>Bourn</hi> Bishop of

Died about ten or eleven Years after. <hi>White</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> though at first imprisoned for his Insolencies,
after some time was suffered to enjoy his Liberty, and
to Retire himself to what Friend he pleased. The like
Favour was shewed to <hi>Turbervile</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who
being a Gentleman by Birth of an Ancient Family,
could not want Friends to give him Entertainment.
<hi>Watson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> having endured a short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
spent the remainder of his Time with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> till being found practising
against the State, he was finally shut up in <hi>Wisbich</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
where at last he Died. <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisle</hi>
Died soon after his Deprivation, of an Apoplexy.
<hi>Bayne</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> of the Stone; and <hi>Morgan</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of St. <hi>Davids</hi> of some other Disease the <hi>December</hi>
following his Deprivation, but all of them in their Beds
and at perfect Liberty. The rest disposed of themselves
as they pleased, but no Restraint was laid upon them,
and were perfectly out of all Fear or Danger of hard Usage,
so far were the Reformers from putting them to Death
upon the Account of Religion. Only Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> was
kept in the Tower for his own Security, to preserve
him from the Outrage of the Multitude, which he had
highly exasperated against him by his former Cruelties;
But so gentle was his Usage, and so answerable in all
Respects to his Character; that one would have look'd
on it rather as a chosen Retirement, than a Restraint.</p>
               <p>This clear Account being given of the Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and undoubted Succession of the Bishops in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Days, by whom the Reformation was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
which was happily begun in King <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth's Reign; come we now to consider the state of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101118:18"/>
inferior Clergy at that Change, as we have set it down by
Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Camb. Eliz. p. 36.</note> who wrote the Annals of those Times.
The Account that he gives us is this, that the Number
of Ecclesiastical Promotions was 9400, of all which, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
80 Rectors of Churches, 50 Prebendaries, 15 Presidents
of Colleges, 12 Archdeacons, 12 Deans, and six Abbots
were turned out, in all 175, most, if not all of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
likely put in unjustly in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Days, or else
chosen out particularly for their known Obstinacy and
Humour, in contending for the Errors of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And yet what a poor handful they were to the
rest, which were above 9200, who did Return to Lawful
Settlement of the Church in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Days, and
the true Canonical Bishops then remaining, who concurred
in Ordaining Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> and other Bishops, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and setling the Reformation.</p>
               <p>God Almighty in his due Time, put an end to all those
immoderate Heats and Contentions; and inspire Papists
and other Dissenters with that Charitable and Peaceable
Temper, which always eminently appeared in the true
Catholicks of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And let all those
that heartily desire the Advancement of Religion, and
the Salvation of Mankind, consider, that the way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Glory of God, and the Peace and Unity of the
Church, is not to carry on secular Designs, to impose the
private Opinions of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi>
Schools, nor yet the Fanatical Devices of some Modern
Reformers, but by maintaining the truly Ancient and
Apostolick Faith, Devotion and Discipline, delivered
and recommended to us by the Word of God, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and Authority of the Primitive and Catholick
Church, which is, and can be observed no where in
greater Perfection, than in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is
Established by Law.</p>
