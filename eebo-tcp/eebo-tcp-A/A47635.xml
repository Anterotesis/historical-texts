         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

POSTSCRIPT
TO THE

PREFACE
TO
Bishop Bramhalls Vindication.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the Animad-versions
upon the Preface to
Bishop <hi>Bramhalls</hi> Vindication,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (if it be not too great a
favour to call him an Author
that writes a Book upon a Preface) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
posted up a <hi>Play-Bill</hi> for the Title of
his Book: And here by the way, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but congratulate his honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
and question not but to hear of his
being prefer'd from writing of <hi>Bills</hi> for
the <hi>Play-houses</hi> to penning of <hi>Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for the <hi>Stage-Coaches</hi> and <hi>Bills</hi> for the
<hi>Pox,</hi> and after a proficiency therein, to be
admitted upon the next vacancy, to form
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64322:3"/>
               <hi>Draughts</hi> for the <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Short-hand-men,</hi>
and frame <hi>Tickets</hi> for the <hi>Rope-dancers</hi>
and the <hi>Royall-Sport</hi> of <hi>Cock-fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that so he may arrive in a short time
to be Author of most of those ingenious
<hi>Labours</hi> which curious Readers admire at
<hi>Passing times</hi> in their passage between
<hi>White-hall</hi> and <hi>Temple-bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say, this great Author (of <hi>Play-bills)</hi>
having in conformity to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
Title <hi>Transposed the Rehearsal,</hi>
or at least all of Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his Play extant,
<hi>four Acts.</hi> I thought it was great pitty so
facetious and Comical a work should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
incompleat, and therefore I have
continued it on, and added the <hi>Fifth,</hi> the
Argument of which, and its dependance
on the other <hi>Four,</hi> I shall give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of after a preliminary examination
of the Characters and Plot in our Authors
<hi>Transpos'd Rehearsal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to either of these,
it will not be unnecessary to consider on
what bottom he has erected his Animad-versions,
and this I find to be no other
then the Preface to Bishop <hi>Bramhalls</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
which is as much as to say, here
is a House wrought out of a Portal. 'Tis
pretty I confess, and exceeds the power
of common Architects. But what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64322:3"/>
is more strange, that 100. pages (the
Preface is no more by his computation)
should be foundation sufficient enough to
support his mighty <hi>Paper-building</hi> of 326.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis very probable, that which
gave the principal hint to our Authors
<hi>Rehearsal Transpros'd,</hi> was the near accord
he observes betwixt the Preface and <hi>Mr.
Bayes</hi> his Prologue, P. 14. and here, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but applaud his admirable dexterity
that could extract four Acts of a <hi>Farce,</hi>
from a single Prologue, but such is the
singular felicity of some Animadverters,
(and of ours amongst the rest) in their
illustrating of Authors, that they have
heighten'd and refin'd some of their
Notions, not only above all others, but
above even the intentions of the dull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
themselves; A rare Art! and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
so well by some of our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of <hi>French</hi> Farce, that some of them
have been luckily mistaken for Authors.
For instance, the Writer of the Preface
had said, <hi>He could not tell which way his
Mind would work it self and its thoughts;</hi> now
this our <hi>Improver of Verity,</hi> according to
his peculiar excellence, P. 12. resolves
into Prince <hi>Volscius</hi> his Debate betwixt
Love and Honour, and tells you more of
the Authors mind in Verse, than he could
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64322:4"/>
do himself in Prose. And this feat is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by no other Magick then <hi>Regula
Duplex,</hi> turning Prose into Verse, and
Verse into Prose <hi>alternativà.</hi> See what

of this Remarque, we must desire the
Reader to observe, That the Writer of
the Preface had said, <hi>That the Church of
Ireland was the largest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cene of the Bishops
Actions.</hi> Now it will go very hard, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64322:4"/>
this Passage will be condemn'd for one
guilty word or two; for Histories are
<hi>Playes</hi> without <hi>Scenes,</hi> and without <hi>Action;</hi>
and these two words being neither of
the <hi>Historians</hi> Profession, nor <hi>Divines:</hi> the
Bishops Historian must of necessity be
cast, unlesse he have any hopes of benefit
of Clergy; however we hope before Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be past, the Animadverter will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us, what words are of the Clergy,
and what of the Layity, which in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Orders and which not; and then their
several Divisions, which <hi>Catholick,</hi> and
which <hi>Schismatical;</hi> and amongst them,
which <hi>Classical, Congregational,</hi> and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
<hi>Sects;</hi> whethàr for Church of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he would read <hi>Congregation,</hi> for <hi>Scene,
Diocess</hi> or <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and for <hi>Actions, Spiritual
Exercises</hi> or <hi>Labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if at last the Animadverter intend
by <hi>Play-Book-Stile,</hi> whatever is written
above the common elevation, unlesse he
would have the Priest and the Poet write
in two distinct Languages; I see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to allow him, that the Priest should
make use of a less refin'd and polisht Stile
than the Poet. If after all this any one
should be so impenitently inquisitive, as
to demand a reason why our <hi>Prologue Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
would have a <hi>Prologue</hi> with a <hi>Plot,</hi> and
not written in <hi>Play-Book-Stile,</hi> he will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64322:5"/>
answer him, no doubt, because 'tis <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Prologue, pass we to the
<hi>Rehearsal Transpros'd,</hi> in which the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
the Action, and the Humour of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to our consideration. The
principal person concerned in this Farce
is Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> whom our <hi>Transproser</hi> makes
to be of the same Character with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Preface; for which he alledges
these following reasons, <hi>pag.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because he hath no name, or at least
will not own it (<hi>Good.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because he is I perceive a lover
of elegancy of Stile, and can endure no mans
Tautologies but his own; (<hi>Good again</hi>) and
therefore, I would not distaste him with too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
repetition of one word, (<hi>Very good I-faith.</hi>)
But chiefly because <hi>Mr. Bays,</hi> and <hi>He</hi>
do very much symbolize in their understandings,
in their expressions, in their humours, in their
contempt and quarrelling of all others (<hi>and
all that</hi>) though of their own Profession. <hi>Then
less chiefly,</hi> Because our Divine, the Author,
manages his contest with the same prudence and
civility which the Players and Poets have pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
of late in their several Divisions (<hi>there's
a bob for the Play-House. And lastly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
both their Talents do peculiarly lye in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and personating the Non-conformists. (<hi>I
gad sir, and there you have nickt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
juncture of Affairs.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64322:5"/>
To all these Reasons, our Farce-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
might have added another, which is
a <hi>non pareillo,</hi> namely, that which Mr.
<hi>Bays</hi> returned when it was demanded of
him, Why in his grand Show (grander
than that in <hi>Harry</hi> the VIII.) two of the
Cardinals were in Hats, and two in Caps,
<hi>because—By gad I won't tell you,</hi> Which
after a pause, is a reason beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>Now though the foregoing Paralell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Ecclesiastical Mr. Bays,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr. Bays</hi> in
the <hi>Rehearsal</hi> be so exact, that it were hard
to distinguish betwixt <hi>Mr. Bays,</hi> and <hi>Mr.
Bayes,</hi> had not one writ a Preface, and the
other a Play; Yet because in the nearest
resemblances of Twins, 'tis not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to trace some marks of distinction and
<hi>House-wives</hi> there have been upon Record,
so expert, as to discern a difference even in
Eggs, so as they never mistook one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
we shall endeavour to shew, that
these two are not so alike, but that they
are as unlike too; nay most unlike in
their nearest resemblances.</p>
            <p>First, Then our <hi>Trans-proser</hi> craves
leave to call the Writer of the Preface
<hi>Mr. Bays,</hi> because <hi>he hath no name, or a least,
will not own it;</hi> from whence we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
That every <hi>Anonymus</hi> Author may be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64322:6"/>
as well call'd Mr. <hi>Bays,</hi> as this Writer.
And what may we then think of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
himself, who would be Gossip to
all the nameless Off-springs of the Press,
and yet has not fathered his own Bastard;
but let him learn to Christen his own
Brat first, before he gives Nick-names to
others; for who can endure that he
should undertake, as Godfather, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
child, that leaves his own to the
Parish; Had not his brain been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of this <hi>By-blow,</hi> without the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisery
of an <hi>Imprimatur;</hi> the <hi>Printer</hi> and
the <hi>Stationer</hi> at least, would have appear'd
as <hi>Sureties</hi> for the Childs behaviour, and
the Issue might have been judg'd le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
though the Father were not
publickly known. But now that the
Infant has crept into the World without
a lawfull Father, without Gossips, nay,
without a name (or what is all one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a name of its own) we cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate
with Fate; as Prince <hi>Pretty-man</hi>
much upon the like occasion.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Was ever Child yet brought to such distress!</l>
               <l>To be, for being a Child, made Fatherless.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Though every Nurse can readily
point to <hi>Daddy's</hi> Eyes and Mouth, in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64322:6"/>
little Babies face, as if the dapper Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
were to be heir to all the Fathers
features; and a Dimple, or a Mole, if
hereditary, were better Titles to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Heritance,
than Deeds and Evidences.
Yet none certainly was ever born with
fairer Marks than this. For it is stigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
in the Fore-head, and bears in the
Front the legible Characters of <hi>well-meaning Zealot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much in consideration of the
first Reason, that induc'd the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yerter
to call the writer of the Preface
Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> because he hath no name: for
which reason he might as well have cal'd
him <hi>Bayes Anonymus</hi> in imitation of <hi>Miltons</hi>
learned Bull (for that Bulls in <hi>Latin</hi> are
<hi>learned</hi> ones, none will deny) who in
his Answer to <hi>Salmasius,</hi> calls him <hi>Claudius
Anonymus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Reason is, Because he
would avoid <hi>Tautologies</hi> and distastefull
<hi>Repetitions of one word;</hi> and to avoid this,
he has taken a sure course; for since his
own Invention could not supply him
with variety of names, he has run over
the <hi>Dramatis Personae</hi> of the <hi>Rehearsal;</hi> and
because Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> alone was not sufficient
for his purpose, he has made bold with
Mr. <hi>Thunderer, Draw-can-sir, and Prince Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scius.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64322:7"/>
These Titles he has confer'd on our
Author in consideration of his Dignity,
as he is a Clergy-man of <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But chiefly (as he goes on) <hi>because Mr.</hi>
Bayes <hi>and he symbolize in their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in their Expressions, in their Humour, in
their Contempt and quarrelling of all others,
though of their own Profession.</hi> Now because
these with their subsequent Train of
Reasons [<hi>because that Players and he manage
their contests with the same prudence and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and both their Talents lie in personating
and exposing the Nonconformists</hi>] seem to
make the most Pompous shew of all the
rest, (for the precedent ones conclude
nothing, why he should be call'd Mr.
<hi>Bays</hi> more then any other name) yetas you
will easily discover, this Pomp is far from
a Triumph, and not less ignoble then
Cardinal <hi>Campejus</hi> his Pageantry, whose
Mules under glorious Trappings, and
rich foot cloaths, carryed such disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
lumber, as is not usually conceal'd in
Carriers Packs.</p>
            <p>1. Then as to their <hi>Symbolizing in their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
&amp; <hi>Expressions,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> you know, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
that one quality of fighting single with whole
Armies,</hi> before <hi>all the Moral vertues put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
and not with standing whatever the
peaceable Morallist says to the contrary,
allows Fortitude the Precedency of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64322:7"/>
               <hi>Red-Hatted</hi> Virtues, &amp; that Fortitude wch
consists in Conquering, not in Suffering,
(for these two differ one from another
more then Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his two <hi>Cardinals</hi> in
<hi>Hats,</hi> from those two in <hi>Caps</hi>) whereas
the Bishops Historian gives the Palm to
<hi>Innocence,</hi> Innocence which is no less a
stranger to the use of Swords and Guns
then the naked <hi>Indian!</hi> this and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
<hi>Reputation</hi> were the <hi>Bishops Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
Your Weapons of Offence, and your
<hi>good old Fox</hi> you would have girt him
with, you might have reserv'd for some
of your Pulpit-Officers, who made less
use of the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> when they
fought under the Banner of the <hi>Lord of
Hosts,</hi> (so they call'd the Earl of <hi>Essex).</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> places most of his Art
in the various Representations of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and in entertaining your eye with
Encounters betwixt the great <hi>Hobby-Horses</hi>
and the <hi>Foot,</hi> or your ear with the
Battle in <hi>Recitativo</hi> (which resembles not
a little your Troops singing of <hi>Psalms</hi> in
their Marches) nay he gives it as one of
the greatest <hi>Elogiums</hi> to his Play, that it
<hi>shal Drum, Trumpet, shout</hi> &amp; <hi>Battle, I gad, with
any of the most Warlike Tragedies Ancient or
Modern.</hi> But in the Bishops Panegyrick, We
hear of nothing but the softer sounds of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64322:8"/>
Peace, and a happy Composure of those
Divisions which have too truly made the
Catholick Church Militant: An Union,
or at least an Accommodation, between
the Churches of Christendom, was one
of those glorious <hi>Enterprises,</hi> and <hi>great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi>
which the Bishops <hi>active and spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mind</hi> was butied in; and for such <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
and Attempts</hi> (Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> and you
call nothing <hi>Enterprising,</hi> but going to
Fifty-Cuffs with Armies) you enviously
compare him to the Bishops of <hi>Munster,
Strasbonrg</hi> and <hi>Colen,</hi> and might with as
much shew of reason to the three Kings
of <hi>Colen,</hi> and that had been <hi>Majestick</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ay and greater to the Ear then the
<hi>two Kings of Brainford,</hi> for that had been
<hi>three Kings of one Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then the Animadverter adds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they symbolize <hi>in their Contempt and
Quarrelling of all others, though of their own
Profession.</hi> The Bishops Panegyrist, 'tis
true has exprest some Contempt, and
not unjustly of the <hi>Army-Divines,</hi> and of
such as were admir'd by the <hi>Elue</hi> and
<hi>White Apron'd Auditories;</hi> but this will not
amount to <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi> Nor
can I conceive that every Cashierd Red-Coat
once listed for a Levite, or every
broken Shop-keeper made free of the
Preaching-Trade, without serving a just
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64322:8"/>
               <hi>Apprenticeship</hi> in it, has a Title to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
so sacred as our Writers is, and
except only this unconsecrate Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Clergy,
these Reverend Divines of the
Shop and the Camp, I know of none that
the Author of Ecclesiastical Policy quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
with.</p>
            <p>The next reason is, <hi>because our Divine the
Author, manages his Contest with the same Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Civility which the Poets and Players
have practised of late in their several Divisions.</hi>
Here it is with the <hi>same Civility,</hi> and yet
in the very next page he tells us, that Mr.
<hi>Bayes</hi> is more <hi>Civil</hi> then to say, <hi>Villain</hi> and
<hi>Caitiff,</hi> and yet these are not so <hi>tuant</hi> as
<hi>Malapert Chaplain, Buffoon-General</hi> (and
because it is an accomplishment to rail in
more Languages then one) <hi>Opprobrium
Academiae</hi> and <hi>Pestis Ecclesiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last is, <hi>because both their Talents do
peculiarly lie in exposing and personating
the Nonconformists.</hi> And who so fit to be
brought upon the Stage as the <hi>Pulpit-Players,</hi>
and those Religious <hi>Mimicks</hi> that
personated the Gravity of Divines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Habits. Whom can our Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
more deservedly expose, then those
that turn'd the Church into one. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astiques
of the Sock and Buskin! To
deny that they were <hi>Actors,</hi> were to
question Nature that gave them <hi>Vizors</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64322:9"/>
for Faces. Certainly <hi>Lacys</hi> best <hi>Grimaces</hi>
were never so Artificial as the <hi>Squints</hi> of
a Humiliation Saint, and Mr. <hi>Scruple</hi> in
the Pulpit has mov'd more to Laughter
then on the Stage. Such has been the
good fortune of your eminent Preachers,
that their Sermons have been <hi>Acted</hi> with
the same applause at the Theatre, which
they have had in the Church, and been
at the same time diversion to the Court,
and edification to the Saints. But yet
what the Play-house gives us, is but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition</hi>
of their excellent <hi>Notes,</hi> and we
must confess, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Tribulation</hi> are
<hi>Copies</hi> short of their <hi>Originals.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of a <hi>Thanksgiving-Romance</hi> have far
exceeded the boldest of our <hi>Heroick-Plays,</hi>
and no Farce yet was ever compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to one with <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Vses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have been somewhat the larger in
the examination of this Character, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our Farce-Poet (in imitation of
the <hi>French</hi> no donbt) has made but one
Person considerable in his Play, and the
rest as it were, but Attendants on him;
for besides Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his part, we have
only <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning, Prince Volscius</hi>
and <hi>Draw-Can-sir Transpros'd,</hi> and what is
most observable here, is the fixing the
Characters so, that one man may Act any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64322:9"/>
of these Parts, nay one man may Act
them altogether; for the Writer of the
Preface is to present Mr. <hi>Bayes, Draw-Can-sir,
Prince Volscius,</hi> and <hi>Thunder</hi> and
<hi>Lightning</hi> all at one and the same time.
A notable and compendious peice of Wit
indeed; for by this means we have a
whole Play Acted by one man, and if our
Clergy-man under the notion of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
may present five several Persons,
why not ten, twenty, thirty, and so on
till he represent an Army in <hi>Disguise,</hi> and
by degrees at last the whole <hi>Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi>
(that's greater than a single Army)
now if Seculars be invested with the like
power of representing Pluralities, one
man may go for the <hi>Representative,</hi> not
only of one <hi>Shire,</hi> but of all <hi>England,</hi>
and by consequence a single <hi>Burgess</hi> may
sit for the whole <hi>Parliament</hi> (this you
may call a <hi>Parliament Individuum</hi> to match
it with your <hi>Synodical Individuum.</hi>)
But this it seems is the <hi>new way</hi> of Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
First the Gentleman claps a <hi>pair of
Boots</hi> on the Clergy-mans legs, and so he
personates <hi>Prince Volscius,</hi> and is sent on a
Journey to <hi>Knights-Bridge</hi> (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you'l hear by and by, he is not gone
neither) anon he arms him with Sir <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
sword,</hi> and then he is the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64322:10"/>
               <hi>Draw-Can-sir</hi> (you forget that wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sword is against the Canons) and
after this had he planted a Ruffe upon
his neck, under that he might have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<hi>an Army Incognito;</hi> unless that this
Army might better lye encamp'd in his
Collar of Fortifications <hi>Sheerness, Inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp;c.</hi> (which he has hung about our
Authors neck for a <hi>Collar of Nesses.</hi>) This
I must confess is more Magnificent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it represents the Army, and their
Trenches too. Thus it is but acting
a different Dress and Equipage, and the
same man is a <hi>Riding Prince,</hi> a <hi>Heroe,</hi> and an
Army in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> in his <hi>booted</hi> capacity
he is <hi>Prince Volscius,</hi> in his <hi>Sworded Draw-Can-sir,</hi>
a pair of <hi>Buskins</hi> thus may perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
a whole <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and a single <hi>Sock</hi> a
<hi>Comedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this notable Art of <hi>Summing up an
Army in one Man,</hi> the Gentleman no doubt
has learnt from the Schools, which tell
us, That from a Muster of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
and several <hi>Individuals,</hi> we come to frame
a Character of bulky <hi>Vniversals;</hi> and if
so, that one man in different capacities
may act severall Persons; no question
but in many more, he may personate
<hi>Mankind</hi> (which in the <hi>Malmsbury</hi> Stile
is but <hi>Artificial man</hi>) for so great a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64322:10"/>
is there in this way of Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Symbols,</hi> and Hieroglyphical Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures;
that not only every variation
of Dress, but every Change of Posture
alters the property of the Actor, better
than a <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rriwig</hi> or a false <hi>Beard.</hi> Thus
the Philosophers have wisely taught us
to distinguish betwixt <hi>Peter standing,</hi> and
<hi>Peter Sitting;</hi> and the <hi>Transposer of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal</hi>
without all controversie will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us, that the same man that <hi>sitting in a
Chair,</hi> and pulling on <hi>one Boot,</hi> personates
<hi>Prince Volscius,</hi> may, when he is prostrate
on the ground, present <hi>Prince Pretty-man</hi>
intranc'd.</p>
            <p>Now having had our <hi>Geneva</hi> Jigg, let
us advance to our more serious Councils.
First then, after <hi>beating up of the Pulpit-Drums
through the Ecclesiastical Camp, Draw-Can-sir</hi>
(an Army in Himself) enters the
Lists against <hi>Hungaria, Transylvania, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,
Poland, Savoy, France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands,
Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and all <hi>Scotland,</hi> (for
these, besides many more, he encounters
in the <hi>disguise</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi>) and
to avoid the dull prolixity of relations
of Squadrons here, and Squadrons there,
<hi>their Forces rang'd in Battalia, their Cannon
plac'd, the Charge sounded,</hi> and the Alarm
given.</p>

This, now, is not improper I think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Reader knows all these Towns

Clergy. And thus far in imitation of Mr.
<hi>Bayes</hi> his <hi>singing-Battel,</hi> and though his
way of fighting in <hi>Recitativo</hi> is very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet, if this were represented with
<hi>Bag-pipes</hi> (instead of <hi>Lutes</hi>) and sung to
the tune of a Psalm, I think, you would
grant it a little better. But if this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of a Battle won't do, <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64322:11"/>
Bayes</hi> (for all this is but a <hi>Scene</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
with a little alteration from his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal,</hi>
as you may see <hi>p. 42. 43. 188. 202.
203.</hi> of his <hi>Play-book</hi>) has contriv'd it
the other way too, and here, if I am not
mistaken, you will have fighting enough.
You must imagine then after a terrible
Sea-fight pass'd betwixt <hi>Draw-Can-Sir,</hi>
(Who single mannes a Navy) &amp; an <hi>Armada</hi>
of <hi>New-England</hi> Divines (conceal'd in a
Fleet of Colliers) and many a Broad-side
of one whole Gun fir'd; a desperate
Land-sight to ensue between the same
numerous <hi>Draw-Can-Sir,</hi> and the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational</hi>
Forces of the <hi>Swiss, Scotch, French,
Dutch, Bohemian,</hi> and <hi>Genevois;</hi> in this Fray
many a <hi>Monsievr Huguonot</hi> falls to the

Ruff, and many a <hi>Scotch Kirkman</hi> his
Blue Bonnet: here lies an Ecclesiastical
<hi>Butter-box</hi> frying in his own grease, and
there a Brawny <hi>Swiss</hi> Divine, (stript of
his Red and yellow Breeches) weltring
in gore with a plump <hi>Bohemian;</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<hi>the Nonconformists bad need desire a
truce to bury their Dead Nay, there are none
left alive to desire it: but they are slain every
Mothers Son of them:</hi> And now that <hi>Draw-Can-sir,</hi>
striding over the dead Army, and
brandishing his Sword, had Proclaimed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64322:12"/>
his Triumph, <hi>I kill whole Nations, I slay
both Friend and Foe,</hi> and you would expect
that he had <hi>Hector'd</hi> and <hi>Achilliz'd</hi> em all
out of the Pit, and routed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the delivery of a <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> Mr.
<hi>Bayes,</hi> to surprize you in the very Nick,
tells you, <hi>that they are but stounded perhaps,

sooner spoke the word, Rise, Sirs, and
go about your business; but all on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
up they get, Horse and Foot, some
upon their leggs, and some upon none,
and away. There's ago off for you, this
can be a Miracle to none that have heard
of a certaine Note, that Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> has
made in <hi>Effaut flat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Critical People</hi> there were, that
took the liberty the other day, to examin
your <hi>Romantick</hi> Tales, and one amongst
the rest, who could not chuse but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the sad sate of the Nonconformists
that were forc'd to follow the wheels of
<hi>Draw-Can-Sirs</hi> Chariot, was very curious
to know why whole Nations, as <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Transylvania, Bohemia,</hi> &amp;c. would
suffer this <hi>Hero</hi> to use them so scurvily.
Phoo! reply'd a Friend of the <hi>Transpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi>
that is to raise the Character of
those Nations; for they were such as
Triumphed in their being knockt oth'
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64322:12"/>
head; an Army of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> provided
with no other Armes then <hi>Prayers</hi> and
<hi>Tears;</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 303.</note> and what defence could these be
against a hard harted Infidel, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to Law, Justice, or Numbers,
would put them all to the Sword, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on their bare knees for Quarter? One
of the company would not let that pass
so, but told us, that <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi>
were a sort of weapons anciently in use
among the <hi>Primitive</hi> Christians, before
Bows and Arrows came up, but unknown
to the Moderns for this many years, as
much as any of <hi>Pancirollus</hi> lost Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
slighted they were at first 'tis
thought, because they were not for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch;
for a good murdering Cannon
does more execution in one hours time,
then <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> use to do in many
Ages: the <hi>German</hi> Churches therefore,
and some of their Neighbours, found a
certain composition of <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Charcoal,</hi>
more necessary for the carrying on their
<hi>Reformation</hi> then all the antiquated Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
of the Ancient Christians. Captain
<hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> converted more
with Swords and Guns, then with their
<hi>sweaty Preaching,</hi> and these are the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Armes they have bequeathed to all
their followers in <hi>Transylvania, Hungary,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64322:13"/>
Bohemia, Poland, Savoy, France,</hi> the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
Denmark, Sweden, Scotland, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
and <hi>Germany.</hi> But this increases my
wonder, sayd his next Neighbour, that
<hi>Draw-Can-Sir,</hi> unless he were Inchanted
and Cannon-proof, should with his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Arm defeat so vast an Army, and so
well appointed! Ay, reply'd he that
spoke last, but he defeated only <hi>Geneva</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the other ten Nations
virtually and inclusively. But is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
answer'd another, that the greater
should be included in the less, and that
an Army compacted of ten different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
should be drawn out of <hi>Geneva</hi> and
<hi>Germany.</hi> Alack, alack, said I, that was
upon the moderating part, you must
conceive Sir, this is <hi>elevate,</hi> this is the
<hi>new may</hi> of writing, for the <hi>Hungarians,
Transylvanians, Bohemians, Poles, Savoyards,
French, Netherlanders, Danes, Swedes,</hi> and all
the <hi>Scots,</hi> lay concealed in <hi>Geneva</hi> and
<hi>Germany.</hi> But is not this, says one, a
thing somewhat difficult to keep this
Spiritual Army thus conceal'd? Not
at all, answers another, to continue on
the mirth, if they made the <hi>German</hi> and
<hi>Geneva</hi> Hosts their Friends. But this we
took fora <hi>Play-Conceit ill Transpros'd.</hi> Some
therefore there were that spoke of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64322:13"/>
               <hi>unhoopable</hi> Tun of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> some of Sir
<hi>Politick</hi>'s comprehensive <hi>Tortoise,</hi> and some
of Sir <hi>Iohn Falstaff</hi>'s more capacious <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basket:</hi>
in short, after many reasonings
and debates, while some said one thing,
some another, a Gentleman in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
to put a period to the descourse,
told us, that <hi>Wesiphalia</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> bred
a Number of very large Hoggs, and the
greater part of those being but Ratt-Divines,
might be stow'd in the fair
quarters of their Bacon-Buttocks, as
commodiously as that Army of Ratts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gammon'd
in the fat Hanches of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian</hi>
Sow; and with this pleasant so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
the Company was dismist well
satisfied.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, after this, the Reader may
judge, how largely the <hi>Rehearsal</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to your controversial <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Knight-Errantry</hi> of your faith;
for to recapitulate. <hi>Pag.</hi> 42, 43. You sum
up a whole Battell in two Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
so lively, that any one would swear,
not only ten Thousand men, but ten Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and more, were at it, realley en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd:
for besides <hi>Hungary, Transilvania,
&amp;c.</hi> many more, which for brevity, you
omit (as the Churches of <hi>New Atlantis</hi> and
<hi>Vtopia</hi>) are included under <hi>Germany,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64322:14"/>
               <hi>Geneva</hi> (that is virtually as <hi>Maggots in
Filberds.</hi>) Nay, what is more monstrous
yet, the united Armies of ten Nations,
(like <hi>Falstaffe</hi>'s Buckram-men) have star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of three; for the six first, <hi>Hungary,
Transilvania, Bohemia, Poland, Savoy, France,</hi>
fight under the Standard of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church;
and <hi>Scotland</hi> under the <hi>English,</hi>
and only <hi>Sweden, Denmark</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>
(that sounds more pompous
than the 7. <hi>Provinces</hi>) have listed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one of your bold strokes; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is <hi>p. 188. When you have rang'd all your
forces in Battle, when you have plac'd your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
when you have sounded a Charge and given
the word to fall upon the whole party; if you
could then perswade every particular person of
them, that you gave him no provocation; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this were an excellent, and a new way of your
inventing, to conquer single, whole Armies.</hi>
To see the superfetatious Miracles of
Art here in the Accumulative Vertues of
a single <hi>Hero!</hi> He ranges his multiply'd
self (Horse and Foot) in battell array,
he places all his Cannon (with fewer
hands than <hi>Briareus</hi> by 98.) and in the
same breath, sounds a Charge (with as
many Trumpets as mouths) and gives
the Signal to himself to fall on; this you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64322:14"/>
may boldly challenge for your <hi>non ultra,</hi>
it is as high as you can go.</p>
            <p>So, now come in <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi>
that is, the Bishops Historian in those
two shapes; and this way of making one
Person represent a Dialogue between
two, is very artificial indeed, yet this
is perform'd with a little alteration
of the voyce (for besides the diversity
of dress and posture, that of the Tone
and Accent is no less considerable in an
Actors Representation of many Persons
at one and the same time) 'tis but rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in a big and hoarse voyce, <hi>I am the
bold Thunder;</hi> then squeaking in a shrill
and tender, <hi>the brisk Lightning I,</hi> and the
business is done; this now if you mark
it, is extraordinary fine, and very appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to the Bishops Historian; for he
saith, <hi>Some that pretend a great interest in
the holy Brotherhood descry Popery in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and usual chance; a Chimney cannot take
fire in the City, or Suburbs, but they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
crying Iesuits and Fire-balls.</hi> Now
what does our <hi>Transproser</hi> do, but <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse</hi>
this thus,
<q>
                  <l>I strike Men down.</l>
                  <l>I fire the Town.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where, by the way, it is a marvel our
Author, when he call'd his Book, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64322:15"/>
REHEARSAL TRANSPROS'D, forgot
to add, the PREFACE to Bishop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>'s
Vindication TRANSVERS'D, that
double Elegancy would have been as
pretty as two Flowers growing on one
stalk. And this I mention the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I sind he is a profest Critick in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
for <hi>pag.</hi> 308, 309. observing, by
chance, the Title age of this Book. <hi>A
Rationale upon the Book of Common-Prayer, of
the Church of</hi> England, <hi>by</hi> A. Sparrow,
D. D. <hi>Bishop of</hi> Exon. <hi>With the forme of

might have atton'd for all) <hi>in Chancery-Lane.</hi>
This he tells us, was an <hi>Emblem</hi>
how much some of them neglected the
Scripture, in respect to their darling
Ceremonies: So that the Animadverter
cannot be better employed next, than in
writing another Book of Animadversions
upon <hi>Title-Pages.</hi> And because it is a
Task so agreeable to his Genius, I could
wish, if all other preferments fail, the
Gentleman might be advanced to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of <hi>Title-Licenser,</hi> (then <hi>Robert Pawlet</hi>
and <hi>Iames Collins</hi> might shut up their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64322:15"/>
Shops, for any trading in <hi>Rationales,</hi> or
<hi>Ecclesiastical Policies</hi>) and if he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
sufficiently qualified to discharge
this trust; I would have him removed
next (or if he please, <hi>Translated</hi>) to the
greater Dignity of revising Prefaces, if
he be not averse from that, because <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,</hi>
as well as <hi>Epistles Dedicatory,</hi> fell
under the inspection of Arch-Bishop
<hi>Laud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But seriously had not our Author En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
his Pamphlet, the REHEARSAL
TRANSPROS'D, we could have given it
a more express Name (unless there be
some mystery more than ordinary,
couch'd in the word TRANSPROS'D)
which is the REHEARSAL TRANS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCRIB'D,
for in <hi>Transcribing</hi> more Verses
of the REHEARSAL, than he hath <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros'd,</hi>
his Play-Observations seem rather
to have answer'd the latter Title. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

words of the Writer, <hi>He knows not which
way his mind will work it self, and its thoughts</hi>
amounts to no more than this; that our
Clergy-man was taken violently with a
fit of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and being sick of
Prince <hi>Volscius</hi> his disease, there was no
other cure, but this Charm,
<q>
                  <l>Go on, cries Honour, tender Love says, Nay:</l>
                  <l>Honour aloud commands, pluck both Boots

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And though the Writer protested <hi>He
was neither Prophet nor Astrologer enough to
foretell</hi> what he would do; the Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adverter
(being both) tells us it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely,
<q>
                  <l>For as bright Day with black approach of Night</l>
                  <l>Contending, makes a doubtfull puzzling Light.</l>

Though the Verses come in to no more

            </p>
            <p>Again, for <hi>Bayes</hi> his Verses will serve
for all occasions, as well as his Prologue,
for all Plays, <hi>pag.</hi> 202. he has borrowed
these from the <hi>singing Battle.</hi>

            <q>

            </q>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> (as you tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 17.)
was more <hi>civil</hi> then to say <hi>Villain,</hi> he
might have taught his Actors better
manners. All these, (besides the two
last verses of the event of the Battle) you
have diligently Collected, and for the
most part faithfully transcribed, unless
in these last recited, where for <hi>Gonsalvo</hi>
in the <hi>Rehearsal,</hi> you have put in <hi>Valerio,</hi>
and by the alteration of that one word,
have made it your own, just so Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>
us'd to do with many a good notion in
<hi>Montaign</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tragedies: yet
though your Title promise us so fairly,
you have not <hi>Transpros'd</hi> three whole
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64322:17"/>
Verses in all your Book. But be it the
<hi>Rehearsal Transpros'd,</hi> or <hi>transcrib'd,</hi> or if
you will, <hi>Reprinted,</hi> for your Pamphlet
is little else but a <hi>Second Edition</hi> of that
<hi>Play,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> his Tract of <hi>Schism:</hi>
though methinks you might have so
much studied the Readers diversion, and
your own, as to have exercised your
happy talent of <hi>Rhyming,</hi> in <hi>Transversing</hi>
the Treatise of <hi>Schism,</hi> and for the Titles
<hi>dear sake</hi> you might have made all the
Verses rung <hi>Ism</hi> in their several changes.
I dare assure you Sir, the work would
have been more gratefully accepted than
<hi>Donns Poems</hi> turn'd into <hi>Dutch,</hi> but what
talk I of that, then <hi>Prynnes Mount Orguil,</hi>
or <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradise lost</hi> in blank Verse.
But as it is, you give us quotations of
whole Books, like him who wrote <hi>Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi>
quite out from the beginning to the
end, professing it was so good he could
leave none behind (how like is this to
our Transcriber, <hi>yet whatsoever I omit, I
shall have left behind more material passages,</hi>
before his Edition of <hi>Hales,</hi> p. 176.) It
is no absurdity now to say, your
Text is all Margent, and not only all
your Dishes, but your Garnish too is
<hi>Pork.</hi> And thus much for your <hi>Regula
Duplex,</hi> changing Prose into Verse, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64322:17"/>
Verse into Prose, that's your first Rule.
Your second Rule, is the rule of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or Record, by way of Table-book.
As thus, in my <hi>Observation</hi> (say
you <hi>p.</hi> 168.) <hi>if we meet with an Argument in
the streets,</hi> (An <hi>Argument!</hi> how civil that is
for a brawl, so modest, so gent!) <hi>both Men,
Women</hi> &amp; <hi>Boys, that are the Auditory,</hi> (that's
well, but Congregation would have bin
better) <hi>do usually give it on the modester side;
and conclude, that he that rails most, has
the least reason.</hi> Very subtilly concluded
by our Observer, the <hi>Boys,</hi> and the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men!</hi>
Now I had thought that in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
betwixt the Oyster-women and
the Opponent <hi>Tankard-bearers,</hi> the cause
had ever been carried with confidence &amp;
Noise, and that the Rabble adjudg'd the
Victory on their side, who manag'd the
dispute with the greatest clamour and
violence, prosecuting the baffled Scold,
that is the <hi>modester,</hi> with stones &amp; hooting.
But I will allow our Authors experience
in the Rabble-Affairs to be greater, as
having been a frequent &amp; assiduous Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
of these little broyles of the Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality.
He has told us where to find
the contemplative man, at the head of a
troop of <hi>Boyes</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> in the corner
of a Street, his Table-book out, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64322:18"/>
his hand and eyes very busie in remarking
the petty disorders of a Riot. This is
his Diary, in which our small Historian
registers the proceedings of every Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burb
Tumult; in this he summs up all
the <hi>Billinsgate</hi> Debates and Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
'Tis his scolding Common-place-book,
which acquaints him with all the
Moods and Figures of Railing; here he
has all the terms of that Art which <hi>Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimnuus,
Marchmont Needham, I. Milton,</hi> or
any other of the Professors ever thought
of, for there is a certain form &amp; Method in
this as well as all other Arts; but yet,
our Author being a well-wisher to the
Railers, to encourage those that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inclination this way, to improve that
faculty, assures them. <hi>Pag. 261. That the

in other things your knowledge may be

hath it naturally. It is but crying Whore first,
and having the last word.</hi> Next he instructs

am confident, that Fellow in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>

that busied himself to find out how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
several ways the Letters in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
might be rang'd, tranpos'd &amp; alter'd,
could not invent more changes of the
Letters, than he has in instructing them
to scold; There is yet another by which
dumb men may be taught to rail, that
is by Signs, (for there is a Language of
the Hand and Head.) This is <hi>pag.</hi> 160.

he slips into a Coffee-house, leaving
the Rabble to the following Adventures
of the day.</p>
            <p>Here, placing himself at the Tables-end,
and calling for a dish of Coffee, which
no sooner brought, but after a short
grace, drunk up; he exalts his <hi>Superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liums,</hi>
and vexes his formal <hi>Beard,</hi> to make
his Face look like the <hi>Turks</hi> in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the <hi>Dish,</hi> (for by that <hi>Glass</hi> the
<hi>Sages</hi> lean to <hi>dress</hi> themselves in their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
looks) insomuch that the Coffee-Boy,
who had all this while intentively
observ'd the Affectations of our Man of
Gravity and Understanding, had much
ado to forbear asking him, whether, that
was not his Picture which his Master had
hung out, imagining, as he well might,
that he had sat for the Coffee-house Sign.
To proceed, the Gazett being examin'd,
and many Political Discourses pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
our Intelligent <hi>Sophy,</hi> and the more
judicious Boy, (for this little Officer you
must suppose is his principal Camerade,
as being of greater quality then those
that make up his Street-<hi>Auditory,</hi> and no
less then our Authors Library-keeper).
I say after several facetious reflections on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64322:20"/>
both sides, on the <hi>Polish</hi> King, and his
Cross-legg'd Parliament of Taylors,
(manag'd in the style of <hi>Prince Prettyman</hi>
and <hi>Tom Thimble</hi>) and many other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
too long to relate; Company
coming in, and the house beginning to
fill, <hi>more Coffee</hi> is the word, and away
goes our Authors Camerade. By this
time, the Politick Cabal-men were most
of 'um set, and all the Rooms rung with
nothing but a continued Noise of <hi>Arcana
Imperii,</hi> and <hi>Ragioni di <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some think, most of our late Forms
of Government were model'd, and there
are, that say, <hi>Machiavel</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> was
born in a Coffee-house) And now one
sinks the <hi>Dutch</hi> in a dish of Coffee, and
another beheading the clean Pipes, prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticates
the fate of <hi>De-Wit</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Putten,</hi>
a third blows up a <hi>Fire-ship</hi> with
a provident <hi>Whiff</hi> of Tobacco, and a
fourth pouring a flood of Rheume upon
the floor, opens the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Sluces.
Many secret Intrigues were whisper'd
too close to be heard, but amongst all,
none we so loud, as a Junto of Wits, that
had seated themselves near our Author:
while they were ingaged in a very warm
dispute, the Man of Observations draws
out his Table-book ('tis his most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64322:20"/>
Tool) making all this while as he
minded nothing, but no sooner had the
Wits spoke of the <hi>Designes</hi> and <hi>Enterprises</hi>
of the Bishops of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Strasburg:</hi>
Oh ho (says he) are you there abouts, I
think these are Bishop <hi>Bramhalls</hi> fellows,
or any an <hi>enterprising</hi> Bishops of'um all;
pop, he slaps them down, and makes
them his own; and as they went on with
the <hi>Attempts</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Munster:</hi>
So, there's another, I shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it'em for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
now I warrant you, and pricks
him down. Bishops he knew they were,
and <hi>enterprising designing</hi> Bishops; but
never minded whether their <hi>Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
or <hi>Designes</hi> were of the same nature
with Bishop <hi>Bramhalls,</hi> or whether they
acted in the like Capacity. If the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
cannot find out that themselves, ev'n
let'em alone for <hi>Bayes.</hi> Resolv'd it seems
he was, come what would, to drag them
by main force into his Book, and he has
thrust'em in accordingly, by head and
shoulders, two of them in one place; but
of this he repents him afterwards, and
says, he <hi>was too prodigal of his Bishops;</hi> but
if the Gazett Commentators had furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Man with any more, you should
have had them freely, and what can be
more reasonable? Where the Writer of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64322:21"/>
the Preface tells us, that Bishop <hi>Bramhall
finished all the glorious designs that be under-took.</hi>
This says he, might have become
the Bishop of <hi>Munster;</hi> though he, we all
know, has not accomplish'd all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs;
but our Author had never another
Bishop left, and he must stop the gap,
or no body, therefore to bring himself,
and his Bishop off, he tells us, it might
have <hi>become him, before he had raised the
Siedge from Groningen.</hi> Nay, then it is
well enough, if it might have become
him at all. But if yet you think these
Bishops are not like Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> he
can dress up Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi> like these
Bishops, and because his <hi>reputation and
Innocence were Armour of Proof against Tories
and Presbyterians,</hi> he arms him with a good
old Fox, (mark, here is Innocence with
a Sword by its side,) and let any one
judge now, whether Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> in
our Authors accoutrements, be not very
like the Bishops of <hi>Cologne, Strasburg,</hi> and
<hi>Munster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ditto,</hi> (for we are yet in the Gazett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>style,
and our Scene is still in the
Coffee-house) <hi>We have advice, that the
French, after a small dispute, forcing the
Dutch from their Post, gained the passage over
the</hi> Bettuwe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I foresaw this all along
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64322:21"/>
(says a <hi>Vertuoso</hi>) this is <hi>Momba</hi>'s and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Groots</hi>
doings, to leave this passage open
and ungarded. My life for yours (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys
another supping up his Coffee, and
scalding his chaps for hast) this is a Plot,
I plainly see't, a Plot of the <hi>Arminian</hi>
Party; this has been a brewing any time
this Thirty years and upwards, thus it
always has been, and thus it always will
be, as long as any of the Race of <hi>Barnevelt</hi>
and <hi>Grotius</hi> are left alive. I gad, Sir, and
you speak a great deal of Truth (says our
Coffee-house Notary, whose hand was
moving all this while) these <hi>Arminians</hi>
are the rudest ill bred'st persons, and
all that, in the whole world. There has
been a party of'em in <hi>England,</hi> that shall
be nameless; of such a Pontifical stiffness,
as if they were Companions for none
but Princes and Statesmen forsooth.
Well, I'le say no more, they shall know
what a Satyrist I am, I'le Lampoon, and
print'em too, I gad. So, out he goes,
leaving the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Calvinistical</hi>
Wits to fight it out at Argument.</p>
            <p>It is not easie to imagine now, with
what pleasure our Author takes a review
of his Forces drawn out in their <hi>Notional</hi>
Parade. Here's a <hi>fantastique</hi> Bishop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
accoutred like a <hi>German</hi> Prelate, at

come over; while those Churches seated
on the frontier of Popery, take Alarm
at their march. Thus having rais'd and

they would be no less to others,
and that no answerer would have the
courage to engage such a <hi>Rhetorical Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi>
unless he were able to give him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in all the Metaphors of War. But
alas, it is not every Fight in Puppet-Shows
strikes a terrour in the beholders,
nor are Armies figured, in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so dreadfull.</p>
            <p>And though I will not deny, that these

our Romancer had quarter'd in the three
Ventricles of his Capacious Brain (his

            <p>No doubt but the thoughts of this

have in calling this <hi>thick drop Serene,</hi> I am

besides the absurdity of his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Divinity, in making <hi>Light</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
with it's Creator, that jingling in

            <p>You see Sir, that I am improved too
with reading the Poets, and though you
may be better read in Bishop <hi>Dav'nants
Gondibert;</hi> yet I think this <hi>Schismatick</hi> in
<hi>Poetry,</hi> though <hi>nonconformable</hi> in point
of Rhyme, as authentick ev'ry jot, as any
<hi>Bishop Laureat</hi> of them all. Tell not me
now, of turning over the moth-eaten Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
or the mouldy Councils: the
<hi>Gazetts</hi> and the <hi>Plays</hi> are fitter Texts for
the <hi>Rehearsal</hi>—Divines (men more
acutely learned than Parson <hi>Otter</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Cutberd</hi> the Canonist) than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of dry Fathers and School-men,
that write in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek;</hi> Romances
are thumb'd more than St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and
<hi>Gondibert</hi> is Dogs-ear'd, while the <hi>Rabbies</hi>
are untoucht. Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his <hi>Ipse Dixit</hi>
will pass, when <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his will not,
and the <hi>Rehearsal</hi> is more universally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
than <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil;</hi> though
they and their Commentators have
taught the World the Mysteries of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicraft,
the Principles of Arts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of Government. This <hi>Mock-Play,</hi>
not only reveals all the Stratagems
of War; all the Policies of Courts, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64322:24"/>
Subtilties of Schools; but is so sufficient
of it self for all Professions, Trades and
Sciences; that if all other Books were
lost, it is conceived they might be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
supply'd from this. It has not
only thrust the Duellist's <hi>Caranza</hi> out
of doors, but the Politicians <hi>Machiavil,</hi>
the School-mans <hi>Scot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and the Soldiers
<hi>Vegetius</hi> too. So compleatly necessary
it is for resolving all Scruples and Cases
of Conscience, that the neglected Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
unregarded and forsaken of all, lye
cover'd over with dust and cobwebs; as
in <hi>Astragons</hi>'s Library, where
<q>
                  <l>—a deep dust (which Time does softly
shed.</l>
                  <l>Where only Time does come) their Covers
bear;</l>
                  <l>On which, grave Spiders, streets of Webs
have spread;</l>
                  <l>Subtle, and slight, as the grave Writers
were.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now my curiosity tempts me to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not a little, why the Poet, after he
had enumerated the <hi>Linguists, School-men,
Natural Philosophers, Moralists, Historians,
Physitians, Civil Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stragon</hi>'s
<hi>Library;</hi> should in the tale omit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64322:24"/>
the mention of the <hi>Dramatists</hi> and <hi>Gazet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers;</hi>
it being a thing wholly unlikely,
that the wise <hi>Astragon</hi> should be unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of such excellent Authors. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefore, that the <hi>Dramatists</hi> must be
included under the Title of <hi>Poets,</hi> and the
<hi>Gazetteers</hi> under the name of <hi>Historians;</hi>
and the latter at least, I am the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to believe, because our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter
(a man of profound learning)
<hi>pag.</hi> 187. tells us, the story of <hi>Macedo</hi>
is matter of <hi>Gazett;</hi> which by the way,
is an important Discovery, as it serves to
correct a popular mistake; for if <hi>Iustin</hi>
and <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> were <hi>Gazetteers,</hi> it is
most certain, <hi>Gazetts</hi> are not so late an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
as is supposed. And of this I
doubt not but our Author can produce
undeniable Testimonies, if any man
should be so bold as to call his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in question; for I presume he has all
the <hi>Gazetts</hi> upon the file, from <hi>Alexander</hi>
the <hi>Great,</hi> to this present Day and Year.
Well, such a Collection is an invaluable
Treasury; but of all the rest, the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Roman Mercuries</hi> best deserve a corner
in a States-mans Cabinet. Who would
not give more for an <hi>Express</hi> from <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi>
or the Letters from <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> then
would purchase the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Leaves, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64322:25"/>
rate the Diurnals of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> at
the price of <hi>Philadelphus</hi> his Library?
How cheap was Fame then, when <hi>Luean</hi>
acquir'd it by <hi>transversing</hi> the <hi>weekly-Posts?</hi>
Who might despair of Honour, when it
cost <hi>Livy</hi> no more than a Body of <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
not much superiour to <hi>Rushworths;</hi>
and <hi>Pliny</hi> procur'd it by setting forth

is a several designe for every Scene, for
sometimes he tells us, that <hi>he accounted it
a work of some Piety to vindicate the Bishops
Memory from so scurvy a Commendation</hi> as the
Writer of the Preface has given; and by
this it should seem, that he has written a
Vindication of the Bishop from the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Politicians</hi> Vindication, and yet
elsewhere he says, that Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi>
so he might (like <hi>Caesar)</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Manage the
Roman Empire at it's utmost extent,</hi> had
quite forgot what would conduce to
the Peace of his own Province and
Country.</q> And again,<q>that he cannot
look upon these undertaking Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
however otherwise of excellent
Prudence and Learning, but as men
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64322:27"/>
struck with a Notion, and craz'd on
that side of their heads, and so he thinks
the Bishop might much better have bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
himself in Preaching, (you can
never magnify that enough) in his own
Diocess, and disarming the Papists of
their Arguments, instead of rebating
our weapons; then in taking an <hi>Oe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

care upon him, which none
call'd him to, and as appear'd by the
sequel, none conn'd him thanks for.</q>
And after proceeds to instruct him, whom
he <hi>believes to have been a very great Politician,</hi>
(a great <hi>Politician,</hi> but a little <hi>craz'd</hi>) in
chalking him out a better way for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
with the same absurdity
as he, who read <hi>Hanibal</hi> a Lecture in the
Art of War. These, if they are Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
I am sure, are <hi>scurvy</hi> ones. And
as <hi>scurvy</hi> as those are, which the Writer
of the Preface has given the Bishop, you
envy him even those, for <hi>p.</hi> 22. you tell
us these improbable <hi>Elogies</hi> (a pretty
word that for <hi>scurvy</hi> Commendations)
are of the greatest disservice to their own
design. <q>For any worthy man (say
you) may pass through the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd

Recommendation; but when he is thus
set off, and bedaub'd with Rhetorick

               </q>find no fault Sir, when
your Picture comes to be drawn, you
shall have no reason to complain, the
Colours are laid too thick; there are
many Wrinckles and Chaps we will not
fill up with the Paint of Art: indeed, to
shape a smooth and well proportion'd
Visage for a <hi>Satyrists</hi> Crooked Body,
would be as preposterous a sight, as a
young Whores face on the neck of an old
Baud. But if the last passage be not
envious enough, what think you of that,

Bishop was) <hi>of the Publick Rites &amp; Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Church,</hi> 
               <q>those things being only
matters of external neatness, could never
merit the Trophies that our Author
erects him. </q>Thus both the <hi>Ecclesiastical
Polititian,</hi> and the <hi>Animadverter</hi> have vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
the Bishop; that is, both diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
vindicate a different Bishop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi>
the one magnisies a Bishop, whose
<hi>Reputation and Innocence were Armour of Proof
against the Tories and Presbyterians;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Bishop with a Sword by his side.
You see now, that the Gentlemans <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

his Modesty (it is his own Bull) <hi>is all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi>
In one place, he saith, he finds
him to <hi>have been a very good natur'd Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and one that comply'd much for peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake,</hi>
and in another, that the <hi>Mediating
Divines</hi> (under these, our Bishop is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended)
<hi>who were not yet past the Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Bottle;
seem'd to place all the business of
Christianity in persecuting men for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</hi>
(He was as much a <hi>Persecuter,</hi> as
the Brethren are <hi>Saints</hi>) 'Twere endless
to recount all the inconsistencies and
contradictions throughout his Book,
and it were an easier task to reconcile the
<hi>Animadverter</hi> and the <hi>Ecclesiastical Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
then the <hi>Animadverter</hi> with himself.
Well, either this Author is several Men,
or at least one Man in several minds.
<hi>Sitting,</hi> he is a Nonconformist, and <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
a Conformist. Every distinct Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Body, and every new wrinkle
in his Forehead produces an answerable
Distortion within. His Laughing Face,
sooner then a light touch of a Pencil can
change it, is turned to a Crying. Nay,
on one side of his Face he often Smiles,
and looks very gravely on the other.
Each turn of his Countenance proves
him a Cheat, and each cast of his Eyes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64322:29"/>
calls him Hypocrite. He pretends to
look directly on the Writer, but squints
on Bishop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and casts a Sheeps-Eye
at Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> and all the Loyal

the Clergy, and Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
from many unworthy and false impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of our Author, if not <hi>Sibthorp</hi> too
in some measure from being thought to
play the Bishop in the States-mans Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
For the truth on't is, he has omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so many material passages, and dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
the rest, that the Story as he has
<hi>castrated</hi> it, is so mutilate and deficient,
as the Narrative which he gives us, <hi>pag.</hi>
285. is not so much Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbots,</hi>
as the Reverend Animadverters. To
look back a little into the occasion of
this <hi>Loan: Rushworth, pag.</hi> 418 of his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Collections</hi> informs us, <q>That the
late King receiving news of the disasters
that had befaln his Uncle, the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> commanded his Councel to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
by what means &amp; wayes he might
fitly and speedily be furnished with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
suitable to the importance of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
(his Allies being weakned &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
threatned with Invasions from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
Hereupon after a Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of divers ways together, they
came to this resolution, that the urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of affairs not admitting the way of
Parliament, the most speedy, equal, and
convenient means were by a generall
<hi>Loan</hi> from the subject, according as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man was assessed in the Rolls of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64322:31"/>
last subsidy. Upon which Result, the
King forthwith chose Commissioners
for the <hi>Loan,</hi> and caused a Declaration
to be publisht, wherein he alledged for
this course of Supply besides other
Reasons, that the urgency of the occasion
would not give leave to the calling of a
Parliament; but assuring the People,
that this way should not be made a Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for the time to come, to charge them
or their Posterity to the prejudice of
their just and antient Liberties, enjoy'd
under his most noble Progenitors, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
thereby to root out of their
minds the suspition that he intended to
serve himself of such ways, to the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Parliaments: and promising
them in the word of a Prince; First,
to repay all such sums of money as
should be lent without Fee or Charge,
so soon as he shall in any ways be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
thereunto, upon shewing forth the
Acquittance of the Collectors, testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Receit thereof. And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That not one penny so borrowed,
should be expended, but upon those
Publick and General services, wherein
every of them, and the body of the
Kingdom, their Wives, Children and
Posterity, have their Personal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest,</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:64322:31"/>
Then he proceeds to the private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
which were given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
besides which, his Majesty
commanded the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>
to draw up other Instructions to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Arch-Bishops, Bishops,
and the rest of the Clergy of this Realm
upon this occasion, in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the people toward a dutiful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
to his Majesties desires. Which
was accordingly performed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and the Instructions thus drawn
up, being approved of by the King
and Council, were sent to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishops
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> with a
command to see them publisht and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperst
in the several Diocesses of their
Provinces. The Instructions are to be
seen at large in Dr. <hi>Heylius</hi> History of
Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> in obedience to these
Dr. <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> as <hi>Rushworth</hi> tells us, <hi>pag.</hi>
422. preacht that Sermon at <hi>Northampton,</hi>
Entituled <hi>Apostolick Obedience,</hi> 
               <q>which he
afterwards printed, and dedicated to the
King, expressed to be those Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which the Doctor first conceived
upon his Majesties Instructions unto all
the Bishops of this Kingdom, fit to be
put in execution, agreeable to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the times; and afterwards
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64322:32"/>
brought forth upon his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for the raising of monies by
the way of <hi>Loan.</hi> And for refusing to
license this Sermon, Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi>
fell under the Kings high displeasure,
and not long after was sequestred from
his Office. <hi>Pag.</hi> 431. and <hi>pag.</hi> 436. the
Arch-Bishop in his own Narrative tells
us, that <hi>Sibthorp</hi> being a man of low
Fortune, conceiv'd that the putting
this Sermon in Print, might gain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at Court, and raise his Fortune
higher, on he went therefore with the
Transcribing of his Sermon, and got
a Bishop or two to prefer this great
Service to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and
it being brought unto the Duke, it
cometh into his Head, or was suggested
unto him by some malicious body, that
thereby the Arch-Bishop might be put
to some remarkable strait: For if the
King should send the Sermon unto him,
and command him to allow it to the
Press, one of these two things would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
That either he should Authorize
it, and so all men that were indifferent,
should discover him for a base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Beast; or he should refuse it,
and so should fall into the Kings indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
who might pursue it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64322:32"/>
as against a man that was contrary
to his Service.</q> Out of this Fountain
(says the Arch-Bishop, if he may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to speak for himself, and not
our Animadverter for him) <q>flow'd all
the water that afterwards so wet.</q> For
Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi> of the Bed-Chamber being
sent from the King to the Arch-Bishop,
with a command that he, and no other
should Licence the Sermon, the Bishop
(in pure obedience to his Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
no doubt) would have declin'd
the Office, and shifted it off to one of his
Chaplains, alleadging very dutifully,
<hi>It was an occupation that his old Master King</hi>
James <hi>did never put him upon:</hi> but in the
end, being urg'd to Licence it himself,
he fram'd several Reasons, why he could
not consent unto it, to which Mr. <hi>Murrey</hi>
two or three dayes after, (having parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
acquainted the King with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections)
brought an answer from his
Majesty. But this not satisfying the
Arch-Bishop, he dismist him with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
that his Majesty would be pleased
to send the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> to
him, that so he might by this means
make known his Scruples. But Mr.
<hi>Murrey</hi> returning after one or two dayes
more, told him, the King did not think
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64322:33"/>
fit to send the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> to him, but
expected he should pass the Book.
While these things proceeded thus slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Arch-Bishop tells us, <q>the minds
of those that were Actors for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of this Book, were not quiet at
Court, that the thing was not dispatcht,
and therefore one day the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> said to the King, Do you
see how this business is defer'd, if more
expedition he not used, it will not be
Printed before the end of the Term; at
which time it is fit that it be sent down
into the Countries.</q> Which so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the King, that the next message
which was sent by Mr. <hi>Murrey,</hi> was, that
if the Bishop did not dispatch it, the
King would take some other course with
him. Whereupon finding how far the
Duke had prevailed, he thought fit to
set down in writing his Objections,
wherefore the Book was not fit to be
publisht, which he did, and sent them to
the King. These Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to answer in Writing, and upon
this the Arch-Bishop flies out into
a Rage, and taxes <hi>Laud</hi> so severely, as
the Animadverten tells us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 286. So
difficult was it for that incomparable
Prelate to fulfil the Will of his Royal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64322:33"/>
and not incur the displeasure of the
Arch-Bishop, who had not only contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuously
refused to conform to the
Command of his Prince, after so many ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
&amp; repeated invitations but justified
his refusal in Writing, and well might we
expect that they who undertook an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
should not escape his sharp Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
for besides that, possibly <hi>Abbot</hi>
(who, as 'tis evident from his Narrative,
had no mean opinion of himself) might
conceit his Scruples unanswerable. In so
doing, they seem'd to disarm him of
all just pretenses, and to call in question
his wilful Denyal. And accordingly he
lays it on with a Vengeance upon Bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> 
               <q>for this man (says he) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives
so well of himself, fram'd an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to my Exceptions,</q> (this was that
which stung him) but to give some
Countenance to it, <q>he must call in three
other Bishops, that is to say, <hi>Durham,
Rochester</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> try'd men for such
a purpose.</q> Why he, that <hi>believ'd so well
of himself,</hi> (though he thrust not himself
upon the undertaking, but was call'd to
it by his Master) should call in three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops to his help, I understand
not. <q>Well, the Confutation seem'd so
strong, that the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64322:34"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Bath,</hi> for reward of their
Service, were sworn of the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</q>
And in the end, the Arch-Bishop
persisting still in his Refusal, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that many things upon his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the Sermon, should be judg'd by the Printed

Phrase is <hi>the under working of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi>)
removed from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to <hi>Foord</hi> in

him, <hi>if ever the Tide turn'd</hi> (a civil expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that, for if ever the Government
chang'd) <hi>he might come to be hang'd for it.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in this appear'd more

not to disallow so much of the <hi>

take a measure of <hi>his refusing to sign it.</hi> And
it is observable, <q>that the Loan being
demanded of the Societies and Inns of
Court, the Benchers of <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne
received a Letter of Reproof, from the
Lord of the Council, for neglecting to
advance the Service in their Society, &amp;
to return the Names of such as were
refractory.</q> 
               <hi>Historical Collections,</hi> p. 422.</p>
            <p>With what justice now can the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter
call this an <hi>Ecclesiastical Loan,</hi>
and tell us, that part of the Clergy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
these <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> instead of the
Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and Statutes of
Parliament, for the whole Quire (saith
he) sung this Tune, <hi>pag.</hi> 294. and yet <hi>pag.</hi>
304. he makes us believe, they sung so
many different Tunes, as the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
never invented more for one Psalm.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64322:35"/>
For there was <hi>Sibthorps</hi> Church, and
<hi>Mainwarings</hi> Church, &amp; <hi>Montagues</hi> Church,
with many more; and all this, whether
more ignorantly or maliciously, 'tis hard
to say, for 'tis manifest this Loan the
King was advised to by his Privy Council
in 1626. Nor was Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> nor any
of those Bishops that Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot
calls tried Men</hi> then of the Council, for
<hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Bath,</hi> were not sworn Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
till 1627. So that he might have

and Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> pag. 294, 295, 296, 301.
were it not impossible for him to speak
well of any but the Tradesmen and the
Forreign Divines. That Bishop was so
far from being a Principal in the matter of
the Loan, that he was no otherwise an
Accessary then as he was employ'd by his
late Majesty in drawing up the <hi>Instructions</hi>
for the Clergy, and penning an Answer to
Arch Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s Exceptions: and as to
his undermining the Arch-Bishop, <hi>Abbot</hi>
himself seems to acquit him, in telling
us, that <hi>all the water which afterwards so wet
him, flow'd from another Fountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Picture of Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> which
the Arch-Bishop has drawn with so black
a Coal, and this Gentleman has Copied, 'tis
done by too ill a Hand, to be thought
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64322:35"/>
to resemble the Life, and what may serve
to convince us of the partiality of the
Painter, is the Character given <hi>Abbot</hi> by
one of our State-Historians, none of
<hi>Lauds</hi> greatest friends; <hi>that his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
remisness, in not exacting strict Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the prescribed Orders of the Church in
point of Ceremony, seem'd to resolve those legal
Determinations to their first Principle of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
and to lead in such a habit of Inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
as the future reduction of those tender
Conscienc'd men to long discontinued Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
was interpreted an Innovation.</hi> From
hence any man may judge, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is to be put upon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishops
Accusation of <hi>Laud,</hi> for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
against the <hi>honest Men that setled the
Truth, (which he call'd Puritanism) in their
Auditors.</hi> For which the good man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<hi>Laud</hi> as a Papist to King <hi>Iames.</hi>
So every stickler for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was term'd in the Language of those
times. But if his <hi>Marrying the Earl of</hi> D.
<hi>to the Lady</hi> R. <hi>when she had another Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
was not the unpardonable Sin, it
may seem strange that neither the Arch-Bishop,
nor our Writer should absolve
him, when we cannot in charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but God did, upon that his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and Submissive acknowledgment,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64322:36"/>
which we find recorded at large in the
<hi>History of his Life,</hi> p. 59.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, the most inveterate Enemies
of this gallant Prelate have not so blackt
him, as the Pens of the Arch-Bishop, and
our Animadverter; for to report him to
the World in the 1 Character, Sir <hi>E. Deering</hi>
tells us, <hi>he had muzzled Fisher, and would
strike the Papists under the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t Rib, when he
was dead and gone. And being dead, that
wheresoever his Grave should be,</hi> Pauls <hi>would
be his Perpetual</hi> Monument, <hi>and his own
Book his</hi> Epitaph. Nay, in that infamous
Book call'd <hi>Canterburys Doom,</hi> we are told
that at his Tryal, <hi>he made as Full, as Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
as Pithy a Defence, and spake as much as
was possible for the wit of man to invent, and
that with so much Art, Vivacity and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
as he shewed not the least acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of Guilt in any of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
which were charged upon him. So
eminently remarkable were his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments,
which the most Malicious
could not dissemble, nor the most Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conceal. His sharpest Adversaries
were his boldest <hi>Encomiasts,</hi> and when
they intended Libels, made Panegy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icks.
At the same Bar condemning themselves,
and acquitting this Great Man, who,
after he had been an honour to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64322:36"/>
higest place in our Church (which was
higher yet in being his) was <hi>Translated</hi>
to a more Glorious Dignity in the
Church Triumphant, received therewith
the joyful <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thems</hi> of a Quire of <hi>Angels,</hi>
and <hi>instal'd</hi> in <hi>White</hi> Robes, according
to the usual solemnities of Saints; sent
thither (as it were) before, to assist at
the following Coronation of his Royal
Master, and to set the Crown of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
on the head of that Heroick <hi>Defender
of the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now methinks, our Author, <hi>had he
any spark of Vertue unextinguish'd, should up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
considering these things, retire into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
and there lament and pine away for his
desperate folly; for the disgrace he hath, as far as
in him is, brought upon the Church of</hi> England.
And though the comfort is, <hi>an ill man</hi>
(you may believe him, when he speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself) <hi>cannot by reproaching fix an
ignominy;</hi> yet the same thanks are due to
his honourable Intentions, and his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
are not the less commendable.
For to say the truth, he has out pitcht
the Executioner half a Barr, so dextrous
is he in severing the Head from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at one blow; that were he Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
for the Headmans Office, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
he would carry it in a free Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64322:37"/>
on without the least Opposition; and
so he might become a more serviceable
Member of the Commonwealth, then he
is at present. Seriously, 'tis great pity
a man of such. Accomplishments should
be lost, when no body can deny but he is
every way qualified to fill the Place and
Quality of <hi>Squire Dun.</hi> Especially if they
saw how passing well he lookt in the cast
Robes of a Malefactor, Woe be to the
Bishops if ever he procures a Patent for
that Honour, they cannot in reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any greater favour then to have the
Traytors Quarters removed from the
City Gates, and their own hung up in
the room. Axes are the most necessary,
because the most powerful <hi>Arguments</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Clergy (they confuted him,
whom <hi>Fisher</hi> could not.) Well, these
Bishops are the men have ruin'd all, they
brought the late King to the Block, and
have contributed to all our miseries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since. How came <hi>Cromwell, Ineton,</hi>
and <hi>Bradshaw</hi> trow, to merit their <hi>

Pomps and second Funeral Solemnities?
Sure 'twas through some mistake, that
those who were but Accessaries and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Instruments
of our late troubles
should be thus highly honor'd above the
Principals, the Prelates. No doubt but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64322:37"/>
it was a great Affliction to this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(poor soul) to see the <hi>Heads</hi> of his
<hi>Master</hi> and the other two well deserving
Gentlemen rais'd to that ignominious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
on purpose to be pointed at by
the Beholders, and what is worse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
without their Hats to the rude vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

appears, it was an Exaltation they never
sought, and they have been undeserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanc'd to that Pitch of Greatness;
which Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> and two or three of

they are there, much good may it do

            <p>This Doctrine of <hi>killing Kings in their

your own, it was never broacht before.
And from such unquestionable Principles
may we reduce your Account of the late
War, p. 303. <hi>Whether it were a War of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or of Liberty, is not worth the labour to
enquire. Which-soever was at the top, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was at the bottome; but upon considering
all, I think the cause was too good to have
been fought for.</hi> Which, if I understand
not amiss, is nothing but <hi>Iconoclates</hi>
drawn in Little, and <hi>Defensio Populi Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
in Miniature. Besides, the War as most
gave out at first, was for the removal of
<hi>Evil Councellors,</hi> but because as we are
told, pag. 252 <hi>A new War must have, like
a Book that would sell,</hi> a <hi>New Title,</hi> our
Author who has a singular knack in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Titles</hi> to both, has founded the late
War upon the more specious and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
names of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> These
which he has assign'd for causes of our
Rebellion being the same with those for
which the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> took up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Lawful Soveraigne, 'tis
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64322:38"/>
worth the while to enquire, whether the
Consequences of both were not alike. <hi>Sir
R. Filmer</hi> in his Observations, <hi>touching
Forms of Government,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Low-Country</hi>
Rebellion, delivers himself thus.
<hi>Two things they say, they first fought about,
Religion and Taxes, and they have prevail'd
it seems in both; for they have gotten all the
Religions in Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>endome, and pay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Taxes in the World.</hi> And I wish I could
not say, such was the Freedome of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
impos'd upon this Nation, and
such the Liberty to which we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slav'd:
for the glorious Defenders of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against their King and Country,
seem'd no otherwise <hi>to prevail in both;</hi>
rescuing us from such great grievances as
our Authors <hi>Ecclesiastical Loan,</hi> to the
milder payments of the <hi>Twentieth Part,
Poll-mony</hi> rais'd by <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and <hi>Loans</hi> upon <hi>Publick Faith:</hi> all
which cannot be better exprest then in
the words of our incomparable <hi>Cowley,</hi>
in his <hi>Puritan</hi> and <hi>Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>What Myst'ries of Iniquity do we see?</l>
               <l>New <hi>Prisons</hi> made to defend <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Our <hi>Goods</hi> forc'd from us for <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
sake,</l>
               <l>And all the reall Non-sence which ye
make.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:64322:39"/>
And to shew that through the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Religions</hi> as well as <hi>Taxes</hi> we were
turn'd <hi>Dutch,</hi> the same Poet a little after
in that Satyre.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Twas fear'd, a new Religion would
begin,</l>
               <l>All new Religions now are enter'd in.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So that upon a better Calculation, it
will appear, that the Clergymen have
not been the only Inventors of <hi>New
Taxes</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> therefore let not
them alone arrogate to themselves the
honour of making other Laws in the
room of the <hi>Common Law and Statutes of
Parliament,</hi> for others are to have a share
as well as they, and this Gentlemans
Masters have deserv'd as highly of the
Nation, and ought to be celebrated no
less for <hi>Imprisonments, Fines, Sequestrations,</hi>
and many kind Impositions, all, questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless
for the good of the People. In
comparison of these, the heaviest Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
complain'd of under the power of
the Clergy in the late Kings Reigne,
were <hi>Acts of Grace.</hi> Only so much may
be added in favour of those rigorous
Burthens and Exactions, that they seem'd
to have some colour of Legality at least
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64322:39"/>
from these Doctrines, <hi>that the Elect had
a Right to all,</hi> and <hi>Propriety was founded in
Saintship.</hi> For making themselves the
<hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Elect,</hi> they had an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
title to whatever the <hi>Reprobate</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
and 'tis unreasonable to say they
plunder'd, when they took but their
own; the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> being not so great
<hi>Delinquents</hi> as their <hi>Estates;</hi> so low they
descended, till at last our <hi>Israelites</hi> had
not only a right to the Jewels and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> but to their <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
and <hi>Thimbles</hi> too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither, as far as I can discern, have this
sort of men since his Majesties return,</hi> given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
better Assurances of their Fidelity
and obedience For not withstanding that
his Majesty, to demonstrate he was Heir
no lesse to his Majesties Vertues then his

Silence those offences, which none

to appoint a Conference between the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal

And the other pag. 304. <hi>after all the fatal
Consequences of that Rebellion, which can only
serve as Sea marks unto wise Princes</hi> (not a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64322:41"/>
word of the Rebels) <hi>to avoid the Causes.</hi>
A dutiful Caveat this to <hi>wise Princes</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the causes of Rebelling against their
Subjects. These I presume are <hi>his own,</hi>
till he produce his Authors. And the
same I think of another, which is well
worth weighing, pag. 304. <hi>His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
being a prince truly pious and religious,
was thereby the more inclin'd to esteem and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Clergy. And thence, though himself
of a most exquisite understanding, yet thought
he could not trust it</hi> (does <hi>it</hi> relate to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>)
<hi>better than in their keeping.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this with <hi>pag.</hi> 299. where, he tels
us, the Clery were <hi>Licentious</hi> in their
<hi>Conversation;</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 224. that <hi>some of
the Eminentest of them made an open defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Church of Rome;</hi> and then
tell me if he has not worthily vindicated
his late <hi>Majesties Piety and Religion,</hi> and
whether he was not couragious and bold
in telling his Adversary he feared not all
<hi>the mischief that he could make of this.</hi> 'Tis
well, he has told us the story of the <hi>Ass,
who because he saw the Spaniel play with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
legs, thought himself priledg'd to paw, and
ramp upon his Shoulders;</hi> for it is the best
Apology in his own behalf, and now he
may plead like himself, he does nothing
without a Precedent. True it is, he tels
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64322:41"/>
us, <hi>pag.</hi> 106. that being a man of <hi>private
Condition and breeding, and drawn in to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Kings and Princes, and even our own;
whom, as he thinks of with all duty and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
(which will appear by the sequel) <hi>so
he avoids speaking of either in jest or earnest,
least he should, though most unwillingly, trip in
a word, or fail in the mannerlyness of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</hi>
Thus being conscious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that he should offend, he thought it
a point of discretion as well as good
Manners, to ask Pardon before hand.
For it is very hard for a <hi>Private</hi> man that
has seen no <hi>Kings</hi> but those in the <hi>Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,</hi>
to frame any other address to Princes,
then such as might become <hi>King Phys,</hi> and
<hi>King Ush</hi> of <hi>Branford.</hi> And accordingly so it
happens, for <hi>p.</hi> 310. speaking of the Laws
against Fanaticks, <hi>Hence is it that the Wisdom
of his Majesty and the Parliament must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to after Ages for such a Superfaetation
of Acts in his Raign about the same business.</hi>
This is so high a Complement that he
has pass'd upon the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi>
that I cannot but admire, how one of his
<hi>Private Condition and Breeding</hi> could arrive
to this Degree of Court-ship, especially
considering how well it agrees with
what our <hi>Private</hi> Courtier saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 242.
where he tells us, <hi>these Kings have shrew'd
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64322:42"/>
understandings,</hi> and he is not a <hi>Competent
Iudge of their Actions.</hi> Fie, fie, that's too
modest Sir, you wrong your self too much
<hi>not a Competent Iudge,</hi> O'my word
Sir, but you are, a <hi>great Iudge.</hi> This
Humility does not become such great

            </p>
            <p>And having taken this Liberty with
Princes and Senates, no wonder if the
Gentleman presume to treat the Bishops
(Peers &amp;, Privy-Councellers are his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows)
with a little more Freedom.
Though for what reason he treats the
present Clergy with so little Respect,
may be hard to say, yet as for Bishop
<hi>Lauds</hi> particular, and his course usage of
him, I think I could give a guess, what
mov'd him to it. Not that I believe as
some, that his Quarrel might be the same
with <hi>Archees,</hi> who, they say, was exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
against the Bishop, because he was
whipt at his procurement, for taking too
much Liberty (a Crime much like what
is charg'd upon this Gentleman) or as
others, that he or some of his Family
came sometime in danger of a <hi>Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chamber
Censure,</hi> and hazarded losing
their Ears; but rather upon better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
that there might be no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
occasion for this Picque, then those
several <hi>Cringes</hi> and <hi>Genuflexions</hi> which the
Arch-Bishop (as he thinks) introduced
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64322:43"/>
in the Church, or rather restor'd, and
this I must confess is sufficient ground
for a Grudge, for it is an unreasonable
thing that the Church should expect that
every man of how <hi>private a Condition and
Breeding</hi> soever, and however <hi>unpractis'd</hi>
in the Graceful Motions and Inflections
of his Body, should be conformable to
the <hi>Genuflexions and Cringes</hi> of the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Ecclesiasticks: Every man has not
had the good Fortune to be train'd up at
the Dancing-School, nor so happily Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
as to pull off his Hatt and make a
Leg with an Air. And would they have
these men expose themselves by not
Conforming to the Ceremonies of the
rest of the Congregation, or betray
their Breeding by an aukard Bending of
their Bodies, or an unsightly Bow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claming
at every Rustick Scrape, that
they have not been initiated by a Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
-Master in the common Rudiments
of Civility. No, I am confident that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>English</hi> Protestants, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
those of a <hi>private Breeding</hi> are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from this, that they would decline
coming to their Churches at all first. As
I have known some People somewhat
wanting in the little Decencies of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
avoid Conversation and appearing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64322:43"/>
in Publick. These Persons <hi>naturally affect
a plainness of Fashion,</hi> and a Homeliness
in Worship. And such a Diversity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
such quick Interchanges of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
distract and confound them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that they are like the unquiet Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Postures of one in a sick Bed, and
and really they consult their ease, and
what is more their health; which is not
a little indanger'd by being too Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
and many a violent Cold occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a Citizens sitting bare-headed all
<hi>Service-</hi>while: without the Defence at
least of a pair of Broad-fring'd Gloves
laid a cross, well knowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their
Betters rather then incommode them, in
such a Case will desire their Worships to
be Cover'd. Several other Occasions
there are, that for Conveniency sake may
require a Dispensation, as if a fat Burger
lye under an inevitable necessity of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Wind, (in a Sister'tis not civil to
call it any thing but venting a Sigh at
the wrong end) shall not this tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscienc'd
Man be permitted to strain
a point of <hi>Decorum,</hi> because 'tis in the
Church, rather then hazard a fit of the
Colick? Another thing is, that one Man
may have an Antipathy against Wine that
comes out of a gilt Chalice, and another
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64322:44"/>
against Bread deliver'd to him by the
Hand of one in a Surplice, and will the
Priest be so uncivil, as to cram it down
the throat of that <hi>puling Christian?</hi> The
Clergy certainly cannot be so rude, and
in an <hi>affair of Conscience.</hi> to exact this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
Since <hi>great Persons out of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
will condescend to their Inferiors, and all

to the East as oft as is requir'd, might
not such Gentlemen as our Author be at
a loss, and he that was so far out in his
Situation of <hi>Geneva,</hi> through pure De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
it may be to that Place, direct
his mistaken Reverence towards the
<hi>West,</hi> which though it were <hi>neither Vice

               </gap> unoffended. 'Tis possible

or the Picture of the <hi>Prodigal</hi> in their

to worship the first fine Picture they saw
abroad. This which I have hinted might
be some Cause of his disaffection to

But for his Quarrel at the
present Clergy, I concluded, there must
be some more important Inducement,
and ruminating on many Causes, I had
the lack at last to pitch upon one more
remarkable, why the Clergy fell into his
high displeasure. This Gentleman, it
seems, <hi>not very many years ago, us'd to play at</hi>
Picket; <hi>Now he us'd to play</hi> Pieces (which
was fair for one of a <hi>private Condition,</hi> and

<hi>Lincoln</hi> (as he tells the Story) <hi>who always
went half a Crown with him, and so all the
while he sat on his hand, he very hone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ly</hi> gave
the Sign, <hi>so</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I was alwayes
sure to loose. I afterwards discover'd it, but
of all the Mony that ever I was cheated of in my
Life, none ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ext me so, as what I lost by
this occasion. And ever since,</hi> (as he adds)
<hi>I have born a great grudge against their finger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing that belongs to me.</hi> The Man
is angry, and who can blame him when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64322:45"/>
he had lost his Money. ('Tis usual with
Gamesters to say they're cheated, when
they have lost) He has been bitten it
seems, and Losers may have leave to
speak. I have ever observ'd, that Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
when not favour'd by Fortune, are
the passionatest of men, but never
thought that they could manage a
Wrangle so sharply for 326. pages. Who
would have imagin'd that a Game at
<hi>Picket</hi> could have made so much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif?
for though it may appear uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable,
to dun a Man when he has paid
the last debt to Nature, yet this Book
against the <hi>Dignitary</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> was I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
design'd in his life time, though it
happens I know not how, to come out
against him, after he's dead. And though
it was intended purely for his sake, yet
is it indifferently calculated for Bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> or any of the Gamester Bishops
that <hi>made the best of their Masters.</hi> Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now, that <hi>the Peeks of Players among
themselves, or of Poet against Poet, or of a
Conformist Divine against a Nonconformist, are
dangerous, and of late times have caused great
disturbance; yet I never remarked so irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
and implacable a spirit,</hi> as that of
Gamesters against those that have won
their Mony. 'Tis a Quarrel not to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64322:45"/>
ended with their Deaths, but sets 'em in
Railing Tune for ever, and they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so flippant as in their Curses of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Fortune,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Polititians;</hi>
now we better understand the meaning
of those words. Indeed, it may happen so,
that at one time or other, some of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks
may be drawn in to play with
<hi>Olivers</hi> Servants, you may suppose his
<hi>Clerks</hi> if you will; and knowing the men,
for whether it is that they smell strongly
yet of <hi>Bishops Lands,</hi> or how; they will
make a shift it may be to pay their old
Scores, and wheadle 'em out of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
summe in reparation of their
former losses. In the mean time, this
may be a fair warning to any one of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Breeding,</hi> and unpractis'd in those
little Arts; to take heed he be not rookt
by such <hi>Polititians.</hi> And though when I
game, I confess if I must lose, it is a
thing to me indifferent, whether to a
Clergy-man or another. Yet our Author
is not of my mind. For since he was
chous'd by the <hi>Dignitary</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he's
resolv'd that none of the Tribe shall ever
be the richer for him. And therefore,
hands off my Masters; and pretend not
now the <hi>Power of the Keyes,</hi> for those of
his Coffers hang not at your Girdles.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64322:46"/>
Well, if this Gentleman build no Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
nor endow no Schools, the blame
must lye upon this <hi>Dignitary,</hi> that made
him incapable. Which way the Clergy
will recover their esteem with him, I see
not, unless by some such devise as peecing
the Fortunes of our broken Gamester
with a <hi>Brief,</hi> recommending his Case to
the Charity of well affected People. For
since he is undone by the Church, 'tis all
the reason in the World they should
make him Reparation. But let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loan
to be Reveng'd on them, for since
they have cheated him, they shan't the
Publick. Therefore to make the better
provision for that, he in his Wisdom has
thought fit to exclude them from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with <hi>Parliamentary Aids,</hi> adding in
the close, that <hi>English Men always love to
see how their mony goes</hi> (especially <hi>at Picket)
and if there be any Interest or profit to be got by
it, to receive it themselves.</hi> Very good! The
Man has made a fair speech to be <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x-keeper,</hi>
and 'twas providently done, for
then let who will be the Gamesters, he is
sure to sweep the Stakes. But were it
true what you pretend, that you were
abus'd by the <hi>Dignitary of Lincoln;</hi> which
we have ground enough to suspect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that you have more then once
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64322:46"/>
shown how singularly you can oblige the
Dead; yet what would you gain by it?
Will you thence infer that none of the
Clergy are men fit to be trusted? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that of your Adversaries is here
highly pertinent, and very applicable to
Men of your no Religion. <q>Put the
Case (says he) the Clergy were Cheats
and Juglers, yet it must be allow'd
they are necessary Instruments of State
to awe the Common People into fear
and Obedience, because nothing else
can so effectually enslave them as the
Fear of Invisible Powers, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
apprehensions of the World to
come; and for this very reason, though
there were no other, it is fit they should
be allow'd the same honor and respect,
as would be acknowledg'd their due,
if they were sincere and honest men.</q>
Indeed, should all men remember an
injury as long as you implacable Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
do, or could you perswade the
Rabble to cry, <hi>No Bishops;</hi> as often as
you have ill Luck at Cards, the World
would never be at quiet.</p>
            <p>Whereas, the Gentleman seems dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
with the Temporal Power and
Employments of the Clergy, telling
us <hi>pag. 300. 301. Whether it be or no,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64322:47"/>
that the Clergy are not so well fitted by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as others for Political Affairs, he knows
not; yet it is generally observ'd that things
miscarry under their Government,</hi> &amp;c. This
making a great noise with some People,
I endeavour'd to inform my self the best
I could, concerning the truth of this
Matter, resolving withal, not to receive
Impressions from any of the Clergy, but
<hi>to gather my Lights from the most Impartial
Authorities I could meet with.</hi> And I think
I am now prepar'd, to give our Author
some better satisfaction in this point. If
we look abroad then, we shall find that
Bishops make a part of the three Estates
in all Kingdoms, and that in <hi>Europe</hi> there
are only two Republiques which exclude
the Clergy from medling with Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and the same great Enemies to
Monarchy, namely <hi>Venice</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
Both which our late Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-men
made choice of as conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Models for their new-fangled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
reconciling Church and State
to these disagreeable Platforms. And
here I think it not impertinent to insert
what a <hi>great Wit,</hi> the fore mention'd
Sir <hi>R. Filmer</hi> in his <hi>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:64322:47"/>
(saith he) is sufficiently
known, much need not be said of them:
they admirably agree under a seeming
Contrariety, it is commonly said, that
one of them hath all Religions, and
the other no Religion; the Atheist of
Venice may shake hands with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary
of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> This is the Liberty
that a popular State can brag of, every
man may be of any Religion, or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
if he please, their main Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is exercised only in opposing and
suppressing Monarchy. They both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to exclude the Clergy from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Government, whereas in all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchys,
both before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
and under it, and ever since: all Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
Grecians, Romans, Insidells,
Turks and Indians, have with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
given such respect and reverence
to their Priests, as to trust them with
their Laws. To come nearer home,
In this our Nation (saith he) the first
Priests we read of before Christianity
were the <hi>Druides;</hi> who, as <hi>Caesar</hi> saith,
<hi>decided and determined Controversies, in
Murder, in Case of Inheritance, of Bounds of
Lands, as they in their discretion judged
meet; they granted Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
It is a wonder to see what high
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64322:48"/>
respect even the great <hi>Turk</hi> giveth to
his <hi>Mufti,</hi> or chief Bishop. So neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
(as he concludes) is Religion to
strengthen and direct Laws.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With him concurrs an Honourable
Member at present of the House of
Lords, in a Speech, <hi>about the lawfulness
and conveniency of the Bishops intermedling
in Temporal Affairs.</hi> 
               <q>Never was there
any Nation that employ'd not their
Religious men in the greatest Affairs.
Hereof Christendome hath had a long

Government of the Church. </q>And the

A Bishop, my Lords, is not so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
within the circumference of his
Diocess, that his sometimes absence can
be term'd, no not in the most strict
sense a neglect or hindrance of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no more then that of a Lieutenant
from his County, they both have their
subordinate Ministers, upon which
their influences fall though the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
be remote. Besides, my Lords,
the lesser must yeild to the greater
good; to make wholesome and good
Laws for the happy and well regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Church and Common-wealth,
is certainly more advantagious to both,
then the want of the personal Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Office. And again, The
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64322:49"/>
House of Commons represents the
meanest Person, so did the Master his
Slave, but Bishops have none to do so
much for them, and what justice can
tie them to the Observation of those
Laws, to whose constitution they give
no consent, the wisdom of former times
gave Proxies to this House (the <hi>House
of Lords</hi>) meerly upon this ground, that
every one might have a hand in the
making of that which he had an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to obey. This House could
not represent, therefore Proxies in

            </p>
            <p>And to manifest the better, <hi>that their
immediate dependance upon the King is a
great Obligation he hath upon their Loyalty
aud Fidelity</hi> (whatever our Author says
to the contrary) we need no clearer
proof then this acknowledgment of a
Common-wealahs-man and a <hi>great Wit</hi>
in his Speech against <hi>Richards</hi> Cobler and
Dray-men-Lords, in 59. <q>One of the
main reasons for exclusion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
out of the House of Lords, was
because that they being of the Kings
making, were in effect so many certain
Votes for whatever the King had a mind
to carry in that House.</q>

That they are not incapable of the

in question by a few Levellers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths-men?
No, this device is
stale. The Sport of <hi>Bishop-hunting</hi> is too
well known, and though the Clergy
be the Game in view, yet they have the
Temporal Lords in Chance. These cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Archers, though they wink with
one eye at the Spiritual Lords, yet have
another open, with which they take aim
at the rest of the Peers. Many of those
Arrows which were once darted at the
Bishops, glanc'd on the Nobles, and
not a few were cast over their heads at

are not so neerly linkt, as that
Royal Aphorism of King <hi>Iames, No Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
No King,</hi> seems to imply. For though
Royalty and Priest-hood, which antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by right of Primogeniture concenter'd
in one, the same being Law-giver and
Sacrificer (see here, Mr. <hi>Author</hi> the
Kings Right to the Priestly Office and the
Clergies Interest in making Laws) were
in succeeding ages deriv'd to different
Persons, their Interests yet were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with their Persons. But as the
Royal and Sacerdotal Dignity have the
same Original, and antiently Prince and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64322:50"/>
Priest had one and the same Name; so,
though differently Branch't now, yet as
springing from the same Root, they
flourish and decay together. So regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
is the Religious State incorporate
with the Civil, that the <hi>Image</hi> of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
(like the <hi>Statuaries</hi> in <hi>Pallas</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get)
seems so riveted in Monarchy,
that none can attempt defacing the one,
without breaking the other. Nay, those
who have been taught by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>
to demean themselves so irreverently to
the Fathers of their Church, have
learn'd from such Apostles as <hi>Knox</hi> and
<hi>Buchanan</hi> (to whom duller <hi>Mariana</hi> might
have gone to School) to pay as little
Obedience to the Fathers of their
Country. This is evident from these O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
            <p>That the Kings Personal and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
Capacity are distinct, and so they
fought for his Crown, when they shot at
his Person.</p>
            <p>That the Original of Government is
in the People, and that he derives his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
from their Consent, and not
from Succession, and by consequence is
no King before he is Crown'd, and his
Style should not run <hi>Dei <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That he is greater then his Subjects
singly and apart, but lesser then them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
that is, as <hi>Mr. Digges</hi> speaks, a
Father is greater then this or that Son;
but less then all his Children toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>That there is a Co-ordination of the
three Estates, but this is moderate; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
go farther, and tell us the King is
subordinate to the other two Estates <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whom</hi> he governs: Nay, <hi>Milton</hi> holds,
that the Legislative Power is in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
exclusively and the Executive
only in the King.</p>
            <p>And that the Supreme Magistrate is
accountable to the Inferior, and though
<hi>Paraeus</hi>'s Book was burnt for this, yet Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Holy Common-wealth</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
he may be call'd to an account by
any single Peer.</p>
            <p>Now because they have been too libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and confer'd too large a Power in
Civil Affairs on their Soveraign, they
will be sure to retrench it in Spirituals.
O they can never give enough to the
Lay-Elders! for they admit Lay-men
to intermeddle in Ecclesiastical Matters,
though they exclude the King upon that
account. Therefore Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi>
speaking of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Disciplinarians in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64322:51"/>
his <hi>Fair warning to take heed of their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
saith, <q>Besides those incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which they have made upon the
rights of all Supreme Magistrates, there
be sundry others which especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> as the
use of his Tenths, First Fruits, and
Patronages, and which is more then all
these; the dependance of his Subjects;
by all which we see that they have
thrust out the Pope indeed, but retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Papacy. The Pope as well as they
and they as well as the Pope, (neither
Barrell better Herrings) do make Kings
but half Kings, Kings of the Bodies, and
not of the Souls of their Subjects,
They allow them some sort of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over Ecclesiastical Persons, in
their Civil Capacities, for it is little
(according to their Rules) which either
is not Ecclesiastical, or may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Ecclesiastical. But over Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons, as they are Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks,
or in Ecclesiastical Matters, they
ascribe unto them no judgment in the
world. Here, he cites the Vindication of
their Commissioners, wherein, they say,
<hi>It cannot stand with the word of God, and that
no Christian Prince ever claim'd, or can claim
to himself such a Power.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:64322:52"/>
So that that great Prelate, whoever he
was (be he amongst the Living or the
Dead, or in the World of the Moon) that
said, <hi>The King had no more to do in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
matters, then Jack that rubb'd his
Horses heels,</hi> may retract his Aphorisme,
since he is out-shot in his own Bow by
<hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> for according to
them, Jack <hi>that rubbs the Horses heels,</hi> (if he
be but a Lay-Elder) is <hi>Supreme</hi> in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
matters. Though why our
Author would have his Adversary write
a Book in defence of that Aphorism, who
had reserved the Priesthood and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it for the King, I see not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be to <hi>vye</hi> him, and <hi>see</hi> him, and
<hi>re-vye</hi> him in Contradictions. This Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
now is lost to any man that is not a
Gamester.</p>
            <p>Upon considering all, I am afraid that
<hi>Reformation</hi> is Tinkers work, making two
holes for stopping one; and therefore I
am sorry that this Gentleman is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in <hi>pulling Pins out of the Church;</hi> for
though the <hi>State should not totter,</hi> he may
chance to pull an old House upon his
Head. And really he has undertaken a
desperate Vocation, and there are 20 o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more honest and painful ways by
which he may earn a Living. Not that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64322:52"/>
I would have him to do in <hi>Ecclesiastical
Matters,</hi> so much as <hi>to rub down</hi> a Bishops
<hi>Horses heels,</hi> for fear my <hi>Iack</hi> should take
himself for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> if he rides some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
though it were but to water his
Masters Horse. Besides, cleansing a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(were it the <hi>Augean</hi>) being a matter
only of <hi>external neatness,</hi> can never merit
the Trophies of <hi>Hercules.</hi> For neither
can <hi>a Iustice of Peace</hi> for an Order about

the same reason would I have him Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-Sweeper

Well, since Bishops must down, (and to be

that travel up and down with two penny

               <hi>Antichristian</hi> Magistrates and Laws, you
have plentifully provided them with
Canting for that purpose, for from <hi>Pag.</hi>
243. to <hi>Pag.</hi> 250. you have carried on
the Cause. I will point to some of it,
<hi>Pag. 249. Pag. 250. Princes consider, that
God has Instated them in the Government of
Mankind, with that incumbrance (if it may
so be call'd) of Reason, and that incumbrance
upon Reason of Conscience. That he might
have given them as large an extent of ground,
and other kind of Cattle for their Subjects:
but it had been a melancholy Empire to have
been only Supream Grasiers and Soveraign
Shepheards. And therefore, though the lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that brutal magistracy might have
been more secure, yet the difficulty of this does
make it more honourable. That men therefore
are to be dealt with reasonably: and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
men by Conscience. That even Law is
force, and the execution of that Law a greater
Violence; and therefore with rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
not to be us'd but upon the utmost, extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
That the Body is in the power of the
mind; so that corporal Punishments do never
reach the offender, but the innocent suffers for
the guilty. That the Mind is in the hand of God,
and cannot correct those perswasions which upon
the best of its natural capacity it has collected:
So that it too, though erroneous, is so far
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64322:54"/>
innocent. That the Prince therefore, by how
much God hath indued him with a clearer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
&amp; by consequence with a more inlightned
judgment, ought the rather to take heed lest by
punishing Conscience he violate not only
his own, but the Divine Majesty.</hi> So that if

            <p>Now these tamer Subjects, (the Brutes)

though they have an absolute Power of

            <p>'Tis true, the Animadverter says, that
God <hi>might have given Princes as large as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

their Subjects,</hi> (Subjects are one kind of

an <hi>Empire</hi> as that would have been,
he has instated them in one far more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant

from whom they must expect no
greater security for Obedience, then their
own good Nature: for punish them
they must not if disloyal and unjust,
for fear of disobliging their Consciences:
for though he says that Laws should not
be put in Execution, <hi>but upon the utmost
extremity,</hi> 'tis plain he intends they should
not be Executed at all; for in the very
next words he affirms, that <hi>the Body is
in the power of the Mind,</hi> so that <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Punishment do never reach the Offender,
but the Innocent suffers for the Guilty.</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Stoick! but say that the infamy of
a Gibbet cannot shame the Generous
Mind, nor the Severities of the Rack and
Wheel awe the most Servile: say further
that <hi>Corporal Punishments</hi> cannot reach
the Principal <hi>Offender,</hi> the Mind; must
therefore the Accessary and subordinate
Instrument, the Body, scape unpunisht?
But the Mind it seems, is not only out of
the reach, but Jurisdiction of the Civil
Magistrate. <hi>For it is in the hand of God,

So that if too, though erroneous, is so far inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.

speak it) to the Deity. This is the <hi>Syntagm</hi>
of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Divinity, and <hi>System</hi> of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Policy. Bishop <hi>Bramhall</hi> (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
noted) accus'd the <hi>Scotch</hi> Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians
for making Kings but Kings of
the Bodies, and not of the Souls of their
Subjects, but this Gentleman is so cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
as to release them from the charge
of both, for the Bodies of their Subjects
are exempt from their Jurisdiction, as
being in the <hi>Power</hi> of their <hi>Minds,</hi> and
their <hi>Minds are in the hand of God,</hi> and so
Monarchs had best take heed, <hi>least by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Consciences of their Subjects, they
violate with their own, the Divine Majesty.</hi>
And now shut up the Church doors,
there is no use of Altars for the Guilty,
they need run no farther then to their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64322:56"/>
own Consciences for Sanctuary, and be
safe. Cut in pieces the <hi>Whipping Posts</hi> and
<hi>Pillories,</hi> make Bonfires of the Gallowses,
set open all the Prisons, and let there be
a general Goal-delivery, for <hi>Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi>
are all unjust, and reach not
the <hi>Guilty,</hi> but the <hi>Innocent;</hi> and what is
more, they are manifest infringments on
our <hi>Libertys,</hi> and the <hi>Magna Charia</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
Sheath the Sword of Justice,
mure up <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> and set Bills on
the Courts, for <hi>Laws are force, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of them</hi> (though in inflicting the
smallest Penalties) <hi>a greater Violence.</hi> Away
with these Oppressions of the <hi>Free-born.</hi>
All Causes are to be try'd in <hi>Foro Interno.</hi>
And every Man is his own Judge in that
High Court of Judicature, his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
from which (in the Character of
Soveraignty) there is No Appeal. Here
Kings are depos'd for <hi>violating the Divine
Majesty, and their own</hi> in the Exercise
of that large Power which God hath
intrusted them as his Deputies with.
To this, all must swear Allegiance and
Supremacy, and those that are Loyal
to Conscience, may lawfully be Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to their Soveraign. The Supream
Magistrate is accountable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior,
but the Conscientious Man in
this preposterous way of <hi>climbing down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:64322:56"/>
is an Inferior Magistrate above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Inferior, as he is a Supream over
the Supream. Thus Conscience is at
once (like Mr. <hi>Calvin) Pope</hi> and <hi>Emperor,</hi>
seated in St. <hi>Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi> Chair and the Imperial
Throne, invested with as great a Power
<hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> as Gods Vice-roys
justly challenge, or Christs Vicar-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
usurps: So have we rejected one
Pope, and set up as many in his room,
as there are Subjects. For had not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
place in every private Judgment,
(and Conscience is no more) why should
our Author imagine, that Princes in <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
Conscience, violate their own, and the
Divine Majestie?</hi> For can they violate the
<hi>Divine Majesty</hi> in punishing Error? Sure
I am, if those Consciences do not erre,
that are tender of offending God in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
Men, and not tender of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in disobeying them, we must
alter the Scripture, and say, <hi>Disobey for
Conscience sake:</hi> but he adds, the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
though <hi>erroneous, is so far innocent as
it is in the hand of God, and cannot correct
those perswasions which upon the best of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Capacity it has collected.</hi> But if the
Prince in punishing an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thers Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
proceeds according to his own, is
not his <hi>so far innocent</hi> too? And since you
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64322:57"/>
are so great an Advocate for <hi>absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi>
you should do well to remember,
that <hi>Zeno</hi> when his man pleaded a Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Offending, answer'd him with a
Cudgel, alleadging the like Necessity of
Beating him.</p>
            <p>Thus have you divested Princes of
an <hi>Vnlimited and Vnco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>roulable Power,</hi>
and given it to a more Imperious
and Arbitrary Tyrant, Conscience.
And because your Adversary had told
you, that Princes have power to bind
their Subjects to that Religion that
they apprehend most advantagious to
Publick Peace: to avoid this Rock,
you split upon a worse, concurring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with your <hi>Dear Friend</hi> Mr. <hi>Milton:</hi>
who says, that the only true Religion if
commanded by the Civil Magistrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Unchristian, Inhumain and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous.
In cashiering the Magistrates
Authority in things Indifferent, you rob
him of all his Power; for those things
that are absolutely lawful and necessary
in themselves were commanded by God
before. And besides, that that Opinion,
that things Indifferent in themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unlawful when impos'd, is irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and absurd; as if (says one) that
were unlawful to be done when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64322:57"/>
which was lawful to be done
even without a Command. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
is yet wilder, For if things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
lawful, become sinful when
impos'd, then by the same reason they
must needs become necessary, when they
are forbidden. And so consequently,
whatsoever of this nature the Magistrate
shall forbid, men must look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as bonnd in conscience to practice;
and thus you give him that power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
your Consciences by his Prohibitions,
which you deny to his Commands.</p>
            <p>No less ridiculous is this, <hi>That Law is
force, and the execution of that Law, a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Violence, and therefore not to be us'd with
rational creatures, but upon the utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
But if the People be <hi>forc'd</hi> to obey
those Laws, to the making of which they
consented in their Representatives; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are not <hi>forc'd</hi> without their
own Consent. Besides, what have Rules
of <hi>force</hi> in them, and <hi>Laws</hi> in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
intention were no more. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
was only annex'd in case of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance.
And here the Casuists
(those Reverend Serieants at the Gospel)
will tell you, that it is not lawful without
great reason to prefer Passive Obedience
before Active, because the Law aims not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64322:58"/>
so much at Punishment as Conformity.
Neither is <hi>the execution of the Law, so great
a Violence</hi> as is imagined. For some are
Condemned to suffer, for a Terrour to
others. To condemn them, because they
have offended, is a folly says <hi>Plato:</hi> for
what is once done, can never be undone.
But they are condemn'd because they
should not offend again, or that others
may avoid the Example of their Offence.
And one man is hang'd to prevent the
hanging of many more.</p>
            <p>Upon considering all, I see not but
your <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> leads to a wilder
Anarchy then the <hi>Hobbian State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and how much better might you
have assign'd Princes the Government of
an innocent Flock according to the
Rules of <hi>Arcabian</hi> Policy, then that of
such ungovernable <hi>Cattle,</hi> as <hi>Conscientious</hi>
Savages. The Command of Fields and
Pastures is more honourable on these
terms, then that of populous Towns,
and Cities (which our Poet and your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>D' Avenant</hi> calls the <hi>Wall'd Parks of
Herded men</hi>) What Monarch, rather then
he would be clogg'd with such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
would not exchange his Royal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for a Forresters <hi>Green,</hi> and the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that Dress (you know) no man
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64322:58"/>
would scruple in order to the <hi>Sylvan</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
So far however it is agreed by all
in favour of your <hi>Supreme Grasiers</hi> and
<hi>Soveraign Shepherds,</hi> that their <hi>Melancholy

            <p>As to those Misfortunes which you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
<hi>Page</hi> 244, 245. befell some bold
Princes that were too saucy with their
Subjects, I shall only match them with
some Historical Remarks in an ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Writer against <hi>Mr. Milton,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Rise and Fall of Republicks, He
tells us, <q>That it was not the Tyranny
of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the cruelty of Duke
<hi>D'Alva,</hi> nor the blood of their Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor Religion, nor Liberty, that
made the <hi>Dutch</hi> cast off their obedience
to their Prince, but one penny excise
laid upon a pound of Butter, that made
them implacably declare for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
That the <hi>Venetians</hi> were
banisht into a Free State by <hi>Attila,</hi> and
their glorious Liberty was at first no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then he may be said to have, that
is turn'd out of his House. That the
<hi>Romans</hi> were Cuckolded into their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and the <hi>Pisans</hi> Trepan'd into
their's by <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth. That as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64322:59"/>
Common-wealths sprung from base O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals,
so they have ruin'd upon as
slight occasions. The same <hi>Pisans,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had spent all they had upon a
Freak of Liberty, were sold (like <hi>Cattle</hi>)
by <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. The <hi>Venetians</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor'd,
and almost ruin'd by <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the First, a poor Prince, for refusing
to lend him money, as they were not
long before by <hi>Francesco Sforza</hi> about a
Bastard. And the <hi>Florentines</hi> were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enslav'd for spoyling of an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
speech, and disparaging <hi>Petro de
Medicis</hi> fine Liveryes.</q> To this I might
add, that many Stories there are of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who have in all humility condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
to bear with the Infirmities of
their Princes (remembring your rule,
that <hi>Great Persons do out of Civility condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to their Inferi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Courtiers would, in his Presence, run
and justle one another, and either stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at, or overthrow whatever stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their feet, to show, that they were
as pur-blind as he.</p>
            <p>So much for his design against Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
There is a deal of Plot yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64322:59"/>
but now it begins to break. <hi>Page</hi>
224. he says, <hi>In the late Kings time, some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Persons of our Clergy made an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Church of</hi> Rome. And instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
him that writ the Book of <hi>Seven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi>
which had been pertinent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
had he writ of <hi>Seven Sacraments</hi> all
necessary to Salvation. But how can this
man imagine that we should believe, that
<hi>some eminent Persons of the Clergy</hi> in the late
Kings time, <hi>made an open defection to the
Church of Rome,</hi> when he does not believe
himself, for p. 297. he cannot think, <hi>that
they had a design to alter our Religion, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to set up a new kind of</hi> Papacy <hi>of their
own here in</hi> England. Then this was the
reason it seems, why Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi>
gain'd <hi>Hales</hi> from <hi>Socinus</hi> (you <hi>great wit</hi>
confess'd when bassled by that Prelate,
that he understood more then <hi>Ceremonies,
Arminianism,</hi> and <hi>Manwaring)</hi> and many
besides of considerable Quality from the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but none of greater note
then <hi>Ch llingworth;</hi> for this it was, that
he twice refus'd a <hi>Red-Hat:</hi> and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
a Cardinal-ship could not tempt
him, when he design'd an <hi>English Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to prove this Surmise of his
groundless, we need go no farther then
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64322:60"/>
the Reconciliation which the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
labour'd betwixt us and <hi>Rome,</hi> for
the compassing of which, amongst other
Articles propos'd, the <hi>Tope</hi> was to be
allow'd a Priority. This Accomodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
notwith standing your Wisdom cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
as a Design impossible to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
was in so great a forwardness
once, that it was thought, nothing but
the Opposition of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> on the
one side, and the <hi>Puritans</hi> on the other,
could obstruct it, as the <hi>Popes Nuncio,</hi>
affirm'd to be written by the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Embassador, expresses it. And indeed,
the Pragmaticalness of these two, had
made the Breach much wider then at first,
else the more Moderate of each party by
distinguishing betwixt the Doctrines of
private Men, and the Confessions of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Church, might easily have adjusted
those Differences, and so have laid a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Foundation for the Peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome
And as for all our Authors
idle talk of <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Secular interest,</hi>
he shows, he has clearly mistaken the
whole matter; for 'twas not an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with the Court, but with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that was propos'd in
this Mediation.</p>
            <p>But the Gentleman is wonderful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64322:60"/>
for <hi>who knows</hi> (says he <hi>pag.</hi> 35.) <hi>in
such a Treaty with</hi> Rome, <hi>if the</hi> Alps <hi>would
not have come over to</hi> England. (No, I
would not they should, for they have
stood ever since the Flood at least, and
I am a great enemy to the removing of
ancient Land-marks) England <hi>might not
have been oblig'd, lying so commodious for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
to undertake a Voyage to</hi> Civita Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.
That need not neither Sir, and
though tis pity this Conceit should have
been lost, yet there is a better way then
this; for since our Island is so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
situate for Trading, had there
been a good Correspondence maintain'd
betwixt the Catholick Merchants and
ours, they mght more easily have drove
on the Traffick; interchangeably expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our Religion in Cabbages, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the <hi>Roman</hi> in Oranges and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
So that there was not that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of <hi>Englands</hi> lying at <hi>Dover,</hi> for a
fair Wind to be Shipt for <hi>Civita Vechia.</hi>
For besides that Transportation of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
is somewhat more troublesome
then Removing House, such a little Spot
of Ground as this Island would soon
have been missing in the Map, had it
been mov'd out of its place; and so
have occasion'd many Disputes in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.

Who knows too, if the <hi>English</hi>
had once broke up House, and pack'd
up their Goods and their Lands to be

might have follow'd their Example; and
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> after they had given their

might have flung up their Leases,
and in time, the <hi>Neth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet if all these new Planters should not

his Holiness I fear would have

Cottages upon the Wast, or at least of
making a Law against <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
to have secur'd his Parish from an
unnecessary Charge.</p>
            <p>Certainly, had <hi>Mr. Author</hi> been one
of the Commissioners for draining of
the Fennes, he could not have argu'd
more profoundly against the cutting of
the <hi>Ecclesiastick Canal. pag</hi> 30. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
it with those Attempts in former
ages of <hi>digging through the Separating</hi>
Istmos <hi>of</hi> Peloponnesus <hi>and making Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64322:61"/>
between the</hi> Red Sea, <hi>and the</hi>

from any Commnnication with <hi>Rome,</hi> he
might have done well to forbid any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
between their Elements and
ours. Who can tell at how great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
every Breath of moving Air may
continue articulate? Especially, if vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caliz'd
in Sir <hi>S. Moreland's</hi> Trumpet. Nay,
why may not those Birds that sojourn
with us half the year, when they fly
thither for Winter Quarters, sing strange
stories in the <hi>Italian</hi> Groves? and those
the learned in <hi>Ornithology</hi> understand.
How if those Winds that whistle near
our Coasts, should whisper Tales there?
and strange Secrets may be discover'd
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Eaves-droppers, if they lay
their Ears to the ground. What does

for it may so happen, that the

in their pratling Murmurs,
when they both discharge into the Sea
(there may be another <hi>Communication</hi> too

I must confess to venture too far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

these Depth's, for fear of being
plung'd past recovery. I leave them
therefore to be fathom'd by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Plummet. He has been over Shoes
already, ay, and over Boots too. He has
waded through the <hi>Leman Lake</hi> and the

<hi>should overtake it</hi> (that is to say, the <hi>Lake</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But to conclude his Discourse of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and with that his Plot.
I have heard of a <hi>Hampshire</hi> Clown who
being upon the Sea-shore, and seeing
nothing but Water beyond <hi>England,</hi>
would not be perswaded that there was
any such Country as <hi>France,</hi> but that all
the Relations of it were Travellers
Tales. And this Gentleman belike, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
collected upon the best of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
(and <hi>what perswasions</hi> the mind
<hi>has so collected, it cannot correct)</hi> that the

clearest Day could not discover <hi>Rome</hi> to
one standing at <hi>Dover,</hi> imagin'd not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly,
that two Places remov'd at such
a distance, could never meet, unless <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
made an Errand over the Water, or
the Catholick City were transported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And good reason it is, according
to the Geography of Religions, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
one Religion to <hi>Islands,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
to the Continent, that the same
Sea which makes a Separation of Places,
should also make a <hi>Schism</hi> in Religions.

            <p>There is one Project more of that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
Knights,</hi> not much below this
Gentlemans reflexion, in relation to
the Security of the City, and that is
concerning Tinder-boxes, for since al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
no Family here, is without its
Box, and that is so portable a thing,
how easie is it for any Man ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to the State, to go with one in
his Pocket into a Powder-Shop, or
where any other Combustible Wares
are lodg'd, and come out again, and
none the wiser. How sit were it
therefore; the State should be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
that none but such as are known
Patriots and Lovers of their Country
should be trusted with such dangerous
Furniture in their Houses, and even
those too seal'd at the <hi>Tinder-box</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and of such a bigness, as might not
lurk in Pockets.</p>
            <p>Well, though our <hi>Transproser</hi> makes no
difference as to the Plot or Characters in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64322:63"/>
his Heroick Plays, yet his <hi>Rehearsal</hi> is as
full of Drollery as ever it can hold; <hi>'tis
like an Orange stuck with Cloves;</hi> as for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 6. he leads us into a Printing-house,
and describes it in the same style
as the Man who shows <hi>Iohn Tradescants</hi>
Rarities (which is extraordinary fine for
those who have never seen such a Sight)
the Letters are shown for Teeth of
strange <hi>Animals</hi> (sure <hi>Garagantua</hi>'s hollow
Tooth would have gone for a Capital
Letter.) And what is more surprising for
<hi>Serpents</hi> Teeth. And those very Teeth
which <hi>Cadmus</hi> sow'd, from which (it
seems) he had a large Crop of Printing-Letters.
The <hi>first Essay</hi> (he has told us)
<hi>that was made towards this Art, was in single
Characters upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ron, wherewith of old they
stigmatized Slaves and remarkable Offenders.</hi>
He might have pursu'd the Subject fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet, and told us of another use of
these <hi>single Characters upon Iron,</hi> (God
knows how ancient) which is, that of
Proprietaries marking Cattle, and from
hence have learnedly concluded a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
in Letters, as well as Beasts. The
Argument if improv'd might have been
of force for the Peoples Propriety in
Language, (a new <hi>Priviledge</hi> of <hi>Subject</hi> for
which our Author contends) for how
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64322:64"/>
justly may he plead, that they give Names
to their Dogs and Horses, (an original
Flower of <hi>Adams</hi> Crown) and fix distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Characters on their Sheep, (nay,
mark their <hi>Piss-pots, Bowls</hi> and <hi>Flagons)</hi>
they exercise a petty Royalty in pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding
Cattle, and pounding Beasts, in
making Wills and Testaments; Leases
made with no less Caution then Laws,
pass (in the Imperial style) under their
Hand and Seal; and why should not they
be intrusted in wording Laws for the
Publick? for 'tis unreasonable to fill the
<hi>Princes Head</hi> with <hi>Proclamations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 233.</note> And since

                  </gap>ry,</hi> (as was said before) is
their due, why might not they have the
dispensing of Coats of Arms. And if
their Pocket-Seals are Authoritative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for setting their Lands, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Sons, why not for disposing of
Offices too, as well as the <hi>Great Seal?</hi> If
any man shall say, that some of them are
unletter'd (as some few of a <hi>private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Breeding</hi> are) and so incapacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Law-makers, because they are
not good Scribes: the Answer is easie,
if they cannot write their Names, they
may set their Mark, (this I conceive was
the <hi>first Essay</hi> towards <hi>the Art of Writing,</hi>
as that in <hi>single Characters upon Iron,</hi> was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64322:64"/>
towards that other of <hi>Printing</hi>) and to
authenticate this, I remember Sir <hi>Politick
Would-bee</hi> (that worthy Predecessor of
this Gentleman) tells us of a Letter he
receiv'd from a High and Mighty Cheese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger,
one of the Lords of the <hi>States
General,</hi> who could not write his Name
(at least at length, and with all his Titles)
and therefore had set his Mark to it. Not
but that he had <hi>Secretaries</hi> under him
(<hi>Latin</hi> or no, I know not) that could
do it. But this was for the greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
            <p>But if the People will be so civil as
to forego their <hi>uncontroulable</hi> Power in
Language (which they have by a <hi>Natural
Right, antecedent to Christ</hi>) they may, but
our Author will not upon so easie tearms
recede from his Prerogative. For there
are two Letters <hi>I. O.</hi> over which he
claims an absolute Power to make them
signify any thing, or nothing, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
He had lookt in his Dictionary ('tis
one of his highest Authors) and found
that <hi>Io</hi> uses to go before <hi>Paean,</hi> and then
amongst the <hi>Proper Names</hi> he saw <hi>Io</hi> was
the Daughter of <hi>Inac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi> and so (as he
tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 83.) <hi>that as</hi> Juno <hi>persecuted
the Heifer,</hi> this <hi>I. O. was an</hi> He-Cow, <hi>that
is to say</hi> a Bull <hi>to be baited by</hi> Mr. Bayes. It
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64322:65"/>
seems then in his <hi>Accidence</hi> (whether it
be the same with <hi>Miltons Accidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd
Grammer,</hi> I know not) it is <hi>Hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Io,</hi>
a <hi>Cow</hi> both <hi>He</hi> and <hi>She.</hi> But though <hi>I. O.</hi>
be the Letters which make up four <hi>pages</hi>
of his Book, (as if his Printer could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with no other) yet is his <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
Wit</hi> further improvable for this <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tallest slendrest Letter of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet,</hi>
and <hi>O</hi> the roundest, he could
not have pickt out two in all the <hi>Criss-Cross-Row</hi>
that point more plainly at the
Man that owns them, for according to
Signatures, they Emblem a <hi>Tall</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
that has been a <hi>Round-Head.</hi> As to the
first part of his Character, our Author
has so far decipher'd him, telling us <hi>pag.
68. of one I. O. a tall Servant of the</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Politician's. And for the later, the
Owner of those two Letters has deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher'd
himself in his Books. But if these
be not sufficient Marks to know the
Beast by, he has describ'd the Monster
with the punctuality of a <hi>Gazett-Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement</hi>
that gives notice of a <hi>Crop-ear'd
Gelding</hi> stray'd from his Master. For
<hi>pag.</hi> 83. he tells us this <hi>I. O. has a Head,
and a Mouth with Tongue and Teeth in it, and
Hands with Fingers and Nails upon them.</hi>
Which is almost as apposite a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64322:65"/>
of an <hi>Independent,</hi> as his Friend Mr.
<hi>Milton</hi> has given us of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who in
his <hi>Apology for his Animadversions upon the
Remonstrants Defence against Smectymnuus,</hi>
says, that <hi>a Bishops foot that hath all his
Toes maugre the Gout, and a linnen Sock over
it, is the aptest Emblem of the Bishop himself;
who being a Pluralist, under one Surplice which
is also linnen</hi> (and therefore so far like the
Toe-Surplice, the <hi>Sock) hides four Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
besides the Metropolitan Toe.</hi> So that
when Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> was suspended,
we might say in Mr. <hi>Miltons</hi> style, his
<hi>Metropolitan Toe</hi> was cut off. But since
<hi>Milton</hi> is so great an Enemy to <hi>great Toes</hi>
(however dignified or distinguisht, be
they <hi>Papal</hi> or <hi>Metropolitan)</hi> we would fain
know, whether his are all of a length,
since the Leveller (it seems) affects a
Parity even in Toes. Whether now his
<hi>Bishop</hi> with a <hi>Metropolitan Toe,</hi> or our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<hi>Congregational Man</hi> with ten <hi>Fingers</hi>
and long <hi>Nails</hi> upon all, be the fitter
Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster to be shown, is hard to say.
Only, I am glad to hear that the Author
of <hi>Evangelical Love</hi> has got Claws, since
belike his <hi>Evangelical Love</hi> (like that of
Cats) is exercis'd for the most part in
Scratching and Clawing. And now let
the Bishops look to their Faces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64322:66"/>
of some with long Nails. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily,
among other Calamities of late,
there has happen'd a prodigious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of a <hi>Latin Secretary</hi> and an <hi>English
School-Master,</hi> the appearance of which,
none of our Astrologers foretold, nor
no Comet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortended. It may be for our
Authors reason, because <hi>it is of far higher
quality, and hath other kind of employment,</hi>
And therefore, though an <hi>Hairy Star,</hi> it
might afford no Prognostick of these
two Monkeys lousing the Bishops heads.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Milton's Sock</hi> will not well endure
a comparison with the <hi>Surplice,</hi> what think
you of our Animadverter's joyning the
<hi>White-Surplices</hi> and the <hi>White-Aprons</hi> in one
period, <hi>pag.</hi> 195. (observe <hi>Iohn Milton,</hi>
they are both <hi>Linnen</hi> and both <hi>White.</hi>)
'Tis much we heard not here of the <hi>Sympathy</hi>
of White Linnen, as well as of the
<hi>Sympathy</hi> of Scarlet, <hi>pag.</hi> 68. where our
Author has married the Tippet and the
Red Petticoat. See how the Turky-Cock
(if that be not too Masculine an
Emblem for a <hi>Capon-wit</hi>) bristles at the
Sight of any thing that's <hi>Red.</hi> However,
this I hope may be a means to reconcile
the <hi>Holy Sisters</hi> to the Church, for if there
be so good an Agreement between the
Tippets and Red Petticoats, and the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64322:66"/>
White Surplices and White Aprons, they
are come one step nearer to Conformity
then they were aware of. Who knows
too, but in time they may be perswaded
that their's are Canonical Vestments,
save only that the <hi>Doctresses</hi> wear their
Tippets at the wrong end, and inverting
the usual Form, under their Surplices.
In the mean time, I think the Regulating
Canonical Habits an Employment no
way commensurate to our Authors A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
wishing him rather to concern
himself in such Worthy Cares as a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Hospital-boys Blue Coats,
or the Water-mens Red-Coats and
Badges, and so till he proceed to the
Lacquey's Liveries. And then possibly
he may conceit himself qualified in some
degree for an Undertaking in Heraldry.
A Perfection he envies in Bishop <hi>Bramhall.</hi>
For it looks like upbraiding in any man
to vaunt his skill in Heraldry before any
one of his <hi>private Condition</hi> that wants a
Coat of Arms, or at least like reflecting
on his <hi>private Breeding</hi> that never learnt
to Blazon anothers. For what else can
you make of his Animadversion, <hi>pag.</hi> 34.
upon this Maxime of the Bishop, That
second Reformations are commonly like
Metal upon Metal, which is false He

raldry. Upon which, <hi>it is a wonder,</hi> (says
he) <hi>that our Author in enumerating the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
perfections in Divinity, Law, History
and Philosophy, neglected this peculiar gift
he had in Heraldry,</hi> which is altogether
as sleeveless as the Heralds Coat, if I
may have to offer at that low Wit with
which our Author so Plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds.
For to give you some of his
Clenches, <hi>p.</hi> 158. he says, his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>leaps cross, and has more doubles, (nay
triples and quadruples) then any Hare.</hi>
And to shew, that he as well as Mr.
<hi>Bayes</hi> is an enemy to all the <hi>Moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
pag.</hi> 322. he tells us, the <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Politician</hi> makes <hi>Grace</hi> a meer <hi>Fable,</hi> of
which he gives us the <hi>Moral.</hi> And p, 135.
<hi>if the Archbishoprick of</hi> Canterbury <hi>should
ever fall to his lot, I am resolved instead of his</hi>
Grace, <hi>to call him always</hi> his Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Whereas he tells us a Story of the
<hi>Scurvy Disease, pag.</hi> 134, his History, and
his hard names of <hi>Podostrabae, Doctylethrae,
Rhinolabides,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 132. declare him
sufficiently Graduated in Canting for a
<hi>Pox-Doctor.</hi> I shall only mind him here
of another <hi>Scurvy Disease</hi> deriv'd from
<hi>Geneva,</hi> Contemporary with that brought
over from the <hi>Indies.</hi> For unless our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64322:67"/>
Calculators are out, the <hi>Pox</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
broke out at the same time in <hi>Europe.</hi>
And therefore are the Twin-Diseases de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
associated in a Fatal Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>And now for what he discourses <hi>p.</hi> 47.
of those <hi>who having never seen the receptacle
of Grace or Conscience at an Anatomical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
conclude that there is no such matter;</hi>
the Learn'd in Anatomy are so far from
granting him this, that they assure him
of the contraty. Maintaining upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section
of the Presbyterian Carcasses
that they have made an undoubted dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the Receptacle of Conscience,

(which is little else but <hi>Milton's Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagitica</hi>
in short hand) <hi>The very Sponges
which one would think should rather deface
and blot out the whole Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k, and were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
used to that purpose, are become now
the Instruments to make things legible.</hi> But
truly, I think the Sponge has left little
else visible in his Book more then what
it did in the Figures of those two Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64322:68"/>
in the one of which it fortunately
<hi>dash't</hi> the <hi>Foam</hi> of a <hi>mad</hi> Horse, and in
the other, the <hi>Slaver</hi> of a <hi>weary</hi> Dog;
the <hi>Sponges</hi> ruder <hi>Blot</hi> prevailing above
all the light <hi>touches</hi> and tender <hi>strokes</hi> of
the <hi>Pencil.</hi> And indeed for this inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Art of the <hi>Sponge,</hi> this of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Slaver</hi> and <hi>Foam</hi> to the Life, I will
not deny but his work deserves to be
celebrated beyond the Pieces of either
Painter. If you will have it in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy,
I never saw a man in <hi>so high a
Salivation.</hi> If in <hi>Miltons</hi> (I know he will
be proud to <hi>lick</hi> up his <hi>Spittle) He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
himself withall the Rheume of the Town,
that he might have sufficient to bespaul</hi> the
Clergy.</p>
            <p>But enough of these two loathsome
Beasts, and their spitting and spauling.
Now what think you of washing your
mouth with a <hi>Proverb</hi> or two. For I
cannot but remark this admirable way
he has of Embellishing his Writings
<hi>Proverbial-Wit.</hi> As for instance. <hi>One night
has made some men Gray,</hi> pag. 144. and <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
come at beginning of a Feast, then latter
end of a Fray:</hi> pag. 166. Which (to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them Proverbially) are all out as
much to the purpose as any of <hi>Sancho
Pancha's</hi> Proverbs. For the truth of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64322:68"/>
this Comparison, I shall only appeal to
the <hi>Leaf-turners</hi> of <hi>Don Quixot.</hi> Some
there are below the Quality of the
<hi>Squires</hi> Wit, and would better have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Mouth of his Lady <hi>Ioan,</hi> or
any old <hi>Gammer</hi> that drops Sentences
and Teeth together, As (speaking of his
own Tale of the <hi>Lake Perillous,</hi>) he faith
in its Applause, this Story <hi>would have
been Nuts to Mother Midnight, pag.</hi> 56. and
<hi>pag. 142. A year, nay an instant at any
time of a mans Life may make him Wiser.</hi>
And his Adversary hath, <hi>like all other
fruits his annual Maturity.</hi> Though there
is one sort of <hi>fruit trees</hi> above all the rest,
that bears with its <hi>Fruit,</hi> a signal Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick
of our Author; and that's a
<hi>Medlar:</hi> A <hi>Fruit</hi> more remarkable for its
<hi>annual maturity,</hi> because the same also is
an <hi>annual rottenness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his wonderful Gift in Rhyming,
I could furnish him with many more of
the <hi>Isms</hi> and <hi>Nesses,</hi> but that I should
distast a <hi>Blank Verse</hi> Friend of his, who
can by no means endure a Rhyme any
where but in the middle of a Verse, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
following the laudable custom of the
<hi>Welsh Poets.</hi> And therefore I shall only
point at some of the <hi>Nesses,</hi> the more
eminent, because of the peoples Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64322:69"/>
and of a Stamp as unquestionable
as the <hi>Breeches,</hi> and so far more legitimate
then any that have past for currant since
the People left off to mind words (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Flower of their Crown which they
fought for, besides <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>)
they are these, <hi>One-ness, Same-ness, Much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Nothing-ness, Soul-saving-ness;</hi> to
which we may add another of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
own, <hi>Pick-thank-ness;</hi> in which
word (to keep our Rhyme) there is a
peculiar <hi>Marvelousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should now in imitation of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
proceed to his Personal Character,
but I shall only advise his Painter if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he draws him below the Wast, to
follow the example of that Artist, who
having compleated the Picture of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
could at any time, with two strokes
of his Pencil upon her Face, two upon
her Breast, and two betwixt her Thighs;
change her in an instant into Man: but
after our Authors Female Figure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,
the change of Sex is far easier;
for Nature, or <hi>Sinister Accident</hi> has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

since the <hi>Transprosing Muses</hi> are gone to

a late Precedent only read you the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the <hi>Fifth Act,</hi> receding as little
as I can, from that which was found in
Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> his Pocket, and then making
our Author personate Prince <hi>Pretty-man,</hi>
and varying old <hi>Ioan</hi> to the Church of
<hi>Geneva;</hi> it is in effect no more then this,
that Prince <hi>Pretty-man</hi> (the Character is
<hi>Great</hi> enough for a man of <hi>Private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>)
being passionately in Love (you
may allow him to be an <hi>Allegorical Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
at least) with old <hi>Ioan</hi> (not the
<hi>Chandlers,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> Widow) walks
discontentedly by the side of the Lake
<hi>Lemane,</hi> sighing to the Winds and calling
upon the Woods; not forgetting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
his Mistresses name so often, till he
teach all the <hi>Eccho's</hi> to repeat nothing
but <hi>Ioan;</hi> now entertaining himself in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64322:71"/>
his Solitude, with such <hi>little Sports,</hi> as
<hi>loving his Love with an I,</hi> and then <hi>loving
his Love with an O,</hi> and the like for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Letters. And anon with such me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
divertisements as angling in
the <hi>Lake</hi> for <hi>Trouts.</hi> And making many
an Amorous Comparison between his
<hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>silly Captives,</hi> his innocent
Prey, His <hi>fishing lines</hi> you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
fram'd of a no less delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture,
then old <hi>Ioan's</hi> Hair, (the Mode
of wearing <hi>Hair-Bracelets</hi> was scarce in
use then, or else you had heard of that.)
To be short, after he has carv'd his
Mistresses Name with many <hi>Love-knots</hi>
and <hi>flourishes</hi> in all the <hi>Bushes</hi> and <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi>
and interwoven those sacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
with many an <hi>Enigmatical</hi> Devise
in <hi>Posies</hi> and <hi>Garlands</hi> of <hi>Flowers,</hi> lolling
sometimes upon the Bank and sunning
himself, and then on a sudden (varying
his Postures with his Passion) raising
himself up, and speaking all the fine
things which Lovers us'd to do. His
Spirits at last exhal'd with the heat of his
Passion, swop, he falls asleep, and snores
out the rest.</p>
            <p>If this <hi>Argument</hi> shall require a Key, I
shall only say, I call not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi>
old, for any other reason then that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64322:71"/>
Antiquity in Mistresses is reckon'd a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.
Besides, I think it would have
been an high <hi>Indecorum</hi> to have supposed
Mr. <hi>Calvin's</hi> Widow younger then the
<hi>Chandlers.</hi> And for Conferring the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Prince <hi>Pretty-man</hi> on our Author,
I shall alleadge such Reasons as these;
because, they <hi>Symbolize in their humour,</hi> and
not a little in their <hi>Expressions: in their
Contempt and quarrelling of all others</hi> that
are not in love with the same Mistress,
and lastly, in the choice of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses.</p>
            <p>And first for their <hi>Symbolizing in their
humour and expressions.</hi> Our Author begins
very briskly with <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Blazing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,</hi>
but in the middle of his Book (as
Prince <hi>Pretty-man</hi> in the height of his
Rapture) he grows heavy and dull; and
a Lethargy at length seising on his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
by that he comes to page 263, he
falls asleep, having first bid Mr. <hi>Bayes
Good Night,</hi> but before you can speak a
<hi>Simile</hi> of eight Verses over him; whip,
he starts up, and cryes <hi>Good Morrow.</hi>
(which is all out as well as <hi>It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd.</hi>)
Add to this, that his <hi>Snip-Snap
Wit, hit</hi> for <hi>hit,</hi> and <hi>dash</hi> for <hi>dash</hi> is pure
Prince <hi>Pret</hi> and <hi>Tom Thimble.</hi> As to their
<hi>Symbolizing in their Contempt and quarrelling
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64322:72"/>
of all others</hi> that are not in love with the
same Mistress, his whole Book is a
Demonstration of their admirable Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this point of Singularity. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoring
all that are not equal adorers
of Mr. <hi>Calvin's</hi> charming Dowager,
though he himself would sooner have a
<hi>Passion for a Whale,</hi> then any other Mistress
but his own. And for the choise of
their Mistresses; the <hi>Prince</hi> quits that
<hi>Chloris, whom Gods would not pretend to blame</hi>
for old <hi>Ioan,</hi> the Chandler's Widow, and
this Gallant no less preposterously, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouses
the sluttish Mother Church of <hi>Geneva</hi>
before our Church with all her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and Decorations, preferring the
<hi>Blue</hi> and <hi>White Aprons</hi> before the Glories
of her <hi>Yellow Hood</hi> and <hi>Bull-head,</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
most the Wrinkles of a homely Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and the Beauties of the <hi>Grub-street</hi>
Gossips, her Ragged Daughters and
Grand-Children.</p>
            <p>Now'tis but a little walk to <hi>Geneva,</hi>
and to invite you thither, I dare under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for your Welcome. That you shall
have good Chear there, and good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
And besides your other Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
there, you may shoot with the
<hi>Arbalet,</hi> or play at <hi>Court-boule.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
there are notable Good Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64322:72"/>
They are incomparable <hi>Pall-mall</hi>-Players.
And very good <hi>Bowlers</hi> too no
doubt (would they were as <hi>honest Men)</hi>
But though we have <hi>Geneva</hi> in the Wind,
I am afraid we had need of a better Guide
then our <hi>Noses,</hi> else we shall ne're come
thither. And for Strangers to ask the
way, would be the readier means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to set'em out of it. If we enquire
of some they'le tell us, it lies <hi>South</hi> of
the <hi>Lake;</hi> if of other, they say it lies
<hi>West,</hi> and Geographers are in as many
Stories as the Country People. In this
uncertainty of Information, what Course
shall we steer? shall we consult the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?
We must go then to the <hi>Transpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</hi>

            <p>Well, fain I would have saluted Mr.
<hi>Calvin's</hi> House, and paid my obeysance
to his Threshold. But since the Way is
so difficult, and my Guides unresolv'd; I
have no great Maw to it. I shall only
therefore leave a Ticket for his <hi>Assignes.</hi>
It is an Enquiry concerning certain things
laid to the Charge of that harmless, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Divine. In which, if I could receive
any Satisfaction from them, I should
gladly acknowledge the Obligation, and
be more ready for the future to pay a
just Veneration to his Memory. The
one is, a Story of an <hi>Italian Marquess,</hi>
which because I am affraid it tends not
much to his Honor, and there is a paltry
Book on purpose set out concerning the
whole matter, I shall forbear to recite
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64322:73"/>
here. The other, a scurvy Report of one
<hi>Servetus,</hi> who after he had been confuted
by the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, and so dismist
(where were the <hi>Pillories, Whipping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Posts,
Gallies, Rods,</hi> and <hi>Axes,</hi> that are the
<hi>Ratio Vltima Cleri</hi>) was more secreetly
handled by Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; lighted into the
other World by Fire and Faggot (add
these two to all the rest, and together
they are, <hi>Ratio Vltima Calvini)</hi> for which
reason <hi>Bellius, Eleutherius,</hi> and their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
styl'd him a Bloody Man, and the
villanous <hi>Montfort</hi> drew <hi>Calvin's</hi> Picture
not in a Gown and Cassock, but in a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
Back and Breast, belted and armed
like a Man of War, (this shew'd more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

burnt, and as if the World might not
know for what, his Books too. But
what makes the Case somewhat the
worse, <hi>Grotius</hi> and two or three unlucky

them, and would bear us in hand,

            </p>
            <p>I have now done, after I have (which
is but just) taken leave of my Author.
Sorry I am, to waken him out of that
pleasant Dream I left him in, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
under the Arms of a spreading
<hi>Bramble.</hi> But I will disturb him as
little a time as may be, a few things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I have to say to him at parting, and
then let him take the other Nap. First
then I cannot but take notice of his
Scripture Railery, for though he has
told the <hi>Ecclesiastical Politician,</hi> p. 166.
that he <hi>really makes Conscience of using
Scripture with such a drolling companion,</hi> yet
he makes none of Travesteering it, for
amongst the <hi>many good jests</hi> (he says, pag.
198) <hi>he has balk'd in writing his Book, lest
he should be brought to answer for every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and idle word,</hi> he could not find in
his heart to balk such as these, <hi>The Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
were great</hi> Traders <hi>in Scripture,
and therefore thrown out of the</hi> Temple,
p. 232. and p. 207. he tells us, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
<hi>is run up to the wall by an Angel.</hi>
And again, p. 77. that <hi>He is the first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel that ever bad it in his
Commission</hi> to rail at all Nations. So that
if any Man <hi>will learn by his Example</hi> (as he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64322:74"/>
advises in the Close of his Book) he may
proceed a most accomplish't Burlesquer
of the Scripture, <hi>wiithout violating and
prophaning those things which are and ought
to be most sacred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next for his Politicks; when I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
how he limited Kings and set
Subjects free, exempting all Affairs of
Conscience from the Jurisdiction of
the Soveraign and exclaiming against
<hi>Laws</hi> as <hi>Force,</hi> and the <hi>Execution</hi> of them
as a <hi>greater violence;</hi> divesting the Civil
Magistrate of his Authority in things
Indifferent, (the greatest part of his
power) and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olling Princes out of their
Right in Complement to their Subjects
(forsooth) flourisht with many Stories
cull'd for the purpose, and garnish't
with a <hi>Bumkin</hi> Simile or two, of such ill
bred <hi>Clowns</hi> as would desire to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
before their Betters: I imagin'd
he made his Collections out of such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
as <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Iunius Brutus.</hi> And
when I remarked how small a matter he
made of <hi>exposing the Wisdome of King and
Parliament for a Superfetation of Acts about
the same thing,</hi> I could not but wonder
that any one of a <hi>Private Condition and
Breeding,</hi> who (it may be) never had the
Government of so large a Family, as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64322:75"/>
that of a single Man and a Horse; should
think himself sufficiently capacitated to
make better Laws for the Government of
three Kingdoms. Certainly, not every
Man that has set his foot in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Venice,</hi> or read over <hi>Baxters Holy Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi>
and <hi>Harrington's Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Speech once in the ROTA, is States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
compleat enough for such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
No, the Training of Boys
and Education of Horses, are Tasks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the experience and abilities of
some of these imperious Dictators, that
assume to themselves a Power of correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Governors. The new Modelling
of a State is somewhat beyond the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of a School, and Monarchs are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Pedantick Discipline of the
<hi>Ferula;</hi> it is Arrogance then in a great
Degree for Pedagogues to Lecture Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Senates, and a high Presumption
for every Tutor to claim the Authority
of a <hi>Buchanan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas this I was displeas'd with, his
irreverent and disrespective usage of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
His Malicious and Disloyal
Reflections on the late Kings Reign, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the Government of the best of
Princes, and defaming his faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
in so foul a manner, as if he had
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64322:75"/>
once made use of <hi>Miltons</hi> Pen, and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier's</hi>
Pencil. So black a Poyson has he
suckt from the most virulent Pamphlets,
as were impossible for any Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank
but the Author of <hi>Iconoclastes</hi> to
swallow, without the Cure of Antidotes.
And certainly if that Libeller has not
clubb'd with our Writer (as is with
some reason suspected) we may safely
say, there are many <hi>Miltons</hi> in this one
Man. Not to recite too often his <hi>too
good</hi> Causes of Rebellion, and his Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Wise Princes</hi> only, to avoid the
like occasions. To which I may add
his insolent Abuse of his Gracions So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
in so cheaply prostituting his
<hi>Indulgence</hi> for a <hi>Sign</hi> to give notice of
his Seditious Writings.</p>
            <p>I was not a little offended to see him
cast so much Dirt on the Venerable
Names of <hi>Laud, Bramhal,</hi> and <hi>Cousens,</hi>
aspersing the last as a Papist, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his incomparable History of
the <hi>Canon of the Scripture,</hi> and with the
like Solecisme branding him that wrote
<hi>De Deo</hi> for an Atheist. His disingenuity
is visible in his misrepresentation of the
<hi>Loan,</hi> and his mis-quoting of <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dikes</hi>
Passage of Schism. And what is
no less remarkable, is his injurious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64322:76"/>
dealing with Mr. <hi>Hales,</hi> in citing his
Tract of <hi>Schisme,</hi> which he could not but
disallow of, when he declar'd himself of
another Opinion, obtaining leave of
Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi> (who converted him)
to call himself his <hi>Graces</hi> Chaplain,
that naming him in his Publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for his Lord and Patron, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e
notice might be taken of the Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>But to conclude all the Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our Author, I will not deny but
the <hi>Transproser</hi> has merited that Crown
at least which <hi>Gallienus</hi> the Emperour
awarded him, who in a solemn Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flinging ten Darts against a Bull,
from a little distance, never touch't
him with one. Alleadging this Reason,
when some seem'd to wonder at the
Sentence; This Man (says he) is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
above you all. For to cast ten
Darts so little a way against so great
a Mark, and not to hit it, is a thing
which none knows how to do besides
himself.</p>
