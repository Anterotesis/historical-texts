         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I ſpeak not this to impute as

He wanted neither deſire nor
endeavour to have ſpoken to the

ſome Spirit-pretenders in theſe
times, upon his being acquainted
with Truth in a more excellent

other gifts of skill in nature and
tongues acquir'd by a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mans induſtry, by which as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable

'Twas his wiſh expreſs'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in his writings, that if it had
pleas'd God, his education had

ſayes he, <hi>I might perhaps have

            </p>
            <p>Hence comes that unuſuall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
many are ſo much ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

skill. Yet by this are we ſet upon
even ground with thoſe of his
own Nation, and to have done
<pb facs="tcp:61255:4"/>
more, had been not ſimply to
tranſlate, but interpret.</p>
            <p>He that will in any Author
whatever joyntly perform both
theſe offices under one name, had
need of a double ſufficiency. Firſt,
He muſt be a bilinguiſt, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Maſter in the Idiomes of
both tongues he hath to deal with;
as for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to make
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
not to get by rote his <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>

have his head ſtuff'd with Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bularies,
but he muſt know the
whole guiſe of the Countrey, and
forms of elegance moſt in faſhion
in the ſeveral times and places of
the Books double nativity by edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and tranſlation; his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an abſolute free Deniſon of
both, may make him defraud the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:5"/>
Reader he takes pains for, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the ſenſe, but very often
of the chief grace of his Authour.
Secondly, He had need have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the tongues, a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Authors Spirit, elſe he
will oft give us his words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his ſenſe, the Lions skin
ſtuff'd with ſtraw inſtead of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>

            <p>But he that will be this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

be a trilinguiſt at leaſt, skill'd
no leſs in the language of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
than in the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> for want whereof much
of the writings, not of this mans
only, but even of Scripture Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
are in ſome parts rather clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
than clear'd by tranſlations.</p>
            <p>For my own Part I pretend to
no great expertneſs in any of the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:5"/>
three, yet have not been as to this
work without good helps in all;
in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from my birth in
<hi>Sparta,</hi> and education at <hi>Athens;</hi>
in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> I eek'd out my own
skill with the advice of a learned
man of that Nation, one of our
Society of <hi>Peter-houſe</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge;</hi>
for the Angelique, my
way was a little ſmoothed by my
former Peruſall of this Authors
other original writings that ſpeak
the ſame language.</p>
            <p>Yet hath the rare occurſe of
thoſe Idioms in this manual, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with its brevity, been my
chief encouragement to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it, leaving the grand body of
his Divinity to the greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and paines of that publick
ſpirited gentleman who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
enrich'd our Nation with
<pb facs="tcp:61255:6"/>
ſome of his larger volumes, and
not yet weary of well-doing, is in
travell with more.</p>
            <p>As for the matter and ſcope of
this diſcourſe, 'tis to ſhew each
complexion its good and evill,
temptations and remedies.</p>
            <p>I know his Colloquies with
<hi>Black-John</hi> in the melancholy
will make ſome men ſmile, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
our <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>Sadducee,</hi>
that laugh at the thought of a
God, Angell, Soul, or Devill,
and know nothing of the joyes of
Gods Kingdom, or thorough
what a wilderneſs of tribulations
'tis arriv'd to; and how that roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lion that goes about daily
ſeeking whom he may devour,
failes not to uſe all meanes of
continuing the ſeparation 'twixt
the Soul of man and that rock
<pb facs="tcp:61255:6"/>
whence it was hewn, and where
he cannot, by fraughting their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
with helliſh or terrene appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and cares, keep God out of
all their thoughts, ſtrives to beget
ſuch an Idea of him in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
as may juſtly render him
a prick in their eyes, and thorn in
their ſides; which is no hard task
for him to perform with many
ſad ſoules in all religions that
give more credit to human ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
than to Gods oath [that he
hath no pleaſure in the death of
a ſinner] with thoſe cleer Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick
Oracles, that [God would
have all men to be ſav'd and
come to the knowlege of the
truth] and that there is joy in
heaven over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth.]</p>
            <p>This of deſpair hath been even
<pb facs="tcp:61255:7"/>
in our dayes a Rock many have
been ſplit upon, and the hand of
the Devil oft very viſible in ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of this nature: we need not
wonder our Author ſhould ſtore
us up ſome proviſion of adviſe
for ſuch a neceſſity, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
a weapon offenſive as well
as defenſive againſt thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</p>
            <p>It's true, his Replies in conflict
with that wicked Spirit may ſeem
at firſt to have ſomewhat of gall,
but we may take notice he both
ſhewes how effectual a weapon
this of contempt is above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for repulſing this enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
advizes an abſtinence from
this bitterneſs but upon impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
neceſſity.</p>
            <p>The Devill (<hi>ſayes he</hi>) is a proud,
arrogant Spirit: in his viſible terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="tcp:61255:7"/>
apparitions you cannot better
get quit of him than by a bold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
and contempt. As oft ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as by his frightning appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
&amp; diſcouraging ſuggeſtions
he endeavours to drive thee to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
or ſelf-murder, flinch not
an ace at his preſence; but meet him
with a ſtout courage, and upbraid
him with the memory of his loſt
glory and preſent ſhame, how of a
glorious Prince in heaven he is
fall'n to be an infamous hangman
in Hell. This is a bitter pill, he is not
long able to digeſt, two or three
doſes of it, will ſay hard to ſet him a
packing; but uſe it only as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
evill, in caſes of grand terror,
otherwiſe do not by ſuch bitter moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
beſtorm thy own Spirit, and
add new affliction to the calamity
of his fall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61255:8"/>
This inoffenſive carriage, even
to the Devill himſelf (like that of
the Archangell <hi>Michael,</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
him with railing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
and our Saviours not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
ſo far of gratifying them in
their moderate requeſt, as to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
their grief for the loſs of
their Nobler habitation, by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to enter the foul carcaſſes
of the Swine) ſhews in the man
and his doctrine an unparalleld
mildneſs of ſpirit, ſcarce viſible
in the writings or practices of any
that now pretend moſt to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Firſt, we think it lawfull,
nay an act of godly zeal, to ſpit all
our venom in the face of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and then every contrariety
to our humours, opinions, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
looking like him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to have much of the Devill
<pb facs="tcp:61255:8"/>
in it (though indeed of Chriſt)
muſt be ſerv'd with the ſame
ſauce.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if any be offended with
the ill ſavour the Devill leaves
behind him, when he flies away
in fume, he may know that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
a grave Author reports

            <head type="sub">Of the cauſes of fear or ſadneſs:
what the aſtoniſhment and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
is. [about ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
things.]</head>
            <p>ALL ſadneſs and fear, where with
a man terrifies and amazeth
himſelf, is in his inward man from
the ſoul; for the outward Spirit which
hath his original from the Starrs and
Elements is not in this ſort troubled,
becauſe he lives in his Mother which
bore him: but the poor ſoul is with
<hi>Adam</hi> entred into a forein harbour,
<hi>viz.</hi> Into the Spirit of this world,
wherewith the beautifull creature is
veild and captivated as in a darkſome
priſon.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit of this world hath
four ſorts of lodgings, wherein the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:10"/>
pretious jewell is ſhut up. Of theſe
four, there is but one principally mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to one man; as 'tis with the
four Elements, which every man hath
in himſelf, and is himſelf the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
except his ſoul, which is not of that
Eſſence, though it lie as a priſoner
in it; and of theſe four lodgings, or
Images, one only hath the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in his life; the names of them
are as followeth;
<list>
                  <item>1. Cholerick.</item>
                  <item>2. Sanguine.</item>
                  <item>3. Phlegm.</item>
                  <item>4. Melancholy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cholerick</hi> is
of the feavers property, cauſes a ſtout
courage, haſty anger, ſwelling pride,
ſelf-willedneſs, mindleſneſs of others;
This image ſhines after the outward
world, in a ſide-light, labours after
the power of the Sun, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be a Lord.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sanguine,</hi> is
after the nature of Air, ſubtill, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
cheerfull, yet not of a ſtout cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
it is mutable, and eaſily moved
<pb facs="tcp:61255:10"/>
from one thing to another, receives
naturally the Starry properties and
knowledge into her eſſence, its pure
and chaſt, and brings great myſtery
[of knowledge] into her underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> is after the
waters nature and property, fleſhly,
rude and ſoft, of a feminine will, of
but a reaſonable comprehenſion, yet
holds faſt what it hath once attained;
knowledge muſt be infuſed into it by
teaching, for ſhe finds it not in her
own root. She takes all in good part,
troubles not her ſelf with grief, hath
a glance of light, is neither extremely
ſad or merry, but is altogether of a
middle and common temper.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Melancholy</hi> being of the
earths nature and property, is as the
earth, cold, frozen, dark, and full of
heavineſs, hungry after the light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
fearfull of the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>For the Earth and Stones are on
the outſide of the Eternall eſſentiality
<pb facs="tcp:61255:11"/>
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) are comprehended or capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in the kindled deſire in the <hi>Fiat,</hi>
both according to the property of the
anger and love; the good and evill
are in them mixt one with another;
the Good ſtands in a perpetual fear
of the Evill, which make a perpetual
flight and purſuit: as 'tis to be ſeen
in metalls, whoſe Tincture is good, but
the body altogether earthly, evill and
of an angry corroſive nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Tincture of the Metalls, as
ſoon as the malignant ſtarry influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
toucheth it, would fly from the
earthly and uncenter it ſelf from it;
hence comes the growth of the Metalls,
for their Tincture drives their deſire
out of it ſelf, and deſire to fly away;
but receives in the deſire ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriety
as the ſpirit or deſire it ſelf is,
hence ariſeth the Metallick body.</p>
            <p>The Melancholy nature is dark
and dry, yields little corporiety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
and corrodes it ſelf inwardly in
its own being, remains conſtantly in
<pb facs="tcp:61255:11"/>
the houſe of mourning, and even
when the Sun ſhines in her, yet is ſhe
in her ſelf ſorrowfull, ſhe receives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſome refreſhment from the Suns
glance, but in the dark ſhe is alwaies
in fear and horror of Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Obſerve here further, the nature
of the ſad minde.</head>
               <p>IF this Complexion hath predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in a man, ſo that it be his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
complexion, then doth the poor
ſoul as the pretious jewell inhabit
this houſe; and muſt during the time
of the life (if ſhe hath not yet fully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the light of God in herſelf) help
herſelf with the glance of the Sun, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divine Light-eye was in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
ſhut up to her in the earthly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
into which ſhe entred. The
Soul hath in <hi>Adam</hi> ſuffered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
as alſo the Spirit of the great
world, the Starrs and Elements, to
<pb facs="tcp:61255:12"/>
enter into her; which during the time
of this life, dwell intermixedly the one
in the other; the Soul in the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
and the complexion in the Soul,
yet one of them comprehends not the
other eſſentially: the Soul is deeper
than the outward Spirit, though in
this life they hang upon each other
as the inward and outward world, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which yet is the other, ſo
likewiſe the outward Spirit is not the
Soul.</p>
               <p>Know further, that, The Soul is
in her ſubſtance a Magicall fire-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or property out of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Nature; a vehement deſire after
the light, as God the Father from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
with a moſt intenſe longing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
his heart, to wit, the Center of
light, and in his deſiring will, begets
him out of the firy property, as the
light is now uſually born out of the
fire.</p>
               <p>Now, there can be no fire, but
there muſt be alſo there a root for the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:12"/>
firy ſubſiſtence, to wit, the Center or
image to Nature; this the ſoul hath
alſo in it ſelf, and burns out of the
Image to Nature [or the Naturall
complexion] to wit, out of the dark
world which in her fountain of deſire
drives it ſelf till unto the firy proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then deſires it the liberty (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
the light, as in the Book of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
life is expreſſed.</p>
               <p>So then the Soul being a hungry
Magicall Spirit-fire, deſires ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eſſentiality and power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhe may nouriſh and preſerve
her fire-life, and ſtill the thirſt of
her firy fountain. Now 'tis well
known, how that ſhe hath with
<hi>Adam</hi> in his diſobedience entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Spirit of this world, and eaten
of it. Whereupon Chriſt became a
man in our eſſence, that he might
bring her again thorough the Center,
and thorough Gods fire into his
light, namely into the world of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which in the perſon of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:61255:13"/>
was actually; but our ſoul ſeeing that
from the mothers wombe it remains
involved in the Spirit of the great
world in the Complexions, it eats
from the very birth, yea, even in the
mothers wombe, of the Spirit of this
world.</p>
               <p>The Soul eats ſpiritual meat, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Spirit of the image of the
complexions, not altogether their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but Magically: it is the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their fire. The Complexions in
the ſoules fire become ſouliſh [or of a
ſoular property.] They are as wood
and fire to each other: underſtand by
wood, the Complexion; by fire, the
Soul. Now the fire muſt have fewell,
<hi>viz.</hi> Either the outward complexion
or a divine eſſentiality of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
of one of theſe muſt ſhe eat or
dy; but 'tis not poſſible for her to
periſh, ſeeing ſhe is a deſire, and
where there is a deſiring, there is alſo
a being; the deſire makes a being to
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:13"/>
By this we underſtand whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
ſuch a difference in the wills and
actions of men.</p>
               <p>For of what the Soul eats, and
wheerin her fire-life is kindled, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
doth the life of the Soul exerciſe
her Regiment.</p>
               <p>Goe's the Soul out of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
into Gods Love-fire into the
heavenly eſſentiality (which is Chriſts
corporiety according to the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
light-world) then eats ſhe of
Chriſts heavenly fleſh, of his eternal
eſſentiality of the mildneſs of the
Majeſtick light, in which the fire of
God the Father, in the glance [reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the light] makes a Tincture
in the ſame eſſentiality in the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fountain
of everlaſting life whereof
Chriſt ſpeaks, ſaying, that he would
give us ſuch water to drink.</p>
               <p>Of this water doth the ſouls fire eat,
as of Divine, heavenly, eſſentiality,
which in the Tincture is converted
into heavenly and ſpiritual blood,
<pb facs="tcp:61255:14"/>
whence ariſeth in the Soul a Godly
will, wherewith ſhe compells the body
to do that which according to its own
inclination and ſpirit of this world, it
would not do; in ſuch ſouls the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
rules not, but remaines only
in the lower fleſhly nature, exerciſes
the Regiment, as to the outward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
onely. The man enquires after
Gods Word, and hath alwayes an
unceſſant longing after God; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is ever to diſcourſe of God, would
always gladly taſt more of Gods ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but is clouded and hindred by
the Complexion; in ſo much that he
lives in a continuall combat. The
Soul fights againſts the Complexion
(for they are here linked together in
one band) and the Complexion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Soul, it would ever gladly
enter into the Souls fire, and kindle it
ſelf, and obtain a life in it. For when
the Soul eats of Gods Word, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
according to the outward life
becomes powerleſs, and as it were a
<pb facs="tcp:61255:14"/>
captive, th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the ſoul is ſo ſtedfaſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
before Gods Love, which alone
comes to her help [in the combat] that
oft when ſhe eats of Gods Love, and
eſſence, ſhe induceth a triumph and
a Divine taſte into the complexion it
ſelf, that the whole body begins to be
rouſed up into a trembling and height
of joy, as Paradiſe were now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but his condition proves not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
for the ſoul is ſhortly after over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
with ſomething of another
nature, which is inſinuated into the
Complexion by the outward imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Spirit of the great world,
whereof ſhe makes a looking-glaſs, and
begins to contemplate in it with her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
imagination. Thus goes ſhe out
from the Spirit of God, and is oft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
in the dirt, were it not that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Wiſdom of God ſhould call her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

               <p>WHen the Soul imagines into the

Will, ſhe then doth after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Complexion; ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
all whatſoever is injected by the
Starrs unto the Complexion, all that
the Spirit of the great world brings into
the complexion by its imagination. She
empoyſons herſelf thorough the deſire
in the complexion in the whole outward
Nature, in all that the world doth in
words and works. Such matter as this
the deſire of the complexion brings into
the ſoul-fire, [or its fewell] and the
Soul-fire burnes [or feeds it ſelf] therein.
Here we ſee how all evill deeds and
works burn in the fire of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

is not agreeable to Gods Love, that
cannot the Love receive. Here find we
likewiſe what and how ſin is, how Gods

life of the ſoul ſuch abomination as a
man works is brought in to him, which
withhold the Soul from Gods Love, and
make the Soul-fire ſtark-blind to Gods
Wiſdom and Light.</p>
               <p>For the Spirit of God enters not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fire burning or life of the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
till the Soul again goes out
of it, and bathes it ſelf again in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

paſs thorough a ſerious repentance: then
is the Soul renewed again in the fire of
Gods mildneſs, as a new born child, and
begins again to drink of the ſame water
and lives in God.</p>

            <p>The Devill can introduce all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
he exerciſes in Hell it ſelf into this
complexion, and if the ſtarrs hinder not,
&amp; the ſoul will give way to it, he gets as
much advantage here as he doth in the
fire of the Cholerick complexion; For
ſin here is little regarded as the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtream
that paſſes away. He hath power
likewiſe to aſſault this ſoul with ſadneſs,
whenſoever ſhe goes about to oppoſe
him: For he darkens the water-glance
with the ſinns foulneſs, which ſhe had
brought in, and ſhuts in the ſoul in this
dark priſon that ſhe cannot behold God;
but when the ſoul with a ſtrong reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſtorms the priſon-gates, ſhe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
herſelf, the Devill can ſubſiſt here
no longer, the complexion is too weak

            <head type="sub">Of the Melancholy complexion.</head>
            <p>THE Melancholy complexion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
the ſad earth, which ſtands
in a perpetual fear before the wrath of
God which came into her in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It gives a moderate underſtanding,
yet of deep cogitations.</p>
            <p>The complexion-chamber ſtands
open, and is capable of much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
if the way be not blocked up by
too much ſadneſs.</p>
            <p>Is the ſoul clothed with this comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
and takes ſhe her nouriſhment
from it? then doth her fire burn extreme
dark: then is ſhe likewiſe exceeding ſad
eſteems not much of any worldly pomp,
and is by reaſon of the complexion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in heavineſs; the Devill mightily
aſſaults her, being deſirous to throw her
<pb facs="tcp:61255:20"/>
headlong into the full poſſeſſion of his
Kingdom of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>For he enters there gladly where dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs
hath the predominance: he makes
ſtrange repreſentations to the ſoul, and
frights her with the thoughts of her
own wickedneſs, that ſhe may deſpair of
Gods grace; For otherwiſe the ſoul in
this chamber of melancholy is not much
ſerviceable, if ſhe depart not from Gods
grace, and grow light-minded: but then
the bodily complexion may ſerve him
in the office of a robber and murderer
who regards man, God, and the Devill
all alike: For if ſhe once turn a ſide from
God, and give herſelf over to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the complexion, then all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the ſtarrs work in the complexion,
ſhe puts it in execution, and the Devill
mixes his imagination therewith.</p>
            <p>But while ſhe remains in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
againſt the ſadneſs of the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion,
there is none among all the four
complexions whereinto leſs wickedneſs
is introduc't; For ſhe is alwayes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
againſt the Devill, knowing him to
<pb facs="tcp:61255:20"/>
be her very neer neighbour; for the
darkneſs is his habitation: therefore doth
he ſo willingly aſſault the melancholy
ſoul: ſtriving alwayes, either to keep
her in the darkneſs, or to throw her
down headlong from he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hope in God,
that ſhe may deſpair and make away
herſelf.</p>
            <p>For he knowes well what the ſoul can
do, if ſhe once kindle Gods light in her;
for then ſhe fires his Garriſon over his
head, whereupon he remaines in great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy,
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd his deceit is made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Ther's no complexion wherein the
Devills will, with all his ſly ſuggeſtions,
lie more open to the cleareſt diſcovery,
(if the ſoul be once kindled in Gods
light) than in the Melancholy, as they
that in their ſtorming his Fort, have felt
his onſets, well know. For they then in
their enlightned complexion ſee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what a ſhameleſs impure Harpy he is.
After that, he deſires not to come near
the ſoul, except he finds her ſecure: and
<hi>in ſuo, (i. e.</hi>) returning to feaſt herſelf
in the houſe of ſin: then he comes as a
<pb facs="tcp:61255:21"/>
fawning Spaniel, ſo as the ſoul knows
him not: Strowes ſugar upon her viands,
holds forth to her nothing but ſhewes
of friendlineſs and piety till he can bring
her back again out of Gods light into
the complexion, that ſhe feed upon
its unwholſome ſad making nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>O how cunningly doth he lay his
Nets for the unwary ſoul, as a Fowler
for the birds? Oft he frights her in her
prayer (eſpecially on the night time,
when 'tis dark) injects his imagination
into hers, that ſhe thinks Gods wrath
now ſeizes upon her, and will throw her
into hell: then he makes ſemblance to
have power over the ſoul, as if ſhe were
his, though indeed he hath not power to
touch one hair of the head, except ſhe
deſpairing yield herſelf over into his
hands; he dares neither ſpiritually take
poſſeſſion of her, nor touch her, only
darts his temptations into her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thorough the complexion.</p>
            <p>For this is the reaſon why he ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
this ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion-chamber
<pb facs="tcp:61255:21"/>
is dark, for into the
light he cannot intrude his imagination,
'tis mans ſin muſt give him entrance,
but into this complexion he finds an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
and moſt natural entrance, it being
of a nature ſo neer that of his own moſt
deſir'd home, becauſe its dark deſire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
darkneſs, in which ſear is an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
by reaſon of the wild earth; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in this reſpect, he hath not one
ſpark more of right to, or dominion in
this, than the other complexions. He can
accompliſh no more in the imagination
than only to affright the man, and make
fainthearted, if the ſoul thorough diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
do not give over herſelf to him, then
he induceth the man at laſt to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
himſelf, for except the man firſt
caſt a way himſelf, he dare not lay hands
on him.</p>
            <p>The Soul ha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h its Free-will or choiſe,
and if it withſtand the Devill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
conſent, however deſirous he be,
yet hath he not ſo much power as to
touch the outward ſinfull body; he boaſts
himſelf indeed as if he had this power,
<pb facs="tcp:61255:22"/>
but is a liar; for had he ſuch power, he
would ſoon ſhew it. But 'tis not ſo;
Chriſt hath by his entrance into death,
and Hells darkeſt dungeons, ſet open the
gate of Heaven for all ſouls; each one
hath now a free entrance; the Devills
ſtrong cords wherewith he faſt bound
the ſoul in <hi>Adam,</hi> is broken in ſunder by
the Croſs.</p>
            <p>O how unwillingly does he hear the
Croſs mention'd, which ſeriouſly applied,
[in the work of mortification] is his
moſt deadly peſtilence.</p>
            <p>The Devill is ever objecting to the
melancholy man the hainouſneſs of his
ſinns; and thereupon ſeeks to perſuade
him ther's no poſſibility of attaining
Gods grace and favour: therefore that it
only remains, he deſpairing, ſtab, drown
or hang himſelf, or murder another, that
ſo he may gain an approach to the ſoul,
otherwiſe he neither dare nor can touch
her.</p>
            <p>But if he can ſo farr prevail with the
ſoul, that ſhe conſent to his ſuggeſtion,
then is he as a hangman that binds a
<pb facs="tcp:61255:22"/>
priſoner, and leads him to execution, yet
dares not execute any thing upon her,
till ſhe herſelf become her own, both
judge and executioner.</p>

               <head>A receipt for the Prince of Darkneſs
when he comes in his black viſard to
affright the ſoul into deſpair.</head>
               <p>WHen he ſollicits the poor ſoul to
deſpair, let a man at his coming ſet
before him this following receipt to feed
upon.</p>
               <p>The Devill is a proud arrogant ſpirit,
whom a man cannot any wayes more
vex, ſo as to make him quit the place,
than by withſtanding him with a bold,
cheerfull, and couragious Spirit, without
ſhewing the leſt fear or terror at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
(for he hath not one ſtraw of
power to hurt) And likewiſe by caſting
in his diſh the ſhame of his fall, of how
beautiful an Angell he's now metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos'd
into a black deformed Devill.
Firſt, when he comes with the ſin-regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and makes a ſhow of his power and
<pb facs="tcp:61255:23"/>
free entrance he hath gain'd to aſſault
thee, by no means diſpute with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give
him to that point no anſwer. But when
he firſt onſets the ſoul by injecting into
her imagination evill thoughts [of God]
and the horror of ſins paſt, and gives out,
as if he would now ſnatch her away
with him in a terrible ſtorm; then bear
up againſt him with a freſh courage,
and ſay whence com'ſt thou, thou foul
Spirit? I thought thou hadſt been in
Heaven among the Angells, but thou it
ſeems ſever'd from that communion,
comſt hither to boaſt thy ſelf with the
Regiſter-book of Gods wrath. I thought
thou haſt been a Prince in the Divine
Regiment, how comes it thou art caſt
down from that high dignity to be his
Jaylor? is then ſuch a bright Angell
turn'd down to be hangman? fie on thee,
what wilt thou with me? get thee hence
into heaven to the Angells if thou bees't
Gods ſervant. Avant hence thou execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
of Gods wrath, go to thine own
Angells, here thou haſt nothing to do.
This receipt he will, I Hope, feed on with
<pb facs="tcp:61255:23"/>
an appetite, 'tis for his health. Will he
not yet begone, but ſtill holds forth the
ſin-regiſter? then ſtand before him, and
ſay, read, and take good notice of theſe
words; <hi>[The ſeed of the Woman ſhall
bruiſe the Serpents head]</hi> Canſt thou not
find it? Stay a little and I will light a
candle to help thee: it ſtands regiſtred in
the ſame place with <hi>Adams</hi> fall, where
immediatly upon the denuntiation of
Judgment from Gods wrath upon man,
followes this ſentence of wrath upon
thee, and of mercy to the fall'n Sons of
<hi>Adam,</hi> That the Womans ſeed ſhould
cruſh thy head. This is another receipt
will pleaſe him no leſs than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>But if he will not yet be gone, but
ſhall ſtill urge, Thou art a groſs ſinner;
haſt purpoſely committed this or that
heinous ſin, which thou knewſt to be an
offence yet would ſtill cover the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with the outward mantle of Gods
gace, when as the principle of Gods
wrath was indeed kindled in thee, and
that therefore thou art now the Devills
propriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:24"/>
Thus by the injections of the Devills
imagination is the poor ſoul oft caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch affrighting thoughts, as theſe
thou haſt been a moſt heinous ſinner,
and for this cauſe God hath forſaken
thee.</p>
               <p>Now will the Devill lay hold on thee,
and throw thee headlong into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs

               <p>But when he ſignifies his approach by

wert he that wrought the ſin in me, keep

Chriſt hath wrought in me that
righteouſneſs that is accepted with God,
this I will keep to my ſelf, his death and

for my ſinns that I have committed, and
is riſen up in his righteouſneſs, and has
receiv'd my ſoul into his ſatisfaction.
Chriſt is in me, and I in him, my ſin is in
thee, and thou in Hell.</p>
               <p>Mock him further, ſaying, go too, thou
glorious Angell that couldſt not ſtand
one day in Heaven. That waſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an Archangell, but now boaſts
thy ſelf of the ſin-regiſter, the filthy ſins

Chriſt hath ſaid <hi>[My ſheep are in mine

them me, is greater than all.]</hi> How art
thou bright Angell turn'd to a drudge to
bear about that ſack full fraught with
ſins? from a Prince to a baſe Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner?
Get thee hence with thy load of
ſin, and take mine in to make up waight,
for 'tis mens ſinns thou haſt moſt need
of, nor doth ought elſe belong to thee
in my ſoul, thou haſt not the leaſt ſhare;
here I ſtand, devour me if thou canſt.
But ſee, I have in me a ſigne or mark,
<hi>viz.</hi> the ſign of the Croſs, whereon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

               <p>Suffer not by any means thy thoughts

at his preſence; Let nothing make thee
diſpair by day or by night: he dares do
nothing to thee, though thou mockſt
him never ſo bitterly, he giving cauſe for
it, otherwiſe mock him not.</p>
               <p>If the inward anguiſh or terror of
ſoul be not accompanied with a kinde
of [outward] terrifying aſtoniſhment,
then is the Devill not there preſent, but
tis the ſouls amazement which is affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the inward riſings of the dark
Abyſs or principle of Gods wrath in
her. She thinks oft when the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complexion is kindled by ſome angry
ſour influence of the Starrs, that the
Devill is there, when indeed there is no
ſuch matter. When he comes, 'tis either
with vehement aſtoniſhing terrors, or in
an Angells behaviour, or rather in a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
poſture like a fawning hound. If
he comes to thee in the dark and skares
thee, thou being in the dark ſtir not a
foot from thy place, ſhe not from him:
he is not worthy a man ſhould do him
that honour. Mock him in the dark,
<pb facs="tcp:61255:26"/>
ſaying, how-now? art thou there? I

more ſtinking abode. Let this when he
ther comes be his entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
give him not by cauſeleſs provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
any occaſion of drawing neer. A
ſtout-hearted man that ſtarts not back
for all his menaces, he doth not lightly
aſſault, eſpecially if withall he take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and mock him, for he is proud and
would be Lord whereſoever he be, ſo if
the man he aſſaults will not flinch nor
give back his ground, it much troubles
him, he will not ſtay long there; and if
(as moſt commonly) at his departing he
leave a ſtinck behind him, then leave
the place for that time, ſaying, Fie
thou ſtincking hangman, how ſtrong
thou ſmelleſt of thy own dungeon?
the draught-houſe ſmells not ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;
thus repuls'd with ſcorn, he
will have ſmall mind to return again in

ſoul.</p>
               <p>Entertain (as I ſaid) no diſpute with
him in thy mind, for he is not worthy
the ſpending an argument upon; Fix this
one following ſentence in thy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which will be enough nor ſhalt thou
in the greateſt affrightments need more
comfort) <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt the
Son of God, cleaſeth us from all our
ſins.</hi> Herein wrap up all thy thoughts, let
for the time no other iſſue out of thy
heart, let the Devill ſuggeſt to thy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
what he will, know all what
he ſayes is a lie, but this ſentence is a
firm truth; hold it faſt as thine own,
maugre all his ſly ſuggeſtions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Make not proviſion of many ſayings
againſt the aſſaults of terror; he is too
ſubtle for thee, ſteales the firſt &amp; beſt out
of thy heart, that thou forgeteſt or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of it. Wrap up thy whole ſoul &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in one; ther's ſtrength enough in
one to withſtand him, thou maiſt in it
ſtrength, wilt thou but wrap up thy ſoul
<pb facs="tcp:61255:27"/>
in it eaſily put him to ſhame. Neither
can he touch thee, nor will he long abide
thy preſence. If thou manfully ſtand
thy ground and give not back, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a laughing-ſtock to his other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
employed in his ſervice among
men, and alſo the holy Angells, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he uſually takes his wings and flies
away before he be forc'd by thoſe tart

               <p>Repeat therefore as need requires that
one ſaying thou haſt made choiſe of,
fix it in thy heart, and from thence
ſtrengthen thy courage againſt him; the
Spirit that lies hid in the holy Oracle,
will not fail to ſtand by thee. Though

(though in the wrath his own principle)
againſt him; yea though thou art in

the door of grace, it now ſtands wide
open to the poor finner while he lives
<pb facs="tcp:61255:27"/>
upon earth, this door of grace ſtands open
in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath in his ſoul broke ope the
Iron gate that was faſt ſhut up in Gods
wrath. Now all ſouls have a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

they all come from one, and are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
one tree with many branches: his

gone forth upon all ſouls from <hi>Adam</hi>
till the laſt men: the door of grace ſtands
open to them all: God hath ſhut it up
to none but thoſe that will needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

his ingreſs into the manhood is manifeſt
to all ſouls: the ſame will be a witneſs

day, which they have deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Though our ſins (ſaith <hi>Eſaias</hi>) were as
red as blood, yet ſtands the door of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſtill open, for in the ſinners converſion
they ſhall be made as white as the ſnowy

Can a mother forget her child that
ſhe take not pity of the ſon of her

<pb facs="tcp:61255:28"/>
                  <hi>I will no forget you: for I have markt
you in mine hand. viz.</hi> In his hand
pierc'd thorough with the ſharp nailes,
and in his ſpear-wounded ſide did he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
the everlaſting memorial of the
ſoul of all ſouls.</p>
               <p>Will now any man not come and reſt
himſelf therein, but contemn the mark
of Chriſt, or ſuffer the Devill to cover
it, he is himſelf in the fault: and though
he cover it, yet remains it ſtill deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
in the greateſt ſinner that lives on
earth. For <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſayes in the Spirit of
Chriſt; <hi>Though a mother forget her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
(which ſhe cannot do but with
great grief) <hi>yet ſhall his love and grace
never be forgotten;</hi> he forgets not the
ſouls, though never ſo deep dyed in the
ſinfull Tincture, for he hath engraven
their character in his own Blood and
Death; not of ſome only, but of the
whole tree, intire with its root &amp; branches,
and as ſin came from one upon all: ſo
(ſaith the Apoſtle) came righteouſneſs
through Chriſt upon all. As the ſin from
one pierc'd through all unto death, ſo had
<pb facs="tcp:61255:28"/>
the righteouſneſs out of Chriſt its impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
from one into the whole ſtock
with all its branches, to animate them
to a new life.</p>
               <p>But that all men partake not of this
life the fault is in their own will, their
will is free. Gods will is that all men
ſhould be holpen, and Pſal. 5. <hi>Thou

               </p>
               <p>Therefore let no ſoul think, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of mine iniquities is full: God hath

cannot be ſo: he hath engraven her in
his nail-pierced hands. She is a ſprig of
the great tree of all ſouls, and hath an

               <p>ALL temptation comes not from the
Devill, eſpecially with melancholy
men, but the moſt part of that afflicting
ſadneſs which falls ſo heavy upon them,
comes from the imagination of the ſoul,
which being neceſſitated to dwell in
dark melancholy habitations, no wonder
if it be eaſily ſurpriſed with heavineſs, ſo
as to think God hath forgotten her, and
will have none of her. For the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
complexion is dark and hath no
light of its own, as the other complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have; yet is not this darkneſs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
to the ſoul; but is only her lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
tabernacle, during her pilgrimage
here on earth; nor doth the ſouls holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and righteouſnes conſiſt at all in the
complexion, but [is deep rooted, <hi>viz.]</hi>
in the inward heavenly principle where
God dwells. For as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi>
3. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:29"/>
Now this Heaven wherein God dwels
is not manifeſted in the outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
but only in it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
ſecond principle.</p>
               <p>It oft happens, that the holieſt ſouls
are in this manner overwhelmed with
ſadneſs, and this not without Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
permiſſion, to the end they may be
proved, and ſtrive the more earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that heavenly crown of victory
which is given them in this life as a
pledge of their everlaſting felicity.</p>
               <p>For, when the ſoul takes heaven as
'twere by ſtorm, and winns her crown
(the gift of the Holy Ghoſt) after a
conſtant perſevering ſtedfaſtneſs in the
fiery conflict, her Crown of triumph is
much more noble and pretious, than that
which is not obtain'd till after the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
death, for the Revelation of Jeſus
Chriſt ſaith; <hi>To him that over comes will
I give to ſit with me upon my Throne, as
I have overcome, and am ſeated on my
Fathers Throne.</hi> Item; <hi>To him that
overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden
Manna, and will give him a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,
<pb facs="tcp:61255:30"/>
and with the Teſtimony a new
name written which no man knows but
he that receives it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to the natural cauſe of
ſadneſs in the melancholy complexion.</p>
               <p>There oft happens a malignant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Starrs, or Eclypſe of the
Sun or Moon, which if it chance to be in
an earthly ſigne, and ♂ poyſon the ☌ with
his helliſh influence, then does the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this ☌ mightily terrify this ſoul
enwrapt in the melancholy complexion
ſhe always imagines 'tis the fierce wrath
of God is riſen up againſt her, or that tis
the Devill is now come to hale her away
into Hell. For her complexion being
ſtrongly imbiterd with ♂ his venemous
beames, and finding herſelf enclos'd in a
deſolate and dark dwelling, ſhe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagins God hath caſt her from him,
and will have none of her, and this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when ſhe caſts her imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the complexion by an anxious ſearch,
and ſo feeds upon ♂ his poyſonous breath,
blowes up her fire-life therewith, then is
ſhe fill'd with a moſt bitter anguiſh and
<pb facs="tcp:61255:30"/>
horible fear of the Devill, and Gods
wrath in her. Then begins ſhe to ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and think that God hath not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
her to eternall life in Jeſus Chriſt,
whereupon ſhe becomes ſo diſcontented,
that ſhe cannot willingly lift up her eyes
and countenance to God, thinketh her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſuch a heinous ſinner that the door
of grace is wholly ſhut up againſt
her.</p>
               <p>But all this is nothing really but a
fancy ariſing from the complexion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
by the ſtarry influence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the ſoul plagues herſelf. For when
the Macrocoſmick Spirit hath, in the
Conſtellations vehicle, inſinuated it ſelf
into her, it acts in her like a <hi>Hocus-Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
fills her brain with ſtrange fancies,
in ſo much that both the deluded ſoul is
therewith much afflicted, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſpirit enflames it ſelf in the earthy
origination, whence the centrall wheel
of Nature whirles faſt about, that the
Spirit cannot fixedly lay hold upon and
ſtay the thoughts; which is properly mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
with which we oft hear how me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb facs="tcp:61255:31"/>
men are infeſted; Which when
the Devill ſees, he injects likewiſe his
imagination, torments the ſoul yet worſe:
but he hath no power to hurt her but by
herſelf, only the ſame principle which is
the fountain of anguiſh in the ſoul,
is alſo the fountain of his life [as Devil]
and therefore he is moſt delighted in
ſuch a lodging. Except in this he hath
a perfect abhorrency from the whole
nature of mankind.</p>
               <p>Therefore let no man thus tormented
with anguiſh imagin within himſelf in
the aſſaults of the complexion, that it
comes from Gods wrath and want of
mercy in him, which is a meer fancy of
his own complexion in the ſtarrs. For
we well ſee that the vileſt fatted ſwine of
the Devills herd, that wallow and bath
themſelves day and night in the filth of
ſin, are not ſo full of ſadneſs, not ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
with this kinde of temptation;
the reaſon is, becauſe they have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
light in the complexion, wherein
they dance before the Devill in an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
likeneſs. So, as long as there is but
<pb facs="tcp:61255:31"/>
one little ſparke of light glimmering in
a mans heart, which deſires Gods grace,
and would gladly partake of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the door of Gods grace ſtands yet
open.</p>
               <p>For he who is given over by God,
whoſe ſin is come to the full meaſure, he
is not at all ſollicitous after God, Man,
or Devill, but is ſtone-blind, runs on
careleſly in a courſe of lightneſs without
fear, reſts himſelf upon a cuſtomary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of ſome outward ſervice of God;
goes a beaſt into the ſanctuary, and
comes again a beaſt out; there is in him
no true divine knowledge, but all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is a meer outward cuſtome and
Chimaera of mans brain, which he ſets
up to himſelf as an Idol, and embraces
it as his holineſs.</p>
               <p>Hereby may the Melancholy minde
perceive that God doth not ſo thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifeſt his wrath in this life. For
however the ungodly be puniſh'd by God
in this life, he looks at the puniſhment
not as coming from a divine hand, but
as a thing caſually befallen him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:32"/>
But that this troubled conſc<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ence, is
rather a ſubject of his pity than wrath,
that of the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evidence, <hi>A bruiſed read will he not
break, and ſmoking fl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>x will he not
quench.</hi> Item, Matth. 11. <hi>Come to me,
all yee that are ſadned in ſpirit, and I
will refreſh you.</hi> Now, his yoke is this,
that what in the courſe of Nature, or by
ſpeciall providence befalls the ſoul be it
temptation, perſecution, weakneſs of
body or ſpirit, a man bear it with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and caſt himſelf with a reſigned
will into Gods free love and mercy;
The affliction then cannot hurt the ſoul
at all but rather much profits it. For
while ſhe ſits contentedly in the houſe of
mourning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe is not in the houſe of ſin,
<hi>viz.</hi> the worlds pride and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for God holds her hereby faſt
chain'd from ranging abroad to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe
herſelf in the delights of ſin.</p>
               <p>She muſt be content to remain in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for a little while, but alas what is it?
how ſoon will ſhe be at liberty from her
ſorrowfull priſon, and have the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:61255:32"/>
Crown of everlaſting joy ſet upon
her head. O Eternity, thy duration is of
a vaſt extent; what is it for a ſoul to be
a ſmall moment of time in ſadneſs, and
after that to rejoyce everlaſtingly? for
God will wipe all teares from their
eyes.</p>
               <p>As long as there is in the ſoul but one
ſingle ſparke that breaths after God,
Gods ſpirit is it ſelf preſent in that ſpark.
For that a man is deſirous of God and
earneſtly labours after him with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thirſt, comes in no wiſe from the
now corrupted nature of man, but 'tis
the impulſe of the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt drawing the ſoul towards him.
The Holy Ghoſt is it ſelf the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
No man can deſire God without
Gods Spirit, which is alwayes in ſuch
deſire, and holds faſt the will of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
in God, whereby the poor ſoul is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
from falling away; for <hi>S. Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>We know not what we ſhould ſpeak
before God, when we pray, but the ſpirit
of God intercedes for us with gronings
which cannot be uttered according, to the
good pleaſure of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:33"/>
Why ſhould we then any longer reſt
in puſillanimous doubting of his grace
and good will towards us? he is far more
willing at all time to receive us to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
than we are to come to him.</p>
               <p>See how he dealt with the loſt Son
which had waſted his Fathers inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
among the Devills fatted ſwine,
and was now become a naked and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ſwineherd? how as ſoon as he ſaw
him returning to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he fell upon his
neck and kiſſed him, ſaying, <hi>This is my
dear Son whom I had once loſt, but is
now come home again, he was dead, but
is now again reſtor'd to life?</hi> how he
ſtirr'd up himſelf with his whole houſe &amp;
neighbourhood, to rejoyce over his once
prodigall Son return'd again into his
boſom? according to what Chriſt in
another place teſtifies more explicitely,
that there is joy in Heaven among the
Angells of God over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth,
more than over 99 juſt perſons
that need no repentance.</p>
               <p>This loſt Son is no other than the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſinfull man, when he begins to be
<pb facs="tcp:61255:33"/>
ſenſible how great a ſinner he hath been,
and thinks of betaking himſelf to Gods
mercy, then doth our moſt gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Chriſt Jeſus go out to meet him,
embraces him with the deepeſt joy, and
both the Angells and holy Souls in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
rejoyce exceedingly, that a beloved
Soul, a dear brother, is come up to
them from out of the houſe of ſin and
death.</p>
               <p>The ſorrowfull ſoul troubles and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
herſelf, becauſe ſhe cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
in the point of her deſire exſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
dig up in herſelf the fountain of
the greateſt joy; ſhe ſighs and bewailes
her ſad condition, thinks God will have
none of her, when ſhe cannot palpably
feel his preſence. She ſees other men,
that walk along with her in the way of
Gods fear, that yet are cheerfull enough,
and ſuppoſing this cheerfulneſs of theirs
proceeds only from a divine fountain of
love and light in their ſouls is conceited,
that ſhe is not accepted with God, but
rather rejected by him, becauſe ſhe does
not preſently upon her converſion which
<pb facs="tcp:61255:34"/>
ſhe expected, feel in her heart the like
comfortable effects of the refreſhing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God.</p>
               <p>Before the time of my enlightning, it
went even thus with me: I ſtood out a
hard conflict before I obtain'd my preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Crown of victory, and then did I firſt
learn out this experimental knowledge,
that God dwells not in the outward fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy
heart, but in the ſouls center, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
then was I alſo firſt aware of it, that
'twas God which had laid hold on me
and drawn me to him in my firſt deſire,
which before I was ignorant of, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the good deſire had been my own
property, and that God was indeed far
from me. But afterwards I ſaw him,
and rejoyc'd at the unſpeakable grace
and love of God, and now write the
ſame for a caveat, that they by no
meanes faint or deſpair, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
delayes his comming, but rather
think of that of <hi>David, Heavineſs may
endure for a night, but joy commeth in
the morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus hath it far'd with many of the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:34"/>
chiefeſt ſaints of God, they were forc'd
to ſtrive a long time for their Crown of
Victory; nor indeed is any man crown'd
therewith, till he hath paſſed as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
through the combat. Tis indeed
depoſited neer the ſoul, but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
principle, the ſoul ſtands fixt upon
the firſt principle, and therefore if ſhe
will have the Crown ſet upon her head
in the time of this life, ſhe muſt earneſtly
fight and contend for it. And then if ſhe
go not ſo far as to obtain it in this world,
yet ſhe obtains it after this life, in the
laying down of this earthly tabernacle.
For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be of a good comfort, I
have overcome the world, and in the
world you have ſorrow, but in me peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The precious pearl lies in many an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted
and troubled ſpirit, much neerer
than in them that think they have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
comprehended it; but it hides it ſelf:
for where it lies richeſt and moſt noble,
there will it not eaſily diſcover it ſelf, but
rather wraps it ſelf cloſe up as if it would
never be communicated, therefore let
no ſoul be hereby terrified or amazed.
<pb facs="tcp:61255:35"/>
She therefore hides herſelf, that the
deſire of the ſoul being the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
enflamed after her, may in the
comprehenſion drink deep to aſſuage
her thirſt, and meanwhile knock
unweariedly at her gates till it be
opened unto him. For ſayes Chriſt,
<hi>Seek and ye ſhall find, knock and it
ſhall be opened unto you;</hi> And, <hi>My
Father will give the Holy Spirit to
them that pray to him for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Have a certain aſſured confidence
upon Gods promiſe, and however thy
miſgiving heart ſay no, yet let not this
affright thee. For to believe is not to
be fill'd with joy in the fleſhly heart
and outward complexion, that the
fleſhly mind and Spirit be ſo jocund,
that the very heart and reines leap for
joy, this is not faith, but theſe are
only ſome love emanations from the
Holy Ghoſt within, a divine light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which hath no ſtability, but
after a ſhort reſplendence, diſappeares.
For God dwells not in the outward
<pb facs="tcp:61255:35"/>
heart or complexion, but in himſelf, in
the ſecond center, in the Jewell of the
noble Image of Gods likeneſs which
is hidden in this outward world. But
the true Faith is, that the Spirit of the
Soul with its will and deſire goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and thirſts after that it neither
ſees nor feeles; here underſtand that
of the ſoul in it ſelf preciſely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſtands not in this time, yet ſhe
ſends in the ſubtill ſpirit of the will
which hath its original from her fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life,
and in this ſpirit of the will is
the pretious pearle received, ſo that
the ſouls-fire now remaines in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.
For ſo as the pearl remaines in
the ſpirit of the will, ſo long does the
deſire remain in the ſoul. For this
pearl is a ſpark of the Divine love,
tis the engin with which the Father
drawes the ſoul unto him in his love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the ſoul muſt therefore ſtand faſt in
her deſire, even when the outward
reaſon out of the dark Complexion
ſpeaks a flat contradiction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb facs="tcp:61255:36"/>
Gods preſence there. Were not
God preſent, there could be no deſire
or will after him in the eſtranged
ſoul. For, where God is not in the
Spirit of the will, the ſoul is as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blind and dead as to God, deſires
not God at all, nor hath any want or
breathing after him, but lives and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
himſelf in the heaven of his own
natural light, and ſelf-pleaſing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations;
only is a more ſubtil pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
underſtanding than the other
beaſt of the field, his ſouls natural eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
being of a higher gradation than
theirs. Therefore by no means let any
troubled ſoul ſuffer the complexion to
faſten ſuch an imagination as this upon
his heart, that God is not preſent with
her, will have none of her, other wiſe
the ſoul feeding upon ſuch imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
becomes exceeding heavy. Its a
very great ſin for the mind, to ſhape out
ſuch a fancy in the heart: for by this
means the ſoul which is a noble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
out of Gods Nature falls into
<pb facs="tcp:61255:36"/>
great anxiety, and the Phantaſy
kindles the ſouls fire with this fewell,
and cauſes it to burn in the painfull
principle.</p>
               <p>Dear ſoul, think no other, when the
anxious property of thy complexion,
thus kindled by the ſtarrs, begins to
move, but that thou then ſtandeſt as
a labourer in Gods vineyard, thou
muſt not ſtand idle, but be working;
thou doſt God herein a great and very
conſiderable piece of ſervice; And thy
labour is this, that thou overcome the
temptation by an unmoveable faith,
however no comfort in the outward
heart appear to ſupport it. Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Tis not faith, to give aſſent
to what I ſee and feel, but this is
faith, to truſt the hidden Spirit, and
believe the truth of its words, maugre
all the contradiction of blind nature;
and this ſo firmly, that I chuſe ſooner
to loſe my natural life than diſtruſt
his promiſe: this is a faith which
wraſtles rightly with God as old <hi>Jacob</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61255:37"/>
did the whole night, which though it
neither ſees nor feels the leaſt atome
of the thing hop'd for, yet reſts firm
upon the word of promiſe; this faith
does indeed overcome God, as 'twas
ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi> thou haſt wraſtled with
God, and Man, and half got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hand. If thou ask what word of
promiſe I mean, I anſwer 'tis this:
<hi>My Father will give the holy Spirit
to them that humbly and fervently beg
it of him;</hi> And this is that which the
mouth of Chriſt it ſelf hath further
delivered, <hi>When he cometh he will
lead you into all truth, for he will take
of mine and will make it known to
you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that thou mayeſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know that this temptation and
terrour comes from the complexion, I
will lay before thee an example of
that which happens eſpecially to the
Cholerick or firy and melancholy
complexions.</p>
               <p>When thou wakeſt by night in a
<pb facs="tcp:61255:37"/>
dark room, thou art ſeiz'd on with a
ſtrange kind of amazement and terror
of mind, and art ſubject to imagine,
that there is ſomewhat in the dark
that affrights thee. Whence now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
this fear? Is the fleſh affraid of
any danger to it ſelf? no ſure, it would
not without the force of blows be
made to enter as an Oxe to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-houſe,
into that place of terror.
But tis the poor ſoul, a priſoner in the
fleſh, that is afraid in this darkneſs, is
ever ſollicitous and fearfull, leſt the
Devill ſhould lay hold on her, for
ſhe knowes that his dwelling is in the
darkneſs, and therfore fears he will be
catching at her; whence tis eaſy to be
ſeen, the fear proceeds from the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thus goes it with a poor ſoul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
mur'd up in the dark cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the complexion; ſhe is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
out of heart, that her thoughts
cannot clear up, but muſt grope in
the dark; ever fearing, becauſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:61255:38"/>
Devill and the wrath of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſhould not a ſoul that
is lockt up in the dark chamber of a
melancholy complexion, dwell long or
ſcarce at all in ſpeculations about the
wrath of God, nor give it ſelf much
to ſolitude, but rather ſpend its time
in godly conferences. For ſo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of thoſe, friendly and profitable,
yeelding ſufficient entertainment to
the working phancy, tis by this
means handſomely diverted from her
torturing cogitations. For no deep
ſpeculation is in this ſtate profitable
for her, which ſeeing ſhe cannot turn
it to her ſouls health and comfort, its
better ſhe let it alone.</p>
               <p>Such a man muſt alſo take heed of
reading ſuch books as teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of a partial and perſonal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Predeſtination of men to
ſalvation or damnation.</p>
               <p>They all teach with miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and do not explain the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
aright according to the ſenſe and
<pb facs="tcp:61255:38"/>
declaration of the myſticall language
of the Holy Ghoſt, of which I have
given a further and better explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in my other writings.</p>
               <p>Neither is it good for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
his thoughts with the reading of
many books, but rather to adhere
ſolely to the Scriptures, in which he
ſhall find durable and ſteddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>But if God hath given him natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
a deep-ſearching underſtanding,
in which the ſoul cannot ceaſe her
perpetual diving to the bottom of the
deep myſtery, let him in Gods fear
be take himſelf in continual prayer to
God, for the opening to him the
center of Nature, in the finding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the ſoul will be at reſt. For there ſhe
ſees the corner-ſtone, on which the
grand fabrick of human ſouls is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd,
and ſo all fear and ſadneſs
quickly vaniſhes away; of which,
I am able to ſay by experience with
ſoul chearing and eſtabliſht light is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind
<pb facs="tcp:61255:39"/>
by him that hath found this
center. But no ſelf-ſeeking or ſelf-opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated
underſtanding, is able by his
deepeſt ſearching to find it out. Yet
does not God willingly ſhut it up

               </p>
               <p>The Melancholy Complexion ſhould
alſo with great care avoid drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that the ſoul be not overladen
and preſs'd down by the power of the
earth. For when the body thus loads
it ſelf with drink, the earthy fumes
of the ſtrong liquor preſently take
poſſeſſion of the complexion cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
then does the ſoul, entring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
with the imagination to her great
hurt, feed upon the earthly property,
kindles her fire therewith, and for a
ſhort time rejoyces in it; but the earthy
floating fumes of the drink which
<pb facs="tcp:61255:39"/>
danc't thoſe merry Anticks in his
brain, muſt ere long vaniſh into air,
and he, like a man warm'd by a wiſp
of ſtraw, returns a priſoner to his old
frozen Melancholy which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
it ſelf in a heavy and darker
conſiſtency by the antiperiſtaſis a of
falſe light of this momentany refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Then ſtands the poor ſoul as moſt
deſolate and more than ever forſaken
of God; for ſhe loſes, in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of the earthly property, the
divine imagination and deſire; for
the Spirit of God will not have his
dwelling in the earthly imagination.
Then ariſeth in the Soul a ſad diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
repentance, as if ſhe were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of God. The wrath of God does
then ſet it ſelf againſt her, as if it
would root her up from her very cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and throw her into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
pit of darkneſs; then falls the
man into great heavineſs, and it may
be for an eaſement of his grief, again
aſſociates himſelf with his pot-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb facs="tcp:61255:40"/>
to refreſh himſelf with them
in their ſottiſh joviality. Thus do
theſe fooliſh drunkards, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he is now linkt in, add one day
of ſin to another, and plunge his and
their own ſouls almoſt irrecoverably
into the earthly darkneſs and the
wrath of God. I ſpeak it as a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
truth, which I have a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
knowledge of, in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Nature and deepeſt principle of
life.</p>
               <p>Let the Melancholy ſoul beware
alſo of inflaming it ſelf with anger;
For wrath is her greateſt poyſon, and
drives her to madneſs, which is cleerly
ſeen in the Center; For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion-Chamber
is rude and unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht
like the wild and uncultivated
earth to which tis beſt reſembled: tis
alſo, as the earth was in the beginning
of the Creation, of it ſelf without
form and void, and hath but a very
ſlender hold on the great wheel of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Whence it falls out, that upon
<pb facs="tcp:61255:40"/>
a too vehement excitation of the fire
of anger, the wheel of nature whirles
about with ſuch a tumultuous noiſe,
that it makes the body of the angry
man even viſibly to tremble. Now
then the complexion-chamber being
ſo empty and void of ſubſtance, the
broken wheel cannot ſo eaſily cement
again, nor the thoughts be reduc'd to
an orderly conſiſtency or compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but all runs about in a hurly burly
fierce firy driving of wrath and fury,
ſo that the mind cannot fix the
thoughts in any ſteddy poſture of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
as in mad men is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ſeen. Nor is he knowing of
what he does, but as the diſorder'd
wheel of the inward Nature moves, ſo
are the tumultuous motions of the
outward members of the body; the
Devill alſo ſlily delights to fiſh in
theſe troubled waters, inſinuates his
imagination therewith, aggravates the
madneſs yet more, and makes it his
inſtrument to work much miſchief.
<pb facs="tcp:61255:41"/>
This wheel well becometh the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Spirit; but then the poor ſoul
alſo layes hold on it, and cauſeth it to
make impreſſions of great horrour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Spirit. Yet let no man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
any ſoul damned, during the
time of this life, for the heavenly
ſign of the Croſs remains yet, upon
which the door of grace ſtandeth wide
open. The ſoul ſhut up in the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly-chamber
muſt likewiſe carefully
preſerve herſelf cleer from covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
yea with the greateſt diligence;
for it is a thing no leſs banefull to her
than anger. For Covetouſneſs is an
earthly deſire, the complexion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
earthly: and this chamber being as
was ſaid, empty and void, its deſire
does naturally attract the earthly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
into its empty manſion, and
fills it with ſuch dark matter wherein
the meer wrath of God, with all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
and falſhood, lies enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
with much other evil of the nature
of the terrene property, which make
<pb facs="tcp:61255:41"/>
the complexion, being it ſelf an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire, yet ſtronglier and faſter tied
to the earth than before.</p>
               <p>Upon which earthly matter, the
ſoul-feeding, with her imagination,
feeles afterwards, upon the awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of conſcience, the fierce judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God burning in her firy Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,
who is inflam'd and made hot by
that evill fewell of falſhood and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs
which covetouſneſs had
pil'd up in ſtore. Now the poor ſoul
finding herſelf thus burning in Gods
wrath, and encompaſſed only with
that vaſt congeries of that evill earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matter of falſhood and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
when this fire is ſtill more and
more kindled, cannot but fall into an
exceſs of doubting, and deſpair of the
grace of God.</p>
               <p>Know therefore of a truth, That
for the Melancholy ſpirit, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better than to lead a ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
life, in a mean condition, where
there is no temptation to pride, and
<pb facs="tcp:61255:42"/>
where he live ſoberly and temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not having his mind charged with
multiplicity of worldly cares, which
if he be neceſſitated to ſometimes, he
muſt begin and end all in the fear of
God, and conſtant exerciſe of prayer,
which will carry him on with profit
thorough all his emploiments.</p>
               <p>For the Melancholy chamber thus
prepar'd is an excellent Councell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
it hath a door open Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
while it keeps it ſelf in a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
poſture of ſobriety, It pierces eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
whit as deep as the Sanguine; but
without Gods fear it obtains nothing
beyond the ſhallow comprehenſion of
the natural reaſon; if ſhe ſtand open,
and have her nativity in a ſigne of
which ♄ is Lord, ſhe layes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the great miſchief which
hath plagued mankind, almoſt from
the beginning of the world, for ſhe
builds <hi>Babel,</hi> and all deception to
himſelf and others of that nature, to
which with her native auſterity ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:61255:42"/>
gains power and reverence among the
ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Therefore let a man that is thus
complexiond (however knowing as
he thinks of that he hath in hand,)
attempt nothing without prayer. Let
him alwayes in the firſt place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his heart, thoughts, mind, will,
and actions, into the holy hands of
the higheſt God, to be directed by his
wiſedom, to the performance of his
good pleaſure, and pray earneſtly that
he will be the ſole regent in all his
deſires and undertakings, ſo may the
complexion freed from its deluſions, by
the in-dwelling wiſedom of God, be
in his hand, a ſerviceable inſtrument
of much good. Without this none
thus complexiond can in the publick
office perform ought thats good and
well-pleaſing to God.</p>

the noble Soul in habiting in

els he ſtands in very great danger: he
muſt powre this water of humility
and meekneſs into his fire, that his
noble Image be not therewith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
above meaſure; for ſhe is
full of pride, ſeverity, and ſudden
anger, and is therefore of all men
fear'd and highly extoll'd, but truly

with her fire; then doth her fire
break forth into a glorious, mild, and
harmleſs flame, which gives light and
warmth, and attracts to it the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of all men.</p>
                  <p>For this chamber hath a native lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre
of its own in it ſelf, in the outward

<hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> Lord of the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of her Nativity; Yet hath ſhe
invelop'd under <hi>Venus</hi> his ſoft mantle
her Devill, which tortures her day and
night, with ſtrong temptations to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity;
and I tell it now for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that there is great danger in
this complexion, yea much greater
than in the melancholy. For here
comes the Devill in his Angells viſard
of light, which as the natural, proceed
of the fire of the complexion, tickles
the ſouls with the pleaſing ſenſe of
her native light, whence ſhe growes
highminded; he repreſents all things
<pb facs="tcp:61255:44"/>
to her imaginations, as ſlightly to be
regarded, and ſo ſhe ſwallows down
glibly, and without any remorſe of
conſcience, all his poyſoned baites of
ſin, as ſwearing, curſing, light and
laſcivious talking, ſo that to deſpite
and unhallow the holy Name of God
in the ſoul, is a thing uſually practis'd
in this chamber; the wrathful firy eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
bears up the minde, that it can
very hardly (eſpecially in a right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant
abſtinence) ſink it ſelf down
into a divine temper of true ſpiritual
love and meekneſs. It rather adheres
rigidly to its wrathfull principle, will
ſubdue all by terror, and make all
ſtand in awe of him. If withall its
nativity happn'd to be in an earthy
ſigne, there is then ſmall good that
may tend to Gods honour to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hop'd for from this complexion.</p>
                  <p>He therfore that hath his pretiouſeſt
treaſure lockt up in this ſtorehouſe had
need be very circumſpect both over
his inward life and outward actions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61255:44"/>
For the poor deluded ſoul fixes her
imagination thereupon, and thence
rejoycing in the ſlight comfort of that
natural light, takes no notice that
ſhe hath ſtill her reſidence in Gods
wrath in the helliſh fire, till either
it awaken it ſelf in her, or till ſhe
come to be bereft of her outward fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtre,
by the death of this body. Then
appeares ſhe in her native colours, a
proud angry Devill, and muſt have
her abode in the eternal darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it good for ſuch a ſoul
not to labour to purchaſe to it ſelf any
high degree of worldly power, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but if in the way of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
they fall to her lot, then not
to pleaſe her imagination with refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
upon the thoughts of her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
For ſhe hath naturally a proud
fire-eye, eaſy to be inflam'd. An ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and humble caſting down of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in prayer before God is her beſt
ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>This kind of ſoul is eaſily by her
<pb facs="tcp:61255:45"/>
firy complexion into the falſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of a triumphant natural joy,
which ſhe oft miſtakes for the lively
emanations of Gods Spirit; but tis a
groſs error, the approaches of the
Spirit of God, when it reveales it
ſelfe, in the ſoule, comes like that
ſtill voyce of God to <hi>Elias,</hi> clad
with the greateſt humility and meek
calmeneſs of ſpirit. O what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſerenity and divine triumph doth
calm the fire complexion in the ſoul
at its appearance there; but it here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remaines in its own inward cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hath very rarely its outflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
into outward skirts of this ſelf-admiring

                  <p>Therefore take warning, ſtrive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
