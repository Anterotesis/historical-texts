            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Herein he made it his business so to set forth the Lord Jesus,
and commend him to them, as that they might receive him with
all acceptation, as the promised Messiah, and High-Priest over
the house of God, and persevere in faith and obedience to him;
and likewise to lay down such rules for their lives and carriages
in the world, as that by an holy and exemplary conversation,
they might honour his Name, and adorn his Gospel: The Union
between Faith and Holiness is so strict, that they never were
nor can be separated; and it is pity they should, being most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in conjunction: Faith giving encouragement unto holiness,
and holiness reflecting a glory upon faith. Several precious
Commands or Exhortations you meet with in this Chapter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40194:4"/>
which, though primarily ordered out to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> do remain
a burden upon all persons in all Ages who profess themselves
Christians; unto them it is our duty to attend, and according
to them to walk.</p>
            <p>The Text is a fruitful Bough, consisting of three Branches:
<list>
                  <item>1. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have
spoken to you the word of God.</item>
                  <item>2. Follow their faith.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Consider the end of their conversation.</hi> Or if you please, you
have here a double duty enjoyned, <hi>Remember them that have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to you the word of God, and follow their faith;</hi> and you have
a choice means prescribed for the commending those duties to
you, and encouraging you in their performance, <hi>Consider the
end of their conversation.</hi> Of all these I shall (God willing)
speak in the prosecution of this Doctrine.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>There is much duty incumbent upon people, upon the
account of their deceased Pastors.</hi> When Ministers dye, their
work is done, they have finished their course, and dispatched
the business given them to do: they did shine among you in
Purity of Doctrine, and Holiness of Conversation, as long as the
Lamp of life lasted; when the oyl of that was spent, they were
taken up to Heaven, there to out-shine the Sun in his greatest
strength and glory. But your work is not then at an end, being
of equal extent and duration with your lives: As you have
time enough for your work, so have you work enough for
your time; none can say he sate idle one hour, because he had
nothing to do; put forth all your strength, use your utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
husband your days and minutes to the best advantage;
you will be happy men and women, you will have cause eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to bless the hand above that help't you, if you can do
your work by that time death shall come to take you off.</p>
            <p>I am not now to speak concerning the whole duty of man,
but those particular duties mentioned in the Text, relating to
those servants of Christ, who have laboured among you, one of
which is <hi>remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40194:4"/>
               <hi>Remember them who have the rule over yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi> In which word
two things must be considered, 1. The Act, <hi>Remember.</hi> 2. The
Object about which that act is to be exercised, <hi>Them which have
the rule over you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall begin with the Object, <hi>those which have the rule over
you,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] your Guides, such as are appointed by God
to point out the way you should go, and do themselves go before
you in it; such as do not only shew the way, but lead the way:
this is the primary signification of the word. And it hath been
metaphorically translated and applied to them whose business
lies in ordering and governing others, both in Church and State,
to persons in Magistratical and Ecclesiastical office. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all peradventure, godly Magistrates, whether Supreme or
Inferior, who rule in the fear of God, and with Prudence and
Righteousness manage the affairs of State, are worthy to be
remembred. Though a <hi>Pharoah</hi> did rise up, who knew not <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
let not the man be found in <hi>Israel</hi> who remembers not <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph;</hi>
nor a Protestant in <hi>England,</hi> to whom the Memory of an
<hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is not precious.</p>
            <p>But it is evident from the words themselves, that the Apostle
here did not intend the Civil Magistrate, but Gospel-Ministers,
whose work is not only to instruct, but also to rule in the
Church of God: they have power to command the rich in this
world: they are to rebuke with all authority. <hi>Paul</hi> had his
rod too, which he knew how to use when need required:
They are the Masters of the Assemblies, Elders that rule, as well
as labour in the Word and Doctrine: Shepherds that are to
feed the flock of God; yea, and to order it, and to reduce
those sheep that wander. Yet let them remember, they are
under authority; though chief men among the brethren, yet
but men; though Masters of the Assemblies, yet servants of
Christ; such as rule, but such as must be ruled by the Word;
and in case of male-administration, are liable to censure: Their
authority is of no farther extent than their warrant; they are
to lead, and be followed, not blindfold, not as infallible persons,
not as being above the possibility of erring; but with caution
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40194:5"/>
and limitation; follow your guides, Christians, but look to your
way, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 11. Be ye followers of me, even as I am of
Christ;</hi> just so, and no otherwise; so far be sure to follow me,
but not a foot farther. But we shall speak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
            <p>1. Those whom you are to remember, are the Ministers of
the Gospel, the Embassadors of the glorious King of Saints, the
Pastors and Angels of the Churches, in whom, though poor
earthen vessels, God hath laid up heavenly treasure for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of many. <hi>Alexander, Caesar, William</hi> the Conqueror may be
remembred; but never let a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Calvin,</hi> an <hi>Vsher,</hi> a <hi>Caryl,</hi> a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
a <hi>Vincent</hi> be forgotten; there is no need of canonizing them;
God made them Saints while they lived, though the Pope dubs
his Saints after they are dead; as the Heathen made gods, whose
Ape he is: It would be a sin to worship them, to pray to
them, or to put up your prayers to God by them as his Master
of Requests; <hi>there is but one M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diator between God and man,
the man Christ Iesus;</hi> yet let them live, they do so in Gods sight,
let them do so in your remembrance and esteem.</p>
            <p>2. Those whom you are specially to remember, are your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
Christs Ministers in your Congregations; so the Apostle
directs, <hi>them that have the rule over you.</hi> It is the fashion of
some to applaud and admire other Preachers, while they despise
and slight their own, which is a shrewd argument of a wanton
spirit: It would be their wisdom, and is their duty to like the
disposals which God hath made. Accordingly, think you of them,
honour them who rule over you, who have laboured among
you, who spent themselves for you; their relation to you was
very near, being your spiritual Fathers; if not those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
you, yet those that nursed y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and travailed for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, by preaching and prayer, with tears and groans, with
earnest longings to see Christ formed in you; Oh how dear w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
their love, answerable to their relation; they watched over you,
and watched for you; they brake their rest, and wasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in providing and dealing out food to you, when, it may
be, some among you thought much of returning to them a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40194:5"/>
sorry and pitiful acknowledgment or reward. However, let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
such narrow souls remember them now; that will cost them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>3. Those whom you are to remember, are your deceased Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
[<hi>loquitur de iis qui jam obierunt.</hi> Jun.]; the Apostle here
means those who had compleated their work, and were gone
to rest. Let those Ministers of Christ, who are alive and remain,
who at this day live and labour among you, be in your thoughts,
and esteem, and prayers; count them worthy of double honour.
Trample not them under your feet, whose feet are beautiful,
being messengers of peace, that bring and rejoyce to bring you
glad tidings of great good, the very best that ever the world
had. Our Saviour pronounceth a wo against those dissembling
Hypocrites, that <hi>build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the
Sepulchres of the righteous,</hi> but despise the labours, and blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the reputations, and starve the bodies, and persecute the
persons of those that are alive, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 29. Give unto both
their due; let it never be said, that dear Mr. <hi>Thomas Vincent</hi> is
out of mind, now he is out of sight. Though now his place
know him no more, though his Family and Pulpit know him
no more, let it never be said his People had forgot him too:
No, no, as God hath received and glorified his Soul, and looks
after his dust, of which he will not lose the smallest atom; do
you preserve his memory, and count his name a precious and
fragrant oyntment. Thus you see, Pastors, your Pastors, your
deceased Pastors are to be remembred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what, all of them? be they never so erroneous or
flagicious?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I do not say so, the Holy Apostle doth not mean so;
if any be corrupt in their Opinions, unsound in their Doctrines,
or disorderly in their Lives; if in their Sermons they bring you
any other Gospel than that which Christ and his Apostles did;
or if Preaching the same Gospel, and holding to the form of
wholesome words, they contradict it by an unsuitable carriage,
and by an unholy life destroy what they build; it had been well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40194:6"/>
for the World, and the Church, and themselves too, if they
had never been born; and the sooner they are forgotten, the
better: When their bodies are laid in a bed of dust, let their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ames be buried in the grave of forgetfulness. May their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
perish with them. Those who are worthy to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
have these qualifications, which you find in the Text.</p>
            <p>1. They are <hi>such as have spoken to you the Word of God;</hi>
not the sentiments of Philosophers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the notions and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of learned and civilized Heathen; not <hi>Aristotles Ethicks,</hi>
and <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Morals, or <hi>Plato's</hi> Divinity, though some good
use may be made of them: Doubtless natural light is beautiful
and lovely. But what need have we of the glistering of a gloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,
or the blaze of a candle, who do injoy the help of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that hath brought life and immortality to light; who do
through the riches of mercy injoy the gracious beams, the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and quickning influences of the eternal Son of Righteousness?
Let us not disparage the God of <hi>Israel</hi> by repairing to the forges
of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> or borrowing their weapons for our spiritual
warfare; none like to the sword of the spirit, the Word of God,
which is mighty through God. We need not go to those pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
since the Lord hath been pleased to open to us the Wells
of salvation, out of which we may with joy draw living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the refreshing of thirsty, and reviving of fainting souls.
Those Ministers are to be remembred, who bring not their own
idle dreams, but Gods Truths; not the Precepts of men, but the
Doctrine of Jesus; who have determined (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) <hi>to know
nothing among you, but Iesus Christ and him crucified:</hi> Those
Pastors which (like the woman spoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>were
cloathed with the Sun, and had upon their heads a crown of twelve
stars;</hi> The Truth of Christ, and the Doctrine of the Apostles;
in short, men sound in judgment.</p>
            <p>2. They are such as did believe what they Preached; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you have mention made of their faith, <hi>Whose faith follow.</hi>
Oh that I could say, all Preachers are Believers. But I cannot
but tell you, though I desire to be very charitable, I have not
faith enough for that; all ages having sadly proved the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40194:6"/>
The woful defections and apostac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of many in the <hi>Pagan,
Arrian,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> Persecutions, are undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of the contrary. God forbid I should take upon me to
judg any particulars, much less whole Parties; that very word
[<hi>Party</hi>] is exceeding bitter and unsavoury to me; I heartily wish
there were no such name, or thing; and oh for that day! when
will that day come (the God of love and peace hasten it), in which
his people shall serve him with one shoulder, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the beauties of holiness! In the mean time I am firmly
perswaded, that there are those who fear God, and work righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and study to approve themselves by a sincere desire and
care of walking up to Scripture-rules, and the dictates of their
consciences, among all those Parties in <hi>England,</hi> which hold the
Head, and have not drunk in <hi>damnable heresies,</hi> as the Apostle
calls them; yet, yet I fear, there are also those that have not
faith: Rest they do in floating notions, take things upon trust,
are beholding meerly to education, or the profession of the
Countrey where they live, for their being Protestants or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
And I also tremble to think how many would be found
stark rotten, if they should be shaken by a temptation; found
dross, if they should be cast into the furnace: Those deserve to
be remembred, who are rooted and grounded in the faith; who
can say, <hi>Lo, this we have searched:</hi> this we have experienced,
so it is; Those that see the truth in its own evidence, that have
found it mighty in operation upon their own souls; those that
have held the mystery of faith in a pure conscience, and would
not let it go upon any terms, or in any times, but chuse rather
to venture all, to part with all, to throw all over-board, than
to make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience.</p>
            <p>3. They are s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their own Sermons; such as exprest the virtues of him who had

them to be lights unto others. Such Masters of the Assemblies

walked in him; such as did [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] foot it right, and could
boldly say to their flock, Walk so as ye have me for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
Such as did not mind earthly things, nor hunt after the
world, as if it had been their god; did not sinfully serve the
times, nor turn into all shapes, and wound their souls to save
their skins; did not prodigally spend their precious hours, nor
unchristianly smite their fellow-servants, nor eat and drink with
the drunken, but were the companions of them that fear the
Lord, and placed their highest delight, next to God, in the Saints,
those excellent ones of the earth; and did shew out of a good
conversation their works with meekness of wisdom, making it
their inward desire, great care, and utmost endeavour in all
things to adorn the Gospel. Holy men of God, who were
good in the Pulpit, and in the House too, and in all places, in all
companies; against whom there could be no exception, save in
the matter of their God, abating them for those natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
infirmities, which are inseperable from the most holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whilest on this side of perfection, tabernacling in houses
of Clay: The good Lord increase the number of such Pastors
in <hi>England,</hi> yea all the world over, in all places where he hath
caused his holy Name to dwell; and unto them, <hi>mine honour
be thou united;</hi> unto them shall my soul adhere in sincere and
most intire affection, whatever smaller and circumstantial dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are, or may be between us. May so much suffice to be
spoken concerning the object, about which the following Acts
are to be exercised, unto which I now come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Next then, What is to be done by that people whom God
did bless with such Pastors?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Two things, <hi>Remember them, follow their faith.</hi> Of
which in order,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember them.</hi> Your memories are precious Cabinets, too
good for dung and trifles; lay up nothing in them but what is
excellent; there is enough of that: <hi>Remember your Creator in the
days of your youth,</hi> yea and in the days of your age, <hi>so shall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40194:7"/>
you be satisfied as with marrow and fatness.</hi> Remember your dear
Saviour, his love, his life, his death; attend upon Ordinances,
and receive the Sacrament in remembrance of him; remember
his love more than wine: Remember the mercies you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
so as to be thankful; the promises you have made, so
as to be faithful; the sins you have committed, so as to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the experiences you have had, so as to be encouraged.
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them
that are in straits and necessities, so as to be compassionate and
liberal to them. Remember your latter end, so as to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and quicken your pace; and withal, remember your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Pastors, who obtained mercy to be found faithful: They,
they are some of Gods Jewels, allow them therefore a choice
room in these Cabinets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> You will ask me, how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>they are to be remembred?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer in these following particulars:</p>
            <p>1. Remember them, so as to bless God for them. Have not
you had great benefit, soul-advantages by them? Oh! let God
have praises from you. When you are under smarting rods, sore
afflictions, pore not so much upon them, as to become by that
means injurious to God: Some that did too little mind, and
prize, and improve mercies whilest they were in their hands,
do view them, and curiously study them, when taken away, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
their spirits be imbittered, and discontent raised up against
the Providence. But, Christians, beware you of that; I advise
you to be sensible of your loss: Let the Widow be sensible what
an husband she hath lost, the Children what a Father (if their
tender age will admit it); the Family, what a Governor; the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
what a Shepherd; I, and others, what a Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But let us all remember to bless God, that we had him
once, that we had him so long; let this Congregation bless God
that ever it was committed to the care and charge of such a
Minister, that ever such a shining and burning light was set up
in this Candlestick; that ever such a labourer was sent into this
Vineyard. My dear friends, I do most earnestly beg this of you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40194:8"/>
for my dear Master, Whatever your loss is, how great soever,
how painful and afflictive soever, let not your and my God be
a loser; look carefully to that, as you love your selves; Gods
loss is your loss. Therefore how sad soever your case is, how
dark soever your day, how low soever your spirits, do not now,
do not at any time withhold from God those praises which are
his due. Truly he hath been good to you, and he is so now,
and he will be so still, if you will but do your duty; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be sure to love him, and bless him; let the holy God ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
the praises of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Remember them, so as to bewail the loss of them. You
ought indeed to moderate your sorrow, keeping it within the
bounds of Reason and Religion, as becomes those that have
hope; nay, let there be a mixture of joy with your sorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sure it is well with them, perfectly, unspeakably, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
well; their happiness doth exceed their thoughts, and
not only afford satisfaction to them, but likewise raise admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Oh what am I that God should ever bring me hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to!</p>
            <p>Yet mourn. It becomes you to be both affected and afflicted
in your spirits. What! shall the Father be smitten, and the
Children not grieved? the Shepherd taken away, and the Flock
not troubled? that would be a grand <hi>Solecism</hi> both in Nature
and Religion. <hi>When Samuel dyed, all Israel were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and lamented him,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 1. The tears of an whole
Nation may well be poured out upon a <hi>Samuels</hi> death. <hi>When
Stephen the</hi> Proto-Martyr <hi>was carried to his burial, there was great
lamentation made over him,</hi> Acts 8. 2. Those devout and holy
men broached their sorrow, they went on, weeping as they
went. When <hi>Elisha</hi> was arrested and confined to his bed by
his last sickness, <hi>Ioash the King of Israel wept over his face, and
said, O my Father, my Father, the chariots of Israel, and horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
thereof,</hi> 2 King. 13. 14. And well may there be such great
sorrow, else it will hold no proportion with the occasion: Losses
of such persons are great, how little and vile soever in the
worlds eyes while they lived; for they were their peoples bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40194:8"/>
the Nations pillars, the stakes in our hedg, and their
death is not seldom ominous; it speaks a storm-brewing evil to
come. When they are hous'd in the silent and safe chambers of
the grave, what may we look for next, but that the great God
should come out of his place, cloathed with righteousness, and
armed with vengeance, <hi>to punish the inhabitants of the world for
their iniquity.</hi> This know for certain, the Lord is greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
it angers him at his very heart, when he sees men stupid
and insensible under such dispensations, specially when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ordinary; <hi>when the righteous perish, and are taken away,
none considering or laying it to heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, there is now joy in Heaven; but let there be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
on Earth, that will not be jarring: Angels and perfect spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
above, welcome those departed Saints with shouts and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
let us part from them with tears, at least with sighs.
Possibly there are some who do rejoyce at such a mans death;
but whether they will believe me or no, I will tell them, they
have no cause; God will make them change their note, even they
shall mourn at the last.</p>
            <p>3. With your remembrance of them, joyn heart-grief and
trouble that you gained no more by them; consult and listen
to your own consciences, see what they will say, deal imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and ingenuously. Have not you been asleep in your seats,
when they have been at work in their Pulpits? Have not your
minds been wandring after vanity, and your eyes gazing about
upon this body and that; this face, and that fashion, while they
have been fixed and intent, wholly taken up about the good
and salvation of your souls? Have not you been cold at heart,
while they were <hi>fervent in spirit, serving the Lord?</hi> They have
mourned, but you wept not; they have piped, but you danced
not; when they poured out their souls in confession of sins,
you were not humbled, your hearts not broken within you;
many a sad and foul story hath been told of you, yet you did
not blush, neither were you ashamed: They have mightily
wrestled with God, and tug'd hard for mercy, mercy for you,
your pardon, and your lives, but you have sate and seen all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40194:9"/>
this with a most wretched indifferency, as if you were persons
altogether unconcerned, and did not care whether they prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or no. How have you slipt the precious truths they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to you, and been disobedient to the counsels they order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out; and have been little the better, though they came to
you in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ? They
have come and blown upon your garden, now with the <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi>
of dreadful threatnings, then with the <hi>South</hi> of gracious
promises; yet <hi>your spices have not flown forth;</hi> nay, are not too
many of you unto this very day like the dry and barren Heath?
And surely you have cause to be troubled, and oh that you may
be so, the good Lord trouble you kindly; let your souls have
these losses and afflictions still in remembrance, and be humbled
within you.</p>
            <p>4. Remember them so as to be quickned by that remembrance.
Think of their death, and go to their graves, and fetch life and
liveliness from thence: We Ministers should do so. When our
fellow-labourers grow fewer, it stands us in hand to work the
harder. What! shall some drop on our right-hand, and others
upon our left, yea many round about us; and shall any of us
notwithstanding be idle, and lazy, and half asleep at our work!
Oh that the ratling of deaths Chariot-wheels might awaken and
rouze us up. When <hi>Elijah</hi> is taken up to Heaven, let every
<hi>Elisha</hi> look out for a double portion of the spirit, and go forth
in all their might to plead the cause of Truth and Holiness, and
finish that great work their Lord hath set them.</p>
            <p>You also that are the People of God, should double your dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
You are not ignorant how your faithful Pastors liv'd and
labour'd, how they walked and wrought, what indefatigable
pains they took for God, and for you, and with their own
hearts: though you do not know half, yet let that which you
do know be a spur to you. Up, Christians, up, shake off a
supine sluggish temper; <hi>Work out your salvation with fear and
trembling: give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi>
Hasten, oh hasten to the Kingdom of God; lose no time, slip
no opportunity, neglect no part of your duty; fill up your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40194:9"/>
days, relations, and places; and <hi>so run, as that you may obtain;</hi>
you are compassed about with a great Cloud of witnesses; lay
aside therefore every weight that presseth down, and the sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that doth so easily beset you; gird up the loins of your mind,
call forth all your strength, buckle in good earnest to your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and on, on in that holy pleasant race that is set before
you.</p>
            <p>5. Remember them, so as to be encouraged by them, and
<hi>take heart.</hi> You live in a world that lyeth in wickedness, it is
grievously polluted; almost all places are so dirty, that we can
scarce tread clean; surely these are the dregs of time; you are
invironed with enemies and dangers. And speak seriously, Do
you not sometimes feel inward fears and faintings? Well, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
your selves in the Lord your God; <hi>And take, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Prophets, who have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for
an ensample of suffering afflictions, and of patience.</hi> You have
seen what great things God hath done by them, and for them;
you have seen that God hath carried them through all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
so that <hi>they have overcome at the last.</hi> Satan that roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lyon hath pursued them, and come with open mouth, yet
could not devour them; he hath got some of them, and <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed
them as wheat, yet their faith did not fail.</hi> Lusts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
within their own bosoms have made frequent assaults,
and furious batteries upon them, yet they could not prevail.
These holy souls through Christ strengthning them, have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down sins strength; sometimes they have gone halting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
always came off conquering. The World again hath one while
fawned like a strumpet, and another while raged like a fury;
yet could not gain them by fair means, nor foul: <hi>Though the
Archers have shot sore at them, their bow hath abode in strength,
and the arms of their hands have been made strong by the hands
of the mighty God of Iacob.</hi> The waves have lifted up their
voice, and dashed against them, yet have they stood like Rocks
unshaken; some of them have had an hard passage, and met
with many a violent storm; yet at last they have got in a Calm
unto their desired Heaven; and being landed in the other world,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40194:10"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re now feasting in the new <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which is above, at the
Court of the King of Glory.</p>
            <p>It is true, they died, and so must we, so must the strongest
and the highest; <hi>it is appointed for all men once to dye,</hi> yet
these <hi>dye but once;</hi> they did not dye before the time; they did
not dye before their work was done; they did not dye before
they were fit to dye, no, nor before they were willing to dye;
they were ripe fruit, and so dropt into the bosom of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
In a word, they dyed to live, and now they live to dye no
more: Be you therefore of good cheer, O ye holy Ones, that
God who did so much for them, can do as much for you; his
arm is not shortned, nor his ear heavy, nor his love less; be you
strong in him, and in the power of his might.</p>
            <p>6. Lastly, So remember them, as to think of theirs who are
left behind. It is more than probable that some of their Wives
and Children are in a low condition, and want conveniencies,
if not necessaries: Be you liberal to them, give them a supply
out of your abundance; pare off some of your superfluities for
their relief; you shall not suffer, nor be losers by it; I dare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
to you, there is one in Heaven will take care of that.
There be others, who, though not reduc'd to such straits as to
need the help of your purses; yet being now in a disconsolate
condition, they do need your company and comforts. Poor
hearts! their houses are left unto them desolate, they are Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
alone, and mourn sore like Doves; give a knock at their
door<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now and then; when you can, turn into those Widows
houses, and speak comfortably to them; the very sight of their
Husbands friends cannot but be cordial to them; though for a
time it will open the wound, and renew their sorrow; yet it will
revive and chear them too. Thus much for the first part of your
duty, <hi>Remember your deceased Pastors.</hi> Yet before I pass on to
the second, let me subjoyn to what hath been said, two things
by way of Caution.</p>
            <p>1. While you remember them, be not unmindful of God,
and do not forget to trust in God; though they are dead, yet
God still lives, yea he lives for evermore; whosoever dyes, God
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40194:10"/>
cannot dye; he necessarily is, and is necessar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly what he is. As
he is eternally, so eternally immutable, not having the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of turning. And this ever-living God hath <hi>the residue of
the spirit,</hi> and can pour it out upon whom he will, and furnish
whom he pleaseth with Ministerial Gifts and Graces; and he
never ceaseth to look after his interest and people. Look you
to it, that you be true to him, and he will be true to you: He
will have a Ministry in <hi>England,</hi> as long as he hath a Church in
<hi>England;</hi> and may that be as long as the Sun and Moon endure,
<hi>Amen.</hi> This great Lord of the Harvest will lose none of his
Corn, not an ear, not a grain, for want of Labourers to gather
it in. This gracious and loving Father of the Family sees good
now and then to pinch some of his Children, but he will starve
none. When <hi>Israel</hi> was in a Wilderness, he was pleased to
work Miracles, rather than they should not be provided for;
therefore let your Faith live as long as God liveth in Heaven,
and you upon Earth. And let me add this for your comfort;
Let never so many good men, eminent men dye, your life, O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
is secur'd and insured to you by the life of Christ. Hear
his own words, <hi>Iohn 14. 19. Because I live, ye shall live also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. While you remember them, do not forget your selves. It
is readily and joyfully acknowledged, that God doth not stand
in need of Ministers: He that could make Heaven and Earth by
the Word of his Power, can accomplish all his pleasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
helps and instruments; yet you do need them, and it is
his Will to employ them, and continue them to the end of the
world. Magistracy and Ministry are two standing Ordinances,
and will be necessary so long as there are men on Earth, and
men to be sitted for Heaven. Therefore, my Brethren, sit not
down in this your Orphan-condition. What I have told you is
unquestionably your duty, but not the whole of it. <hi>Keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
Though the Shepherd be smitten, let not the Sheep be
scattered. <hi>Look out for a good supply;</hi> that your loss may be made
up again, and your Pastors place filled. No loss is irrepairable
but the loss of God and your souls. <hi>Be wise before you fix;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
together, and ask advice of them who are both faithful and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40194:11"/>
able to give it; act with due deliberation, yet defer not too
long. <hi>Above all go to God,</hi> who holdeth the Stars in his right
hand; and then look out for a man Orthodox in judgment, and
holy in life, who may not go about to raze, but wisely to build
upon the foundation, which by my Reverend Brother
hath been already laid. And my prayer is, That God would
set a man over your Congregation, even a man after his own
heart. And so I come to the second Duty incumbent upon
you, which you have in these words, <hi>Whose faith follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holy imitation doth most highly become all that profess
themselves Christians. Be careful in your chusing a Pattern,
and then curious in your imitation: You must not follow lying
vanities, then you forsake your own mercies; you must not
follow vain fashions, that is not suitable to the gravity and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness
of your Religion. <hi>You must not follow a multitude to
do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vil,</hi> unless you have a mind to be damned with a multitude,
and think Hell is a desirable place, because most go thither:
The most beaten road is not always the best; you must not
follow the world; instead of being conformed, you ought to
be crucified to it.</p>
            <p>You have far better Copies set you, far more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Patterns before you. <hi>God;</hi> be ye <hi>followers of God as dear
children. Christ,</hi> he hath left you an ensample, that ye should
tread in his steps. <hi>The Saints,</hi> who while here walked in their
integrity; and now they are above, sit in Robes of Glory: <hi>Be
ye followers of them that through faith and patience have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
the promises.</hi> And among them, those that have held
forth the word of life, and shined as lights in the world. Be
wise now in making these your choice, and follow them as
close as you can; live up to Scripture-rules, and holy Presidents.
And truly, my Brethren, since God and Christ, Godliness and
Heaven are as good, full out as good as ever they were; I can
see no just reason why Professors should decline and decay;
why our gold should become dim; why the Saints of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
should fall miserably short of those that went before
them; why the present Christians should be so unlike the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40194:11"/>
both for Purity and Zeal, as if they were not begotten
of the same Father, and did not suck the same breasts. But
so it is; ah! so it is; our <hi>Nazarites</hi> were purer than snow, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than milk; whereas now the visage of many of them is
blacker than a coal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they can scarce be known in the streets; and
let this be for a lamentation.</p>
            <p>Oh that you would do your endeavour to revive the old
Godliness, which is the best Godliness; and to live over again
the lives of the old Saints, and in particular, those of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Pastors: Follow them in all that is good, and within
the compass of your sphere; you must never go out of your
places to follow your Pastors; the Lord Jesus himself is to be
imitated by you only in his imitable works. That being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
I say with the Apostle <hi>Paul, Phil. 4. 8. Whatsoever things
you saw in them, true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report,
whatsoever there was of virtue, or of praise, think on those things,</hi>
and follow them in those things: In no other; for they were
but men, imperfect men, subject to like passions, infirmities,
and failings; and these you must not draw into an example,
nor use them as an argument why you should do so too, as too
many argue from <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery to their uncleanness; for
certain God never put such things upon record for an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
unto sin, but for cautions to all; you must not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with them that wander, nor fall, because others have; no,
follow them as they followed Christ, and only so, in all that is
good, in all that is well-pleasing to God, and will be Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the Gospel. But I shall confine my discourse to the
Command in the Text, <hi>Follow them in their faith.</hi> And here I
shall speak to these four particulars:</p>
            <p>1. Follow them in the Doctrine of Faith: Be sound in your
j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dgments, and suffer not your heads to be fly-blown with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<hi>Hold fast that which is good,</hi> for otherwise you will lose
your Crown: The age in which we live is a learned age, and
it is a very inquisitive age, and an hot disputing, but with grief
be it spoken, it is an error-broaching and imbracing age; there
are too too many among us that act industriously toward the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40194:12"/>
shaking of our foundation, though the Virgin-daughter of <hi>Zion</hi>
looks upon their attempts, and laughs them to scorn; for God
himself, the mighty God hath laid them, and they shall not be
destroyed. But though our foundations are firm and lasting,
yet many of our professors are feeble and wavering, yea some
are removed to another Gospel: They have rejected those great
Points, those main Truths, which are the very vitals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, and you may see them wallowing in the blood
of their Apostacy: Stick you to that faith which was delivered
to you by your deceased Pastors, who are now with God, that
is, the faith which was once delivered to the Saints, once for
all: The Doctrine which they held out to you, is the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> built upon the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone. Hold
to that, all that, specially the Deity of Christ, his satisfaction,
justification by him, and faith in him, not by works which we
have done; and the spiritual mystical Union that is between
him and true Believers. Keep these things as the Apple of your
eye, yea as you would your lives. <hi>And though we or an Angel
from Heaven should come and preach among you any Gospel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to, or besides that which they have preached, and you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
let him be accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Follow them in the Grace of Faith. They were Believers,
be you so too: look narrowly to it, that it be <hi>the true Grace of
God in which you stand.</hi> Take not up, my brethren, with an
empty name, a verbal profession, a company of bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
and heartless duties. Mind, I beseech you, the Power of
Godliness, and do not stop one hairs breadth on this side of it:
Painted Hypocrites are as odious to that God who requires and
searches the heart, as the openly profane: his soul hates them that
secretly mock him, as well as those that publickly affront him.
Make sure work therefore for your precious souls; see that you
have that faith which is unfeigned, the faith of Gods Elect,
that you do cordially imbrace the Truths of the Gospel, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lose with an offered Jesus; that you have that faith by which
you may live, that faith by which you may walk until you come
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40194:12"/>
to <hi>walk by sight.</hi> I would not have any of you deceived, and
cheated to your own destruction, as many poor creatures are,
who run away with a lie in their right-hand, build hopes of
Heaven and Happiness upon a sandy bottom, please themselves
in a lifeless Image of Religion, which the holy One of <hi>Israel</hi>
will despise when he awaketh unto judgment; their faith is
no better than a fancy; their Godliness is not a Godliness of
Gods making nor approving; they walk about in the sparks of
that fire which themselves have kindled, and at last lie down
in sorrow. Be you wise for your souls, and deal prudently;
get that faith which upon tryal will be found to praise and
honour, much more precious than gold that perisheth; be ye
provided with that Oyl which will keep your Lamps burning
when the blessed Bridegroom cometh.</p>
            <p>3. Follow them in the actings of their faith. Grace is given
you not only for Ornament, but also for use; we are not only
to be justified by faith, and saved by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, but to live by faith.
Have you got it? then suffer it not to lie dormant, but exercise
it: Act your faith <hi>upon Christ,</hi> his Mediation, Merits, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:
He is a full Christ; <hi>it hath pleased the Father, that
in him should all fulness dwell,</hi> a fulness that is far beyond your
emptiness; live upon him therefore, and draw from him, you
can never draw him dry: Act your faith <hi>upon the Covenant,</hi> it
is an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. God
is ever mindful of it; with it holy <hi>David</hi> comforted himself,
in it he placed all his happiness, and sum'd up all his desires.
Act your faith <hi>upon the Promises;</hi> these are exceeding great and
precious, you cannot measure them, nor over-rate them. In
them there is an answerableness to every case, a complete suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
to every condition, in which you either are or can be.
And you cannot over-trust them, being Yea and Amen, of most
sure and certain accomplishment: The Womb of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
never miscarried, but shall bring forth at the time of life
all the mercies and blessings with which it travails. Ever count
Gods Promise abundant security; and believe that all Mountains
which lie in the way of its performance, shall be made a plain;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40194:13"/>
the darkest Providences are still subservient to the promise.
<hi>Iosephs</hi> being sold for a Slave, and clapt up in a Prison, were
steps to his being made the second man in the Kingdom. Act
your faith <hi>upon the wisdom and power, the love and care of your
heavenly Father;</hi> know, he endears you, and will look after
you: His Glory shall not be lost, nor given to another; his
Truth is great, and shall overcome; his Church is built upon a
Rock, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. <hi>Iacob,</hi>
though small, shall rise; and though a worm, he shall thresh the
mountains; the Beast and the false Prophet shall be cast into a
lake of fire, burning with brimstone, and the glorious victory
shall be the Lambs; for he is King of kings, and Lord of lords;
and they that be with him, are chosen, and faithful, and
true.</p>
            <p>Believe, and rejoyce while you believe, that when Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Enemies are at work, He himself is not idle, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
them, is in the Conclave and the Cabal, undermines them,
counter-acts them, and will turn their counsels backward or
headlong, so that no weapon shall prosper which they form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his cause and people; but he will accomplish the thoughts
of his heart, which shall stand in all generations; and effect his
own designs, and be absolute Master of all his ends, finishing
all the work which he hath to do in the world, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
losing either time or ground; as our days go off, so Gods
work goeth on, it is never out of hand. Thus act your faith
upon God in all conditions, and under all dispensations; when
you are high, and when low, yea at the lowest, for still, still,
still the everlasting arms, arms, are underneath. In these actings
of faith those holy men lived, and so must you, otherwise you
will never be established, much less in such gloomy, tottering,
turning, and tumbling times as these are.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, Follow them in the fruitfulness of their faith.
Your gracious Pastors were not, neither may you be <hi>Solifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
As they did believe, so they maintained good works, and
by that means obtained a good report. While you know that
faith justifieth you, you must also know, it is your duty to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40194:13"/>
justifie your faith; that faith which is alone, is stark naught, it
is dead and rotten, and stinks above-ground; shew me, and
shew the world your faith by your works. If you ask me what
fruits they are which grow upon the root of faith, and prove
it genuine? I Answer, all the fruits of the spirit, in which you
must abound, if you would have an abundant entra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce into the
glorious Kingdom of our God and Saviour. But I shall speak
only to three, <hi>Holiness, Love, Ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Follow them in their Holiness. A wicked Believer is as
meer an impossibility as a gracious Devil; such a faith as will
consist with the love, and life, and reign of sin, is no better than
what may be found in Hell among lapsed Angels, and damned
Spirits, who, as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, <hi>Believe and tremble.</hi>
Wheresoever true faith is, it purifies the heart, and reforms
the life, and orders the footsteps according to the word: As
it cloathes the soul with the beautiful Robe of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
so it subjects the soul to his governing Scepter and
Law; it lets Christ in, and casts corruption out; when Christ
dwells in the heart by Faith, he shines in the life by Holiness:
The pearl of faith is never found in the dunghil of profaneness.
Study then, study holiness, and perfect it too in the fear of
God; think with your selves what manner of persons ye ought
to be, how acurate and exact in your whole course; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
<hi>That grace of God which bringeth salvation, and hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto you, teacheth you, that denying ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lusts, ye should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
evil world,</hi> 2 Tit. 11, 12. And that you ought to be like your
Father, who is holy in all his ways, and righteous in all his
works. When therefore a temptation to any sin assaults you,
resist it with utmost indignation, and say as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in
another case, <hi>Shall such a man as I do this?</hi> or as <hi>Ioseph, How
shall I do this great wickedness and sin against God?</hi> or as that
good Woman [<hi>Christiana sum</hi>] I am a Christian. This, my
dear Friends, this is the way to glorifie your God, to honour
your Religion, to credit your Pastors. In this way you shall
be their comfort while they live, their Crown when they are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40194:14"/>
dead, yea their joy and rejoycing in the presence of the Lord
Jesus Christ at his coming: The exemplariness of your carriages
is the best commendation of the Ministers you have, and of
the Sermons you hear; whereas when you walk disorderly,
and as Enemies to the Cross of Christ, you are our shame and
reproach, spots in our Assemblies, goads in our sides, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
upon our spirits: Let no man nor woman tell others they
sit under my Ministry, unless they resolve by the grace of God
to depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>2. Follow them in their Love. True faith works love, and
by it; it kindles a pure flame of love, and then makes use
thereof for the promoting and furtherance of all duty. Have
you not taken notice of your Pastors love? What did they
think too much to do for you? They have hazarded their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and spent their strength, and broken their rest, and
wasted their lungs for you: They mourned under the untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctableness
of some, and were humbled for the unreformedness
of others, who had sinned, and had not repented; they longed
for your Conversion to God, and progress in Religion, and
growth in grace: They had no greater joy than to see you walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the truth; Oh! how did they prize God, and Christ, and
you? how did they rejoyce in their work, though hard, yet
sweet? how welcome was a Sabbath, upon which they might
draw their breasts for your consolation, and open their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for your inriching? imitate you them in their love; give
the best, the flower, the quintessence of it unto God. Erect in
your hearts a Throne for Christ; love him as well as you can,
and then mourn because you love him so little, and always pray
that you may love him more: Love one another dearly, for
you are brethren, and so fulfil the law of Christ, and prove
your selves his Disciples. Have an universal love for all the
Saints, all in whom you can see [<hi>aliquid Christi</hi>] any thing of
Christ; yea so love all men, as to wish their good, and to do
them all the good you can, even your Enemies, your Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
those that hate you; do you hate their sins and wicked
ways, but love their persons, and pray for their conversion and
salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40194:14"/>3. Follow them in their Joy. You read of the joy of faith,
and of the Saints rejoycing in believing, <hi>with joy unspeakable and
full of glory.</hi> Certainly it is a duty incumbent upon all the Saints
to rejoyce in the Lord, and that evermore; and call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
the times that are past. Have you not seen the faith of
your Pastors budding and blossoming with joy, when you have
been sinking, and days have been dark, and fears many? Have
you not seen a smile upon their brow, even then when there was
a Cloud upon their tabernacle? You have indeed been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their sorrows, and their tears, because men hated to be
reformed, would not keep Gods Law, but dishonoured his Name,
and opposed his Gospel, and would break his bands asunder, and
cast away his cords from them; but you have also been privy to,
and witnesses of their joys; follow them in this: Let them that
are of a fearful heart be strong; be you of a cheerful spirit, and
let your brethren and others see you are so. You have, O Saints,
matter of rejoycing in your worst conditions; nay, let me say
this, You have much more matter of rejoycing than you now
have, or ever shall have of sorrow and disquiet. For, if you be
really what you profess your selves to be, God is the cause and
matter of your rejoycing; it is he that is your comfort and
your glory, <hi>Psal. 43. 4. I will go,</hi> saith that sweet singer of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
unto the Altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:</hi> or as the
margin tells you it is in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> unto God the gladness of my
joy. Now I beseech you, if you can, tell me, What can possibly
be; I ask you again, what can possibly be so great a cause of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sorrow, as your God is of joy and rejoycing? Thou, O
poor drooping soul, thinkest thou hast a great many sins in thy
heart, and the Church of Christ hath a great many dangers at this
day in poor <hi>England,</hi> City and Country is full of them; and
doubtless all this is very true, too too true, the good Lord help
us. Yet know, God is above them all, and greater than them all:
He is greater than all thy sins, and so can both pardon and subdue
them: He is greater than all his Churches enemies, and so can
either reconcile and change them if he pleases, or curb and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
them. As he is greater than all our dangers, and so can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40194:15"/>
obviate and prevent them: He can with a word command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
and create peace, and place a defence upon and about
all our glory. You have, my Brethren, at all times, in the very
worst times, more cause of joy in God, than you can have of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and discouragement in any thing, nay in all things. This
made the holy Prophet take up that brave resolution, <hi>Hab. 3. 17,
18. To rejoyce in the Lord, and to joy in the God of his salvation;</hi>
though there should be a famine in the world, and the staff of
creature-comforts should be broken to pieces; though earth
should sink under him, yet he would by faith hang upon a
God above him; and as long as he had a God above to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his joy should live and flourish: He knew not only how
to make a meal, but how to feast it upon God alone. Thus
have I at large set before you that duty which is incumbent
upon you in reference to your deceased Pastors, who have
Preached to you the Word of God; it lieth in these two things,
<hi>Remember them—Follow their faith.</hi> Now I come to the last
clause in the Text, which you may look upon either as a third
duty, or an excellent means for the commending of the two
former, and facilitating them unto you; and that you have
in these words, <hi>Considering the end of their conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here again you have the Act, <hi>Considering;</hi> and the Object,
<hi>The end of their conversation.</hi> I will begin with the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Considering.</hi> We ought to be a considering people; it would
be our safety, our honour, our comfort and advantage every
way, as I could easily shew you. We should sin less, if we
would consider more. Most, if not all our sins come in at
this door, want of consideration. Men do not consider,
their ways lead directly to Hell, going down to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Death; and therefore they go on in them: They
do not look into the state of their souls, nor consider how
affairs stand with them; and so when they should mourn
and weep, they live jovally, and frolick their days away,
dancing and roaring upon the very brink of the burning
lake: They do not consider the pearl of price, how orient
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40194:15"/>
it is, how excellent and inestimable; and therefore they do
not sell all, and buy it: They do not consider the worth of
their souls, that they are immortal, and their ransom preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and therefore they barter them away for a filthy lust
and transient pleasure. Men do not consider how sordid
and odious a thing it is, how ill-becoming them, how hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God, and how exceedingly it inflámes their reckoning,
and will one day add to their torments, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to see them raging-mad in sin, so long as they live like
fools, without consideration.</p>
            <p>Well, my Friends, if any will be vain and foolish still, let
them be so: As for you, reckon upon it as your wisdom and
interest to do nothing rashly, not to pass over things lightly,
not to run on headily; look before you leap, ponder your
path, try all things. Consider those things which we deliver
to you in the course of our Ministry, and require of you
in the Name of our God, whether they be not most <hi>holy,
and just, and good.</hi> Consider those things we propound
to you, the great and gracious offers we make, whether
you can any where else better your selves, and get a more
gainful bargain; see if we do not out-bid all the world, and
offer you such a match for your souls, as is the chiefest of
ten thousands, altogether lovely, without compare. O ye fools,
be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40194:16"/>We would not have you embrace our counsels, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our directions blindfold. We can say this, We counsel you
as we do our selves, and we lay no other burden upon you
than upon our selves, and your souls are precious to us as
our own, and it sorely troubles us to think of your eternal
miscarrying, and our hearts would greatly rejoyce, even ours,
if that danger were over, and that we did but see you in that
tender and mighty hand, out of which none can pluck you:
yet we would not have you take all upon trust from us; an
implicit faith, and a blind obedience do not please us: No,
weigh things in right balances, compare the service of Christ
with the drudgery of a Devil, and the service of sin; peace
of conscience, with roaring in a Tavern; the kisses of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
lips, with the caresses of a Minion; the favour of
Christ, with the smiles of a Man; a being filled with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
with a being drunk with wine, in which is a brutifying
excess. Compare contrivances for God, with plots for <hi>Rome,</hi>
and conspiracies against Princes; an heavenly mind, with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affections; an interest in promises, and an inheritance in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
with an ill-gotten estate in the world that hath a curse
in it. Compare, I say, these things together, and consider,
and then chuse. Let some men say what they will, their
tongues are their own, only let them remember, they must at
last be accountable for their words; as for us, we would
have you rational in your Religion, rational in your believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and living; use your reason in all things within its reach,
only to call that to determine in matters too high for it, in
points of faith, that could never have been known by us,
but by Divine Revelation, hath much more absurdity in it,
than to call a Countrey-clown from following t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mysteries and riddles of State. Use all the reason you have,

we are not afraid of having things brought to a tryal; the
cause of Godliness is too good to be cast, when it hath its
hearing before a prudent, impartial, and righteous Judg.</p>

               <hi>Consider</hi> then, and that not only once, but often; so the
Original word signifies [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] considering again and
again; frequently repeat this act; think of it now, and think
of it anon; to day and to morrow, every day. The things
of God, the matters of Religion, the product and issue of an
holy life, do deserve greatest seriousness, and most frequent
thoughts; there is nothing in the world so considerable in it
self as these things are, and therefore nothing in the world
is so worthy of your consideration. Besides the merit of the
things, the dulness of the hearts calls for it. Ahlas I we are
not easily wrought upon; our minds are blockish, our wills
stubborn, our hearts obdurate, our judgments do not readily
assent to truth, nor our wills close with goodness. We are as
the Disciples were, slow of heart to believe, and submit and
embrace the things of God. There must be precept upon
precept, and line upon line; and there had need be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
upon consideration, and prayer upon prayer, and all
this is little enough; nay all this, and more than this would
be too little, were not God pleased to bare his Omnipotent
Arm, and to make it a day of power upon the obdurate
and refractory sinner. Slight thoughts and transient glances
will make no impression, will kill no sin, nor kindle any holy
heat; it is the fixed eye that doth affect the heart; as the
Burning-glass must be for some time held with a steddy hand
in the beams of the Sun, before it will fire combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Be much then in the work; let not vain thoughts lodg,
but let holy thoughts abide and dwell within you.</p>
            <p>So much for the Act. I now come to the Object, What
is it that we are to consider? What? truly you need never
be at a loss for matter of consideration, most choice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
matter, <hi>viz.</hi> God himself, and the operations of his
hands, in Creation-work, and acts of Providence; specially
that admirable Master-piece, sinners Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Consider your selves, your hearts and ways, and latter
end; together with that infinite Ocean of Eternity into which
you must lanch; and those two places, Heaven and Hell, into
which all Intellectual and Rational beings shall be gathered.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40194:17"/>
Consider the Sermons you hear, and search the Scriptures dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
bring all that is said in the Pulpit to the Law and to the
testimony; and see whether those things be so or not. In
Prayer consider in what a presence you are, and with what
a glorious Majesty you have to do; what great Mercies and
Blessings you have to seek, and do not offer the sacrifice of
fools. Consider the Worship you perform, whether the word
will warrant it, and God accept it; many things that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pretty in the account of men, are very ugly in the sight of
God. Consider the opinions you take up, the Doctrines you
believe, whether they be truths of God, what foundation they
have in the Scripture, with what evidence they come upon
your minds, and what work they have made within. I might
multiply particulars to this purpose, but shall forbear. The
Text directs you to a very proper Object, Consider your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
<hi>in the end of their conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> was a very wise man, and very considerate; he
went too far in his trial and search for an happiness under the
sun; and being out of his way, he was often in the ditch; yet
wheresoever he was, he took consideration with him: You
find him one while <hi>returning and considering oppression,</hi> Eccles.
4. 1. another time you find him <hi>returning and beholding vanity
under the sun,</hi> Eccles. 4. 7. and at another time he is busily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in the sluggards field, Prov. 24. 30, <hi>He went by the field
of the slothful: he saw and consider'd it well, and lookt upon it.</hi>
What did he observe there? Two things; The posture of the
field, and the issue of the Owner. The field lay over-grown
with thorns, covered with nettles, having its stone-wall broken
down; and as for the end of its Owner, that was beggary; he
had not so many rags to his back, as he had nettles in his ground.
Poverty and want came upon him as an armed man. King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
consider'd all this, and receiv'd instruction. He was the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it while he liv'd. If we would be wise, we might get
good out of nettles; turn every thing we see, into spiritual
advantage. Honey is by the industrious Bee suckt out of net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles

I am calling you to turn, not into the Field of the heavy and
lazie drone, but into the Field of the diligent and laborious
Husbandman. And do you consider it well, observe how it is
watched, and manur'd, and kept; how curiously it lies, and how
fertil it is; what pains the industrious owner took in sowing,
and what comfort he hath in reaping; observe his harvest joy,
when he goes home at night carrying his sheaves with him.
We will consider here two things.</p>

these did flie an higher pitch. A liberal maintenance
was their due, the communication of their spirituals did rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserve a return of your temporals, which to make is not
your charity but duty, yet this was not their end. I could tell
you of some, who for your sakes have greatly deny'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
Others have laboured hard and chearfully in the midst
of hardship and want. They have hugg'd opportunities of
bringing to hungry souls bread from Heaven, clusters from the
Land of promise, when they themselves have, as to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition, been in a dry and barren wilderness: but affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively
thus, the end at which they aimed did consist of these
three things, which were worthy, most worthy of such truly
noble souls.</p>
            <p>1. The glory of the ever blessed God, which is his own su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and ultimate end in all he doth; and indeed nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the glory of God is fit to be advanced to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of such an end. Now this was the end of those holy men,
<hi>To me to live is Christ,</hi> said <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1. 21. He was the Author,

the inlarging of his territories, and increasing the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

all his actions: and this also was principally designed by your

and feeble to admit of so lofty a flight. Let nature and the

take it, and much good may it do them; when they have their
bellies full, let them go to rest, and sing themselves asleep in the
lap of pleasures, at the breast of creatures; when God awakens
them, they will find emptiness and pain, having fed all along
upon wind and ashes. <hi>As for me,</hi> I will not be put off with
these things, they are but for the body, but for the belly which
must be destroyed, for that part of man which shall never be
glorified. <hi>As for me,</hi> I study the good of my precious soul,
and am set for a portion for my soul; I would have my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take when their portion is spent: I am for beholding
the face of God, and satisfaction with the likeness of God; and
when I once have that, I am sure that I shall have enough both
of his love and of his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more abundantly than all; if you should ask
him, what it was he laboured for, he tells you, I and my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Brethren labour <hi>that whether</hi> present or absent, they
might be accepted of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. We would gladly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the Saints, but our chief desire and ambition is to be
accepted of the God of Saints, and to be received to live with
him as his Children for ever. And surely their greatest Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
may well allow them this. We all know, there is a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
in the creature, and a narrowness in the world, from
whence proceeds shouldering, and justling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and scrambling; but
the Divine Love is infinite, the fulness of a God inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible,
and in Heaven there are many mansions, room enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and happiness enough, and glory enough for all that shall
come thither: let us not quarrel by the way, nor at the Inne;
at home, at our Fathers house, there is <hi>fulness of joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Lastly, They desir'd and aim'd at the spiritual good,
and eternal welfare of your souls: To bring you unto Christ,
to build you upon Christ, to keep you from departures from
him, and from unstedfastness with him; in a word, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
for the making you meet to be partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Saints in light. Your selves are witnesses of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40194:19"/>
the pains they took among you. God is witness of their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for you, the tears they shed in private, the prayers they
made, in which they wrestled with great wrestlings, that you
might live in his sight, and neither fall short of the <hi>grace</hi>
which is bestowed upon his people, nor of the <hi>Rest,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
for them. I dare with highest confidence affirm, these
were the ends at which they principally aimed, and do not fear
being put to the blush at last, as one that is found a lyar.</p>
            <p>2. But now let us consider the end of their daies, their [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>]
last end, their going off the stage of the world, and out of
this vail of tears. What <hi>Exist</hi> have they? how come they off
at last? for that is the import of the word in the Original;
which (saith a Learned Critick) is a metaphor taken from
those, who being incompast about with thieves, are in danger
on every side; how do they escape? Faithful Pastors are tha
light of the world, but how many are there every where puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at them! They are the Salt of the earth, but how do the
wicked endeavour to cast all this Salt upon the dung-hill! and
what an unsavoury world should we have then? They are
troubled on every side, and in all revolutions of Kingdoms and
Nations, none are so much exposed to hazard as they. Well
now, observe and consider the end, the last Act, and blessed be
our good God, you shall find that <hi>in the Evening it is light,
[Finis coronat opus</hi>] Their End is such as that it crowns their
works; such as makes them free to tell the world, that their
labour hath not been in vain in the Lord, because it fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
all their hopes and expectations; nay, doth unspeakably
exceed them. It is such an End as is desirable for all men. Even
a <hi>Balaam</hi> wished thus, <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous,
and let my last end be like his.</hi> The vile wretch did not like
the righteous mans life, that was too refined and strict for him
who loved the wages of unrighteousness, but he would fain
have his end. And you will see no cause at all to wonder at
it, if you will but retire a little, and in good earnest consider
these things.</p>
            <p>1. The End of your faithful Pastors, yea and of faithful
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40194:20"/>
Christians too is <hi>a welcome end.</hi> Others, like the fool in the
Gospel, have their souls taken from them; there is a force put,
if they could resist, they would: in a sullen mood and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fit they will call for death, but when it comes indeed, they
wish it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arther off, Whereas these resign their souls, and
give up the Ghost, and commend their spirits into their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
hand, They did according to their duty love their work,
and Relations, and Friends, and Comforts, yea and glory in the
Cross of Christ, but they can freely bid farewel to all, when
they know they shall, and think they do go to God. Though
their daies be few, yet they depart hence full of daies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have had their fill of living, they do not only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to God, when he sends for them, but also are well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the World was crucified to them, and they to the World;
&amp; when things are once brought to that pass, it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to part, the World is weary of them, because they convince
and condemn it; and they are weary of the World, because of
its wickedness and frowardness. It is terrible to think, what
a strugling there is when a wicked man comes to die. Methinks
it is something like, though much beyond that of the Vine and
Olive, when the rest of the Trees would have made one of
them King; Oh, saith the Vine, how shall I leave my sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
and I, saith the Olive, my fatness? So say ungodly men
upon a dying-bed, how shall I leave my jovial and merry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
my honours and preferments, my riches and estate,
my pleasures and delights? if these be once gone, all is gone
with me, there is nothing left, I have nothing to take to. Death
ruines them at once. Alas, these poor cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

branches of the Vine, they are not ingrafted into the Olive,
they are brambles, and it is not strange that they should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuse to rule on earth, than to burn in Hell.</p>
            <p>But when these holy men come to die, whatever struglings
there are in nature, they chearfully comply. Death is what
they have looked and long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have prepared for it, and waited for it, and given many a long
look; and what should hinder their bidding of it welcome, since
they know it comes upon a good errand, though it be a grim
Messenger.</p>
            <p>2. It is a <hi>peaceable end.</hi> If a wicked man should say to Death,
as <hi>Ioram</hi> did to <hi>Jehu, is it peace,</hi> Death? He might expect such
an answer as he had. <hi>What peace,</hi> so long as thy rebellions, and
whoredoms, and abominations are so many? peace? no, no peace.
I am come to arrest thee upon Actions of high Treason against
the King of Heaven. The Soveraignty, Holiness, Goodness, Son,
Gospel, Mercies, Judgments of God have brought in their charges
against thee, and I am come to drag thee as a cursed Malefactor
to the tribunal of thy Judge, where thou shalt be convicted and
sentenc'd.</p>
            <p>But now if these gracious men should ask death, as the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
did <hi>Samuel, comest thou peaceably?</hi> the answer would be,
<hi>yes peaceably.</hi> I was thine Enemy, but I am reconciled. A
good Friend of thine hath pluckt out my sting, so that I cannot
hurt thee. I am come to fetch thee home. I am come to send
thee to a place where thou hast laid up great hopes, and many
prayers, and much treasure, to a place where thy Father is, and
thy Saviour, and an innumerable company of Angels, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of just men made perfect; many of them thou knowest,
most of them thou knowest not; yet all of them, one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
are ready with joy to bid you welcome. Sanctifie thy
self, set thine house in order, and come away. As soon as
ever I have taken off this clog of earth, Angels sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, according
to the charge their great Lord hath given them, receive thee,
and conduct thee to <hi>Iehovahs</hi> pallace, where thou shalt quickly
be; no tiring by the way, and no want in the Countrey It is true,
a malicious Devil is ready to fall upon the Saints, when they
are weakest, and if God permit him, he will bruise their heel
just when they are to go their journey. And sometimes there is
a very sharp bout, and soar conflict upon a death-bed
between him and them, but when once death is come, he parts
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40194:21"/>
the fray, and all is quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Devil may rage, and storm, and
fret, but he can do nothing else.</p>
            <p>3. It is a <hi>comfortable end;</hi> I deny not but a little before there
may be Clouds; and this shady Valley so dark, as that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is at a great loss. Though his Title be good, yet h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cannot read his Evidence. God may be pleased to put a Vail
upon his own face, and the Sun of Righteousness suspend his
Beams. There may be a great silence in Heaven, and not one
word of comfort spoken, that the attentive and listening Soul
can hear. God is indeed by, but he is not seen. He doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
but not revive. And hereupon there follows sad que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionings
and hot disputes, <hi>if it be so, why am I thus?</hi> will not God
vouch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afe me one smile now, and can I think he owns me for
one of his Children? <hi>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Hath he
forgotten to be gracious,</hi> or resolved he will not be so to me?
But when it is thus very dark, the dawning of the day is near at
hand. And oftentimes the Clouds scatter, and the case is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stated, and things are brought to a good issue, before the last
blow be given. God comes in and takes off the sackcloth, and
puts upon his beloved Child a Garment of praise, so that now
he lies in state upon his Bed of languishment. But however, as
soon as Death hath done his work, the dispute is at an end, and
the controversie is determined on the Souls side. And this is
done when things have been at the worst. After the lowest ebb,
there then is a spring-tide of consolation. Then the enlarged Soul
<hi>doth magnifie the Lord, and the Spirit rejoyceth in God its Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how often is it otherwise, have you not known? have
you not heard, that some of these precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> these
heirs of joy and glory have triumphed over Death, even while
they were under its assaults. When Death hath been making its
most furious batteries, then have they been singing their Song
of praise in the Apostles language and strain, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55, 56, 57.
O Death, where is thy sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The
sting of Death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law. But
thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40194:21"/>
Christ.</hi> What raptures have they been in; and what extasies
of joy? so that their pains and throws have been forgotten or
neglected. How have some of them told by-standers [<hi>hic sat
lucis] here is light enough,</hi> meaning in their breasts. And others,
that they were as full of joy as they could hold. God had anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with the oyl of gladness against their burial, and made
their cups run over, so that their Hearts have leaped within
them at the thoughts of their being upon the borders of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and so near the company which they lov'd so well. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that more than Swan-like Song of good old <hi>Simeon, Luke 2.
29. 30. Lord now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, according
to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.</hi> Having got
his Heart, and Christ in his Eye, he would set up his Sail, and
his Frait, Grace inbe gone for the other World.</p>
            <p>4. It is an <hi>Honourable end.</hi> Wicked men go out in a stink, not
only the grosly profane, but the hypocritical professors, if dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
as often they are. Their putrid carasses are not so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury
as their Names. Specially the Names of such professors,
who by their villanies have made Religion stink in the nostrils
of foolish men; though it is pity it should. Let all men judge
of our Religion, not by the practices of some that pretend to it,
but by its own Rules and Laws, which are the most exact, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and noble, of any in the World. But let the name of
the wicked rot, and indeed so it doth and shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is a curse
upon it, and that rots it. There was wickedness in their Lives,
and that causeth rottenness in their Names. No good man will
speak well of them, and the commendations of the wicked are
not worth the having, for they are a real disgrace.</p>
            <p>But these followers of the Lamb have obtained a good report,
and left it behind them. That Death, which makes them naked
and bare of all their temporal enjoyments, cannot strip them
of this. The righteousness of Christ, and the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
go along with them; their works sollow them, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of their holiness and usefulness stays behind. How
do their Relations and Friends want them? How do their People
and acquaintance bewail their absence! nay, some of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40194:22"/>
will strew flowers upon their Herse; And though they will
not be so liberal as their Conscience, nor speak all that's put
into their mouths, but suppress and detain such truths in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
yet they will bestow the Epithet of <hi>an honest man.</hi>
That God whom they served, hath said, <hi>The Righteous shall be in
everlasting remembrance.</hi> He takes care of their names, as well
as of their dust. And he hath also said, <hi>the memory of the just is
blessed.</hi> It is and shall be so, like a precious oyntment, which
fills the whole place where they lived with a fragrant odour, yea
and places far remote.</p>
            <p>We cannot expect all should speak well of them. Some paint
the Angels black; the Devil would have had <hi>Iob</hi> taken for a meer
mercenary, although he was the Worlds none-such for his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness.
<hi>Shimei</hi> cursed <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator
threw dirt upon a <hi>Paul.</hi> Christ himself was called a Deceiver
after his death, yet He was in all things faithful to him that
appointed him. When <hi>all</hi> men speak well of <hi>one,</hi> it is a shrewd
sign, <hi>all was not well.</hi> Either something was amiss, they will
be such as their company is; or else something was wanting,
<hi>viz.</hi> Faithfulness and plain dealing. It is honour enough to have
a good report among them who fear God, they are best able to
judge, and most to be credited; and this honour have all his
Saints, all those, whose character I have given you, and those
also who tread in their steps, and hold out to the end, so doing.</p>
            <p>5. Lastly, It is <hi>a most blessed and glorious end.</hi> You, Slaves of
Hell, who are at the Devils beck, and drudge for him all your
days, committing uncleanness with greediness, and drawing sin
as with Cart-ropes, what is the end you must expect? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
tells you, <hi>Rom. 6. 21. The end of those things is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is the best wages the Devil hath to bestow upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
a never-dying death, a death which is unspeakably worse
than death, and their end is <hi>shame.</hi> Now they are impudent, but
then they shall be ashamed. Dread shall fill them, and shame cover
them. <hi>That is the promotion of fools, Prov.</hi> 3. 35. Oh! change
your Master, leave your work, break off your sins by repentance,
unless you think eternal death a good reward, and everlasting
shame desirable preferment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40194:22"/>But behold these servants of the Lord, who have served their
generation according to the will of God, and glorified him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth, who have fought a good fight, and kept the faith to
the finishing of their course; who have desired and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to turn many to righteousness; how is it with them, when
their end comes? I want words, <hi>The lines fall to them in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
places, they have a goodly heritage.</hi> Who can summe up
their happiness? were one of them here, were an Angel here,

Diadems are not worth taking up in the street. And their
glory is answerable to their Crown. An exceeding and eternal
weight of glory, such as hath substance and solidity in it. And
no wonder if, together with all this, they have their joy. If any
thing can, this will make them forget their sormer sufferings,
the worlds affronts and inoignities, the angers and bitter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses
of their Mothers children, who are dandled in her
lap, and yet are peevish with their weaned Brethren. All this will
make them merry at heart, and cheerful in look, and sing <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah.</hi>
They have a joy of God's making<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maintaining; not
the crackling joy of the world, but the unconceiveable joy of
their Lord; a joy too big for them to contain, though their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
are greatly enlarged: it cannot enter into them, they
shall enter into it: a joy that shall fill them to the brim, and
compass them round about: they shall be in joy as a full vessel

Application. And</p>

know and speak <hi>the truth as it is in Iesus, not departing from the purity
and simplicity of the Gospel.</hi> Let us remember, whose Embassadours we
are, and keep close to our Commission, delivering only our Masters word.
Let our lips preserve knowledge, and not cause people to erre. May
our discourses turn chiefly and mostly upon those two Cardinal points
that <hi>Pauls</hi> did, <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
Do what you can to turn your Auditors from all their immoralities to
a sober, civil, and unblamable life. Doubtless the Gospel requires this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Christ came to redeem us not only from Hell and condemnation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from a vain and vicious conversation. And our perfection in Heaven
will consist in a compleat conformity to the Moral Law. If any decry
Morality, it is because they do not understand it. Yet my Brethren, let us
also teach Faith in Jesus Christ; do not rob him of any part of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to bestow it upon another. Sure I am, that is far from Morality; it is
no good manners to deal so with a precious Saviour, to whom we are
infinitely and everlastingly obliged. And such injustice will cost them
dear, that are guilty of it. Labour we to make men and women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Believers. Shew them the insufficiency of all they do to justifie them;

tell you one passage which came from him about three or four daies
before his death. Asking him how it was within, He answered me, <hi>very
well,</hi> adding withal; <hi>Blessed be God for an imputed Righteousness, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God for an inherent Righteousness; Dear Brother, I must tell you, if I
had not an inherent Righteousness, I could take no comfort</hi> from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Righteousness.</p>
            <p>He was of an unblameable Conversation. I never heard of one dead
flie in his Box of Ointment. Did I say; he was of an unblameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation?
it was too little a word, too short by much; He was of an
exemplary Conversation; He reduced precepts into practice, and was
not only in his Doctrine, but in his way too a shining light.</p>
            <p>He was a sweet Companion. Ah! my dear Brother, how pleasant, how
very pleasant wast thou unto me! Grace was poured into his lips, and
they dropt as an hony-comb. I was beholding to him for frequent visits.
And though sometimes my own occasions were very pressing and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
yet was his company never burdensom, for he still detained me
from business with delights and sweetnesses. And if at any time I was
not a gainer by his company, it was mine own fault. He was a warm
Christian, and carried up and down with him a heavenly fire, a Divine
heat both in his heart and his discourses.</p>
            <p>Some opposition he met with in his work, and discouragements, yet
he was not discouraged, but held on his way, and grew stronger and
stronger [<hi>Sub ponder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flourish the more. He did not count liberty nor life dear to him, so
that he <hi>might finish his course with joy, and the ministry, which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospel of the grace of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his blessed Master crowned his labours with admirable success,
he did not draw up his net empty, nor had he cause to complain of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
in vain, &amp; spending his strength for nought &amp; in vain. He did see
of the travail of his soul in the conversion of many, and will be able to
say at last, <hi>Lord, here am I, and the Children which thou hast given me.</hi>

            <p>But alas! alas! this bright and orient Star must fall, he must fall,
not by the rail of the Dragon, but by the hand of death, did I
say, he fell? no, no, he rose higher, and is now in the highest, with
the highest. This Star is removed into another Orb! His Mantle of
flesh he dropt and left behind, but his Spirit mounted, and returned to
God that gave it. And [<hi>Si verbis audacia detur</hi>] give me leave to

not manifest thy self to me at the Sacrament, when I was so very weak? didst
not thou give me some tasts that thou art gracious, and that thou didst love
me in particular, and that thou wouldest never leave nor forsake me, nor
