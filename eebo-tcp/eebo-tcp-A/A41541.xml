         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF the Great and Wiſe God regards the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of his Creatures, to provide for them in
every Exigency of their Caſe, to relieve
their Wants, and help them in all Difficulties
and Diſtreſſes, we may be aſſur'd that his kind
and watchful Providence is more peculiarly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about the Perſons of good and pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
While they live in this World, he guides
them by his Counſel, he ſteers the Courſe of thoſe
Kingdoms over which they reign: He by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and unaccountable Methods, points to a
Diſcovery of thoſe dark Conſpiracies which were
aim'd at their Ruin: He protects them, and is a
ſafer Defence than the greateſt Numbers of their
armed Guards. He influenceth their Minds and
Thoughts to obſerve the wiſeſt and beſt Rules of
Government; and he ſo diſpoſeth the Temper of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95008:4"/>
their Hearts, that Kings become nurſing Fathers,
and Queens nurſing Mothers to his People and
Church; when the moſt who have rul'd the
Nations of the Earth, deſtitute of this Divine
Care and Direction, have been Tyrants and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors:
And when the Date of the Life and
Reign of good Princes is ended, at the appointed
Period, God removes them from a low Throne
on Earth, to an higher in Heaven; and he takes off
a Crown ſharpned with Troubles and Cares, as ſo
many Thorns, to ſet one of undiſturbed Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Glory on their Heads. This is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
State of juſt and good Princes, ſo rarely found
among Men, that God will not only here guide
them by his Counſel, but lead and ſecurely bring
them to his Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pſalm,</hi> tho wrote by <hi>Aſaph,</hi> yet hath an
apparent regard to <hi>David;</hi> and of him as a King,
whom God had eſtabliſhed on the Throne, and
proſper'd his Reign, guiding the whole Courſe of
it by the beſt and wiſeſt Counſels, the Words of
my Text are meant; which alſo expreſs the firm
Confidence which this Great King and Prophet
had in God, that to the lateſt Moments of his
Life and Reign, he would aſſiſt him with his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95008:4"/>
Directions, and that when his laſt Day
was ended, he would bring him to the Poſſeſſion of
a Glory infinitely exceeding all the Splendor and
Magnificence of that Royal Majeſty of which he
muſt be diſrobed. It is by theſe Conſiderations
he ſupports and ſolaces his Soul; which, upon firſt
Thoughts, was vex'd at the Proſperity of wicked
Princes, who grew old in Tyranny and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
who daily increas'd in Greatneſs and Power,
tho founded on the Blood and Ruin of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
who triumph'd in uninterrupted Succeſſes,
when as his own juſt and good Reign was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
diſturb'd by the Wickedneſs of his own
ungrateful Subjects, or the Invaſions of unjuſt
Enemies. But when he conſider'd that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Counſels by which they acted, would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be proſperous, for God would blaſt and
confound them; that all their Arts of Policy
would fail for want of God's Direction and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
that all their Supports of Power would be
ſuddenly broken, and that the Ground on which
they ſtood was uncertain and ſlippery, and ſo they
would tumble into unexpected Deſtruction:
When this good King entertain'd himſelf with
theſe wiſe and ſober Thoughts, the Hurries of
his Mind were preſently compos'd, and he no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95008:5"/>
longer envied at the Proſperity of the Wicked,
nor complain'd that God was pleas'd to fill his
own Life with Difficulties and Troubles. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Tumults and Combuſtions diſquieted the
Peace of his Reign, yet he enjoy'd an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd
Repoſe within his own Breaſt; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God's Protection and Care, he was ſure of
being inviolably ſafe. As long as he was led by
God's Counſels, which never fail of Succeſs, he
knew certainly that neither his Kingdom, nor his
own Perſon, could be in danger. He knew that he
ſhould live gloriouſly, and die happy; that God
would receive him to a greater Glory, than what
he left here; and that he would only take off an
Earthly Crown, to ſet an Heavenly One infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more bright and ſhining, on his Head. Thus
Good Princes are entirely bleſs'd; while they live,
God is not only their Guard to defend them, but
their chiefeſt Miniſter of State, to give them the
wiſeſt and moſt faithful Counſel; and when
they die, they go off honour'd and lamented by
all their People: nor do they leave only a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Name behind them, but they go to poſſeſs
a ſolid, and eternal Glory, which fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
They but ſtep out of one Throne, to aſcend
another in Heaven, which cannot be ſhaken, nor
endanger'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95008:5"/>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That they are moſt certainly bleſs'd
whom God loves, and takes care of; whom he
leads by his Counſel through all the troubleſome
Paſſages of their Lives; and after all Storms and
Dangers, lands them ſafely on the Shores of his
Glorious Kingdom above. As he always gives the
beſt Advice, ſo they can never miſcarry who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it; but if we truſt to our own Wiſdom, and
purſue Counſels different from what he gives us,
we renounce his Care, we refuſe his Inſtruction,
we blindly ruſh on without him, and ſo bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our ſelves, that we are fatally loſt. He knows
what is for our Good, and kindly directs us to it.
He ſees a-far off the threatning Danger, and
warns us to avoid it. He diſcerns what may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
promote our Happineſs and Safety, which
is not deſcry'd by us ſhort-ſighted Creatures; and
all his Counſels have a tendency to bring us unto
Bleſſedneſs: and if we are led by them, we ſhall
not miſs of arriving at Glory. But he who forſakes
this ſure Guide, moſt certainly loſeth his Way;
and is diſmally benighted, and falls down a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice
into the Place of everlaſting Night and
Darkneſs. I ſhall conſider,

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95008:6"/>
                  <item>1. What Counſel is in general.</item>
                  <item>2. Who the Perſon is, who ſo graciouſly offers
us his Help to conduct us ſafely by his Counſels,
through all the Temptations, Diſtreſſes, and
Dangers of this Life.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall ſhew how the Circumſtances of our
Caſe make it neceſſary for us to be counſell'd and
directed by God; and that if we do not mind
what he ſays to us, if we are obſtinate and will
not obſerve his Directions for our Happineſs, we
muſt unavoidably be miſerable.</item>
                  <item>4. I ſhall diſplay the bleſſed Fruits, and Effects
of being led by God's Counſels; what Peace and
Satisfaction of Mind there is in following his Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
what Security in ſuch a Courſe; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Joys fill the Heart from theſe Thoughts,
that we ſhall be ſafe through all the Time of our
Lives, and ſhall be bleſſed and glorious whenever
we die.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. What is Counſel. It is a wiſe Advice to
direct us what is fitteſt to be done according to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95008:6"/>
the Circumſtances of Caſe; and what may be
the propereſt, and moſt ſucceſsful Means to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
the intended and deſired Effect. Such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
all Kings want, but few are ſo happy as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. Thrice happy was our Queen, who was
not only directed by her Counſel of State, but by
that of Heaven too. It is God the abſolute Diſpoſer
of all Affairs both in Heaven and Earth, as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarch of both Worlds, who gives out
Commiſſions to the Kings of the Earth; and when
they govern according to his Orders, and are led
by his Counſels, they are Fathers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and publick Bleſſings. It is this great and wiſe
God, who alone can make any Nation flouriſhing
and proſperous, by inſtructing the Prince, and the
Senators in Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>2. If we conſider the excellent Perfections of
<hi>this mighty Counſellor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 6.</note> they all are ſo many convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Arguments to prevail on us to obſerve his
Inſtructions while we live; and to have the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Confidence and Hope, that being purſued by
us, they will make us happy when we die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The Greatneſs of God gives Authority to
his Counſel. We redily hearken to thoſe who are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95008:7"/>
above us, and every Word which they ſpeak car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a weight in it, and is forcibly impreſs'd on our
Minds. If a Friend adviſeth us to what we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
may be an Advantage, we chearfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and follow his Counſel: But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of a Superior is a Command, and adds
the Obligation of Duty to the Conſideration of our
own Benefit. God then who is the greateſt above
all, may very well guide all by his Counſel; and
it is not more a Duty than a Privilege, to obſerve
the Meaſures of his Conduct. Within this Circle
our Queen was ſecure, when in the Management
of all Affairs, ſhe was under the Guidance of a
Power infinitely greater than her own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The Wiſdom of God aſſures us that his
Counſels are not obnoxious to the leaſt Miſtakes:
and that by adhering to them, we can never be
miſguided. The greateſt Politicians may ſee their
trueſt Rules fail them, and their exacteſt Meaſures
broken; for there are ſo many nice Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Affairs which indiſcernably paſs by, and
cannot be fore-ſeen, that it is impoſſible for the
Wiſeſt to provide againſt all Events. The beſt-laid
Deſign may be fruſtrated by very ſlight unthought
of Accidents, which could not fall within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95008:7"/>
of the moſt careful, and conſidering Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
But the all-knowing God, who ſees the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
of things, before we can diſcern their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
makes ſuch effectual Proviſions, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can interrupt, or diſappoint his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The Goodneſs of God gives us ſufficient
Security, that he will not adviſe us to any thing for
our Hurt; but that all his Counſels come full
charged with Bleſſings to us. It is condeſcending
Goodneſs, that he will inſtruct his Creatures,
whom he might have left to wander and periſh
in their Folly. Since then, to prevent their Ruin,
he is ſo gracious as to adviſe them, we may be
certain that he doth not direct them to any thing
but what is mightily conducive to their Welfare
and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>3. Let us reflect how our weak and helpleſs
Condition makes it neceſſary for us to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd
and directed. What is the greateſt among
Men, without the Care and Aids of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but a poor wretched Creature abandon'd to
Miſery, and Deſpair? When encompaſs'd with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
Difficulties, all his Preſence of Mind is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95008:8"/>
loſt, if God doth not reaſſure him; and his
Thoughts are ſo diſorder'd and perplex'd, that
he knows not which way to turn himſelf, nor
what Knot he ſhould firſt untie to looſen his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements:
It is only the Thought of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Care and Conduct of the Wiſe and
Good God, which can reſtore his Spirit to him,
and fortify his Reſolution.</p>
            <p>4. What are the ſignal Advantages of being
protected by God's Love and Care, and guided
by his Counſels.</p>
            <p>1. The Aſſurance that we have of God's kind
and careful Regard to us, and that he will, ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the Exigencies of our Caſe, not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
but counſel us too, gives us the trueſt Senſe
of Pleaſure in every State of Life. There is no
Condition ſo proſperous, but the Conſideration
of the Vanity of its Enjoyments, or the Fears of
a Succeſſion of Miſery, may imbitter it to us. We
gain therefore, in the moſt flouriſhing Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of our Days, a double Advantage by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God's Care and wiſe Conduct: For the
Experience of it repreſents to us thoſe Bleſſings
we enjoy, not only as Pleadges of his Love, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95008:8"/>
Teſtimonies of his Favour, but as Gifts which
Infinite Wiſdom thinks meet to beſtow on us,
and will teach us to make a right and good Uſe of
them; and this encreaſeth their Value, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanceth
the Pleaſures of Enjoyment. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
alſo which we have in a Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
kind and indulgent to us, and carefully
managing all our Concerns for the beſt Purpoſes
of our Happineſs, doth fence us againſt too anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fears of a Change of our preſent eaſy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For tho we know that all things here are
variable, yet we are undoubtedly certain that
God never alters in the greateſt Revolutions, which
toſs this lower World, and wholly change the
Poſture of it. That he continues the ſame Care
over thoſe whom he loves, tho their Condition
is varied. That no Extremities of Miſery, nor
Perplexities of Affairs, can put his Wiſdom to a
loſs, but it is always able to ſhew us <hi>a Way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape;</hi>
and that therefore tho all the Calamities
ſhould come upon us which Men have either ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or do fear, yet we ſhall be ſecured by the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of Divine Counſel. The Thoughts and Hopes
of this therefore can only afford us a ſolid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the deepeſt plunges of Miſery: For what
can ſupport us in any ſad Moments of our Lives,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95008:9"/>
wherein all things may ſeem to conſpire our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
when a Storm threatens from all Sides,
and a wide Ruin opens to ſwallow us? Where
can we find Ground for hope to ſettle upon, or
from whence can we expect a Reſcue? If in ſo ſad
and deſperate a Condition we look on all things
about us, we have nothing in proſpect but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.
It is the Senſe of that part which we have
in the Protection and Conduct of God, to whoſe
Power all things are ſubject, and whoſe Wiſdom
was never perplex'd by the greateſt Difficulties,
which can here alone bear us up from ſinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our deſpairing Thoughts. This Faith ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 62. 1, 2. <hi>Truly my Soul waiteth
upon God: from him cometh my Salvation. He only is
my Rock and my Salvation: he is my Defence; I ſhall
not be greatly moved.</hi> And the ſame Faith ſo
ſtrongly eſtabliſh'd the Heart of our Queen,
that no Report of Evil Tidings, nor Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Danger, could once move it from its due
Station, but ſhe firmly bore all Events with an
equal Mind.</p>
            <p>2. The Apprehenſion of being guarded by
God's careful Love, and guided by his Counſel,
will give us that entire Satisfaction of Mind, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95008:9"/>
we ſhall poſſeſs Eaſe and Joy within; which
is a Rational, and therefore the beſt and
pureſt Pleaſure. What greater Torment is
there, than a Man's own unruly Paſſions when
let looſe, which rage with the utmoſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?
What Delight doth a Man feel, when
thoſe Furies being quell'd, he enjoys an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded
Serenity of Mind? It is the pleaſing
Reflections which we make on our being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of a Good and Wiſe God,
which breaths this Calm in our troubled
Breaſts, and lays the Storms which were
rais'd there, either by our own bluſtering Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
or the Impreſſions of outward Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
For Man is not only expos'd to all
manner of preſent Evils, but tormented
with the Fears of greater to come, which
aggravates and ſharpens the Sadneſs of
his Condition: For as an Addition to his
preſent Diſtreſſes, he anticipates thoſe Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which he apprehends will come upon
him; and all thoſe Evils which he yet ſees
but at a greater diſtance, are repreſented
by his Fears as preſent in the moſt horrible
Appearance. If he be therefore left wholly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95008:10"/>
to the Mercy of his preſent Troubles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Defence, and hath no hopes of his
future being prevented, he cannot entertain
one comfortable Thought: The Horror of
ſo ſad and diſmal a Condition, will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
confound him, and he will always be
diſtracted with his own Fears; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1.
<hi>The Wicked fly when no Man purſues:</hi> They
ſtartle at the leaſt Appearance of Danger, and
fly from thoſe terrible Shadows which their
own Phancies have frightfully drawn: They
have no Intereſt in the Care and Counſel of
God, which only can help a forlorn aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
Creature, and relieve him in the moſt
deplorable Extremities: They have no
Strength to oppoſe againſt the dreaded Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
no Refuge to fly unto for Security.
Whither ſhall that Man go for Advice,
whom God refuſeth to lead by his Counſel?
Where can he be ſafe, whom God will not
take care of? To what Power ſhall he have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to defend him, who wants the Divine
Aſſiſtance? or by what Hand can be expect
to have what he fears turn'd off from him,
who hath not the leaſt apprehenſion that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95008:10"/>
God hath a kind Regard to him, and will
ſafely conduct him thrô all the wild and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
Paſſages of this World, to Eternal
Bliſs and Glory? Such a wretched Man muſt
neceſſarily be left to the Fury of his own
fretting Thoughts, and to the Violence of the
deepeſt Deſpair, who not only groans under
preſent Evils, but is wrack'd by Fears of the
Future, without any hopes of Relief. But
the happy Perſon, who knows that the whole
Courſe of his Life is ſteer'd by a wiſe and
skilful Hand, which is ſo kind as to be careful
of his Welfare and Felicity, may baniſh all
Fears and troubleſom Paſſions from his Breaſt,
repoſing himſelf ſecure upon the Love and
Care of his God.</p>
            <p>Thus our Queen was led by God's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
and though in the Adminiſtration of
Affairs ſhe imploy'd that admirable Wiſdom
with which God had endow'd her, and fitted
her to ſway the Scepter of Three Kingdoms,
yet with an entire Confidence ſhe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Events of Government unto him.
This made her always eaſy in her own Mind,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95008:11"/>
whatever Occaſions there were, which would
have diſquieted any Soul leſs firm than
Hers; and her Thoughts were ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
and ſerene.</p>
            <p>And as God anſwer'd that Truſt which
ſhe repos'd in him, in leading her by his
Counſels in the Conduct of a Reign, which
though alas but too ſhort, yet was very
difficult, and in preſerving her Perſon and
Government; ſo when the ſad Hour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd,
ſad indeed to Three Nations, but
glorious to Her, in which a Period was put
to a Life ſo dear to all good Men, and
which the Worſt could not but admire,
God made good his own Promiſe, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
her Hopes and earneſt Wiſhes, in
bringing her to his Glory. In the joyful
Aſſurance of this, the Great Soul took its
flight to its Redeemer, and is for ever with
the Lord.</p>
            <p>She is gone, and hath left us to our Sighs
and Tears, to bewail a Loſs, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Day will make us more and more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95008:11"/>
She is retir'd out of ſight, and our
Eyes will no longer be charm'd with the
View of ſo many Excellencies, as are the
Wonder of this Age, and will difficult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be believ'd by the Succeeding, to have
been found in any one ſingle Perſon. She
was weary of the Troubles which infeſt
this lower Region, where nothing but Sin
and Sorrows dwell, and ſilently withdrew
to a ſafe and pleaſant Retreat. Her calm
and gentle Soul was contrary to Storms,
though it was never diſturb'd by them; and
by the Direction of God's Counſel it hath
arriv'd in a quiet and ſmooth Haven, while
looking on this little World, it ſees every
Shore cover'd with the ſad ſcatter'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of innumerable Shipwracks of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Nations, whom God led not by
his Counſels, but left them to ſteer their
own fatal Courſe.</p>
            <p>She enjoys not only a perpetual Peace,
and uninterrupted <hi>Pleaſures for ever more,
Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. after all her Cares and Labours
employ'd for the Happineſs of her Subjects,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95008:12"/>
but <hi>God hath brought her to his Glory;</hi> a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which, being above our higheſt Thoughts,
muſt neceſſarily exceed the Compaſs of any
Words to expreſs it; an Eternal Glory
which can never decay, and in compariſon
of which all the Magnificence of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Earthly Monarchs, is but the Pageantry
of an Hour, and a tranſitory Shew. But
though ſhe hath left this World, her Great
and Honourable Name and Memory will
never leave it; that, Immortal as her Mind,
will be had in <hi>everlaſting Remembrance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112. 6.</note> and
Princes in many Ages to come, will ſtrive
to reſemble her Character, as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Pattern of an Excellent Queen.</p>
            <p>She was greater by her Vertues, than by her
Birth and Dignity; and the Blood of Kings
which flow'd in her Veins, was one of the
leaſt Things which enobled Her. Thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Qualities by which ſhe was ſo
illuſtriouſly diſtinguiſh'd from all others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Men, would have rendred her wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the greateſt Crown on Earth, tho
ſhe had not been born to one: And if ſhe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95008:12"/>
had liv'd among Nations, where not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Birth, but the Suffrages of the
People, place the Crown upon the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Head, and the Power of Empire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on the Perſon, whoſe Majeſtick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and Great and Noble Mind, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him as the moſt deſerving and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to command others, whom he ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
excells; Her alone appearance among
the aſſembled Tribes, at the very firſt ſight,
would have determin'd the Choice of the
rejoicing People. Never was in any finite
Perſon, ſuch a due mixture of Sweetneſs
and Majeſty; and Royal Greatneſs was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo equally lov'd and rever'd before.
We ſaw, with a ſurprizing Amazement, all
thoſe manly Vertues in the ſofter Sex,
which we admire in a Heroe; Wiſdom in
Counſels, a ſteady firmneſs of Mind amidſt
all the perplexing Difficulties of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a Reſolution never ſtartled by
the ſudden appearance of any ſad Accidents
or unexpected Dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95008:13"/>
But Accompliſhments of Nature have been
ſeen, and with wicked Flattery have been
ador'd in Heathen Princes; though the
greateſt Examples of them cannot, by many
Degrees, reach the Height of our Queen:
She excell'd them in all the Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
with which God hath been pleas'd
(that the Deſigns of his Providence might
be effected) to dignify ſinful Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in ſeveral Perſons, who neither knew
nor acknowledg'd him. A Crown never
ſhin'd ſo brightly before, though worn by
many Kings of the Chriſtian Name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Grace of God, which ſo very
rarely ſparkles there, hath never, ſince the
Time of <hi>David,</hi> ſpread ſuch a Luſtre on any
Crowned Head.</p>
            <p>Our Queen (whoſe Loſs not only we,
but many Ages to come will deplore)
was not only Great, but truly Religious;
She had not meerly the Vertues of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Princeſs worthy to command Men,
but the Graces of a Chriſtian. She had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95008:13"/>
not the empty Title of <hi>Defender of the
Faith,</hi> but knew, and heartily believ'd the
Truths of the Goſpel, and felt their lively
Influence on her Heart, and the Fruits
were viſibly apparent in the Actions of her
Life.</p>
            <p>She wore a Crown, not to glory in the
Pride of Majeſty, but to feel the Weight of it;
and the Regal Power did not adminiſter to
her the Luxuries and Pleaſures of a Court,
but the anxious Cares of Government; and
when other Kings have been only ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to make the Throne eaſy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
and to indulge themſelves in all
things which the Licentiouſneſs of a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would afford, She alone burden'd her
Self with the Affairs of Three kingdoms;
and her conſtant Thoughts were to provide
for the Welfare and Safety of her numerous
Subjects in them all. This was her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
Employment; Religion was her
great and pleaſing Buſineſs, as thoſe many
Hours which ſhe ſpent in Sacred Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a Spiritual Converſe between
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95008:14"/>
God and her own Soul, did evidence.
Theſe happy Moments ſolaced her amidſt
all the Diſquiets of her Reign, and eas'd the
Burden of that Crown which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have oppreſs'd her. As ſhe lov'd her Lord
Jeſus, ſhe made him her Support, truſted in
him, caſt her Care upon him, according to
the Direction of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> and her
Faith and Hope in him, who is King of
Kings, made her Soul calm and ſerene,
when threatning Storms aroſe, and the
Hearts of all the People trembled: Her
Faith did not only eſtabliſh her Mind, but
was fruitful in good Works towards others;
and that remarkable and diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a true Chriſtian, which could
never be found in the moſt celebrated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Ethnick Vertue, was eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in Her.</p>
            <p>She lov'd and did good to them who
hated her; and they that could not be her
Enemies, without being ſo of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
too, felt the Bleſſings of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they ſo eagerly endeavour'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95008:14"/>
to ſubvert. She reliev'd their Wants, who
would have rejoic'd to ſee her reduc'd to
the Condition of the meaneſt of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and who not only murmur'd, but
would have cut off the Hand which fed
them. They then who regarding only their
private Gain and Intereſt, and inſenſible of
the Calamity of the Country, triumph'd at
her Death, might yet with better Reaſon
have bewail'd their private Loſs in the
Publick One of the Nation; for they ſoon
were ſenſible of the Decay of thoſe Streams
of Bounty which refreſh'd them, when the
Spring was dry'd up.</p>
            <p>As ſuch Inſtances of all Princely Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
join'd with the Graces of a Saint, are
very extraordinary, we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
them as Publick Bleſſings, and moſt
joyfully to praiſe God, that he hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
this Nation with ſuch Examples, as
very rarely appear upon Earth: We ought to
value, love and reverence their Perſons, to
do all that we can to eaſe the Cares and
Weight of a Crown, by our chearful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95008:15"/>
to all juſt Commands; and by our
readineſs to imploy our Lives, and all that
we have, for the Support of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When God deprives a People of a Wiſe,
Good, and Pious King or Queen, we ſhould
tremble at ſuch a dreadful and portentous
Sign of his Diſpleaſure, as foreboding Ruin
to us, if we will yet be obſtinately reſolv'd
to continue in Sin, and refuſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
We ought not only to bewail the
Loſs of ſo much Excellence in the Death of
the Queen, but to lament it as a National
Calamity, and to feel the Wound that is
ſtruck ſo deep into the very Bowels of our
Country. When good Princes die, the
ſtrong and healthy Conſtitution of a good
Government is impair'd; and the Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
being gone, with the departure of the
Univerſal Soul by which it was animated, a
Kingdom lies expiring, when They reſign
their lateſt Breath. This draws Tears from all
Eyes at their Funerals,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 35. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and not only the
Court, but a Whole Nation goes into
Mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95008:15"/>
Our Sorrow ſhould ſharpen a juſt Hatred
and Indignation againſt our Sins, as the
Cauſes of that diſmal Calamity, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
it. <hi>The Sins</hi> of a Country ſhorten
the Lives of thoſe, who are the Fathers of
it. <hi>They</hi> infect the Air of a Nation; and
Good Princes firſt fall, and then the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded
People periſh in whole Multitudes.
<hi>They</hi> deſtroy with a ſwifter Violence than the
malignant Deſigns of Secret, or the Swords
of Open Enemies.</p>
            <p>Let us not put our entire Truſt in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though the beſt upon Earth; for none
but God who cannot die, nor any of his
Perfections ever decay, but are unchangeable,
is ſtrong enough to bear up all the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we can put in him.</p>
            <p>We have ſadly experienc'd how ſoon we
may be diſappointed in the beſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
What great, and juſt Expectations
had we from the Reign of a Princeſs, in
whom Regal Power was join'd with Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95008:16"/>
and Grace? How did we promiſe to
our ſelves from the vigorous Conſtitution of
her Youth, not only happy Influences, and
Proſperity of her Government, but alſo a
long Continuance? But how ſoon were our
Deſires and Expectations blaſted on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den?
and when we did not ſuſpect it, a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and treacherous Diſeaſe in a few Hours
murther'd all our Hopes. It is then in our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone, who is King of
Kings, and Lord of Lords, and who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
not only over Nations, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Kings themſelves, that we ought
perfectly to confide; and if we believe,
and truſt in him, <hi>be will here lead us by his
Counſel, and aſſuredly bring us to his eternal
Glory.</hi>
