            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr reſolution of this queſtion, I muſt premiſe ſome things, to make the way thereto the more eaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. That the old Hebrew language wherein the Scripture ſpeaks, there is no one word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the compages of the ſuperiour and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies, which we call <hi>Mundus,</hi> but theſe two words <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

put together, onely ſo that when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (the World that then was, periſhed by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but the Heavens and earth that are now, are reſerved to fire:) He might as well have ſaid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his meaning, The Heavens and the Earth which then were, periſhed by waters, as the world that now is ſhall by fire. For the words <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> joyned, imply no more in the one (according the Scriptures notion) than the ſingle word <hi>Mundus</hi> or <hi>World</hi> doth in the other, being applyed to the hiſtory of the great deluge: as alſo, a <hi>New heaven</hi> and a <hi>New earth</hi> is the ſame notion with that in our expreſſion, where we ſay a <hi>New World;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Nova rerum facies, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va rerum conditio;</hi> which we otherwhile apply to very ſmall, and even particular and domeſticall changes, when we ſay, Here is a new World; which the Hebrew would or might expreſſe, Here is a new Heaven and a new Earth.</p>
            <p>2. That it is not like that any other World, or Heaven and Earth, ſhall periſh by fire, than ſuch a one as heretofore periſhed by water: for ſo the <hi>antitheſis</hi> importeth, <hi>viz.</hi> The World, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth that then was, periſhed by water, the Heaven and Earth which now is, is reſerved for a deſtruction by fire. Now the world which periſhed by water was no other than the ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry world; the Heaven whereof is that which we call Ayre, but the Scripture Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary heaven, together with the earth, was marred by that generall deluge; and the creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them both either wholly deſtructed, or

marvellouſly corrupted from that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: ſuch a World therefore, and no other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, ſhall undergo the ſecond deluge of fire for reſtauration, which before ſuffered the deluge of water for corruption.</p>

               <hi>as the leafe falleth off from the Vine, and as a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling figge from the figge-tree. For my ſword ſhall be bathed in Heaven: Behold it ſhall come downe on Idumea, &amp;c.</hi> See the reſt, and know that this deſtruction of Edom is propheſied of in no leſſe hyperbolicall a ſtraine by <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> chapter 49. from verſe 7. to 22. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 35. verſe 4. and 25. 12. which I note, leſt any man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at the <hi>hyperbole</hi> of this of <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſhould thinke it applyable onely to the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that ſuch ſchemes as theſe were uſuall to the Nations of the Orient, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare not onely by the Chymicall Phyloſophy derived thence, (which makes heaven and earth and ſtarres in every thing) but from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Moſes Maimonides,</hi> who (<hi>more Nebochim part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 29.) affirmes that the Arabians in his time in their vulgar ſpeech, when they would expreſſe that a man was fallen into ſome great calamity or adverſity, uſed to ſay, <hi>Coelum ejus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per terram ejus cecidit:</hi> Compare <hi>Lament.</hi> 2. 1. No queſtion theſe ſchemes were as familiar to them as our Poets ſtraines and expreſſions are to us, though of another <hi>genius:</hi> Ours are borrowed from fables, ſtories, places; theirs more, from the frame of the world, the Sunne, Moon, Stars, and Elements, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a notion of <hi>Coelum</hi> and <hi>Terra</hi> may have place in this place of <hi>Peter,</hi> (and why may hee not uttering a Propheſie borrow a Poeticall ſtraine) it may eaſily appeare what Heaven and Earth the fire at Chriſts ſecond comming ſhall

burne up and conſume, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heaven and the earth of the contained world, ſuch as thoſe which the former judgement by water over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed and deſtroyed; the World of wicked ſtates and men, high ones and low ones, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Pezants, man and beaſt; according to that twice repeated paſſage, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. 11, 17. (which the ancient Jewes interpreted of the day of judgement) <hi>The loftineſſe of man ſhall be bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downe, and the haughtineſſe of men ſhall be made low, and the Lord alone ſhall bee exalted that day: And the Idols</hi> (theſe are part of the hoſt of<note place="margin">See the Apoſtaſie of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</note> heaven wee ſpeake of) <hi>hee ſhall utterly aboliſh.</hi> And of ſuch heavens and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as theſe, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth not though we underſtand an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction (<hi>viz.</hi> of ſo much as ſhall bee burned) as was in the deluge of <hi>Noah.</hi> And ſo likewiſe of the earth and workes thereof. But whereas by the univerſall deluge, though onely the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus contentus</hi> periſhed, yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Mundus continens</hi> was therewith corrupted and depraved: In the deſtruction of fire it ſhall bee otherwiſe; for the world of wicked ones being deſtroyed, the Heaven and the Earth which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them ſhall bee purged and refined, for the righteous to dwell therein. This expoſition I put but in the ſecond place, becauſe where the proper ſenſe of the letter may be kept, I preferre it before any other.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if any there yet bee, whom neither of the former expoſitions can ſatisfie, but will needs have the fire and burning here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63989:14"/>
of, to bee that whereby the World is to bee utterly annihilated; I could anſwer, that the day of judgment is a thouſand yeares; and this fire, though it be to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in that day,</hi> yet ſhall it not bee in the beginning, but end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the beginning being but a deſtruction of the enemies of Chriſt, and the Kingdome of Sathan, and then a reſtauration: The end, a deſtruction of the whole creature it ſelfe by utter annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then Saint <hi>Peters</hi> words, verſe 13. to bee conſtrued after this manner; <hi>That howſoever the Heavens and the earth ſhall at length bee diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by fire, nevertheleſſe before that ſhall be, we look for a new Heaven and a New Earth</hi> (i. e. a new World or reſtauration) <hi>to precede this abolition, according to his promiſe,</hi> Eſay 65. &amp; 66.</p>
            <p>But ſuch an expoſition, methinkes, would not ſuit ſo well with that which I take to bee Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chiefeſt ſcope in this paſſage; nor with the words of the holy Prophets hee pointeth at, which ſeeme to ſpeake onely of ſuch a fire, which ſhould precede a reſtauration, and not of that which ſhould cauſe an utter abolition of the World: And as concerning ſuch an utter abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the whole frame of Heaven and Earth, after the Oeconomy of the Redemption and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of Chriſt ſhall bee finiſhed, it ſeemeth to mee a myſtery which hath no bottome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I am not perſwaded this place of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould meane any ſuch thing. Thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, <hi>Iob</hi> 14. 12. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 102. 26. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20. 11. may ſeeme to bee of more moment.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63989:14"/>
And if any ſuch annihilation ſhall bee, it ſtands more with reaſon it ſhould bee by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate power of God, without the inſtrument of any creature, than by fire; and that hee who at firſt brought it out of nothing without any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures help, ſhould reduce it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again without the help of any creature.</p>
