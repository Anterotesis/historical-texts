            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Attorney generall; to deliver their opinions touching the queſtion, whether Corne was ſuch victuals as was intended to have the price rated within the ſaid Statute: In anſwer to which demand, the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Berkley</hi> then being one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Court of Kings Bench, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the ſaid unlawfull charge, endevoured to be impoſed, as aforeſaid, the 30. day of <hi>November,</hi> in the 8. year of his now Majeſties Raigne, did deliver his opinion, that Corne was ſuch victuall as was intended to have the price rated within the ſaid Statute; which ſaid opinion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, and to the plaine ſence, and meaning of the ſaid Statute; and contrary to his owne knowledge, and was given and delivered by him, with a purpoſe and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſaid unlawfull charge might be impoſed upon the Subject.</p>

And after upon a Reference to him and others, by order of the ſaid Court, of the impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Interrogatories and depoſitions of witneſſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the Defendants part; in the ſame caſe the ſaid Sir <hi>Robert Berkley,</hi> upon the ſecond day of <hi>May,</hi> in the eighth yeare of his now Majeſties raigne, certified that nine and thirtie of the ſaid Interrogatories, and the depoſitions upon them taken, ſhould be ſuppreſſed, with anſwers (except as aforeſaid) and depoſitions, although the ſame did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſaid Defendants moſt materiall defence.

            <p>And whereas the Earle of <hi>Exeter,</hi> by vertue of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Commiſſion to him directed, for the arraying and arming of a certaine number of perſons in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> hath aſſeſt <hi>William Pargiter</hi> being a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of body for that ſervice, but being of eſtate and ability fit to contribute, amongſt others, to pay the ſumme of five ſhillings towards the arraying and arming of others of able bodies, and wanting ability to arme and array them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>And whereas wee have received information from the ſaid Earle, that the ſaid <hi>William Pargiter</hi> hath not onely in a wilfull and diſobedient manner refuſed to pay the ſaid money aſſeſſed upon him towards ſo important a ſervice, to the diſturbance and hinderance of the neceſſary defence of this Kingdome; but alſo by his ill example hath miſ-led many others, and, as wee have juſt cauſe to beleeve, hath practiſed to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
