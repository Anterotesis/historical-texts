            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THe Wise Man tells us <hi>Pro. 17. 14. that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of strife is as when one setteth out Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore leave off,</hi> saith he, <hi>contention before it be medled with.</hi> The Original is big with an Emphasis, and is rendred by <hi>Arius Montanus, [Aquas aperiens, or qui aperit aquam]</hi> that is to say, Opening the Bay, or making a gap in the Banks for the water to run out; so that at first, though the matter may seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable, yet the Waters widening their passage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impetuous, grow stronger and stronger, carry all before it, drown the Country, and cause great Devastations: In like manner from small beginings of Controversy, Breaches are enlarged, Animosities fomented, the World filled with Variance, Noise, and Clamour: so that he that first starteth the same, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being compell'd thereunto, especially if it be about Theological points, and those Circumstantials and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio's, shews himself to be a man of little judgment, and less affection to the <hi>Churches Peace.</hi> For though disputes about Religion are sometimes <hi>Necessary,</hi> yet are they alwayes <hi>Dangerous,</hi> too often emptying the heart of Christian Charity, and filling it with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Zeal, and Passion: upon which account few there are to be found, who are fitly qualified to manage such undertakings, which are usually carried on with more heat than any other Subject. For that besides Reason,
<pb facs="tcp:106704:3"/>
Learning, Reputation, Confidence of Verity, and Interest, which warm men in other <hi>Polemical encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> they are in this inflamed with a <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, and the <hi>Impulse</hi> of Conscience to appear in his Cause, and for his Truth impugned. The Concurrence of all which, or some of them, have perhaps induced Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> to appear once more upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and thereby given the <hi>Ansa,</hi> or occasion of another <hi>Duel,</hi> between him and me, who both being of no great Strength, might well have given place to others, as fitter <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions</hi> for the Truth, on which side so ever it be. I must therefore acquaint thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> that my <hi>Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> having formerly published a Treatise for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Believers <hi>only,</hi> I presumed to declare my <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> from him, and in my <hi>Preface</hi> to the Answer have expressed the Reasons that obliged me thereunto. And besides my endeavours to refute all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against Infant-baptism, I did more especially detect his failings in the Historical part of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and how extreamly culpable he was in his Collections, and in perverting the sense of Authors, contrary to their intentions: And though some thought it was impossible for him, not to be convinced of the offence he had done <hi>Antiquity,</hi> yet instead thereof, and an ingenuous acknowledgment of his <hi>Aberrations,</hi> he hath attempted to vindicate himself, and by all <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> imaginable to cover or guild over his <hi>Defects;</hi> and for a pretext to hide them, hath as much as in him lies, insinuated a disesteem of my labours, making use of the politick <hi>Engine</hi> of <hi>Repercussion,</hi> retorting and bandying back the charges which I bring against him, with a sufficient Talio, and large requital. Herein much resembling <hi>Verres,</hi> who when <hi>Tully</hi> framed an Oration against him for Thievery, he knew no better
<pb facs="tcp:106704:3"/>
way to discountenance the same, than by accusing <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> a true man, that he was a Thief. But this will prove but a poor <hi>Salvo;</hi> for when the <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> of such a procedure appears, will not his face be covered with redoubled Shame? I am sorry he hath obliged me to consume more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time with him, and am not willing to say any thing that may disturb the tranquillity of his Soul, and that because he is deeply touch'd at what is past; for however he pretends to <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Suffering,</hi> 'tis easy to observe in him the marks of a great <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity</hi> and <hi>Discomposure:</hi> And can any man blame him? since he (as he tells us) had formed his Treatise in a new <hi>Method</hi>
               <note place="margin">Preface to the Reply.</note> for the Benefit of this Age, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently might expect it should have been a Standing-book for the whole Nation, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received without contradiction. But instead thereof, to have the <hi>Mummery</hi> discovered, the <hi>Mask</hi> and <hi>Vizard</hi> pluckt off, to have his darling Child, his first born in this kind, Anatomized, it's unsoundness and rotten parts laid open, and exposed to Shame, Censure, and Loathing, this must needs exasperate a great Spirit. This was such a Provocation, that his fancy hath been more busily imployed in inventing Charges against me, then in clearing himself. He hath mainly improved his Study (in conjunction with what help he could get from the Wits of his Party) to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage my Book, vilify my Person, and to render both odious, and to be suspected. And what a noise doth he make in the Preface, with the remarkable exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of my Curtilations, Misquotations, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translations, Misapplications, when all this while he looks upon what I have written through the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying-glass
<pb facs="tcp:106704:4"/>
of prejudice, taking <hi>Mole-Hills</hi> for <hi>Mountains,</hi> and <hi>Peccadillo's</hi> and little <hi>escapes</hi> for unpardonable <hi>Crimes;</hi> and what is wanting in <hi>Weight,</hi> he makes up in <hi>Number.</hi> Never did any <hi>Momus</hi> more industriously set himself to carp; and some of his Accusations are so trivial, that they may be brought against the exactest Writer living. And yet after all these <hi>Exclamations,</hi> having compared notes with him, and examined Quotations, I find my self little more concerned, then in the mistake of a <hi>Name,</hi> a <hi>Century,</hi> and a passage of <hi>Cassander.</hi> And since my Antagonist hath the confidence to refer matters in debate between us to the Tribunal of the <hi>Reader,</hi> I willingly joyn issue with him, not doubting (if he hath Honesty and Ability to judg) but that he will find me <hi>Innocent,</hi> and this Accuser a <hi>Delinquent.</hi> There is no way to try our metal, but to bring it to the <hi>Touch-stone</hi> of the <hi>Original</hi> Authors, from whom we pretend our Authorities. There are some things in debate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they who understand only their <hi>Mother</hi> tongue, cannot possibly be competent Judges of which side the Truth lieth: some other things are obvious to the unlearned, and they that have read only P. <hi>Perin</hi> in English, and Mr. <hi>Foxes</hi> Book of Martyrs have wondred at Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> errors. In respect of these I have the less need to vindicate my self from some of his charges. And truly if the satisfying some mens importunity, that I would endeavour to disabuse credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Souls, had not been more important than any fear of suffering my reputation by this Satyrist, I should have been altogether silent: For though it be certain, there is nothing so far from Truth, which a craftily compos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed discourse cannot make to appear probable, yet my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate thoughts were, that I might have saved this
<pb facs="tcp:106704:4"/>
labour: Since the Learned are well satisfied of the Truth of what I have written, and the more illiterate that are <hi>Paedobaptists</hi> are not over-forward to believe what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith, and for his own Party, many of them will boast still. <hi>Partiality</hi> and <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> will not suffer them to believe what is said in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to him, and from them I must expect no mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er penalty, then what I suffered for the first Piece, <hi>viz.</hi> to be looked upon with a Squint-Eye, and wounded in reputation. But methinks there should have been so much nobleness in Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> being a Gentleman, and a Christian, as to have forborn his Invectives, and instead thereof, have attacqued some of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for <hi>Pedobaptism,</hi> against which he hath brought no other <hi>Weapons</hi> than what every <hi>Zantippe</hi> can afford, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sword of the Tongue, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of bitter words. But I must expect an <hi>after-clap of Thunder,</hi> for he saith he hath much to reckon with me for mistakes in the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part. I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him rather, first to take off the exceptions I have made against his Historical part of Baptism, which he cannot but be convinc'd of, unless he wink hard. Let him clear his Accounts with me in respect of that, before he enters upon new work; or rather, which is most ingenuous, let him publish a <hi>Retractation</hi> of his Errors, and so desist: for experience at tests the Truth of that Maxim, <hi>Veritas non quaerenda in cristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> Moreover he cannot be ignorant that the Nation hath taken a Surfeit of these Baptismal-Controversies; there is more said already <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> than we are able to speak, and few have patience to read any more, and if we fall to it again, doubtless our Books will prove waste paper. And I must further acquaint Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> that he having treated me with so much rudeness
<pb facs="tcp:106704:5"/>
in what is past, I have little heart to have any more to do with him, (unless I see better cause) and do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by promise him Security, as from me, from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, when-ever he lets fly. There is no Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping I find before an Hot-Oven; and silence is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the best Answer to such as <hi>super-add</hi> Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to their mistakes: For when men are grown so tenacious of an opinion which once they have <hi>espoused,</hi> as never to admit of a <hi>Divorce,</hi> though by conviction they find it <hi>Adulterate,</hi> all disputing is to no purpose: such were anciently condemned, <hi>quos non persuadebis, etiamsi persuaseris.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> be not to be numbred amongst them, I should be glad; For what ever he hath said of my malignity against his person (altogether unknown to me) I here declare before all men the contrary, and that I love him as a Brother, though erring, and had mu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106704:6"/>The first of these he attempts to prove in seven Chapters, and the last is from the Testimonies of learned men in all ages since Christ, witnessing to it. Witnessing to what? Why, to the truth of his first Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Baptism of <hi>Believers</hi> is the [Only] true Baptism: Had he said no more than A true Baptism, he had been safe. And again, in his 7th Chapter of the same Treatise, p. 56. he thus expresseth himself: Not only Scripture, but even Antiquity it self (of which they so much boast) is altogether for <hi>Believers,</hi> and not for Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism: Now whether these sayings of his, compared with that above-mentioned, that he doth not quote the Ancients to prove <hi>That Believers Baptism</hi> is the only Baptism of those Centuries, be not <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and evident contradiction, I will not say Madness; and whether he hath not shamefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquished his <hi>Thesis,</hi> yea whether he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate to free himself from the Charge of Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is submitted to the judgment of the <hi>Reader.</hi> And although it must needs be obvious to every impartial eye, that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is herein found tardy; yet, as one that hath quite forgotten himself, he doth also in the <hi>third</hi> page of his <hi>Reply</hi> tell us, that he hopes it will be acknowledged he doth not prevaricate and pervert the Testimonies in the three first <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,</hi> and that Believers Baptism was the <hi>only</hi> Baptism for near 300 years, flatly gain saying what he hath in the 20th pag. of the same Book, as we have above mentioned. Thus, <hi>Proteus</hi>-like, he often changeth Shapes, and being so wavering and fickle, as we have noted, it is a shrewd Sign he will also faulter in making good what he pretends to as to the 3 first <hi>Centuries;</hi> namely, That he hath not prevaricated or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106704:6"/>
perverted the Testimonies thereunto belonging. Which whether it be so or not, we cannot come to know but by making some Reflections upon the 7th Chapter of his Treatise of Baptism, where he begins with the first <hi>Century,</hi> thus—<hi>The Magdiburgenses in their excellent History do tell us, that as to the subject of Baptism in the first Century, they find they Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Only the Adult or Aged, whether Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> How well Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth excuse himself for adding the word <hi>only,</hi> we shall hereafter see. We are now upon the trial of Prevarication; which is a concealing or letting pass that which ought to have been declared, on purpose to deceive; and this I charge him with: for though the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> do say (what every one knows) that we have Examples of <hi>Adult</hi> persons both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were baptized, but as touching Infants there are no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples recorded, <hi>Exempla annotata non leguntur;</hi> yet they add in the very next line, that <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> affirm, that even in the Apostles days Infants were baptized, &amp; since these Fathers lived in the next <hi>Century</hi> after the <hi>Apostles,</hi> they may very well be thought to understand what the <hi>Apostles</hi> did.</p>
            <p>In the 2d <hi>Century,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> quotes from the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> some of <hi>Justin Martyr's</hi> words in his Apology to <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> where mention is made of Instruction and fasting, and prayer before Baptism, but withal conceals what in the same place the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> tell us, that this was the Method which was used in reference to <hi>Aliens</hi> upon their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Christianity; for these are their words—<hi>Cum qui ad fidem Christianam conversus esset sat instructus &amp;c.</hi> that is, when any one was converted to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, he was sufficiently instructed before Baptism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106704:7"/>In the 3d <hi>Century</hi> he doth egregiously prevaricate in telling us, that the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> say, As to the <hi>Rites</hi> of Baptism they have no Testimony of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for hereby he doth suggest to the Reader, that in this Age as well as in the former there was no Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism owned but that of the <hi>Adult:</hi> whereas,</p>
            <p>1. Those words [as to the Rites of Baptism they have no Testimony of alteration] are his own words, and not the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> who say only this, viz. <hi>Baptizandi ritus in Ecclesiis Asianis observatos hoc seculo, quia omnium ferme Doctorum Asiaticorum scriptis destituimur, commemorare non possumus;</hi> that is, We cannot rehearse the Rites of Baptizing observed in the <hi>Asiatick-Churches,</hi> because we want for the most part the Writings of the <hi>Asiatick</hi> [<hi>Doctors.</hi>]</p>
            <p>2. He silently passeth by what they do expresly say was in use in this Age, namely, that Adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of both sexes, and also Infants, were baptized; <hi>Baptizabantur in utroque sexu, Adulti simul et In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes,</hi> Cent. 3. C. 6. p. 124.</p>
            <p>3. Further: under this head he perverts the Sence of Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> words, and carrys them quite off from the intent and scope of his Discourse, as you may see in his <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> Part 1. c. 8. sect. 5. For what is there spoken from <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> of an express Covenanting before Baptism, is meant of <hi>Adult</hi> Strangers; nor is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> treating there of Baptism, but something else. And at this rate what Author can be secure from the Violence of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations? And if he had thought on it, he might have urged for <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism that of the <hi>Magdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs,</hi> Cent. 3. C. 6. p. 124. where having said as before, That persons of both Sexes, both Aged and Infants, were baptized; the words immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106704:7"/>
are these, <hi>Adultorum autem aliquandiu ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam baptizabantur, fides explorabatur, i. e.</hi> But as touching the <hi>Adult,</hi> they enquired after Faith and Repentance before they were baptized. Thus much for the 3 first Centuries, wherein as you see Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is sufficiently faulty; and yet as if he were most innocent, he doth (in the preface to his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Truth) most confidently address himself to the Reader, and complements him in a high strain, saying, that at his Bar the matter is now brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and him; and all that he asks, is <hi>only</hi> to do themselves and the Truth in question so much right, as to afford the Common Justice of an open ear; that having heard the Recrimination (he means Crimination) they will also attend to what is said for Vindication.</p>
            <p>But the specious <hi>Title</hi> of a Book, or <hi>Daring Preface,</hi> will never blind an intelligent Reader, who will judg of things not by a parcel of confident words, but <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> according as things are alledged and proved.</p>
            <p>In the next place we come to the 4th <hi>Century,</hi> concerning which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith, I make a great <hi>Cry;</hi> though I know no such Vociferation, but only a just Censure made against him, by reason of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of this Age which he hath so much abused.</p>
            <p>For in his Treatise of Baptism in both Editions he thus speaks—In this Age they [the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi>] tell us, That it was the universal practice to Baptize the <hi>Adult</hi> upon Profession of Faith: if he quotes it not to shew that it was the practice to Baptize only the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult,</hi> it is impertinent; but his grand Assertion both in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism</hi> and in his <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 4. That <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism was only practised in the 4th
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106704:8"/>
               <hi>Century,</hi> denotes in what sense we are to understand him. Now for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> thus to father on the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> what they never spake, and also to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert what they did speak, renders him chargeable with Falshood and Prevarication; for,</p>
            <p>1. They say no such thing, that it was the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Practice to baptize only the <hi>Adult</hi> upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith. But of this in its proper place, when we shall make good the Charge of Falshood against him in divers other things as well as this.</p>
            <p>2. They do indeed tell us, That in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Asia</hi> the Baptized were for some time first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and were called <hi>Catechumens;</hi> wherein then lies the prevarication? Why,</p>
            <p>1. Because the Instances there given by the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diburgs</hi> were <hi>Aliens:</hi> For they tell us of some <hi>Jews</hi> (taking it from <hi>Athanasius</hi>) that being newly converted to Christianity, prostrated themselves at the feet of the Bishop, and desired Baptism. <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat de Judeis Berythi Athanasius in lib. de passione Domini, quod ad Episcopi ejus urbis genua advoluti Baptisma petierint, quos ipse cum clericis suis suscipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens per dies multos in doctrina Christianae pietatis, erudierit;</hi> which <hi>Jews,</hi> after they had been for many days instructed in the doctrine of Christian Piety, the said Bishop with his Clarks baptized.</p>
            <p>2. Because a little before in the same Chapter the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> have these words—<hi>Baptizabantur autem aquâ publicè in Templis cujuscunq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sexus aetatis et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis homines;</hi> men of all ages, sexes and conditions were baptized publickly in the Temples, (how could this be by dipping) and lest it should be thought Children were not comprehended under those uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal terms, they say in the same chapter—<hi>De Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106704:8"/>
               <hi>Ecclesiis Nazianzenus loquens Infantes baptizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos esse ait &amp;c. Nazianzen</hi> speaking of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Asia</hi> saith, That Children were to be baptized. And note here by the way, Reader, That because in my Answer I have not gone on with the following words of <hi>Nazianzen, si aliquid immineat periculi,</hi> that is, in case any thing of danger happen, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth in his Preface exclaim against me for curtailing that Father: but the judicious Reader may understand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he quarrels at me without a cause; for my business was to prove, that Infants Baptism was owned in that Century, as to matter of fact, and not to discourse the ground of it, or to enquire in what cases it was done, and therefore he might have spared his frivolous charge about that matter.</p>
            <p>It is truely observed by one of the Anabaptists party, That my Antagonist is so tenacious that he will stand in a thing, although all the World gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it: for though the Baptism of Infants in this 4th <hi>Century,</hi> be so frequently attested by the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> yet he will not receed from his former Position; but hath invented a threefold evidence (as he calls it) to prove, that <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism was only practised in this Age.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the sayings of the Fathers and great men of this <hi>Century,</hi> both in <hi>Africa, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. He begins with the sayings of the <hi>African</hi> Doctors, <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Arnobius,</hi> two of the most eminent of this Age, who (saith he) do positively affirm, That <hi>Teaching, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Desire,</hi> should, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs Commission, preceed Baptism; whereby it appears that no other than <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism was practised in the Churches of <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer, That having searched after the Doctrine of <hi>Athanasius</hi> in the 4th <hi>Century</hi> of the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> I find not any thing of him menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned about Baptism, but only one saying <hi>contra Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anos sermone tertio, viz.</hi> That the Son is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commemorated in Baptism, as if the Father was not sufficient, but because the Son is the Word of God, and the proper Wisdom and Brightness of the Father, with a passage or two more concerning Christ's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Nor is there any word concerning Baptism to be found in <hi>Athanasius</hi> his life, Cent. 4. C. 10. from pag 1027 to 1053, for so far it reacheth. But suppose this Father hath something of that import elsewhere, according as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> reports of him in his Treatise of Baptism, namely, <hi>that our Saviour did not slightly command to baptize; for first of all he said, Teach, and then Baptize, that true faith might come by teaching, and Baptism be perfected by faith.</hi> Will this think you do the business? will this prove that he owned no other Baptism but that of <hi>Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in opposition to that of Infants? No such matter: For, as hath been shewn in our answer, the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it self for Baptism doth not exclude Infants that priviledge, as appears by the consideration of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106704:9"/>
condition of the persons to whom Christ sent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles who were <hi>Aliens;</hi> and of <hi>such</hi> ought we to interpret the sayings of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance before-mentioned from him, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Jews at Berythrum,</hi> who being proselyted to the Faith of Christ craved Baptism of the Bishop, and they were made <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and instructed &amp; fasted 3 days, &amp; baptized by the Bishop. But Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> in his Just Vindication, examining a book called a <hi>Well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treatise &amp;c.</hi> takes notice of this very passage mentioned by Mr. <hi>D.</hi> from whom I suppose he therefore had it. And page 219, 220. Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> demonstrates that <hi>Athanasius's</hi> words are wrested to another sense than the scope of his Discourse tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and some words left out which served to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his meaning, and other words so palpably mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translated, that the Reader is grosly abused thereby as well as the Author.</p>
            <p>The next is <hi>Arnobius</hi> upon the 146 Psal. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strange to me that when Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> had reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Origen</hi> upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> as spurious, though <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> only tells us, it was not faithfully translated by <hi>Ruffinus;</hi> he should quote <hi>Arnobius</hi> upon the <hi>Psalms</hi> for his own opinion, which is altogether spurious; being (as <hi>Perkins</hi> saith) of a far more modern forge. It seems it is lawful for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to quote spurious Authors, though not for the Pedobaptists. But I hope the judicious Reader will hereby be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that this testimony doth not prove his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That no other than the Adult-Baptism was practised in the Churches of Africa in the 4th Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He also adds a saying of <hi>Optatus Milevit. out of</hi> the <hi>Magdiburgs, Cent</hi> 4. p. 237. Namely, that none deny but that every man by nature, though born of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106704:10"/>
Parents, is unclean, and that without the Spirit he is not cleansed; and that there is a necessity of the Spirit's cleansing before Baptism; so that the house must be trimmed and fitted for the Lord, that he may enter in and dwell in it. But this Authority sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies as little as the other: for suppose this passage rightly translated, as it is not, yet the quotation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry insignificant to prove that for which he brings it, <hi>viz.</hi> that no other than Adult-Baptism was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> in the 4th Cent. for <hi>Optatus</hi> presently adds, <hi>Hoc exorcismus operatur,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcism doth this; which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> knows an Infant as capable of as the Adult, and which was equally practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on both; and therefore he did discreetly to leave it out, but how honestly, is left to the Reader to judg, and to his own Conscience. But indeed the whole sentence is miserably mistranslated, as all Scholars may see by the Latin which runs thus:</p>
            <p>[<hi>Neminem fugit quod omnis homo qui nascitur quamvis de parentibus Christianis nascatur, sine spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu mundi esse non possit, quem necesse sit ante salutare lavacrum ab homine excludi &amp; separari. Hoc exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismus operatur, per quem spiritus immundus depellitur &amp; in loca deserta fugatur. Fit domus vacua in pectore credentis, fit domus munda, intrat Deus &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitat, Apostolo dicente, Vos estis Templum Dei, et in Vobis Deus habitat.</hi>] Another by this true translation <hi>viz.</hi> [Every one knows that every man that is born, though of Christian Parents, cannot be without the Spirit of the world (the unclean spirit he means) which ought to be cast out and separated from a man before Baptism. This Exorcism doth, by which the unclean spirit is driven away and flys into desert places. The house is made empty in the breast of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106704:10"/>
Believer, the house is made clean, God enters and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits there according to the Apostle, Ye are the Temple of God, and in you he dwells.] And is it not strange that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> who in his Preface charges me with the notorious abuse of Authors in curtilations and mistranslations, should be thus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously guilty of both himself? <hi>Qui alterum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusat moechum, seipsum intueri oportet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thus having travelled through <hi>Africa,</hi> we shall now set footing in <hi>Asia,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would have us believe, That it was the Faith and practice of the Churches, to baptize the <hi>Adult,</hi> in opposition to that of <hi>Infants.</hi> And this he saith appears by the like sayings of <hi>Bazil, Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen, Ephrim Syrus, Epiphanius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> thou must know that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> cuts out work for me that I am not concerned to take notice of; for my Business was to answer his first Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Baptism, and these two last men are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned, but brought in since, as Auxiliary forces: nevertheless I shall not wave them.</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>Bazil,</hi> the passage which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> quotes from him and inserts in both his Tratises of Baptism is this, <hi>viz. Must the faithful be Sealed with Baptism; Faith must needs preceed and goe before. Contra Eunomium.</hi> In answer to which, 1. I deny that any such Sentence is to be found in <hi>Bazil,</hi> for I have perused all that he saith in reference to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in his 3 Tomes, nor have the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> any such saying of his where they repeat his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and sayings, <hi>Contra Eunomium;</hi> they mention only this against <hi>Eunomius,</hi> That <hi>Baptismus est Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillum fidei,</hi> Baptism is the Seal of faith, Cent. 4. C. 4. p. 234.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106704:11"/>2. There is a great absurdity in the words, as they are placed by Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> For the Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, Must the Faithful be Sealed with Baptism? and the Answer is, Faith must needs preceed and go before; and how absurd is it? for it supposeth that the faithful could be without Faith. But what can be said to that which is further urged from <hi>Bazil? That none were to be baptized but the Catechumens, and those that were duly instructed in the Faith.</hi> I answer, that those words are not to be found <hi>in terminis</hi> in any part of his discourse about Baptism: But do not the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> say thus, <hi>Bazilius ait non alios quam Catechumenos baptizatos esse; Bazil</hi> saith none but the <hi>Catechumens</hi> were to be baptized? But when I tell Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that <hi>Cyprian</hi> held Infants Baptism an Apostolical Tradition, as the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> inform us, he replyes, <hi>That is just as much as if Mr. Wills should so affirm except some Authentick authority be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the same, pag.</hi> 91. of his <hi>Innocency</hi> &amp;c. And may not I be bold to assume the same freedom, and retort, that if we cannot find the afore-mentioned words in <hi>Bazil,</hi> though the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> tell us so, 'tis just as much as if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should so affirm. But suppose <hi>Bazil</hi> had said it, what will it amount to? surely no convincing Testimony: since whether the <hi>non alii quam Catechumeni,</hi> No other than the <hi>Catechumens</hi> doth exclude the Infants of Believers from Baptism, we are yet to seek; For that passage may very well be interpreted that no <hi>Pagans</hi> were baptized till first they were made <hi>Catechumens</hi> or instructed; so that it is left to the Reader to judg whether from that speech of <hi>Bazil</hi> (if it were his) it may groundedly be concluded, he was against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Baptism, which that he was not, I shall give you Reasons shortly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106704:11"/>The next is <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> who was very positive and express for Childrens Baptism, as shall be demonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when we come to discover the weakness of our Antagonists Cavils against it.</p>
            <p>The third man is <hi>Ephrim Syrus,</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> whom the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> so much blame for ascribing such wonders to the Cross, that (if you will believe him) the Devil flys and is not able to stand before it, as the other said of Baptism (strange Anabaptists as ever the world heard of!) This <hi>Ephrim</hi> termed the Cross <hi>Daemonum expultrix, et Paradisi reseratrix;</hi> That which routs Devils, and opens Heavens-gate, and therefore adviseth all Christians to cross themselves in divers places of their Bodies, which will notably fortify and preserve them from the Devil. <hi>Madg.</hi> Cent. 4. C. 4. p. 302. This is a Witness that seems to be spit out of the Popes mouth, for he is for praying to the Martyrs and Saints departed, and helps us to some pretty little forms, As, <hi>pro nobis mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris peccatoribus interpellate;</hi> pray for us miserable Sinners. And, <hi>O gloriosissimi martyres Dei me miserum vestris juvate precibus;</hi> O ye most glorious Martyrs of God help me a miserable Wretch with your prayers. But it may be said what of all this, he may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his superstition be an Authentick Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what was in his day as to Matter of Fact: It may be so: What then is his Testmony as to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism? why, this: Those who were to be baptized did profess their Faith before many witnesses, &amp; renounce the Devil and all his works, &amp;c. as it is in the <hi>Church-Catechism.</hi> And <hi>Ambrose</hi> that was so much for Infants-Baptism, and lived in the same Century with <hi>Ephrim,</hi> speaks his very words, as the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> inform us from his <hi>3d Book of the Sacraments.</hi> Chap. 2.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106704:12"/>
               <hi>Confessos baptizandos scribit &amp;c. Ambrose</hi> writes there, That those who confest were to be baptized, where he recites, how that the Baptized declared, he renounced the Devil and all his works; and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the same place tells us, that in his 84 Epistle of his 10th book of Epistles, he is for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, Cent. 4. p. 239. which clearly makes this quotation of <hi>Ephrims</hi> very insignificant as to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; because he might say that, and yet be for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism as <hi>Ambrose</hi> was. But Mr. <hi>D.</hi> quotes his 3d Orat. of Baptism for this passage; which I presume is a Manuscript, as not being to be found among his printed Works. And if so, I hope Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will discover himself such a friend to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Learning, as to bless the world with its publication. But I am afraid at last it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is every whit as guilty in mistaking <hi>Nazianzens</hi> 3 Orations of Baptism for <hi>Ephrims</hi> book <hi>de Paenitentiâ Cap.</hi> 5. as I was for mistaking <hi>Bazil</hi> for <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> And it is as much a making an Authority.</p>
            <p>3. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> tells us, <hi>it was the Universal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Western</hi> or <hi>European Churches, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from Hilary, Ambrose, Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Marius-Victorinus,</hi> to which I reply more generally.</p>
            <p>1. That in this he doth designedly go about to delude the <hi>Reader,</hi> for these four <hi>Ancients</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries, and flourished in the 4th <hi>Century;</hi> And they are all put together by the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> in one <hi>chapter,</hi> where they give us their saying from their several works. One of them speaks of Baptism upon profession, and there is no sentence quoted from him in reference to Infants, whereas they give the words of all the rest of these Fathers concerning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106704:12"/>
profession before Baptism, and withal divers pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the same men asserting Infants-Baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being so, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can never be excused for his Partiality and Falshood, in saying as he doth, That it was the Universal practice of the Western Churches to baptize the Adult, that is, <hi>only</hi> such, which is the point <hi>prae manibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. particularly. 1. For <hi>Hilary,</hi> he doth very ill in saying as he doth expresly, Treatise of <hi>Baptism, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> 1. That all the Western-Churches did only baptize the <hi>Adult,</hi> quoting <hi>Hilary lib:</hi> 2. <hi>de Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;</hi> whereas <hi>Hilary</hi> hath no such saying there, but is for Infants Baptism, as appears in his 2d <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Austin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Ambrose,</hi> he is large for it in his <hi>2d. Book of Abraham, Chap.</hi> 12. which the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> have amply set down, Cent. 4. C. 5: p. 239. and in the same Chapter <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is mentioned for it, whom we shall suddenly vindicate, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that he was absolutely of our side, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the frivilous distinction whereby Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> would render him otherwise.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Marius Victorinus</hi> speaks nothing about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>But lastly, as for <hi>Jerom,</hi> the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> give his Testimony for Infants Baptism in words at length, and not in figures, Cent. 4. C. 5. p. 239. <hi>Hieronimus quoque lib. 3tio Dialogorum adversus Pelagianos Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobulo sic scribit: Jerom</hi> also (having spoken of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> just before) in his <hi>3d Book</hi> of <hi>Dialogues</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> writes thus to <hi>Critob.</hi> Tell me, I pray, and resolve the question, why are Infants baptized? <hi>Attic.</hi> That their sins may be done away in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism. <hi>Critob.</hi> But what sin have they commited?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106704:13"/>
is any one loosed that is not bound? <hi>Attic.</hi> Dost thou ask me the question? The Evangelical Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet or Dr. of the Gentiles, that Vessel that shineth throughout all the world will answer thee—<hi>Death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them that have not sinned after the manner of Adams transgression, which is the figure of him to come:</hi> But all men are guilty either in respect of themselves, or <hi>Adam; Qui parvulus est parentis in Baptismo vinculo solvitur:</hi> he that is a Child, is freed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism from the Bond of his Parent [that is, Original Sin, or guilt contracted from them].</p>
            <p>2. His second Medium or Argument, to prove that <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism was only practised in the 4th <hi>Century,</hi> is <hi>the Positive Decrees of the 3 eminent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> of this Age, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Garthaginian, Laodicean,</hi> and <hi>Neocesarean;</hi> which, he saith, do positively decree <hi>that Teaching, Confession, Faith, and Free-choice ought to preceed Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We omit speaking to these Councils for the present, intending to do it in a more convenient place.</p>
            <p>3d Argument that <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism was the <hi>only approved</hi> Baptism of this Age, is, his Ten remarkable Instances in this <hi>Century,</hi> that were not baptized, though the Children of Christian Parents, till they were able to make profession of Faith, <hi>viz Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Basil, Gregory, Nazianzen, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Jerom, Austin, Nectarius, Valentinian, and Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> (and others of his party, as I hear) triumphs over me, because in my Answer I speak not to every one of these, and besides I am up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by him for excepting only against 4 of the Ten Testimonies of the Fathers, <hi>viz Athanasius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106704:13"/>
               <hi>Ambrose, and Nazianzen,</hi> who, as I told him in my answer, were for Infants Baptism.</p>
            <p>To which he Replys;</p>
            <p>1. That if but four of the Ten be excepted against, then he hath six more stands good, besides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (<hi>viz.</hi> 15 not excepted against as perverted). But really I have endeavoured to understand his Account, but cannot: and therefore either he is very confused, or I am very dull.</p>
            <p>2. The four that I lay claim to, <hi>viz. Athanasius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil, Ambrose, Nazianzen,</hi> he will not grant me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he saith, full in their Testimonies for <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism; He begins with <hi>Bazil's</hi> saying, That Faith must preceed Baptism. To this I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that notwithstanding this he might be as much for Infants-Baptism, as <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who spake the same words; and moreover, I shall now give you some Reasons from whence we may conclude, That <hi>Bazil</hi> was for Infants-Baptism.</p>
            <p>1. Because two of the most eminent Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his contemporaries, were for it, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Nazianz.</hi> appears in his Oration in <hi>Sanctum lavacrum, Madg. Cent.</hi> 4. C. 6. p. 417. likewise <hi>Chrysostom in his Homilies ad Neophytos,</hi> besides those eminent Latin Fathers, as <hi>Ambrose, Jerom,</hi> and others that were such zealous Assertors of Infants-Baptism who lived in the same Age with <hi>Bazil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because in all the three Tomes of <hi>Bazil,</hi> there is not one word to be found against Infants-Baptism (though he be very large in his discourses about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism) and certainly he would have said something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, had he deem'd it an errour, for as much as it was practised not only in the Age wherein he lived, but in the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> where he was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106704:14"/>
Bishop. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaking of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> saith, Infants were to be baptized. <hi>Mag. Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 6. p. 461.</p>
            <p>Because <hi>Nazianzen</hi> his most intimate friend and fellow-student was for Infants-Baptism. The <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diburgs</hi> say there was so great an endearedness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Fathers, that they had as it were but one Soul. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> is called <hi>animae Bazilii dimidium,</hi> the half of <hi>Bazils</hi> Soul, if in them both, say the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> there was not <hi>Una prorsus atque eadem anima.</hi> They further tell us that from the time of their first acquaintance there was such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctio animorum et Studiorum,</hi> such a conjunction of spirits and studies that they continued in most entire friendship ever after. <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. C. 10. p. 939, 940.</p>
            <p>4. We do not find that in any of their Epistolary Entercourses, any thing that may argue them to be of different judgments in this point; hence I suppose it may be rationally concluded, that as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was for Baptism after preparation and confession, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns those that enter upon it rashly, <hi>Magd. Cent.</hi> 4. C. 6. p. 417. And yet in the fore-going page tells us, the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> owned Infants-Baptism in case of danger, and declares his own judgment <hi>absolutely</hi> for it, without respect to danger. <hi>Orat. quarta ad Baptismum,</hi> as you shall hear more anon; so might also <hi>Bazil</hi> be notwithstanding he hath any-where said, Faith should preceed, or go before Baptism.</p>
            <p>5. Tis no wonder we read not of <hi>Bazils</hi> insisting upon Infants-Baptism, for such was the Errour, and superstition of those times wherein he preached, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing such Virtue to Baptism to do away the guilt of Sin, that they would delay the taking up that Ordinance, till they thought they should dye, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106704:14"/>
so they might depart with pure Souls; so that, as far as I can find, <hi>Bazil</hi> had much ado to perswade his Hearers to be baptized, and spends abundance of his pains in quickening them to take up Baptism, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out longer delay: as appears in his Exhortation to Baptism, where he doth most sharply inveigh against procrastinating the same. If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would but weigh these things without prejudice, I doubt not but 'twould abate much of his Confidence that <hi>Bazil</hi> is on his side.</p>
            <p>Nor will he allow me <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him we shall speak in another place.</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Ambrose</hi> he saith, that he is full also, <hi>That the Baptized should not only make profession but desire the same.</hi> But then (as conscious of prevarication) he adds, that if any of them should contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to say, they would contradict themselves and the practice of the Age: But this is meer shuffling. Since the practice of the Age, as to profession, had respect to Pagans as we have often told him, and in this sence we are to understand <hi>Ambrose;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in my Infants-Baptism Asserted, I prove <hi>Ambrose</hi> was for us from those words of his <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. C.</hi> 12. being these—Because every Age is obnoxious to Sin, therefore every Age is fit for the Sacrament; to this he replys, that this is no proof that he was for Infants Baptism. First, because Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is hereby meant. Secondly, if Baptism, then those of every Age that are fit for that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must not be supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> those that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to confess Faith, and desire Baptism, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not only Children but all good and bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obnoxious to Sin are to be esteemed fit subjects for Baptism. Neither will this Evasion serve Mr.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106704:15"/>
               <hi>Danvers</hi> turn to put by this our Testimony; and I wonder, he should labour thus to darken Truth, and delude the <hi>Reader;</hi> for 'tis true, those words before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned were spoken of Circumcision, but he knows it was by way of introduction to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Infants; and therefore that he may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the <hi>Reader,</hi> I will give the whole Sentence of <hi>Ambrose</hi> from the <hi>Magdiburgs, Cent.</hi> 4. C. 5. p. 240. The Law commands the Males to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised when newly born, and as soon as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to cry; because as Circumcision was from Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, so was the disease [Sin]: no time ought to be void of a Remedy, because no time is void of Sin—Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the old man that is a Proselyte, nor the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Infant is excepted; then comes in those words, Because every age is subject to Sin, every age is fit for the Sacrament; and the very next words are these, <hi>eadem ratione Baptismum asserit Pervulorum, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Epistolarum, Epistola</hi> 84. that is, by the same reason he asserts Infants-Baptism in the eighty fourth of his 10th Book of Epistles. Whether now Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath not weakly opposed and dealt sophistically with this Quotation of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and whether it be not a pitiful shift in him to say, the being fit for the Sacrament of which <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks, must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be meant of those only who are capable to confess Faith, is submitted to the judgment of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>Reader.</hi> As for what he objects that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age be fit for the Sacrament, in regard every age is obnoxious to sin, then Infidels are fit subjects of Baptism: I answer that the foregoing words of <hi>Ambrose, viz.</hi> Neither the Old man that is a profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte, nor the New-born Infant is excepted, shew, that he speaks of those who are within the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106704:15"/>The last man that we bring for Infants-Baptism, and excepted against by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> and 'tis observable, that he confesseth what we urge from him hath most in it: It seems then I was mistaken, for I thought what we bring from <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Ambrose,</hi> had altogether as much in it, as what is re-urg'd from <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> The words quoted from this Father are out of his 40 oration, <hi>viz.</hi> Hast thou a Child? let it be early consecrated <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from its Infancy. To which he replyes, that I impose a fallacy upon the Reader, for translating the greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Infants, thereby concluding him <hi>absolutely</hi> for Infants-Baptism, and that because, saith he, the word signifies a <hi>State</hi> of Childhood, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. And therefore <hi>Nazianzen</hi> must be understood by his early <hi>consecration</hi> to mean, not in the Cradle, but as he explains himself, so soon as they are able to understand Mysteries, except in case of death: and when I pray according to <hi>Nazianzen</hi> were they capacitated for the understanding My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries? the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> inform us from his 3d <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it was about the age of three years: <hi>Extra periculum, triennium aut eo plus minusve expectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum esse censet, Cent.</hi> 4. C. 6. p. 416. that is, if there be no danger of Death, his judgment was, they should stay till they are about 3 years old or something less, and so be baptized; nevertheless, say they, in some other place of that Oration <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> declares, <hi>omni aetati Baptisma convenire,</hi> That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is fit for every age, comporting herein with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> as before: But whether I or Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a fallacy, let the Reader judg by what follows.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was for baptizing Children in case of danger, though as young as the Children of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106704:16"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> that were circumcised the 8th day, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the reason which he gives for their Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> It is better to be Sanctified (by which he means baptized) without knowledg, than to die without it; for, saith he, it happened to the circumcised Babes of <hi>Israel,</hi> upon which <hi>Vossius</hi> hath this note, in his <hi>Thesis</hi> of Baptism, <hi>Non igitur Nazianzenus &amp;c.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen was not against Infants-Baptism, and his judgment will be taken as soon as most mens.</p>
            <p>2. Though [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] should be taken for a state of Childhood, yet in that place of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not to be taken so largely (that is, Children of some understanding,) as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, because of the instance of Circumcision given by the Father.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> being a Greek-Father, intends the word according to its proper signification, and as it is generally taken in the New-Testament as well as in prophane Authors, and that is a <hi>state</hi> of Infancy; for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies an Infant, saith Mr. <hi>Leigh, Crit. Sac.</hi> and is properly spoken <hi>de partu recens edito,</hi> of a Child newly born, quoting <hi>Beza</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15. who saith, the word properly is taken for <hi>Infantes teneri nimirum, &amp; adhuc ab uberibus pendentes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuli,</hi> (i. e.) Sucking Babes, such as are carried in arms. The same word is given to Christ, when the Wise-men found him in swadling-clouts, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 12. And we have it again for a new-born Babe, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new-borne Babes desire the sincere Milk of the word &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath not done with <hi>Nazianzen</hi> yet, and therefore frames an Objection for us and answers it himself thus. It is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106704:16"/>
that in case of death, he would have an Infant baptized? To which he answers, It is true, but that was not <hi>quà Infant,</hi> but as a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing person.</p>
            <p>We see by this acute distinction that our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist is not only a Critick, but that he hath some Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick too, in which he saith he owneth little skill; but that little, I suppose, is in that part which they call Sophistry, or the abuse of Logick. But that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this distinction may appear, consider,</p>
            <p>1. That it is true <hi>Nazianzen</hi> would not have an Infant baptized <hi>quà Infant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is untrue, that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> would have an Infant baptized <hi>quà</hi> a dying person; for if they were to be baptized under either of these Considerations, then had he been for the baptizing all Infants, and dying persons promiscuously.</p>
            <p>3. But <hi>Nazianzens</hi> judgment was to have them baptized because they were the Children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in iminent danger of death; They were such as were capacitated for that Ordinance on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God's Covenant; else why doth he speak of circumcising Children in the very place which is now under debate; <hi>Melius est enim nondum rationis compotes sanctificari quam non Signatos et initiatos vitâ excedere,</hi> Nazianz. Orat. 40. It is better, saith he, they should be consecrated without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, than to die without the Seal, and not be initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, <hi>idque nobis designat octavum diem circumcisio illa, itaque fuit figurale signaculum ac propter irrationales introducta:</hi> For so it happened to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Babes of <hi>Israel.</hi> But let the account be what it will upon which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> would have Children baptized, it is not material; since he owned
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106704:17"/>
their Baptism in some case, which is sufficient, if we had no more to overthrow Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Position, <hi>That the Baptism of Adult persons was the only Baptism owned in this Age; and it is</hi> excentrical to the question to talk of the Consideration on which they were baptized</p>
            <p>But to give Mr. <hi>D'anvers</hi> full measure, pressed down, and running over, we shall acquaint him with some other place of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> where he is for the Baptizing Children absolutely without respect to dying state, and that is in his 4th Oration, p. 648. <hi>Edit. Lutetiae Par.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. 1. It belongeth to all degrees of Ages, to all Kinds and Manners of Life. Wherefore it should be carried through all: Art thou a young-Man? Then 'tis of use against the turbulent motions of the soul: So he speaks of its conveniency for old Age. Then he comes to Infants, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Hast thou an Infant? let him be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> [baptized] <hi>from his Infancy, let him be dedicated to the Spirit, lest wickedness should take occasion, &amp;c.</hi> And then he concludes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Art thou afraid of the Seal (Mr. <hi>D'anvers</hi> will not have Baptism to be a Seal) because of the tenderness of his nature? <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Thou art a pusillanimous Mother, and of a weak Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for that jeer with which he concludes, that we may as well bring <hi>Protogenes</hi> for an Authority, that pretended to Baptize Children in this Age to cure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106704:17"/>
Diseases, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> to save their Souls; I shall retort what I find in his Friend <hi>Haggar,</hi> in his Book called <hi>The foundation of the Font discover'd,</hi> pag. 94. <q>Where he thus speaks I can boldly say with a good conscience, in the presence of God to his Glory, I have known many weak and sickly before, that have recovered health and strength afterwards (that is, after being dipt) and some immediately in a few days, yea and that when they have been so ill, that all Doctors have given them over.</q> A good encouragement to proselyte credulous souls to their way, and to augment their Churches apace; for if Dipping prove usually so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal and succesful, even in desperate cases, it will undoubtedly impair, if not render altogether useless, the Practice of Physick. But whether this story of <hi>Haggar</hi> be not as fabulous as that of <hi>Protogenes,</hi> I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in the next place comes to the Decrees of the three Councils, to prove that it was the universal practice of this Age to Baptize upon the profession of Faith.</p>
            <p>To which I gave this Answer: 1st, That we have ten-times three for Infants-Baptism, and if we must go by number of Councils, we shall carry it.</p>
            <p>2. I told him that the 3 Councils, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for <hi>Adult</hi> Baptism, had respect only to <hi>Pagans;</hi> To which he gives this answer, <hi>It is granted I think (as I have made it ready to his hand) he may quote the Canons of thirty Councils for Infants-Baptism in the following Ages (and a stout Argument no doubt for it): But what are such Decrees saith he to this 4th Century, which are for Believers-Baptism on professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and free choice, and 'tis impossible to produce one for</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106704:18"/>
               <hi>Infants-Baptism till after this Century.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I reply: 1st, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> boasts too much in saying he made the 30 Councils ready to my hand for Infants-Baptism; and he is too vain-glorious to confess who made them ready to his hand; but, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disparagement to his reading, I think verily 'twas <hi>Baronius</hi> or <hi>Vossius,</hi> or some other. 2dly, He confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that we have 30 Councils for Infants-Baptism; what then is become of his stout Assertion in his Treatise of Baptism? <hi>Chapt.</hi> 7. p. 56. That not only Scripture but Antiquity it self, which (saith he) hath been so much boasted of, is altogether for <hi>Believers</hi> and not for Infants-Baptism. 3dly, Let it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noted, that we can produce 30 for it, and he not one against it; but he tells us 'tis impossible for us to produce one for Infants-Baptism till after the <hi>4th Century.</hi> But 4thly, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath forgotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for we have an <hi>African Council</hi> about an Age before his three Councils, consisting of 66 Bishops (where <hi>Cyprian</hi> was present that flourished in the year 250) who determined, that Children might &amp; ought to be baptized, before the eight day. <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. Cap. 9. p. 205. <hi>Synodus Africana de infantibus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizandis,</hi> and to which <hi>Synod Jerom</hi> refers for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of Infants-baptism, mentioning <hi>Cyprians</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Fidus,</hi> as the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> have it, <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. c. 5. p. 239. nor is that to be slighted which <hi>Austin</hi> speaks concerning this <hi>Synod, Cyprianus non novum aliquod decretum condens, sed Ecclesiae fidem firmissimam servans &amp;c. Cyprian</hi> was not devising any new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but followed the most sure Faith of the Church, <hi>Aug.</hi> Epist. 28. <hi>ad Hieronimum.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>But if Infant-Baptism was owned in the 4th <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106704:18"/>
why is it not mentioned in any of those three Eminent <hi>Councils</hi> which were then held, the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> the <hi>Laodicean,</hi> and <hi>Neocesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean?</hi> They speak not a word of it, but posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively decree that <hi>Teaching, Confession, Faith</hi> and free choice, ought to preceed Baptism.</q>
            <p>I answer, That as it is certain that almost all the <hi>Canons</hi> of those <hi>Councils</hi> are taken up about Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and have hardly any thing of Doctrine in them; so it is to be observed that Councils do not mention all things controverted in one Age, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are concerned in resolving the doubts which troubled the Church when such Councils were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened; since therefore there is no <hi>Canon</hi> in those three Councils before-specified for Infants-Baptism, it may well be thought the reason was, because in those dayes none did scruple it; which we may the rather believe because it was in practice before those <hi>Councils</hi> and in the same <hi>Century</hi> also, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fully shewn. But since Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> glories so much in these <hi>Councils,</hi> and prefers them before all those many ones that follow after, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss to examin what they are that he stands so much upon; for certainly if we must give them the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, it must be upon account of their purity, whereas truly we shall find if they are not altogether as corrupt as those that follow, yet certainly in some things as gross for Error and Superstition, as the Popish Councils themselves.</p>
            <p>The 4th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Synodus 4tae Carthaginensis</hi> Cent. 4. cap. 9. pag. 873.</note> is that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> intends, and it is the 85th Article, <hi>Those who are to be baptized, must give in their Names,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106704:19"/>
               <hi>and Abstain for a long time from Wine and flesh, and after often examination may receive Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 7 and 90 <hi>Canons</hi> owneth <hi>Exorcism,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring out the Devil. Though, if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is to be believed, <hi>Exorcism</hi> was added to the former fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy customs in the 9 <hi>Cent.</hi> as he tells us in his 2d Ed. p. 11, 7. The 74, 75, 76, <hi>Canons are for Penance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also the 76 <hi>Canon</hi> is for pouring in the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi> into mens mouths that are upon the point of dying. But notwithstanding Mr. <hi>D's.</hi> confidence, it is very clear that that 85 <hi>Canon</hi> was not intended by the Council to exclude Infants from Baptism, because <hi>Augustin,</hi> who was (as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tells us 2d Ed. p. 108) a great Patron and Defender of Infants-Baptism, subscribed all the Decrees of this Council: So that only the <hi>Adult</hi> are herein intended.</p>
            <p>Next for that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> The<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laodicens. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium</hi> Cent. 4. cap. 9. p. 833.</note> 2d <hi>Canon</hi> is for <hi>Penance</hi> according to the quality of the Sin. The 26th owneth <hi>Exorcism,</hi> the 48th for Anointing with Oyle after Baptism; the 59th contains the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture, and rejects the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and what then will become of Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's Theopolis,</hi> or discourse made upon some part of it, which is in print?</p>
            <p>But what doth this Council say against Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism? why, that the Baptized should rehearse the Articles of the Creed (2 Ed. p. 59) but do they say that none must be Baptized but such? and why may not this intend only the <hi>Adult</hi> as well as that above? let Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> render a satisfactory reason against it if he can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Synodus Neocaesariensis,</hi> Lastly the <hi>Neocaesarean Council,</hi> upon which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> lays so much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106704:19"/>
Stress, determines in the 6th <hi>Canon,</hi> that a Woman with Child might be baptized; Because the Baptism reached not her Womb, for in the Confession made in Baptism each ones free choice is shewed; hence Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> concludes against Infants-Baptism. To this I answered in my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism Asserted &amp;c.</hi> That the <hi>Canon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected <hi>Pagans,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> notes from <hi>Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the <hi>Glossator,</hi> who saith, Such Women as went with Child, and come from the Infidels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what is this to the Question which is about Children born in the Church, of Believing Parents? and <hi>Balsamon</hi> himself upon this <hi>Canon,</hi> saith with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to these, they may be said to answer by such as undertake for them. But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> out of self-Opinion that he is still right in his Baptismal notions, and that no Gloss can be good that thwarts with him, rejects it, and tells us we do miss the Case. But what thinks he of <hi>Dr. Hammon:</hi> he may be thought to hit the case as likely as Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> The said <hi>Dr.</hi> speaking of this <hi>Cannon</hi> brought against the Baptizing the Children of Christians, saith, Is it far enough from it, for as for the words of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the <hi>Canon: Each ones will or resolution,</hi> which is <hi>professed or signified in the Confession, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> (for so he words it in his translation of the Greek) it imports no more than that the Confession or) Profession of a Woman that being with Child is baptized, doth only belong to her self, not to the Child, and consequently that her Baptism belongs only to her self; [so as the Child cannot be said to be baptized because the Parent is]. And all, saith he, that can be concluded from hence, is, that the Child of such a Parent that was baptized when that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106704:20"/>
was in her Womb, must when it is born have a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism for it self, and the Baptism of the Parent not be thought to belong to it. And this, as he observes, in opposition to the Conceit of the <hi>Jewish Rabbies,</hi> who say, <hi>si gravida fiat proselyta, adeo<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> lavacro susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatur, proli ejus Baptismo opus non est;</hi> that is, <hi>if a Woman great with Child become a proselyte, and be baptized, her Child needs not Baptism.</hi> But if this will not satisfie Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> I must tell him that the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> do question (If I understand them aright) whether that Council ever made this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. <hi>Canon Concilii Neocaesariensis (si unquam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it) permittit, &amp;c.</hi> And certainly those Excellent Historians (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> calls them) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have put such an If to it, if they had wanted ground for so doing. And Mr. <hi>D.</hi> cannot be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how usual it hath been, to have <hi>Canons</hi> foisted in by others that were never thought one by the Councils themselves. Nay, I think I have more reason to deny the very <hi>Being</hi> of this Council, than Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath that of <hi>Cyprians</hi> 66 Bishops. For neither <hi>Eusebius,</hi> nor <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Theodoret,</hi> nor <hi>Sozomen,</hi> nor <hi>Evagrius,</hi> those ancient Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Historians, make any mention of it, that I can find; nor our modern Collector of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, <hi>Sympson:</hi> but however suppose there was such a Council, and that they made such a Canon, just as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> words it; There is nothing positive against Infant-Baptism, (which certainly there would have been, had their Judgments been against it): And Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> only gathers it by <hi>Consequence,</hi> because they say, <hi>that Confession and free-choice was necessary to Baptism.</hi> But this is not sufficient; For Our Saviour tells us, <hi>That he that Believes not shall</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106704:20"/>
               <hi>be damned;</hi> which is as much against the Salvation of Infants, as these words of the Council against their Baptism. And yet Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will not deny but that some Infants are saved. And why may not the other expression be as well taken in a limited sense? But suppose not; Mr. <hi>D.</hi> must remember that he tells us in his second Ed. p. 65 That <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>That none without due Examination, both as to Doctrine and Conversation, ought to be admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi> And yet <hi>Austin</hi> was for the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And why may not this Council be supposed to be as inconsiderate? Certainly they were corrupt eonugh in Mr. <hi>D's.</hi> Judgment, to take up such an Antichristian error (as he is pleased to call it.) For the <hi>1st. Canon</hi> is against Ministers Marriage. The <hi>2d.</hi> is for <hi>Penance.</hi> The <hi>3d.</hi> against often <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,</hi> and <hi>Penance</hi> for the same, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have tried Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his strength, and let the <hi>Reader</hi> Judg upon the whole, whether he hath any ground to conclude himself free from <hi>Prevarication</hi> both in <hi>Councils</hi> as well as <hi>Fathers:</hi> For after all this Clutter, and great noise of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> he hath not produced so much as one man that denyed, and condemned the practice of Infants-Baptism, nor one <hi>Canon</hi> that ever was discharged against it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in regard I except only against four of those eminent Men before-mentioned, as not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized till Aged, though born of Christian Parents (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will have it) and they are, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine, Nazianzen, Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>Austine,</hi> he therfore triumphs, and saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath six other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perverted Authorities unexcepted against, who were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106704:21"/>
not baptized till they could make confession of Faith, which he conceives, is a substantial argument, that Believers Baptism was the Baptism generally owned in this Age.</p>
            <p>To this I answer. 1 That for to say Believers Baptism was generally owned in this Age, comes short of his former Assertion, that it was the only Baptism owned; 2. And that it was generally owned because of those six mens not being baptized till aged, is a <hi>non-sequitur;</hi> and the quite contrary may be much more rationally argued: for, if upon his inquisition through <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> [that is, all the world where Christianity was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed] he can find but six persons born of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Parents remaining unbaptized, till they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a profession of their Faith, will it not follow, that the Baptizing of Believers Children in their Infancy, was generally owned in that Age? especially if we consider, upon what suspicious grounds Baptism was retarded in those days; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the very point of dissolution, concerning which we have spoken before. But I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> about the grounds, why the Baptism of all those <hi>ten</hi> was delayed, since neither of us, without great presumption, can absolutely determine; and unless we are instructed by a sure light, from the records of Antiquity, when all is said that we can say, we shall but impose upon the <hi>Reader</hi> our uncertain guesses. But having a good foundation in <hi>History</hi> for what I have formerly said, concerning <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Austine</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized till Aged, which was their Fathers being Infidels at their Birth, and so continuing (for ought we can learn to the contrary even to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106704:21"/>
their death. I conceive Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> cannot clear himself from perverting their Testimonies, being unserviceable to his purpose: For,</p>
            <p>1st. For <hi>Constantine,</hi> we have told him (in our <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi>) from Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> that it doth not appear that his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> was a Christian at his Birth; and for his Father, <hi>Constantius,</hi> every one knows that is acquainted with History, that he was none, although he favoured the Christians, and grew into a good esteem of their Religion, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially towards his latter end. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath only this to say against it, that good Historians are of another mind, and that <hi>Helena</hi> was a Christian, before the birth of <hi>Constantine,</hi> quoting <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Dailly</hi> for it: But if this were so, what hath he to say for <hi>Constantius</hi> his Father? Why, the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> give this account of him from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi> that <hi>Constantine</hi> was <hi>Bonus a Bono, Pius a Pio;</hi> a Good Man from a Good Man, a Holy Man from a Holy Man. To this I reply;</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Constantius</hi> his being denominated a <hi>Good Man,</hi> doth not argue him to be a Christian, but only <hi>morally</hi> good, as many other <hi>Heathens</hi> were; nor is <hi>Pius</hi> always taken for a holy man though <hi>Sacer</hi> be: For <hi>Antoninus,</hi> the <hi>Pagan Emperor,</hi> (to whome <hi>Justin</hi> writ an Apology for the Christians as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> notes, (Treatise of Baptism. p.) was called <hi>Pius</hi> for his Clemency, and modest behaviour, having raised no persecution against the Christians, and putting a stop to the same, when moved, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Edicts</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> prohibiting all persecution, meerly for the profession of Christianity. <hi>Fox Act. &amp; Mon. V.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 37, 38. But if it could be proved that <hi>Constantius</hi> was at any time a Christian, yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106704:22"/>
that would not serve our Antagonists turn, unless it could be made out, that he was such at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's</hi> Birth, which no man will affirm. Neither is it likely he was a Christian, when <hi>Constantine</hi> was grown up; for then how could he have permitted his Son to be educated in the Court of that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical <hi>Pagan Emperor, Dioclesian;</hi> So that it is no wonder <hi>Constantine</hi> was not baptized till aged, especially if it be considered, that he continued a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> sometime after the Imperial Crown was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Head. For <hi>Socrates</hi> in his first Book and first Chapter, tells us at large, <hi>Qua ratione Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Imperator ad fidem Christianam se contulerit,</hi> by what means <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour became a Christian; and the Story is to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That when he heard how <hi>Maxentius</hi> ruled Tyranically at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was resolved to go against him, and as he was marching with his Army thither, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with himself (being not without some fear of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> by reason of his Sorceries and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish Arts) <hi>quem deum sibi adjutorem ad bellum geren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum advocaret,</hi> what God he should invoke for his assistance in the War; and being in doubtful deliberation, he saw a Pillar of Light representing the <hi>effigies</hi> of a Cross. And for the more credit of this Apparition, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the first Book of the life of <hi>Constantine</hi> witnesseth, that he hath heard <hi>Constantine</hi> himself oftentimes report it to be true, and that not only he, but his Soldiers saw it. At the sight of which being much astonished, and consulting with his Men upon the meaning thereof, it so happened that in the night-season, in his sleep <hi>Christ</hi> appeared to him, with the sign of the same Cross which he had seen before, bidding him to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106704:22"/>
make the figuration of it, and to carry it in his Wars before him, and he should have the Victory. Where by the way, let us observe what Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Story: It is to be noted, saith he, That this Sign of the Cross, and these letters added with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>In hoc vince,</hi> that is, <hi>In this overcome,</hi> was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him of God, not to induce any superstitious Worship, or opinion of the Cross, as though the Cross itself had any such power or strength in it, to obtain Victory: But only to bear the meaning of another thing, that is, to be an admonition to him, to seek and aspire after the Knowledg and Faith of him, who was crucified upon the Cross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Salvation of him and all the World, and so to set forth the Glory of his Name; as afterward it came to pass. <hi>Fox Act. and Mon. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 77.</p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Austin</hi> had Christian Parents Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> cannot prove by any Antiquity, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends us to Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who have, it seems, said somthing to that purpose, when in the mean-while he makes no reply to what I alledg to the contrary, in my <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted &amp;c. part</hi> 1. p. 21. Where I prove from <hi>Austin's</hi> own pen that his Father was an Infidel, when he was grown up to understanding, and he relates how he came afterward to be converted: <hi>Aug. Confess. lib.</hi> 2. c. 6. And though Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may be of another mind, yet Dr. <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> who is not inferior in learning to either, tells us in his late Book of the Spirit, p. 294. Sec. 11. that the reason why <hi>Austin</hi> was not baptized in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy was, because his Father was not then a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p>By this time I suppose the <hi>Reader</hi> may guess how
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106704:23"/>
well Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath purged himself from the charge of prevarication, and proved his grand <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, That Believers Baptism was the only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism for the four first Centuries.</hi> For if he reflects upon the whole that hath been hitherto disputed between us, he shall find that as to the <hi>first Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> (from whom we have our light in the History of Baptism) tells us, that <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirm, that Infants were baptized in the <hi>Apostles</hi> days. In the 2d <hi>Century,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the words of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> by applying that which was spoken of baptizing <hi>Pagans</hi> against the baptizing of Believers Children, as appears by what the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> say in that very place. In the <hi>3d Century,</hi> he suggests that no Baptism was owned but that of the <hi>Adult,</hi> when they tell us plainly, both persons grown up, and Infants of both Sexes were baptized. And for the 4th <hi>Century,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> is so bold as to say, that the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> tell us it was the Universal Practice to Baptize the <hi>Adult</hi> upon profession of Faith; <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 1. p. 64. when they say otherwise, namely, That persons of all ages were baptized in the Temples, and cite <hi>Nazianzen</hi> for baptizing of Infants in the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> to which also we have added the Testimonies of <hi>Hillary, Ambrose, Jerom, Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, Austin,</hi> all of the 4th <hi>Century:</hi> and for Infants Baptism, lastly he brings the <hi>Canons</hi> of the 3 Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Carthage, Laodicea,</hi> and <hi>Neocaesaria,</hi> which have not a word in them against Infants Baptism, and what is decreed about Confession before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism relates to <hi>Strangers,</hi> as I presume <hi>I</hi> have made it appear beyond all doubt in the two last of them (if that of <hi>Neocaesaria</hi> ever had a being.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:106704:23"/>But I must proceed on, and follow Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> for he tells us he is not alone in his Opinion, and therefore brings in divers Authorities to confirm it; that <hi>only the Adult</hi> upon confession of Faith were the subjects of Baptism in the first times, p. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>He begins with <hi>Strabo,</hi> that saith, In the first times Baptism was wont to be given to them only that could know and understand, what profit was to be gotten by it. But it seems by the story, that <hi>Strabo</hi> his first-times go no higher than <hi>Austins</hi> Days; for he instanceth in his being baptized at Age, when-as we have Testimony that Childrens Baptism was in use in the Church above a hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Austin</hi> was born. And <hi>Austin</hi> (that lived about four hundred years nearer the primitive times than <hi>Strabo</hi>) affirms, that the Church always had it, and always held it. Besides, the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Strabo</hi>) is not to be valued, being condemned by <hi>Vossius</hi> and others for a false Historian: We have formerly in our answer given instances thereof, and particularly we noted that gross mistake of his, That Sureties (called God-Fathers, and God-Mothers, were first invented in <hi>Austin's</hi> days, when <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of them, above a hundred years before.</p>
            <p>Next follows <hi>Beatus Rhenanus, Rupertus, Boemus, Dr. Hammond, and Mr. Baxter;</hi> the eldest of whom lived but in the 12th Cent. according to Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and had no other way of knowing what was don in the first times than we: and therefore let them affirm what they please, unless they can prove it by the records of those times, it signifies no more than if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> told us so. And the contrary to what he asserts is apparent from Antiquity. But because Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> shall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106704:24"/>
not say I slight his Authorities, I shall particularly examine them. And as for B. <hi>Rhenanus</hi> (who lived in 15. <hi>Cent.</hi>) what Mr. <hi>Danvers makes him say</hi> is very impertinent to his purpose. For his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is to prove, that <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Adult</hi> were then baptized, which his quotation affirms not: and what then doth it signifie, but to help to swell his Book? But I shall make it appear that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath shamefully mistaken <hi>Rhenanus's</hi> sense, and thereby exceedingly abused him. For B. <hi>Rhenanus</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> upon <hi>Tertullian's Corona militis,</hi> on those words, <hi>Aquam adituri,</hi> saith thus, p. 500. <hi>Baptizandi ritum ostendit, qui in usu Veterum fuit, de quo Consuetudo quaedam mutavit. Nam tum Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti regenerationis lavacro tingebantur, quotidie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis e Paganismo ad nostram Religionem confluenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. Siquidem id temporis ubique reperire erat Ethnicos Christianis admixtos. Postea statis temporibus nempe bis in anno celebrari baptismus caeptus, ejus enim rei nullam hic facit mentionem, alioqui non omissurus. Qui mos antiquus etiam per tempora Caroli Magni et Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovici Augusti servatus est. Judicant hoc Leges ab illis sancitae, quibus cavetur ne quemquam sacerdotes baptizent (excepto mortis articulo) praeterquam in Paschate &amp; Pentacoste.</hi> That is, He (<hi>Tertullian</hi>) shews the Rite of baptising that was in use among the Ancients, from which a certain custom hath made a change. For then for the most part the <hi>Adult</hi> were baptized, strangers daily flocking from Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism to our Religion: because at that time Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were every-where to be found mixed among the Christians. Afterwards Baptism began to be celebrated at stated times, to wit, twice in the year, for of this thing [the two stated times of Baptism] He
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106704:24"/>
[<hi>Tertullian</hi>] makes no mention here; otherwise [had it been in use] he would not have omitted the mention of it. Which ancient custom [to wit of celebrating Baptism at two stated times of the year] was also observed in the days of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and <hi>Ludovick</hi> the Emperor, as appears by the Laws made by them, whereby care is taken that the Priests Baptize none (except those at the point of death) but at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide.</hi> By this it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent (1st.) that by the <hi>Adult</hi> he means only Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens newly converted, and (2.) By the <hi>ancient custom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Baptizing at the two stated times of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whisontide;</hi> and not the baptizing those that were come to their full growth, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> saith. And to assure him Infants are not hereby excluded, <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus</hi> presently adds, <hi>Hoc sic accipiendum ut sciamus Infantes post Pascha natos ad baptismum Pentacostes reservatos, et natos post Pentacostem, ad Paschatem festum diem Bapismo offerri solitos, excepta, seu dixi, necessitate, una cum adultis Catechumenis qui de exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis nationibus Danorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; similium populorum, Christianae Religioni initiabantur.</hi> That is, this is so to be understood that we may know that these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that were born after <hi>Easter</hi> were reserved to the Baptism of <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and those that were born after <hi>Whitsontide</hi> to the <hi>Easter</hi> following, except in case of necessity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now I perswade my self Mr. <hi>D.</hi> for very shame, will take no more notice of this Quotation, unless it be to acknowledg his Inadvertency in producing it.</p>
            <p>His next Author is <hi>Rupertus</hi> in his 4th <hi>Book</hi> of Divine Offices, c. 18. Here Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is guilty of most <hi>notorious forgery.</hi> For in his second edition, <hi>p.</hi> 73. he hath the same quotation, and there he tells us <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106704:25"/>
saith, that in former times the custom was that they administred not the Sacrament of Regeneration but <hi>only at the Feast of Easter and Pentecost.</hi> And here in his Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 15. he alters the words and makes him say, that they administred but <hi>only to the Catechumens, &amp;c.</hi> If Mr. <hi>D.</hi> must have the liberty thus to deal with Authors, I confess there is no standing against him. But I hope the Reader will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be satisfied, that this signifies no more as to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, than the former, but deservedly renders him unworthy of belief in his Quotation of Authors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boemus</hi> follows who lived in the 16 <hi>Cent.</hi> (though M. <hi>D.</hi> brings him into the 12th (2. Ed. <hi>p.</hi> 73.) And he tells us there, that he saith, That in times past the custom was to administer Baptism only to those that were instructed in the Faith, and seven times in the week before Easter and Pentecost, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techised. Suppose this to be a right Translation, it makes no more against the baptizing of Infants than the other of <hi>Rhenanus:</hi> for it clearly appears that by <hi>in times past, Boemus</hi> intended <hi>then</hi> when Persons were appointed to be baptized at Easter and Pentecost; at which very time <hi>Rhenanus</hi> tells us Infants were baptized. And it is most certain that baptizing of Infants was before then, because <hi>Cyprian, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> do all mention it, who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that custom was brought into the Church.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is the next; and I need not search to see whether he is rightly quoted; for he makes the Dr. say nothing but what all the Paedobaptists ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>all men</hi> were instructed in the fundamentals of Faith anciently, before they were baptized. But how doth this prove that <hi>only the Adult.</hi> were <hi>then</hi> the subjects of Baptism? I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106704:25"/>
Mr. D. is not ashamed to quote Authors at this rate.</p>
            <p>His last is Mr <hi>Baxter.</hi> And he tells us that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> do all of them affirm that in the primitive times none were baptized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an express Covenanting. But this falls out very unluckily for Mr. <hi>D.</hi> For those three Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of them for Infants-Baptism could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no other than Heathens converted to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; which all acknowledg; And it is plain Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> so intended it, because he hath written largely to prove that none are to be baptized but such, and the Children of such. And after this manner doth Mr. D. prove his Assertions. But I am confident it will prevail with none that have not given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over to an implicite Faith.</p>
            <p>His next Testimonies for it (beginning with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons) are from Duch Authors: we shall speak with them in due time and make it appear, how gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they erre in their relations of divers things, as particularly about <hi>Cresconius;</hi> but of this when we come to examine his pretended Witnesses.</p>
            <p>Then we have <hi>Faustus Regiensis</hi> named, who said, that personal and actual desire was requisit in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that was to be baptized, which that it was meant of Adult Pagans, needs no other proof than this, that he was a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and they were for the Baptism of Children by the confession of Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> and I presume Mr. <hi>D.</hi> will not persist in denying it.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Alban</hi> that suffered for opposing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptism in the 6th <hi>Century,</hi> I cannot give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the <hi>Dutch Martyrology</hi> which it seems affirms it, because there is nothing to be found in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi>-Writers,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106704:26"/>
nor any Martyr of that name noted, but only St. <hi>Alban</hi> the first (as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us) that ever suffered Martyrdom in this <hi>Island;</hi> but that was under <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and not for opposing Infants-Baptism, but refusing to offer Sacrifice unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
            <p>I cannot find the <hi>Swermers</hi> under the 6th <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury</hi> in the <hi>Magdiburgensian History,</hi> as suffering under <hi>Justinus,</hi> or <hi>Justinianus</hi> for being <hi>Anabaptists:</hi> Nor in <hi>Sympsons History of the Church,</hi> nor in any other Authors as I have met with. And certainly, if indeed they had convinced the Imperial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to leave off Childrens Baptism, as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> mentions it twice in the compass of twelve lines, all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would have taken notice of so remarkable a story, which yet I can find mentioned by none.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Apamen,</hi> and <hi>Zoaras</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> we told him formerly that the <hi>Magd.</hi> told us, they were for <hi>Rebaptization;</hi> but that did not prove them against Infants-Baptism: Their words are these. Cent. 6. c. 5. <hi>De Anabaptis. Anabaptismum defendisse Petrum Apameae Syriae Episcopum, et Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aram Monachum Cyrum, scribit Nicephorus.</hi> But saith Mr. <hi>D.</hi> in his Reply, p. 106. The late Century-Writers calling them Anabaptists in a <hi>modern sense</hi> [that is, for those that deny Infants-baptism] we have no reason to doubt it. But how doth M. <hi>D.</hi> prove this? because they say <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writes they defended Anabaptism [that is Re-baptizing] <hi>Risum teneatis amici!</hi> But let Mr. <hi>D.</hi> take them and make the best of them he can; I shall not envy him such Patrons. For the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tells us in the same place, out of <hi>Niecphorus,</hi> that they owned but one Nature in Christ: and were guilty of most wicked Obscenities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106704:26"/>Another which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> quotes is <hi>Adrianus Bishop of Corinth.</hi> I granted in my Answer that this Man was against Infants-Baptism, where-as since I have understood from a Learned Divine, well-read in Church-History, that <hi>Adrianus</hi> was falsly accused to have turned away Children from Baptism (for that was the Charge) when-as in truth his fault was only his remisness, not taking care in his Diocess for the timely Baptizing of them, whence it happened that many died unbaptized, which was judged dangerous.</p>
            <p>Nor should I have granted <hi>Hincmarus</hi> to be of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> party, who is brought in next to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus,</hi> for refusing Infants-Baptism. I was told of the Mistake (though led into it by what I found in the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> who represent him as accused by his enemies for denying Childrens Baptism) by the afore-mentioned learned person: And having since met with <hi>Sympsons History</hi> of the Church, I find this following Account of <hi>Hincmarus</hi> under <hi>Century</hi> 9. and in <hi>pag.</hi> 566. <hi>Edit.</hi> 3 That in the Council of <hi>Acciniacum</hi> in <hi>France, Hincmarus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> accused his own nephew <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laudum,</hi> a man disobedient to his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and a man who for private inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had excommunicated all the Presbyters of his Church, debarring them from saying Mass, baptizing Infants, absolving the Penitents, and burying the Dead, and was condemned of Petulancy and deprived of his Office. Judg <hi>Reader</hi> by this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this man be to be lookt upon under the notion of an <hi>Anabaptist</hi> by the character yet given. But (to go on with what <hi>Sympson</hi> saith afterwards) he was restored to his Office by <hi>Pope John</hi> the ninth, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106704:27"/>
that because he made his Appeal from his <hi>Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and the Synod of his own Country to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Chair of <hi>Rome.</hi> A pure Anabaptist indeed!</p>
            <p>There are three other of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Witnesses yet behind, (and had there been but one more it would have made a compleat Jury) but those three speak nothing at all of Infants; so I let them pass. The <hi>Dutch-Martyrology</hi> (Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Book) name also <hi>Smaragdus:</hi> But he hath the Wit now to leave him out, though he is in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 1. under <hi>Cent.</hi> 10. But I minded him in my answer with those words of <hi>Sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragdus,</hi> That little Children are to be baptized, grounding it upon Mat. 19. 15. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Reader thou hast heard what Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers's</hi> Witnesses can say, and what exceptions I have made against them; they all stand at thy Bar, and I hope thou wilt give righteous judgment, and dost by this time see, that my Antagonist hath no need to complain, that I allow him but two Witnesses, <hi>viz. Hincmarus,</hi> and <hi>Adrianus,</hi> having been too liberal in that.</p>
            <p>2. In the next place he produceth another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, that he saith denyed Infants-Baptism; but as the <hi>Donatists, Waldenses:</hi> But how false this is we shall hereafter shew. And as for those of <hi>Germany</hi> we are contented he shall have them, some of which he may be ashamed to own. As for what he saith of the Churches of <hi>Helvetia, Flanders, Bohemia, Hungaria, Poland, France,</hi> and <hi>Silvania;</hi> as I take it, those of them who were really Anabaptists, are of no higher Antiquity than <hi>Luthers days:</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106704:27"/>
for his pretending to the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> I shall reckon with him for that in its proper place; so for the <hi>Lollards,</hi> they are of the same stamp with the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> whose Confessions will confute Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> For the <hi>Wickliffians;</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> that accused <hi>Wicklif</hi> for other things and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, never charged him with denying Infants-Baptism; and <hi>Walden</hi> that writ against him shews from his own works, that he was for it. Lastly, since <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight's</hi> time, there hath been of this <hi>sect</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what dangerous Errors some of them held in that Kings Reign, and in <hi>Queen Elizabeths,</hi> we have shewn in our <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted, part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 90, 91. To which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith nothing in his <hi>Reply.</hi> And really I wonder he should not publiquely disown <hi>Munzer, John of Leiden, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, Knipperdoling</hi> with their Comragues; I hope he reckons not those Synagogues of Sathan into the number of the Churches of Christ, though 'tis to be feared, since he is so much their Advocate.</p>
            <p>But concerning the Anabaptists of this Age here in <hi>England</hi> I have sufficiently published to the world, that I believe many amongst them are persons truly fearing God.</p>
            <p>3. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> brings Testimony for <hi>Adult</hi>-Baptism from Paedobaptists; and it seems a strange design to all that I have spoken with about the same, that he should offer to bring <hi>Chrysostom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin &amp;c.</hi> against Infants-Baptism, so making the Fathers to contradict themselves, and for which I rebuke him in my Answer.</p>
            <p>But he takes much pains to vindicate himself, in which undertaking I find him so full of Meanders
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106704:28"/>
and tedious <hi>Circumlocutions,</hi> that I judg it not worth while to follow him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, step by step; And there is no great reason I should take notice of it. Since he confesseth, 1. The sayings of those Men [Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptists] are expresly for his Opinion, though it may be [O sad is it but a may be?] not intended so, and therefore saith he, I have done them no injury. 2. He saith, he quotes them not to prove Believers-Baptism was the only Baptism of those <hi>Centuries:</hi> Why then did he quote them? why, to shew how they contradicted themselves, and likewise his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, how well he can beat them with their own weapons. O Prodigious self-conceitedness! What doth he think he can see (having washt his Eyes so profoundly) the folly of contradiction in the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of such a numerous company of Fathers, and Learned Godly Divines? And yet he is so blind as not to see in how many things he contradicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. I shall give you a Catalogue of some of them before we part. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> might have forborn his wrangling, and attended to the distinction which we gave in our Answer of <hi>Ecclesia colligenda</hi> and <hi>collecta,</hi> which serves very well for the reconciling the Fathers, and modern Divines to themselves: For when they speak of Teaching, Confession and Examination, requisite before Baptism, they intend it of the way that is to be taken in the first planting of a Church, when Pagans are brought into the Faith of Christ; and when they speak of the Right of Infants, it is in a Church already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, of which Infants being a part they must not be denied Baptism. But this Mr. <hi>D.</hi> likes not, and therefore, hath invented a way to reconcile the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulty (as he calls it) and what is that? why
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106704:28"/>
all the sayings of the later Doctors and learned men (why not of the ancient ones too?) wherein confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and profession is required, are to be understood, not, saith he, as Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> would have it, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely <hi>Adult</hi> Persons and <hi>Pagans,</hi> but Infants also, because they hold Infants to repent and believe by their Sureties. Which he conceives he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved by the Instance which he gives from the Catechism of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> just before mentioned, which (after his usual manner) he doth pervert. For it being said in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, that Faith and Repentance, is required in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be baptized; the Question is, Why then are Infants baptized, when by reason of their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, they cannot perform them? To which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> makes the Catechism give this answer, <hi>They do perform them by their Sureties;</hi> as if that was all the answer they gave: whereas indeed the answer in the Catechism runs thus; <hi>They perform them by their Sureties who promise and vow them both in their names; which when they come to age, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are bound to perform.</hi> And as if the Bishops foresaw that such as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would cavil at the word <hi>perform;</hi> in the last Edition of the Common-Prayer Book, they<note place="margin">Common-Prayer Book last <hi>Edit.</hi>
               </note> have left it out, and only say, Because they promise them by their Sureties, which promise when they come to age, themselves are bound to perform. So that it appears, the sense of the answer in the Catechism is to be understood, according to what we find mentioned by the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diburgs, Cent.</hi> 4. C. 6. p. 422. <hi>Neque enim hoc ille ait, ego pro puero abrenunciationes facio, aut fidei</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106704:29"/>
               <hi>Sacramenta profiteor; sed ita puer renunciat et profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur, id est, spondeo puerum inducturum cum ad Sacram intelligentia venerit, sedulis adhortationibus meis, ut abrenunciet contrariis omnino, profiteaturque &amp;c.</hi> which in English is to this effect; the <hi>Sponsor</hi> doth not say, I do renounce the Devils works &amp;c. and profess Faith for the Child, but promises, when the Child comes to understanding, he will exhort him to renounce the Devil, and World &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> conceives that the sayings of the Doctors and learned men, when they speak of profession before Baptism, is not by them intended of <hi>Adult</hi> persons, and <hi>Pagans,</hi> but of Infants also: Otherwise it would be, saith he, to make two Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms and necessitate two Commissions; one for the <hi>Adult,</hi> and the other for Infants.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, there is no such need of two Baptisms, for the Baptism of <hi>Adult</hi> persons and Infants is one and the same, as to the matter, both being baptized with Water, and so also, as to form, In the name of the Father &amp;c. Nor doth it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate two commissions, one will serve the turn ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, and comprehend both Parent and Child; and to make this clear, I will give the Judgment of some of our modern Doctors and learned men as to the sense of the Commission for Baptizing, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>toto caelo</hi> from Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> fancy. <hi>Perkins</hi> upon <hi>Mat. 28. 29. Go teach all nations baptizing them:</hi> In these words, saith he, the Baptism of Infants is prescribed, and the Apostles by vertue of this Commission, baptized whole families, as knowing in Gods former <hi>Administration</hi> to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Children were taken into Covenant with the Fathers. As the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were first
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106704:29"/>
taught, and then they and their Infants being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates were circumcised; so saith our Saviour, Go disciple the nations, and baptize them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paraeus</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 7. hath those words: <hi>Ad eos [Infantes] etiam pertinet universale Christi mandatum,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we render [<hi>teach</hi>] signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to make disciples, which is done, saith he, by <hi>Baptizing</hi> and <hi>Teaching;</hi> and he gives this reason for this his <hi>Analysis;</hi> because, if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should signifie only to teach, there would be found a tautologie in Christ's words. Thus, Go, Teach
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106704:30"/>
all nations, Baptizing them, Teaching them: The sense therefore (saith he) of Christs words, is this, <hi>Goe ye, make Disciples to me out of all nations by Baptizing and Teaching,</hi> and the former way of making disciples, <hi>Infantibus etiam aptari poterat,</hi> may be applyed to Infants.</p>
            <p>4 I think I could bring some scores that understand the Commission in this sense, and therefore argue against the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> thus—The Gospel is to be preached to every Creature: All nations must be discipled; but Infants are a part of this Creation, are included in all Nations; therefore they must be made disciples also: for [Them] in the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must refer to Nations, or else it relates to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for it hath no relative besides to answer to, and therefore Infants being a part of the Nation, where the Gospel is preached, must be baptized.</p>
            <p>Thus we see hitherto Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himself of the charge of Prevarication, and perverting the Authorities produced by him, but like a discontented man, is angry with every Body he meets with, that crosseth his humour, and therefore falls a Skirmishing with the <hi>Lutherans, Calvin, Baxter,</hi> and concludes bitterly against me with an Appeal to the <hi>Reader,</hi> whether it can be supposed, I did read his Book, and answer it with consideration, and so whether I ought not to be esteemed a person extreamly void of Reason and Conscience. And let the Reader likewise judge whether this be suitable to the Title of his Book, <hi>A Sober Reply</hi> to Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> against whom I may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly object that of <hi>Ambrose</hi> on the 119 Psal. <hi>Quem veritate non potest, lacerat convitiis</hi>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106704:30"/>Secondly, concerning the Falsehood chargedu pon Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> which is fully proved in what follows.</p>
            <p>Page 30. After some scornful jeers which he is pleased to cast upon me, as that I profess my self a solid grave person, a Minister of the Gospel, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts and a Learned Man, and one that hath spent much time in the University (which is more than ever I profest or pretended to) he thinks it not enough to render me ridiculous, but wicked also, and therefore insinuates, that I have a peculiar malignity against his person (whom I never saw) as well as against the Truth.</p>
            <p>To which I shall only say, That Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath cause to repent of his great Uncharitableness, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally because I have exprest my Charity towards him, declaring in my <hi>Infant-Baptism Asserted, part 2. page</hi> 224. That I hope he is a Godly-Man, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the searcher of Hearts in this matter (who knows that he wrongs me) that I look upon him rather as an Object of pity than hatred. And for that other which is much worse, that I have a malignity against the Truth, I can speak it in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (my Conscience bearing me witness) that I can do nothing willingly and knowingly against the Truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Wherefore I desire him to search his own Heart, whether the malignity be not there, and so I shall leave him to our great Master, whose Prerogative it is to judg, and who I hope, may in time convince him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Jude</hi> 15. of all his virulent Speeches.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> having thus discharg'd his Stomach,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106704:31"/>
offers to joyn issue with me, in order to the speedy trial, at whose door the Falshood lies. He hath made a good beginning, hath he not? and 'tis very like we shall have as good an end.</p>
            <p>1. First I charge him with <hi>Falshood,</hi> for saying the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tell us, that in the first <hi>Century</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Baptized <hi>only</hi> the Aged; I told him the False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood lay in this, because he addeth the word <hi>Only,</hi> which is not spoken by them. And how doth he clear himself of this? Why, by inveighing against me <hi>Suo more,</hi> and telling the World, that I am an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, and charge on him a Falsehood of my own making; how so? Since, saith he, my words are thus; <hi>As to the subjects of Baptism the Magdeburgs tell us, that in this Age they find, they Baptized only the Adult or Aged, I do not say, saith he, that they tell us, that in this Age they Baptized only the Adult:</hi> risum teneatis amici! <hi>Reader,</hi> I think thou art hard put to it, to find how I have injured him; for it seems by his own confession, they tell us they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Adult,</hi> but I wrong him, for not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his other words [that they did find it]; But it is to be supposed that whatever they did tell us, they did find it. But I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that they do not say that they find, they [only] Baptized the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult.</hi> This is all they say, <hi>Baptizatos esse adultos ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla probant, de infantibus baptizatis exempla qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem annotata non leguntur.</hi> Examples prove that the <hi>Adult</hi> were Baptized, and as for the Baptizing of Infants, we read not any Examples upon Record. Now for to say that the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tell us, they find, they Baptized <hi>Only</hi> the <hi>Adult,</hi> is (as he brings it in) a subtle insinuation to deceive the Reader) for the words being placed in that order by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106704:31"/>
do import, as if the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> did not look upon Infants-Baptism as Apostolical, or that any such were baptized in the Apostles days; whereas their very next words are: Nevertheless <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> tell us, that even in the Apostles days Infants were Baptized; and that it is evident from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Writings, that Infants were not excluded from Baptism: which words being concealed by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> shew him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be as guilty of Substraction in this latter as of Addition in the former. Had Mr. <hi>D.</hi> said, <hi>they only find they Baptized the Adult,</hi> I should have let it pass; because there are no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Examples thereof upon Record; but there is a vast difference between that, and <hi>they find they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized only such:</hi> The first leaves room for Infants-Baptism, for <hi>a non dicto ad non factum, nonꝰvalet conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia,</hi> but the latter is totally exclusive thereof; could Mr. <hi>D.</hi> find it; but he is as unable to do that, as to prove the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> said so. And yet he would have his Reader believe, <hi>it is most manifest that I am an injurious man in charging this falshood of my own making upon him, there being no such Words in his Book,</hi> though but three lines after he fully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges what I charged him withal; as may be seen p. 31 of his <hi>Reply,</hi> where he saith, <hi>my words are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly thus, that in this age they find they Baptized on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Adult.</hi> And now let any sober man in his senses (to use Mr. <hi>D's</hi> own words) judg whether indeed I have done him injury in charging this upon him, or those Ministers he informs us of, who said upon the reading thereof, he wanted morality in so dealing with Authors.</p>
            <p>A second <hi>Falshood</hi> for which I censure him is for saying the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tell us, that the Custom of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106704:32"/>
Dipping the whole body in Water, was changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sprinkling a little water in the face, in the first <hi>Century;</hi> whereas they say no such thing in this <hi>Century,</hi> nor any of those that follow. So that I charge him with a double Falshood.</p>
            <p>1. For representing them, as if they asserted the ceremony of Baptism was <hi>only</hi> by Dipping, which they do not, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>2. In affirming that the <hi>Rite</hi> was <hi>changed</hi> in that <hi>Century</hi> from <hi>Dipping</hi> into <hi>Sprinkling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now observe, how Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> vindicates himself as to this.</p>
            <p>1. He saith, the <hi>Magdeburg's</hi> own words will clear him for <hi>Dipping,</hi> and refers us to <hi>Cent.</hi> 1. c. 6 p. 148. where they speak nothing at all of this matter: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I find in <hi>Cent 1. lib. 2. c. 6. p.</hi> 497. we have these words; As to the place of Baptism, it was as occasion was offered, in Rivers and Fountains, and the manner was thus; <hi>Minstrum Baptismi in aquam baptizandos immersisse seu lavasse in nomine patris</hi> &amp;c. <hi>probat verbum</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> thus translates, <hi>the word</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>signifying immersion or dipping in Watter</hi> [thus far he is right] <hi>proves that the Minister of</hi>

               <hi>Baptism did dip the Baptized, washing them in the name of the Father;</hi> which is a very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt translation of the words, as all Scholars know: for it ought to have been translated, The Minister of Baptism doth dip or wash them, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine signification of the Word, as they give it us, <hi>Cent. 1. lib. 1. c. 4. p. 152. Vocabulum Baptismus signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat tinctionem seu lavationem a graeco verbo</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 4. say they; for it is taken a <hi>Judaica l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106704:32"/>
dipping]: The words of <hi>Mark</hi> are; <hi>The yeat not except they wash.</hi> How now can Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> justifie himself to represent them, as restraining the word <hi>Only</hi> to Dipping, when they give us to understand, it signifies any kind of Washing, rinsing, or cleansing, as a man will wash his hands, as well by pouring water on them, as by dipping, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 11. here is <hi>Elisha</hi> which hath poured water on the hands of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah,</hi> being his Servant, as 'tis noted in the Margent.</p>
            <p>1. The other <hi>Falshood</hi> is for saying that the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgs</hi> tell us, that the Custom of dipping the whole body was changed into sprinkling in this <hi>Century:</hi> Let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge, how lamely he comes off here; for he saith, those words of changing the custom were his own, not the <hi>Magdeburgs:</hi> But what had he to do, to interpose his own words, when he undertakes to tell us what the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> say as to the manner of Baptizing, when he repeats their words all along, and then concludes, which said custom of Dipping the whole body was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Sprinkling a little Watter in the face. There is no man living but would have taken those words, to have been the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> as well as the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all joyned in the same sentence, and one and the same character. See his <hi>Treatise of Baptism Edit. 1. pars 1. p.</hi> 58. Surely in this any ordinary <hi>Reader</hi> may see, we have found Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> faulty, nor will any evasion serve his turn for an excuse; yet hath he still something to say for himself, and that is, that in the 2d. <hi>Impression</hi> of his Book, he did for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter distinction (that all men might know those words of <hi>Altering the Custom of dipping the whole Body into sprinkling a little water in the face,</hi> were his own, not the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi>) put them into a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106704:33"/>
character; and then saith, that prejudice blinded my Eye, my business being to make a hole if I could not find one. What unparalelled confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is this! But be it known unto him; (and his Eye might have seen it in my <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Infants-Baptism asserted,</hi> that my business was to answer his 1st <hi>Edition,</hi> and he knows very well, (by a good token which I shall forbear to mention) that my <hi>Book</hi> was printing, when his 2d <hi>Edition</hi> came forth; which is sufficient, (I doubt not) with an Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> to clear me from blame in not taking notice of his <hi>different Character,</hi> had he really made it. But when upon examination the Reader will find no such thing, to convince him of Mr. <hi>D.</hi> care in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; (there being only a Semi-colon between, and not the least distinction to make it possible for the most intelligent Reader so much as to suppose it;) I presume he will wonder at it, that a good man should talk at such a rate. But if he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed on purpose put those words in this fifth head into a different character, left they should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed not to be his own; why did he not do so in the 2d. head, the four last lines being his own? nor in the 3d. head where the three last are his own? nor in the 4th head where the last is his own? As the Reader may see <hi>Ed.</hi> 2d. p. 46. certainly if he had so honest a design, as he pretends, he would have done so throughout, and, <hi>I appeal to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> whether he ever thought of such a thing as a different <hi>Character</hi> before he saw my Answer to his Book.</p>
            <p>A third <hi>Falshood,</hi> which I lay at his door, is for saying, the custom of <hi>dipping</hi> was changed into <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> in the third <hi>Century.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106704:33"/>To this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> answers p. 36. of his <hi>Reply,</hi> I do him manifest injury: How so? Why, because he tells us, he saith only this, <hi>viz.</hi> many were the corruptions about Baptism, that were creeping in, some whereof he confesseth, he mentions, and amongst the rest, Altering the form from dipping to sprinkling. Where then is the manifest injury? I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be because I say he changed and altered: and being it seems pincht with this charge, he calls me unfaithful man: and though as above, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that he said among other corruptions that was one, <hi>the altering the Form from dipping to sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> yet he denies it again presently with a severe increpation, and wonders that I am not ashamed to assert, that he saith the custom of dipping the whole body was changed into sprinkling in the third <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</hi> I suppose <hi>Reader,</hi> thou hast seldom met with the like ridiculous contradiction in any Author; I assure thee some have set their wits on work to find out the injury I have done him, and cannot hit upon it, unless it be because I have asserted that he saith the custom of dipping the whole body when he only names <hi>dipping:</hi> I thought indeed when ever people are dipt it had been the whole body, and I borrowed the form of expression from himself, <hi>p.</hi> 57, 58. of his first Edition; So that he is the Man that hath cause to be ashamed, and is found very unfaithful, in speaking thus forward and backward at his pleasure, yea that which is manifestly false, and then denying it in the same breath, so adding one Falshood to another; which is a sorry way of Vindication. But he would say something if he knew what, to clear himself; but 'tis very confused, and impertinent, as that he did not quote p. 125, 126. for that, but for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106704:34"/>
Rites, and did thereby only intend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with more such stuff which I let pass, and think it necessary to give the Reader an account of the whole that he hath upon this matter in his <hi>Treatise of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> 1 Edit. <hi>p.</hi> 113. 2 Edit. p. 101, 102. and so he will be the better able to judg, whether I have wronged him, or he me. Thus he speaks there <hi>verbatim.</hi> [Many were the corruptions about Baptism, that in this Age were creeping in, as the confining Baptism ordinarily to be performed by a Bishop] quoting <hi>Magd. Cent. 3. p.</hi> 123. limiting the time to <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide, p. 129. altering the Form from dipping to sprinkling;</hi> (there's that for which I accuse him) and the place from Rivers and Fountains to Baptisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; with divers superstitious Rites, as <hi>p.</hi> 125, 126.</p>
            <p>The 4th. Falshood I charge him with is for Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing several things upon the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> respecting the <hi>4th. Century,</hi> when not a word of it is to be found in them; as</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That they tell us it was the universal practice to baptize the Adult upon profession of faith;</hi> and how he clears himself of this, let the <hi>Reader</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve: all the Reply, that he makes to it, is, That he doth not say, that the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> do say in so many words, that it was the universal practice of this age, to baptize the <hi>Adult</hi> upon profession of Faith, as he saith, I would insinuate. But for this, let Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> own Book decide the business. I confess I wonder he should deny it when there are a thousand witnesses to prove it (for so many Books were the first impression as they say). For my part I have exprest the very syllabical words
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106704:34"/>
without altering one tittle, as the Reader may see if he please to look on Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Treatise of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>Edit.</hi> 1. p. 64. under <hi>Century</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> these are his words,—In this age they tell us, that it was the universal practice to baptize the <hi>Adult</hi> upon profession of Faith, and for which they give us se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authorities, out of the Learned <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> at that time, some whereof you have as followeth. If Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can excuse himself no better than he hath done in this, it had been more for his credit to have been silent.</p>
            <p>And whereas he excepts against the two instances I bring from the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> that Baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren was owned in the <hi>Eastern-Churches.</hi> The 1st was <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> puts this off easily, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us: he hath answered that already, and refers the <hi>Reader</hi> thereto, and so do I, to the reply I make him, where is manifested the Vanity of his distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on That <hi>Nazianzen</hi> was not for baptizing Children <hi>quà</hi> Children, but as dying persons.</p>
            <p>The other Instance given by me from the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgs</hi> is, that of <hi>Athanasius</hi> Question to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> which they bring for Infant-Baptism, used in the <hi>African</hi> Churches: the words are, <hi>Quod et in Africanis ecclesiis receptum fuisse Athanasius testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Quest. 124. (1) Athanasius</hi> doth witness in his 124. <hi>Question,</hi> that it was received in the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Churches. And for quoting this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is in a pet, and saith, I produce a spurious piece [is the <hi>Magdeburgensian</hi> History such?] why then doth he call it an excellent History? And further addeth, that I was not ignorant of this, but went
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106704:35"/>
on purpose to abuse the world.</p>
            <p>This is very harsh, but I will not be moved, but only tell him, he does very ill thus to load me with undeserved Calumnies; for,</p>
            <p>1. I took up the Quotation from the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs: Cent.</hi> 4. C. 6. <hi>p.</hi> 419. where they produce it for a Testimony for Infants-Baptism in the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can-Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They give not the least hint in that place, of its being spurious, but introduce it, with other Testimonies that are <hi>Authentick,</hi> without the least Censure.</p>
            <p>3. I never understood that it was reputed spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> presumptuously saith I did) for, I never read the life of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> till after I received this severe correction; who also saith, I did, out of meer design, fall in with the wicked cheat. This is more of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Charity and Sobriety, and another of his great charges in the preface, saying, That I abused the <hi>Reader</hi> with a supposititious Testimony of <hi>Athanasius, &amp;c.</hi> But is this so great a Crime in me as to deserve such severe Reprehensions? Certainly not from Mr. <hi>D.</hi> who is equally guilty with me in this particular: for in his 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> p. 66. p. 2. Ed. p 56. he quotes <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi> upon the <hi>Psalms</hi> for his opinion, which <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> tells us is spurious. Now if I should have told Mr. D. that he was not ignorant of this, but went on purpose to abuse the World; and that he did of meer design fall in with the wicked Cheat, and abused his Reader with the supposititious Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Arnobius;</hi> how would he have liked it? I believe he would have called me the most disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Person in the World; when yet I took mine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106704:35"/>
out of the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> (his excellent History) where I think his is not to be found; though his expressions would induce us to believe he had it from them.</p>
            <p>A fifth thing charged upon him is the curtailing and leaving out part of a Sentence quoted by <hi>Bazil, vix.</hi> Must the Faithful be sealed with Baptism? Faith must needs preceed. And I do in my Answer cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him for stopping there, when he should have proceeded with what follows, which is this: What then say you of Infants, which neither know good nor evil? may we Baptize them? yea for so we are taught by the Circumcision of Children.</p>
            <p>Now how doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> clear himself of this? Why by telling us there are no such words to be found in <hi>Bazil:</hi> and I do freely confess my mistake of a name, and fathering upon <hi>Bazil</hi> the words of <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> but withal I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that he in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism</hi> 1 edit. <hi>Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 66. 2 edit. <hi>p.</hi> 56. fathers upon <hi>Nazianzen</hi> that which he never spake, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Baptized used in the first place to confess their sins, and to renounce the Devil and all his works before many witnesses; and that none were Baptized of old but they that did so confess their sins: and for which he quotes no place, where we may find it in that Father, which put me and another to some trouble in perusing all that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath writ upon the subject of Baptism; so that I can confidently affirm those words; <hi>that none were Baptized of old, but they that did confess their sins,</hi> are coin'd by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> and none of <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen's.</hi> And I am apt to think he cannot find in <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> that the Baptized renounced the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and all his works before many witnesses; because
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106704:36"/>
the <hi>Magd.</hi> have no such quotation out of him as I can find; but they tell us indeed <hi>Ephrim</hi> said so. By which it appears to me that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> is as guilty in making an Authority of his own as I am. For he saith <hi>pag</hi> 47. of his <hi>Reply,</hi> it is true the words I find to be exactly the words of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen:</hi> And then withal let me mind him that <hi>Nazianzen's</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for Infants-Baptism in the 4th <hi>Century</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as good as <hi>Bazil's</hi> being of as great repute in in the Church as he; and what pregnant grounds we have to believe that <hi>Bazil</hi> was for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism likewise you have heard before. To conclude this, although it be not possible for any unprejudiced man to conceive otherwise of my naming <hi>Bazil</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> than that it was an innocent mistake; yet doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> (according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed charity) declare his fear that I did know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impose upon the Reader, and that it was not <hi>lapsus calami,</hi> but <hi>mentis,</hi> not a sin of ignorance or a meer mistake, but a wilful mistake. But in these his uncharitable surmises he is very injurious to me, but most of all unto himself who is more guilty in this very particular.</p>
            <p>A sixth Falshood he is censured for is for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Waldenses</hi> as witnesses against Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as for this, he tells us he will examine it in his <hi>3d Chapter</hi> whereto he refers the <hi>Reader,</hi> and so do I to my Reply to him under that head, where is sufficiently discovered his falshood and weakness.</p>
            <p>The seventh Charge is for dealing craftily with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and traducing his sayings, quoting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Arguments to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> as though he had been only for Believers Baptism, when in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106704:36"/>
same place he so fully explains himself, that as for Infants Right to Baptism he takes that for granted, upon the account of their Parents, and that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is wholly managed with respect to <hi>Adult,</hi> not Infants-Baptism.</p>
            <p>Now as to this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath nothing to say, but that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> contradicts himself, as before he hath said of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church, and all our Learned and Godly Divines, according to the Verdict of his modest intellect.</p>
            <p>The eight and last I charge him with is that of delusion, which he endeavours to fasten upon the Reader in reference to Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> by improving that Argument which he hath in his <hi>Liberty of Prophesie</hi> as though he were against Infants-Baptism; when the Dr. himself saith, his design in that piece was only to draw up a Schem of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> Arguments, and to represent their fallacious reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and declares, that he conceives them to be in an Error, and that he was for Infants-Baptism.</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> replyes, in way of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what-ever the Drs. judgment or end was in writing, yet God's Wisdom and Power in it the more appears, if an Enemy, to bring forth such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Arguments from his own mouth, to witness to his despised truth.</p>
            <p>To all which this may suffice for Answer.</p>
            <p>1. God is Infinite and unsearchable in his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, and hath made even Satan himself to bear witness to the Divinity of Christ; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Opinion be a truth <hi>Sub judice lis est,</hi> is the thing in controversie.</p>
            <p>2. As touching his Argments, how convincing they are, we do not deem Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judg.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:106704:37"/>3. The Dr. himself who hath so much discust the point, and examined what can be said <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> is more likely to give a right Judgment, and to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the strength of the Arguments on both sides, and he hath declared himself fully for Infants-Baptism, and given us his Arguments for the same, in a Book entituled <hi>The Consideration of the Church in Baptizing the Infants of Believers;</hi> the which he published since his <hi>liberty of Prophesy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> takes much pains to make the World believe, that the Dr. in his liberty of Prophesy, spake his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as theirs. And in his Preface to his <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 1. says, Surely Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> had the reputation of a person of more Integrity, Conscience and Honesty, than so egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to prevaricate in the things of God. But what prevarication is it in him when he gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand he doth but personate an Anabaptist, and tells us he will draw a scheme of what they can say for their Opinion, which he looks upon as erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and in the same place positively declares himself for Infants-Baptism?</p>
            <p>And whereas Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath answered that Collection of <hi>Antipaedobaptistical</hi> Arguments put forth by Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> tells us Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> hath rather confirmed than answered them: But I hope not all of them; for that had been a strange way of answering indeed: There is one of his mediums to prove Infants-Baptism by, which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith I much glory in, and which he is pleased to except against; the rest, it seems are not worthy of his notice, and that is the Drs. Argument taken from the use of Baptism amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106704:37"/>
a kind of <hi>Initiation</hi> (of which Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> gives divers Testimonies upon the 17. <hi>Gen.</hi>) and saith he, the <hi>Institutions</hi> of Christ (who came first Messias to that People, was born of that Nation, lived regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under their Law, and observed their customs) were by him drawn from their former practices in the Old- Testament, and so were lightly changed, and accommodated to his own purposes. And after that he had instanced in divers things, he pitcheth upon the Lords-Supper instituted and taken from their <hi>post-caenium,</hi> and cup of Blessing, solemnly used by them at the close of a Festival, and from thence passeth on to that of <hi>Baptism,</hi> or <hi>Washing,</hi> a known Rite solemnly used among the <hi>Jews</hi> as a form of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> into the Covenant of God, and so into the Congregation: And shews out of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> that the way of entering into Covenant was by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Baptism, and then comes to improve the Argument thus: That as the natural <hi>Jews</hi> were thus entered, so were the <hi>Proselytes;</hi> and as the Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes of age, so also were their Infant-Children. From which it appears that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremony of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, was accommodated by Christ to the right of our <hi>Initiation</hi> of the profession of Christ, whereof, saith the Dr. we have as little reason to doubt, as that a <hi>Picture</hi> was taken from that <hi>Face</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles to the life, and from whence we have, as he conceives, no obscure ground for our practice of Baptizing, not only those who make profession of Faith, but also their Children with them.</p>
            <p>In answer to which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> refers us to the Animadversions of Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbul</hi> where we have such censured, that fetch the foundation of Truth from the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and no doubt deservedly.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106704:38"/>
But as for Infant-Baptism, the foundation thereof is laid in the Covenant of God's Grace that takes in the Child as confederate with the Parent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Child must not be denied that Seal, which under the Gospel-administration, is Baptism. But that Baptism was a way of <hi>Initiating</hi> the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes of age with their little ones, we have it several ways attested. See <hi>Godwin of the Jewish Antiquities,</hi> c. 3. p. 10. quoting <hi>Moses Kotsen, Moses Aegyptius, Drusius de trib. sec.</hi> p. 102. who saith, That to the making of <hi>Males</hi> Proselytes were required <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and <hi>Purification</hi> by Water; and for the <hi>Females,</hi> only <hi>Purification</hi> by Water. From whence Mr. <hi>Godwin</hi> concludes thus; hence we may observe that a kind of <hi>Initiation</hi> by water was long in use among the Jews (having before found it to be as high as <hi>Davids</hi> time) though, as he saith, it was not <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> till Christ his Institution: yea therefore it may seem to have been used by them, because they expected it at the coming of the Messias, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by their coming to <hi>John,</hi> questioning not so much his Baptism as his Authority: by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he Baptized, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 15. But what need more be said to this? when Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> himself (to whom I hope Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will subscribe) acknowledgeth, Examen p. 89. <hi>That it is well known, Baptism was in use among the Jews, in the initiating Proselytes, for many years together with Circumcision.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. II.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> Wherein Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> pretends to shew that Infants-Baptism hath neither Foundation in Scripture, nor Antiquity, with an answer thereto.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>§ 1. THe Arguments used in his Treatise of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, we have again in this his Reply thus. That if Infants-Baptism had been any Appointment, or Ordinance of Jesus Christ, there would have been some Precept or Example; but the Scripture is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly silent as to either, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I gave this answer, in my Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism asserted &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, A thing may be said to be commanded in scripture two ways:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Expresly,</hi> or <hi>litterally</hi> and <hi>syllabically,</hi> that is, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in so many words: Thus we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Infants-Baptism is not commanded; it is no-where said, Go Baptize Infants, if it had there would have been no controversie.</p>
            <p>2. A thing may be Commanded in Scripture <hi>implicitly,</hi> and by good Consequence; and what is thus commanded is as valid and obliging, as if it were in so many letters and syllables, and thus we affirm Infants-Baptism is commanded. There are in Scripture clear grounds and principles, from whence by just and warrantable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences it may be deduced, that Beleivers children ought to be baptized; for if they belong to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106704:39"/>
and are holy, if they are members of the visible Church &amp;c. then they have right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism with more to this purpose, <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted, pars 1. p.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> says nothing in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but plays the sophister, mangles my discourse, picks up words scattered in my Book about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pages each from other, and spoken upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accounts, and withal foisteth in some of his <hi>own</hi> with them, and then falls a-skirmishing with the man of Clouts which he hath made.</p>
            <p>To give you some instances of his disingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein.</p>
            <p>1. He represents this to be my argument for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism, viz. <hi>That as there is no scripture expresly commanding, so neither is there any scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture excluding Infants from Baptism, nor any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that saith there was no Infants baptized,</hi> and then refers the Reader to p. 36. 38, 101, 131, 132, where note, what a Compass he fetcheth to glean up words and then patcheth them togetther for an Argument: and after all this, the words are not to be found in those pages, but are more his than mine: I have told you before, what is asserted by us, namely, That Infants-Baptism is implicitly, though not expresly commanded in Scripture: <hi>pag.</hi> 36, and <hi>pag.</hi> 38, I speak thus—To say, Infants-Baptism is no Ordinance of Christ because we have no Examples in Scripture, of any that were Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a pittiful Argument: for we have no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of most of the Apostles that they were Baptized, and shall we say therefore they were not Baptized?</p>
            <p>Pag 101. Which is another of my places that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> turns the Reader to; I shew, that the want
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106704:39"/>
of an express Command makes not against the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of it, and that the Anabaptists want an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Command or Example (there being neither to be found in the Book of God) to plunge Men head and ears under Water, as they use to do; Nor have they any Precept or Example, to Baptize peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with their cloaths on. And in p. 131. and 132, the last of my pages he refers to, I thus express my self, that there is nothing in Christs Commission that is against Childrens Baptism; for the Teaching that is therein required, excludes not the Children of Believers (if <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be restrained to Teaching) as appears by the consideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Persons to whom Christ sent his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to Baptize who were <hi>Aliens,</hi> and though Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving goes before Baptism in <hi>Mark</hi> it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants; because the same condition, that is required there to preceed <hi>Baptism,</hi> is required to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede <hi>Salvation:</hi> so that if the <hi>Sense</hi> be that Infants must not be Baptized, because they cannot believe, it will as directly follow they must not be saved, because they cannot believe. The way of answering one answers both, by the same distinction the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Infants may be maintained, their Baptism may. Thus Reader, I have given thee the whole which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> improves into an Argument against me, as before; but how justly I shall leave to thy consideration. And I must crave leave to say that this Argument: Infant-Baptism is lawful because no-where forbidden in Scripture, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where told where it was not done, is a Brat of his own begetting, which he would fain lay at my door.</p>
            <p>Next follow some passages quoted from Divines
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106704:40"/>
that are Pedobaptists; as, first from Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Book called <hi>Innocency and Truth Vindicated</hi> (by which name Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath baptized his Book, though little of either is found in it); who lays down this position, <hi>That no part of Gods worship, either in the old or new-Testament, was lawful, but what had some express warrant from his word for the same;</hi> in opposition to what Dr. <hi>Parker</hi> asserts, that what is not forbidden may be Lawful: To this I answer that I humbly conceive, that his <hi>position of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press warrant</hi> is to be understood with some limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for I have learned from Mr. <hi>Ger<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and some other Divines, that there is a great difference between an Ordinance it self, and some particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances or the subject to which that Ordinance is to be apply'd: For the Ordinance it self, as the setting up Baptism as a Sacrament of the Gospel-Covenant, renewed by Christ, it requires express warrant in the word of God: But when we have such Warrant for the Ordinance it self, to whomsoever we find by grounds or principles in Scripture that it doth of right belong, there we may apply it though we want express testimony for it, if we have none against i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And that this is the Doctor's meaning is clear from what he tells us in his Exposition of Heb. c. 1. p. 86. <hi>viz. That it is lawful to draw consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from Scripture-Assertions, and such consequences rightly deduced are infallibly true, and</hi> de fide: <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will rightly follow from truth, but what is so also, and that of the same nature with the truth from whence it is derived; so that whatsoever by just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is drawn from the word of God, is it self also the word of God, and of truth Infallible.</hi> And if Mr. D. will please to ask the Doctor what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106704:40"/>
by <hi>express Warrant,</hi> I am confident he will find him exactly of <hi>Bucers</hi> mind who thus expresses himself on <hi>Rom. 6. Lex dei perfecta est, docet que quibus totam Vitam ad voluntatem Dei instituere licet, quare contineri in Scripturis necesse est certa, &amp; non expressa nominatim, oracula, de omnibus quaecunque afillis Dei, sive publice, sive privatim suscipi conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath pickt up another saying of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> before his <hi>Vind. Minist. Evang.</hi> viz. <hi>That in things relating to the worship of God nothing ought to be done without express Warrant in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> This Assertion of Mr. <hi>Collins's</hi> in that latitude as it is laid down is liable to exception; for there are many Circumstances relating to Gods worship, as time, place, and order, that are not so expresly set down in the Word, which nevertheless may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be prescribed by the Church, provided that it agrees with the general Rules set down in the Word: and I find this was written in opposition to Souldiers that took up the practice of Preaching without Ordination: and his endeavouring to make the bow straight might make him bend it a little too much the other way. But I am confident if he was to explain what he meant by those words, Mr. D. would find them very little for his purpose. But to come more closly to the matter, what express Command have we for the observation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sabbath? for want of which, many Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists (notwithstanding the Apostles met on the first day of the week) own not the Morality of it. Again, what express Command, or Example have we, for Womens receiving the Lords-Supper; good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence there is for it, but no express mention of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106704:41"/>
it. But this satisfies not Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> for he is for express Scripture, to prove Women received the Lord's Supper; as you have it in his reply to Mr. <hi>Blinman:</hi> who very rationally and truly argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that the words upon which he lays the stress of Womens receiving the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are in express terms against him, it being these [all that beleived were together] and as he argues rightly, the Greek phrase is expresly of Men and not of Women, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, being masculin expresly limits it to Men and not to Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Replies very confidently, that the exception of Mr. <hi>Blinman</hi> seems to be as defective in Grammar as in Divinity [and why in Divinity, since Mr. <hi>Blinman</hi> holds that Women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Lords-Supper, and this is not the thing disputed] and then he paedagogue-like, sends the Reverend Learned Man to his Grammar to learn what <hi>Syllepsis</hi> means: which is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose but to make a noise.</p>
            <p>To gather up then the Discourse, we grant all this is good by consequence, That the first-Day ought to observed as a Christian Sabbath, that Women ought to receive the Lord's-Supper, but we cannot prove either by express terms. To conclude then, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and no less ignorant a Spirit appears in those words of Mr. <hi>Danvers;</hi> That Mr. <hi>Blinman</hi> trifles in the things of God, and plays with Words to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Truth, when he only tells him (being challenged thereunto) that as much might be said for Infant-Baptism as Womens receiving the Lords-Supper, there being no express Command for either, but only implicit, and both warranted by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106704:41"/>There is a third Author quoted by Mr. <hi>Danvers, viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who saith, that an Institution of Christ, such as each Sacrament is, should not be judged by any other rule, than either the Word wherein the Institution is set down, or the Records of the practice of Christ or his Apostles. A sound position, but such as toucheth not the case before us, for we judg of the Sacrament of Baptism as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Infant-seed of Believers by the Word wherein the <hi>Institution</hi> is set down, as before is shewn.</p>
            <p>Thus we have manifested the Sophistry and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> arguings together with the impertinency of his Quotations. Nevertheless he concludes, as if he had done some great thing. <hi>By all this evidence it appears that Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>is so He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox in his Positions, that he hath neither Scripture Reason, Antiquity, or the learned Protestant-Writers to stand by him, and wherein if he persists, he gives up not only the Independent, but whole Protestant Cause</hi> (as if all the Protestant Cause depended upon the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of those three men before mentioned, or on my opposing him for wresting and misapplying the same against Infant-Baptism). But what should make him fancy the Protestant Cause depended upon the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this <hi>Triumviri,</hi> I cannot imagin, unless it be because one is an Independant, the other a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, and the third Man an Episcoparian, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantism is only found among the men of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, the Anabaptist being not concerned in it. And truly if we consider what Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath said of the Protestants in some parts of his Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we had need of much charity to believe, it would be at all grievous to him, if the Protestant
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106704:42"/>
cause miscarried; for we are all in his esteem a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of erroneous persons, not of the Church of Christ, having no true Ministry or Baptism, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian enemies to the Truth, as well as to them, and ever and anon linkt by him with the Papist, as conspiring togethher in upholding the Tradition of Infants-Baptism, and therein grounding all our Christianity, and against which he bids defiance; and declares against all possibility of Communion with us, whilest we adhere thereto, as may be seen in his Preface to his <hi>Treatise of Baptism,</hi> Edit. 2.</p>
            <p>But will Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> allow of no consequences, or are not implicit Commands obligatory? you have his judgment in what follows.</p>
            <p>1. He tells, us <hi>he will allow of Consequences when there is express Scripture for the thing else-where, as in the case of the Resurrection, else not:</hi> And I pray, who now is Heterodox? No thanks to him for his grant, for we have no need of consequences to be drawn, where the thing is set down in express terms: It seems if the Doctrine of the Resurrection had not been delivered in Scripture plainly in so many words, all consequential arguings from the Infinite Power and Justice of God requiring it, would little have avail'd with him. But he might have learned from Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> (with whom he is acquainted) that to deny Consequences to have the strength of Commands is to leave very few Duties to be practised, or Sins to be avoided: expound the Ten-Commandments without Consequences, and very few will be found literal transgressors, but most deplorable debaucht Persons. And since the Bible is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106704:42"/>
but a short System of Religion, every place is fitted to expound each other, and this must be done by Rational, Spiritual, Comparisons and Inferences: and how doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> prove that those of his way, must be covered when Baptized, have they any express Word, or Example for it? doth he not fly to rational Inference? how doth he know Baptizing is by Plunging? hath he any other way for it than consequential Reasonings? it must be so, he conceives, for the word signifies it; see his <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 34.</p>
            <p>2. He saith, he will admit of plain Consequences, which mends the matter very little. For now we shall want some Supreme Judg to determine, which are plain, which not; must we go to him and his party for resolution? certainly it must be so according to his mode of arguing, for though he will admit of plain consequences he presently adds, Therefore we deny the Inferences usually drawn from Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision under the Law for Baptism under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to be either plain, proper, or true: How blind was <hi>Nazianzen, Jerom, Austin,</hi> and the rest of the Fathers, to infer Infants-Baptism from Circumcision? and how irrational are the deductions of such an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Doctors and learned Divines? Had they lighted their Candles at Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Torch, they might have seen what had been plain, proper and true Inferences; but the Vanity of his discourse in this kind, we have shewed in our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism Asserted, part</hi> 1. 116, 117. and answered their objections against our Arguments for Infants-Baptism drawn from Circumcision.</p>
            <p>In the next place he saith, <hi>That as to the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Infants-Baptism, with its impious Concomitants of Salt, Oyl, Spittle, Chrism, Exorcism, it was not</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106704:43"/>
               <hi>about</hi> 400 <hi>years after Christ, in the</hi> Milevitan <hi>and</hi> Carthaginian <hi>Council,</hi> and that according to my own grant.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that here Mr. <hi>D.</hi> doth impose: For in the 106 page of my Infant-Baptism (the place which he intends) I do not calculate the Antiquity of Infant-Baptism, from those Councils 400 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ; nor is there any thing there spoken of Salt, Oyl, Spittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This trumpery is an addition of his own, to render Infant-Baptism odious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he knows it was used also in the Baptizing of grown Persons in those days. 2. What is there spoken of Infants-Baptism is from Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> and no grant of mine, about the necessity of Infant-Baptism not determined till the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Milevitan Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> 3. He makes me to say positively, that the reason why it was not enjoyned sooner was, because the lawfulness of it was rarely, if at all questioned before, and then glories that I have confirmed his witness against Infants-Baptism; whereas all that I say amounts but to a conjecture, and that upon a supposition of the truth of Dr. <hi>Taylors</hi> speech concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the time when Infant-Baptism was established by <hi>Canon;</hi> for these are my words: Belike the reason why it was not established sooner by Council, under an <hi>Anathema,</hi> was, because it was rarely, if at all, questioned or opposed till then. It was indeed determined in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Council about a hundred and fifty years before, that Infants might be Baptized before the eight day, but no Anathema was made about this point of Baptism so early. 4. Observe Reader what an idle Inference my Antagonist draws from the pretended Grant of mine; then saith he, if it be so, that the <hi>Canons</hi> in the <hi>Milevitan</hi> Council,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106704:43"/>
and inforcing Infants-Baptism [with thirty more Councils doing the same] were only made upon the occasion of those that denied, or opposed it.</p>
            <p>We have then, saith he, our witnesses through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages confirmed by himself, the Reader must needs see how precarious he is in his reasoning, and if he hath no more to say for his Witnesses in all ages than this, I am sure he will never carry it at the Bar of an Impartial Judg: He must seek else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for his Witnesses than in my Writings, or he is never like to find them, and if I had argued at the rate as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth in this thing, I might justly have deserved his censure for folly, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood.</p>
            <p>Lastly, he concludes that till any instance be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of any Child that was <hi>Baptized,</hi> as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Christ, within the first 300 years, he is yet unreprovable in his Assertion, and very safe in what he hath said.</p>
            <p>I answer, 1. That this is very weakly spoken, in as much as he confesseth just before from the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgs,</hi> that the Records of Antiquity say nothing of the particular persons, either Infants or Adult, that were Baptized in the third <hi>Century,</hi> but only; there is mention made of one Family Baptized, in which there was a young Man named <hi>Symphorianus, Magd. Cent.</hi> 3. c. 6. p. 1. 25. 2. What though we have not the particular names of Children (having not the Church-Registers) it is sufficient that we are informed in general that it was then the practice of the Church to Baptize Children, as we have it in the same place before-mentioned, <hi>p.</hi> 125. <hi>significat</hi> Cyprianus <hi>in Epistola ad</hi> Fidum, <hi>etiam Osculum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanti</hi>

               <hi>a ministro baptizante dari solitum,</hi> that is, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Fidus</hi> doth likewise intimate, that the Minister used to kiss the Child when he Baptized it: Let Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Friends judg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not enough, if no more could be said, to confute all his Discourse about Antiquity. Add hereunto this consideration, That in this <hi>Century Tertullian</hi> perswading to defer both the Baptism of Children, and others who are of age, doth thereby intimate that it was the custom of the Church at that time to Baptize the one as well as the other; otherwise there was no reason why he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that they would defer the one as well as the other.</p>

If <hi>Austin</hi> then means the same that <hi>Bazil</hi> doth by <hi>Tradition, viz.</hi> the Scripture, he says true, when he tells us that Infants-Baptism were not to be believed, unless it were an Apostolical Tradition, and although he intends the word otherwise in that famous speech of his in his 4th <hi>Book</hi> against the <hi>Donatists, Chap.</hi> 24.

               <p>A third passage Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> brings from Dr. <hi>Field</hi> in his Book of the Church, <hi>Chap</hi> 20. Where speaking of the several sences in which the word Tradition is taken he saith, That Infants-Baptism is therefore called a Tradition because it is not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Scripture that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did Baptize Infants, or that they should do so: And is it fair dealing for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to stop here, when the following words would have cleared the point, which are these; yet is not this received by bare and naked Tradition, but that we find the Scripture to deliver unto us the grounds of it, <hi>lib. 4. p.</hi> 375. and the more inexcusable is our Antagonist being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly minded of this unfaithfulness in our <hi>Infant-Baptism Asserted, &amp;c.</hi> And when I shewed to a Friend that hath a great respect for the Anabaptists, how he had served Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> the said person presently said, certainly Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is either weak or wicked.</p>
               <p>The last instance is from the <hi>Convocation</hi> at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and he deals unfairly with them likewise, by altering, and disordering their words; For he quotes them thus. That without the Consentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment and practice of the universal Church they should be at a loss when they are called upon for proof in the point of Infant-Baptism: whereas they are expressed in another strain, and less advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> purpose, being thus. That the Consentient judgment and practice of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church is the best interpreter of Scripture in things not clearly exprest; and then they say, that without it they should be at a loss in sundry points of Faith and manners, believed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

               <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> having as he thinks cleared his Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceeds to draw a parallel between Papists and Protestants, to shew that there is no great difference between them, after the manner as I have represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Protestant sentiments in the point.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, 1. That the <hi>Papists</hi> hold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that are <hi>Orthodox</hi> and sound, especially in Doctrinals, but are very corrupt in Discipline, and abominably unsound in the point of Tradition, for they equal it with Scripture: and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> determined that Tradition was to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>pari pietatis affectu,</hi> with the like affection as the Scripture, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> abhor this, as may be seen at large in the afore-mentioned Author <hi>Hamelmannus</hi> in his Book of Traditions, where disputing against <hi>Staphilus,</hi> and <hi>Cassander,</hi> and speaking particularly of Infants-Baptism, p. 818. he saith <hi>non nobis satisfae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret, nisi peteretur probatio paedobaptismi ex Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> Tradition would not satisfie us unless we had Scripture-proof for it.</p>
               <p>Now for his <hi>Parallel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Do the <hi>Papists,</hi> saith he, maintain that the Ecclesiastical Tradition of <hi>Infants-Baptism,</hi> as it is gathered from the Scripture, and appointed by the Church, is of equal Authority with Scripture it self? so, saith he, doth Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> assert for <hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine, That the Tradition of Infants-Baptism, proved by Consequential Arguments from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106704:46"/>
ought to be esteemed as firm and good, as the Scripture it self; and to prove that I say so, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> refers the <hi>Reader</hi> to p. 117. of my Book, where there is nothing spoken of Tradition; but only a position quoted from Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That evident consequences, or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn by Reason <hi>from Scripture,</hi> are as true proof as the very words of a Text. And is there any hurt in this? can any man that is rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it? doth not Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> positively assert it? Nay, doth not Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> himself tell us <hi>We admit of plain consequences? Reply</hi> p. 69. though he will not grant Infants-Baptism to be of the number of them. But what saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned place? If I prove, saith he, that all Church-members must be admitted by Baptism, and then prove that Infants of Believers are Church-members, is not this as much as to prove they must be baptized? What thinks Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> of that passage of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his <hi>5th Book of Theology? Quae colliguntur ex Scripturis Sacris, perindè haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da sunt, ac si in illis scripta essent:</hi> those things that are gathered out of Scripture are to be of like esteem with us, as that which is written in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Without doubt Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> look's upon this as a Popish saying in <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> The rest of his Parallel is so frivolous, that I will not trouble my self, nor the Reader with it. And truly if one were minded, how easy is it to retort upon him, and shew the vanity of his discourse in such a manner? as for instance.</p>
               <p>Doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> say that the promise <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, pertains not to the Carnal seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to the Spiritual? so doth <hi>Estius</hi> the <hi>Jesuit</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> about which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted so great a Mistake, that if I had done the same he would have said I had belyed <hi>Calvin,</hi> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the World. Doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> say, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was only a Seal to <hi>Abraham,</hi> not to Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their seed? so saith <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin,</hi> in his first book of the Sacraments, and after him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papists, affirming that Circumcision is not said to be a seal universally to any faith, but only a seal of the individual faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> say, it could not be a seal to an Infant that had no faith? <hi>Bellarmin</hi> speaks the same; If it be a seal, saith he, (in that Baptism comes in the place of Circumcision) it is in vain to baptize Infants, because they have no Faith: so that it seems, his sentiments about these points are the same with the Papists also.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Mr. Danvers Exceptions against our Testimonies for Infants-Baptism from the Ancients, examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confuted.</head>
               <p>His first Exception is against that passage we bring from <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Triphon,</hi> part. 2. <hi>propos.</hi> 3. where he saith, It was lawful for all to receive the spiritual Circumcision, which was done by Baptism: From whence we argue, That if it was lawful for all to receive it; then Infants who were the subjects of the legal Circumcision, for they must be part of the all, and not excluded.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith two things. 1. That it is a meer Impertinency, and <hi>nothing to the purpose,</hi> why so?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because there is not one wo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of Infants, nor of</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106704:47"/>
                  <hi>Infants-Baptism, nor its Apostolicalness:</hi> And what of that? doth he not know that <hi>omne universale continet in se particulare,</hi> every universal contains within it self the particular? And doth not <hi>Justin</hi> say it was lawful for all to receive the spiritual Circumcision, which is Baptism? Nor do we stand in need of a word for its Apostolicalness here, since the only end for which the Quotation is urged is to prove that <hi>Justin</hi> was for Infants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>2. He tells us <hi>it is not only Impertinent, but Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, to interpret the word [All] to be all men, for then it must comprehend wicked as well as good, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers as well as Believers.</hi> But this is a shift; for I say, [All] is here to be limited to those who are within the Church, for to them Only apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Legal Circumcision under the Law, of which <hi>Justin</hi> speaks, and by proportion to such only, the Spiritual Circumcision [Baptism] now under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>As to what he further objects, that <hi>Justin</hi> in this very Dialogue tells us, that by the Word and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism Regeneration was perfected in all mankind: As it is more than the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> say, for their words are, <hi>per aquam et fidem regenerationem fieri humani generis;</hi> so it makes nothing at all against us, because this is added by the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> in the same place (speaking how they baptized in <hi>Justin's</hi> time) <hi>De adultis paenitentiam requirunt &amp;c.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Repentance of the <hi>Adult</hi> before Baptism. If Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> had set this down, he could not have framed his objection. Just thus he deals with Mr. <hi>Baxter's Treatise of Baptism, Ch. 7. p. 49. 2d Edit.</hi> where he quotes Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as rendring some part of <hi>Justin Martyr's Apology</hi> in these words in his <hi>Saints</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:106704:47"/>
                  <hi>Rest, Ch.</hi> 8. Sect. 5. <hi>viz.</hi> [I will declare unto you how we offer up our selves to God after that we are renewed by Christ &amp;c. Where if you will compare, you shall see both how considerably he varies it in the words from Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> words, and likewise how he leaves out that which would have shewn the Quotation nothing to his purpose, <hi>viz [Justin Martyr</hi> speaking of the way of Baptizing the Aged.]</p>
               <p>In the next place he excepts against what we urge for Infants-Baptism, from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived in the same <hi>Century</hi> with <hi>Justin,</hi> in the Age of those that saw the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and so must needs know their Practice: It is a passage of his in <hi>lib. 2. Advers. Haeres.</hi> c. 39. where discoursing of Christ that came to save all ages, he specifieth particulars, as <hi>Infantes et Parvuli,</hi> Infants and little ones, as well as <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eros et juvenes, et seniores;</hi> Boys, young men, and old men: and then concludes, <hi>Omnes inquam qui per eum renascuntur in Deum;</hi> All, I say, who by him are born again unto God. Where, by Infants being born again unto God, must needs be understood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Scripture-notion and sence, and as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers usually took the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Baptism. For as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> observes, that by the <hi>Washing of regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. none will deny is meant Baptism: And <hi>Vossius,</hi> upon that Scripture saith, that to call Baptism <hi>Renascentia,</hi> [Regeneration] <hi>is usitata veteribus loquendi for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> an usual form of speaking among the Ancients. And to put this out of all doubt, <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> in his Apology before-mentioned, speaking of the manner how they were baptized, saith, The party was brought to the place where the water is, and regenerated in the same manner, wherein we were
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106704:48"/>
regenerated. To this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath little to say, and if I mistake not, very little to purpose, as, <hi>that it is Impertinent as before and far-fetched, and that there is not a word of Infants-Baptism in it,</hi> or <hi>Apostolicalness:</hi> which is just the 2d part of the same tune which was sung but now: And further he adds, <hi>that as the interpretation upon which it is founded is fallacious; so neither Scripture nor</hi> Justin, <hi>doth call Baptism, Regeneration absolutely</hi> [who saith they do?] <hi>but only the Symbol of Regeneration.</hi> And this is very true, and which no body denies but I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that this is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, and far off from the matter we are upon.</p>
               <p>But his Confidence doth not abate, for he tells us, 'tis <hi>manifest these Authorities are to little purpose, yea wholly insignificant, and nothing to the purpose</hi> [do not only tell us this Story, but give us Reason for it, or say nothing] and that they failing, as he concludes they do, there is <gap reason="foreign">

in the 1st Edition of his <hi>Treatise of Baptism</hi> p. 74. we have him thus, Dr. B. late Doctor of the Chair, a person of great Learning and Eminency, hath these words in a Letter I have seen in print; I do believe, and know, there is neither Precept nor Example in Scripture &amp;c. as before: And for as much as I questioned the Truth of this, [that is, that the Doctor was of this Opinion] and being desirous to know his Judgment, and whether he owned any such printed Letter, I did therefore write to him, and received this following Letter from him, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Our 3d testimony is <hi>Origen,</hi> who in divers places of his Works, as in his <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. saith, The Church received a Tradition from the <hi>Apostles</hi> to give Baptism to little Children: the same we have again in his <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Objects.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:106704:50"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That of <hi>Dr. Taylor,</hi> That <hi>Origen is but one single Testimony.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That his Writings are notoriously corrupt, and particularly in the point of Baptism.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Many of his works, and particularly those that treat of Baptism, fell into ill hands.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In answer to the first; Let Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his later Discourse of <hi>the consideration of the Church in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Children of Believers,</hi> answer Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> in his former Book of the <hi>Liberty of Prophesy,</hi> where he saith, that <hi>Origen</hi> is but one single Testimony. In his later Discourse (put out since) he cites <hi>Justin</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> saying positively, <hi>That the Tradition of Baptizing Infants passed through</hi> Irenaeus <hi>his hands.</hi> So then he, by this acknowledgeth that we have more than the single Testimony of <hi>Origen:</hi> and if he hath put forth any thing else since in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, I may say his words are not much to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, for we know not where to find him.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Origen's</hi> Writings (saith he) are corrupt: who denies it in some things? So are <hi>Tertullian's,</hi> so are all the Fathers. To which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> vauntingly replyes, Let both <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> go together, only I shall thereby have the better bargain; for Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> in parting with <hi>Origen</hi> parts with all, but I have many more to witness for me besides.</p>
               <p>To which I only say, I wish I could see them, or if it were possible to speak with them face to face, as I lately did with Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> 'tis very like I should have the same account of their Judgments, as I had of his; And let Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> know, that one word of solid Reason, hath more weight in it, and is more taking with the judicious, than all his Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonical
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106704:50"/>
Boasts and calumniating reflections?</p>
               <p>3. His Works fell into ill hands; which is true of some, yet not all of those that treat of Baptism: for I tell him in <hi>Infant-Baptism Asserted p.</hi> 135. that <hi>Origen's Homilies</hi> on the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by <hi>Jerom,</hi> and to be esteemed <hi>Authentick,</hi> quoting <hi>Erasmus</hi> for it: and for this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> falls foul on me, this being another of his great charges in his Preface, that I abuse <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who saith quite contrary to what he saith I father on him. As 1. That the Translation of the <hi>Homilies</hi> on the <hi>Romans</hi> appeared to him to be <hi>Ruffinus's</hi> and not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Preface</hi> to the Translation which represents it as <hi>Jerom's</hi> was a cheat of the Bookseller, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> notes.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, 1st. That <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth not say that the <hi>Homilies</hi> upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> set forth as translated by <hi>Jerom,</hi> were <hi>Ruffinus's Homilies,</hi> and not <hi>Origen's.</hi> 2. The <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> reckoning up the legitimate Works of <hi>Jerom</hi> in the story of his Life, do mention that of translating <hi>Origen</hi> on the <hi>Romans</hi> to be one, and that according to the Judgment of <hi>Erasmus, Cent.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. p. 1218. Extant <hi>inter</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genis <hi>Opera Latinè facta quaedam quorum interpres fuit Hieronimus, Erasmi judicio:</hi> that is, among the works of <hi>Origen,</hi> some are translated into Latin by <hi>Jerom,</hi> in the Judgment of <hi>Erasmus;</hi> and then they nam which they are, as follows. As the <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Jeremy,</hi> which have <hi>Jerom's</hi> Preface to them, the <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the 39. <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Luke cum Praefatione Hieronymi,</hi> with <hi>Jeroms Preface,</hi> and <hi>ten Books of Origen's Comments upon the Romans.</hi> [there's that which will clear me against all Mr. <hi>Danver's</hi> reproaches] <hi>cum ejusdem praefatione,</hi> with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106704:51"/>
                  <hi>Jerom's Preface.</hi> I appeal now to the <hi>Reader,</hi> whether I had not good Authority for what I said, That according to <hi>Erasmus's</hi> judgment <hi>Jerom</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated <hi>Origen</hi> on the <hi>Romans.</hi> You see from whence I had mine information, The <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> affirm that both Translation and Preface too were <hi>Jerom's,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> knew it to be so, for in my Answer I directed him to the <hi>Century</hi> and <hi>page</hi> in the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgensian History,</hi> from whence I had it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis a sorry trick, of him to slur me as he hath done in this thing, and make such an Exclamation against me. <hi>What credit is to be given unto</hi> Mr. Wills <hi>let all men judg!</hi> he might rather have said what credit is to be given to the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> (and their excellent History as Mr. <hi>D.</hi> calls it) let all men judg! for if I was deceived, they deceived me. 3. I have yet further to say, and that is that I have another to speak on my behalf, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (of no small note for his knowledg in Antiquity, and perhaps not inferior to <hi>Erasmus</hi>) who tells us in his Letters of Resolution, p. 215. that though we have not <hi>Origen</hi> upon the <hi>Romans</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> yet being translated by <hi>Jerom,</hi> and so owned by him in his Epistle to <hi>Heraclius,</hi> prefixt before the <hi>Commentary,</hi> we have his Authority to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us that the words [about Infant-Baptism] were <hi>Origens.</hi> And let it be supposed that <hi>Jerom</hi> did not translate those on the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that the <hi>Homilies</hi> themselves are spurious, and none of <hi>Origens;</hi> Yet those on <hi>Luke</hi> pass for current without controul, and there the point of Infant-Baptism is as fully asserted, as in the other place on the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Against this also Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath borrowed a scrap from Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> (who finding nothing in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus Censures</hi>) hath yet by good hap hit upon a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106704:51"/>
word in <hi>Erasmus Comment</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3. The words of <hi>Erasmus</hi> are [For so he seems to think, whosoever he was, whose <hi>Commentaries</hi> are extant upon <hi>Luke</hi> under the title of <hi>Admantius</hi>] which shews (saith Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi>) that <hi>Erasmus</hi> took them not to be <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi> or at least doubted thereof.</p>
               <p>It is very remarkable that Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> should spy out this passage, much more that he should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus upon it. For what <hi>Erasmus</hi> speaks of <hi>Origen</hi> upon <hi>Luke,</hi> might as well be said of every Book; nor can any man say posatively these are the Books written by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> or <hi>Tertullian;</hi> so that to interpret that passage of <hi>Erasmus</hi> for a doubt is but a meer Cavil.</p>
               <p>But that he doubted not that <hi>Jerom translated O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> on <hi>Luke,</hi> take his own clear word for it in his <hi>Censure, Homil. In Lucam, Dubium non est quin</hi> 39 Homilias <hi>in Lucam verterit Hieronimus, quod ipse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam in praefatione profitetur.</hi> There is no doubt to be made of it, saith he, that <hi>Jerom</hi> translated the 39 Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies on <hi>Luke:</hi> And if <hi>Jerom</hi> translated them (as there is no doubt according to <hi>Erasmus</hi>) then we need not doubt but he did it from the Original Copy of <hi>Origen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judg now Reader what Mr. D. hath got in this Business, notwithstanding all the Clutter he hath kept with his boastings and defamings: we see by what is said, That we have Infants-Baptism owned as from the Apostles by <hi>Origen</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> [whatever becomes of that on the <hi>Romans,</hi>] and translated by <hi>Jerom,</hi> of which <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth not in the least doubt; so that the Fabrick stands yet upright never like to be demolisht by Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> what-ever great exploits he hath done heretofore in the days of his Colonel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106704:52"/>Our last Testimony is from <hi>Cyprian</hi> against whom also he hath something to say, though methinks that of <hi>Vossius</hi> is enough to silence all<note place="margin">☞</note> Cavils, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Testimony of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for Infants-Baptism both in his time and before, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception. And <hi>Grotius</hi> speaks to the same purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Epistle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fidus</hi> maks the matter plain that there was then no doubt of Infants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>Against this he gives in three Exceptions,<note place="margin">☞</note> in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism,</hi> presented again in his <hi>Reply;</hi> as <hi>First, Infants-Baptism is not urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by</hi> Cyprian <hi>for an Apostolical Tradition, nor upon any Authority of Scripture, but upon his Own, and Bishops Arguments;</hi> though if he should have said it was an Apostolical Tradition, his word, he saith, would have no more been taken than when he tells us <hi>Chrysm</hi> was so. To which I replyed, in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That though <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not say it was <hi>Apostolical;</hi> yet it follows not he did not own it as such: yea, to put it out of doubt, the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tell us he did own it as Apostolical, <hi>Cent. 1. l. 2. c. 6. p.</hi> 496. But what though the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> tell us so (saith he) that's no more than if Mr. <hi>Wills had said it:</hi> Strange! that such venerable persons as those famous Divines were, that have written such an excellent History, as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> else-where terms it, should be of no more credit with him than my self, whom he so much vilifieth? But hath he not forgotten what he speaks just before, That <hi>Cpyrian</hi> held Chrysin to be an Apostolical Tradition? and is it not strange! that he should not hold the same of Pedobaptism? But whether he did or not, is not material to the point which is now before us;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106704:52"/>
for we are inquiring <hi>de facto,</hi> what was done in <hi>Cyprian's</hi> time, as to the Baptizing Children; not <hi>de jure,</hi> upon what ground they did it, or whether 'twas esteemed Apostolical: if the practice was own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'tis as much as we need to put by Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Cavil; and that it was so, Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his great Tutor, had never the face to deny, but confesseth plainly, That it was a truth, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> assured <hi>Fidus,</hi> that by the unanimous consent of sixty-six Bishops gathered together in a Council, Baptism was to be administred to Infants, as well as grown men. <hi>Tombes Examen, page</hi> 11. And since <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> flourished in 250 according to <hi>Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Usher</hi> placeth him in 240, what is become of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> proposition, That Believers Baptism was the only true Baptism for near 300 years after Christ, <hi>page.</hi> 3. of his Reply? Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himself doth lend us his helping hand to pluck down this rotten fabrick. I am not willing to let any thing pass, that may blind the weaker sort of Readers, and therefore shall go on with him: If <hi>Cyprian</hi> (saith he) <hi>should have said Infants-Baptism had been an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition, his word would have been no sooner taken, than when he tells us, Chrysm was so.</hi> This <hi>crambe</hi> we had in effect long since by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in his Exercitation: There were many other things (saith he) went under the name of a Tradition, which were but meer humane Inventions: What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> Infant-Baptism, which went under the name of a Tradition, is also human Invention. Shall I shew (saith Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>) the natural face of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in a glass? such and such men, who went under the name of honest men, were knaves, <hi>Ergo</hi> all that go under the name of honest men, are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106704:53"/>
knaves: 'Tis true (saith he) many things in those days went under the name of Apostolical Tradition which were but humane Inventions; and 'tis as true, [as before is fully shewn] that many points of faith went in the same ages, under the name of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But to proceed,</p>
               <p>His second Exception is, <hi>because it is questionable, whether there were ever such a Council.</hi> This is to lay the Ax to the root of the tree. But to this I answer:</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> do not question it, but own it as authentick, as any of the rest of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Cent.</hi> 3. C. 9. <hi>p.</hi> 203.</p>
               <p>2. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> was so wise as never to question it, in all the contest he had with Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ever I observed. But why should we question it? Why? because (saith he,) there is no place mentioned where that Council was kept. What if I say 'twas at <hi>Carthage?</hi> no doubt Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would then give me the lye: and yet Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> calls it the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and well he might, because <hi>Cyprian</hi> was Bishop of that place. And for his further satisfaction, that he might not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil against the being of this Council, I reckon up in my Infants-Baptism divers of the Ancients that make mention of it with high Esteem; as <hi>Nazianzen, Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi> [Greek Fathers] <hi>Ambrose, Austin, Jerom,</hi> of the Latines. So that I conceive Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is very perverse to question it. And as much weakness follows, in that he saith; It was no Argument, it was a Decree of such a Council, because so many had a good esteem of it, for the same Fathers esteemed very well of Chrysm, &amp;c. But when I speak of an esteem of it, my meaning is, That they did not judg it a fictitious Council, but a real one,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106704:53"/>
which is obvious. I wonder Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should not apprehend it. But since he is not a man of that Sagacity as I thought him, but runs on upon a falle scent, I shall leave him. A second Reason of his doubt, is because the grounds brought by <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> for Infant-Baptism are weak: and because I gave no answer thereto in my Infant-Baptism, Mr. <hi>D.</hi> tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, and it is one of the Charges in his Preface to the <hi>Reply, That I am notoriously partial in my Answers all the Book through, replying to what I judg weak, and leaving other unanswered.</hi> Whenas I profess, I let many things pass because of their weakness, and have even wearied my self out with making answers to his Impertinencies. I could have given him the same answer, which Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> did to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> near 30 years since, when he objected the weakness of <hi>Cyprian's</hi> grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> If what <hi>Cyprian</hi> spake was weighed in the Ballance of his judgment, it would not be found light: and even Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himself confesseth, that <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Epistle for the proving of Baptizing Infants: which acknowledgment (saith Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi>) streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens my opinion of the worth of <hi>Cyprians</hi> grounds; for two such eminent men would not have relyed on that which had no weight in it. But what are the weak grounds which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> mentions?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because he and his Council held, that Baptism was simply necessary to Salvation.</hi> But is not this more than Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can prove? I do not find the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diburgs</hi> mention it; although Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> saith, <hi>Tossa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> notes it for <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Error, That Infants should be baptized <hi>ne pereant,</hi> lest they perish.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That it washeth away original sin, so as it is never to be imputed.</hi> This is the judgment of many
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106704:54"/>
learned Protestant Divines, especially the famous Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Epistle speaks positively, <hi>Omnes Infantes baptizati, ab originalis peccati reatu absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuntur.</hi> Others are not so general, but conceive it to be a truth with respect to Elect Infants: and they judg they have good reason to conclude, that since they must be discharged from the guilt of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sin, or cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, God doth apply the Blood of his Son to them, in the use of that Ordinance of Baptism.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Because the Grace of God is to be tendred to all, therefore all Children should be Baptized.</hi> I see no such weakness in this; for though it be laid down in such general terms, that Grace is to be tendred to all, and none hindred from coming to Christ; yet, as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> observes, what he saith, ought to be understood of the Church, because he speaks of such as God hath cleansed, or purified; and 'twas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such, that <hi>Fidus</hi> stood in need to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to the time of Baptizing; and the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs</hi> conjecture, that <hi>Fidus Episcopus ad Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num scripserat,</hi> he had written to <hi>Cyprian</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Because Children have lesser sins than others.</hi> This is harsh: but you must know, this is Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s dress. The <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> express it otherwise, thus; <hi>Si quid hominem impedire a baptismo, potius adultos, peccata sua arcere deberent, quam Infantes, qui nihil peccaverunt, nisi quod ex peccato Originis vitia tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hant;</hi> which is to this effect: Grown Persons should rather keep off from Baptism by reason of their Sins, than Infants, which have contracted no guilt but that which is Original. I hope there is no great hurt in this.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Because in their first birth they do nothing but pray, crying, and weeping.</hi> Well said Mr. <hi>Danvers!</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106704:54"/>
the words are these; Because in their first beginning (or birth) crying and weeping, they can do nothing but call for Mercy: which (what ever ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may think of it) is a high strain of Rhetorick in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> importing only, that Children are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Mercy.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Because the Soul that is not baptized is lost.</hi> This is to the same purpose with the first: but the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgs</hi> have it not, nor Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> who translates the Epistle to <hi>Fidus</hi> out of the Greek, at the end of his Consideration of the practice of the Church of Baptizing Infants. Therefore Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> must find it elsewhere, or else he split the first Reason into two; <hi>cujus est dar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, ejus est disponere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two other things which he brings as reasons why he questions this Council, which are very frivolous; as That <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian's</hi> Master, was against Infants-Baptism; which is not so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, for he was for it in danger of Death: and the other is, That many things were fathered on <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> which were none of his. If I should let but this one pass, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would cry out against me for partiality. But, why should he fancy that this of Infants-Baptism, was one of those things fathered upon <hi>Cyprian?</hi> when the Council is owned by the <hi>Magdeburgs,</hi> the Fathers Greek and Latine, and even by Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himself, as before.</p>
               <p>His third Reason I have spoken to already, being co-incident with the latter part of his first.</p>
               <p>One thing I had almost forgotten, and that is; whereas in my <hi>Infant-Baptism Asserted,</hi> I tell Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> that his pretended Witness <hi>Tertullian</hi> was as corrupt as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and that the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us that he was the first inventor of Chrysm,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106704:55"/>
and that <hi>Cyprian</hi> belike took it up from him; he retorts in his <hi>Reply</hi> thus, That if <hi>Tertullian</hi> was the first inventor of Chrysm, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls an Apostolical Tradition, what credit then (saith he) is to be given to his Testimony that dare to avouch so fearful a Lye? A rude speech! altogether unfit to be uttered against so glorious a Martyr as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was; but any thing is good enough to be spoken in contempt of those who are for Infant-Baptism. But I assure the Reader, that as there is no good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, so neither is there truth in that passage of Mr. <hi>D's:</hi> for I cannot find that <hi>Cyprian</hi> held Chrysm an Apostolical Tradition; it being not reckon'd amongst his <hi>Naevi,</hi> which after the <hi>Magdeburg's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count are six, and the last is, <hi>Sumpsit Ceremonias, ex Traditionibus Montani a Tertulliano, consecrationem &amp; unctionem post Baptismum;</hi> That is, he took up the Ceremonies, <hi>viz.</hi> Consecration and Unction, (that is, Chrism) from <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of the Traditions of <hi>Montanus.</hi> Here's nothing of Apostolical Tradition. And <hi>Hamelmannus</hi> shews what Traditions <hi>Cyprian</hi> held, that he took up the Ceremonies of Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Unction from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but not a word of calling it an Apostolical Tradition.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in this Section more, but only that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth endeavour to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from a mistake about <hi>Austin's</hi> words, which I charged upon him; but it is so intricate and dark, that I do not very well understand him. Also there is some disparagement cast by him upon that blessed Martyr of Jesus Christ, Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> and a fling against the <hi>New-England</hi> way of baptizing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren only of In-Churched Parents, with some other Reflections which I let pass as futilous, having no mind to spend time in such small matters.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> Wherein <hi>Mr. Danvers</hi> endeavours to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his Witnesses against my Exceptions, and the same examined and found insufficient.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. HE begins with particular persons; but first minds me, with my penuriousness <hi>in my Preface to Infants-Baptism,</hi> where I allow him from the first Century to the end of the twelfth only two Persons against Infant-Baptism, viz. <hi>Adrianus,</hi> and <hi>Hincmarus.</hi> But what will he think of me now? for I have denied him those two also, as before; and have shewed the ground of the mistake why they have been looked upon under the notion of Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptists.</p>
            <p>The first witness mentioned is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who (saith Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>) opposeth it in six Arguments. We shall inquire into them by and by. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith true, that I acknowledg <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath divers passages seemingly against Infants-Baptism: but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humor, he is catching me up before I am down: for he calls upon the Reader to take notice, that his witness is owned by me. And is it not a very great owning indeed, to say, he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers passages that seem to be against it? But in the 38 <hi>page of my Infant Baptism,</hi> I give a Reason why it's more than probable that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism; in the 41 <hi>page,</hi> That he was no more against their baptizing, than of grown persons bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing; and in the 43 <hi>page,</hi> we shewed that the Reason why he would have Infants-Baptism delayed,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106704:56"/>
was, not because he judged it unlawful, but inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; for he was for it, rather than the Child should dye unbaptized. And now I tell Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> further, that as for those seeming passages against Infant-Baptism, they are spoken in reference to the Children of Pagans, not Believers, according to the judgment of <hi>Estius</hi> and other Learned Men: for (as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> observes) <hi>Tertullian</hi> in that <hi>Book</hi> of his <hi>de Baptismo c.</hi> 18. speaks of the Baptism of such as were not born of Christian Parents, and therefore desires the Baptism of such Infants should be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till they come to years, and be able to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their sins, and profession of Faith, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being Infidels, and their Sponsors mortal. And that this is the meaning of the place, seemed evident to him, because in the 39 <hi>chap.</hi> of his Book <hi>de Anima, Tertullian</hi> acknowledgeth that the Children of Believers had a priviledg <hi>tam ex Seminis praero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativa, quam ex institutionis disciplina;</hi> a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by their birth, besides that of their Education. And by this time me thinks Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should be sick of his Witness <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> said to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in the same case.</p>
            <p>As touching the Reasons which <hi>Tertullian</hi> urgeth for the delay of the Baptism of Infants, and which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> undertakes to Vindicate as proper and good, against those who would make those words, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,</hi> to be a coming to Baptism, I shall only remind him with two or three things.</p>
            <p>1. With what we have from the <hi>Magdiburgs Cent.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 83. <hi>Sentit Tertullianus in libro de Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismo, mira opinione, pueros non tam cito baptizandos osse, at<expan>
                     <am>

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106704:56"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tertullian (say they) is of a strange opinion to disswade the Baptizing of Children by such Reasons as he gives in his paraphrase upon the 19 of <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. None that ever I heard of, have brought this Text of coming to Christ, as a full and direct proof for baptizing of Children, or have urged that the coming there was a coming to Christ for Baptism, who never Baptized any; nevertheless it proves two points, which lay a good foundation for Infants-Baptism. 1. That the Kingdom of God is made up as well of Infants as grown persons. 2. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy is no Bar or exclusion of any from coming to Christ and receiving a Blessing. Infants are capable of receiving benefit by Christ, though they do not actually believe; though they cannot lay hold on Christ, yet Christ can lay hold on them, and bless them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But Baptism is not concerned in the Text, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can be made out that Blessing was Baptizing.</p>
            <p>To this I replyed in my former Answer, That it's true, Blessing is not Baptizing, but 'tis something more; and Christ in Blessing them, vouchsafed that to them, which usually was as an Ordinance admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred after Baptism, and which is of an higher nature, and so we may argue from this to Baptism inclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or <hi>à majori,</hi> from the greater to the less. 2. And further, though Blessing be not Baptism, yet in as much as they were of the Kingdom of Heaven whom he blest [let it be meant if you will of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, it supposeth that they must be first of the Kingdom of Grace, and were of the visible Church, and so it comes all to one] it follows, they were qualified Subjects for Baptism. For, grant to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106704:57"/>
Children a Church relation (as I have proved it is their Right), and their right to Baptism will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably follow upon it. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> might have done well to have shewn us the weakness of our arguings from this Text, as containing in it a good foundation for Infants-Baptism, instead of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to vindicate <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Paraphrase thereon, grounded on a mistake, as if Pedobaptists made the word <hi>Come</hi> in the Text, to be a coming to Baptism. And for <hi>Tertullian's</hi> reasons against Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens coming to Baptism, I shall not scruple upon second thoughts, to say they are childish ones, and the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> wonder at their silliness.</p>
            <p>For, 1. (saith he) Children cannot come till they are elder, till they know &amp; are taught why they come; and may not the same be as well urged against the circumcising Children of old? Let them stay till they are older, till they can know what the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance meaneth.</p>
            <p>2. And then for the weightiness of the Ordinance, in which regard he would have them forbear; were there not also many deep Mysteries wrapt up in Circumcision? As that it was a seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Did it not shadow forth the mortification of Sin, Regeneration, and Redemption by the blood of Christ? And was it not a ridiculous reason which he gave why young men, and those who were newly married, and young widows should delay Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism? namely, That the lust of concupiscence should be first extinguisht. One would rather have suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Ordinance might have proved a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against such violent passions as they were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be subject to: for the more temptation any state is obnoxious to, the more need it hath of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106704:57"/>
Helps, specially such as do not only lay ingagments, but contribute strength, as Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> speaks. Most of the rest of his reasons, as our Divines observe, do argue that his words for the putting off Infants-Baptism, are to be expounded of <hi>Aliens;</hi> as that about not giving holy things to dogs; and that of the Inconveniency by reason of the mortality of Sponsors, or Sureties, for in that Chapter he is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Infidels as we have shewed before.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> being willing to make the most of a little, will not by any means part with this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (such as it is) and therefore brings in Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> to confirm it, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> disliked Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as unwarrantable and irrational: but the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor having now declared his Judgment, I hope Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will for the future forbear quoting him as he hath done. Then we have <hi>Daille, Scultetus,</hi> and the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> &amp;c. But we have told you before, from learned men, that it is to be understood of the children of Pagans; to which we may add, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Junius</hi> (that famous Expositor) concurring with them.</p>
            <p>As for the Testimony he brings from B. <hi>Rhenanus</hi> of the ancient Custom of baptizing those of full growth, we have spoken to it already, and shewed how grosly Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> did mistake him. And for the rest of his Regiment, <hi>Vincentius, Victor, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribertus, Cresconius, Fulgentius, Regienses, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi> the <hi>Swermers, Arnoldus, Henricus, &amp;c.</hi> We shall confer with him about these, or the most of them, very shortly; and when this is over, he wil have no need to complain of my silence (which he saith gives consent to the whole) or of my unfair and disingenuous dealing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106704:58"/>Lastly, he endeavours to clear himself from some exceptions, which I have made against some of his witnesses, saying they are frivolous; which whether it be so, I leave to the Reader to judg.</p>
            <p>1. I tell him <hi>Berinus</hi> is nothing to his purpose: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is evident that his Sayings have respect to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: But that he conceives will not do, because <hi>Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> saith, Baptism ought not to be administred to any without Instruction. But I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> that <hi>Bede</hi> saith no such thing, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. c. 16. nor any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else that I can find. Indeed <hi>l. 3. c. 7. Bede tells us of Berinus, that Britanniam perveniens, ac primum Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissorum gentem ingrediens, cum omnes ibidem Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos inveniret, utilius esse ratus ibi potius Verbum Dei praedicare, quam ultra progrediens eos quibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare deberet requirere: ita<expan>

Aquinas</hi> or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the profoundness of his speculation, and subtilty of his distinction; there being none, I am confident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, able to perform such an undertaking.</p>
            <p>2. Next I blame him for bringing in <hi>Durandus</hi> for Believers Baptism in opposition to that of Infants, when he expresseth himself positively for Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and most severely against the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> For this he hath nothing to excuse himself, but that <hi>Durandus</hi> is in his Index, but he doth not know how, put in among the witnesses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106704:58"/>3. I charge him with another falshood, in b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bishop of <hi>Apamen</hi> among his witnesses: because, though he were for Rebaptization of such as he conceived were not rightly baptized, yet was he not an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> as the word is now taken, for being against Infants-Baptism. Of this he would excuse himself if he could, by telling us the late <hi>Century</hi>-Writers do call him so in a modern sense; which is notoriously untrue.</p>
            <p>4. I charge him for abusing <hi>Peter Bruis,</hi> having nothing to evidence that he denyed Infants-Baptism but the lying Stories of <hi>Abbots:</hi> but he saith he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced three or four evidences more to prove it. But I can find only two, <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 1. in the 290 page. The first is that of the <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgs, Cent.</hi> 12. p. 843. where they tell us nothing but what they take from <hi>Cluniacensis,</hi> and so name his Hypotheses, or Opinions, quoting that <hi>Abbot</hi> for every thing: But withal manifest their suspicion that he wronged him with an <hi>utinam vero ipsius Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri scripta extarent, ex quibus multo rectius facere Judicium liceret, quam ex illis, qui in defensionem Pontificiarum abominationum conspirarunt:</hi> Would to God the writings of <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> were extant, for out of them we might give a truer Judgment, than from them who have conspired to defend the Popish Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. And then again (say they) <hi>non est certum &amp;c.</hi> It is not certain, that they were for the rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Children baptiz'd in their Infancy, when they come to be of Age, <hi>nam malevoli quaedam commentiti sunt, p.</hi> 836. they feign some things, &amp; then fasten them <hi>per vitiosas consequentias,</hi> by vicious consequences. The other is <hi>Osiander,</hi> &amp; he takes it up at second hand from the <hi>Magdiburgs;</hi> &amp; saith withal, that what <hi>Peter</hi>

               </hi> and others are charged with, 'tis from their Enemies; and 'tis uncertain whether they held those things: for the Papists did charge them with gross things, because they inveighed against their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>Osiander Cent.</hi> 12. L. 3. C. 3. And when I read these passages in the <hi>Century</hi>-writers, I could not but wonder Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should have no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of what he writes; and thus go about to delude the Reader, by telling him he quotes others besides those lying <hi>Abbots</hi> in this matter.</p>
            <p>5. I accuse him for traducing <hi>Wickliff,</hi> he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ground at all to say he denyed Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; and when I discoursed with Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> I told him this story that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> confidently reports that <hi>Wickliff</hi> was of their way: to which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently said, I have <hi>Wickliff</hi> by me, and could never observe any such thing in him.</p>
            <p>But how doth Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> make good what he affirms of <hi>Wickliff?</hi> why, he tells us he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced much evidence to prove it <hi>pag.</hi> 283: even to 289 of his <hi>Treatise of Baptism Edit.</hi> 2. demonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only that Believers were the only subjects of Baptism, but withal, that Children were not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally to be baptized.</p>
            <p>To this I replyed in the Recapitulation at the end of my Answer, that the name of <hi>Wickliff</hi> being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would fain get somthing out of him for his turn. But I must tell Mr. <hi>D.</hi> that all that he hath produced to prove <hi>Wickliff</hi> against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism, is very insufficient to prove him so. His asserting, <hi>that there are only two Sacraments;</hi> and <hi>that Believers are to be baptized in pure water, thô they have received the Baptism of the Spirit,</hi> is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant to his purpose. His 3d Assertion indeed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106704:59"/>
is considerable, if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can prove he ever said so, <hi>viz:</hi> That Believers are the only subjects of Baptism; as appears (sayes he) in his 11 <hi>Chap-Trial:</hi> where he saith, that <hi>persons are first to be baptized with that he calls the first or insensible Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> viz. <hi>in the blood of Christ, before they are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in water; without which their Baptism in water profits not.</hi> One would think this was certainly so, because Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is so free as to give us <hi>Wickliffs</hi> own words, which he subjoyns to his translation. But it thereby appears he hath so grosly perverted the sense, that I cannot conjecture the reason of his so doing, unless he presum'd his quoting the Original would satisfie the Reader he had rightly translated it, and so <hi>supersede</hi> any further examination. If that was his design 'twas boldly done; but the discovery doth not advance his Reputation. For <hi>Wickliff</hi> doth not say that persons are first to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the insensible Baptism, as Mr. D. would make us believe, but only this, <hi>that one without the other avails not to Salvation.</hi> And how doth this prove Believers the only subjects of Baptism? The rest of his proofs are just like these, that is, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant; because indeed <hi>Wickliff</hi> was for Infant-Baptism, as I could plainly demonstrate from his own words. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath saved me that labour, having done it so substantially already in his Answer to Mr. D. (see his <hi>More proofs for Infant-Baptism,</hi> lately printed) <hi>p. 354, &amp;c.</hi> as must needs satisfie all impartial Readers, and convince Mr. D. himself of his mistake, if he is not resolved to stand out against the clearest evidences: To him therefore I refer them both. But suppose <hi>Wickliff</hi> had not been so very express in his words as to this point;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106704:60"/>
yet his making an <hi>apparent difference</hi> between the children of Believers and others, in his saying, <hi>Quod definientes,</hi> not, <hi>desinentes</hi> (as Mr. D.) <hi>parvulos fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um sine baptismo sacramentali, decedentes non fore salvandos in hoc presumptuosi et stolidi.</hi> And that <hi>ample Testimonial</hi> which the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> gave him, is enough (if we had no more) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front Mr. D. although he had the confidence to print them both in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism,</hi> from whence the Reader hath ground enough to infer (unless he first supposes <hi>Wickliff</hi> considered not what he wrote, and the whole University were Anabaptists) that he was not against Infants-Baptism. And give Mr. D. as good ground to expunge <hi>Wickliff</hi> out of his Index of witnesses as <hi>Durandus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last place, he complains of another piece of injurious dealing in me, and that is for fathering so notorious a Fallacy upon the Reader, and Abuse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; because I charge him for bringing in a great Bed-Roll of Witnesses against Infants-Baptism, when those men were so firmly for it, as <hi>Austin, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, &amp;c.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for so doing (nowithstanding his equivocation) appears by this: for though he would excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by saying they were not in his Catalogue, yet they are found in his 7th Chapter of his <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 1. which serves to prove that Believers Baptism is the only true Baptism; and that I do not wrong him, let the Reader Judg, when he hath lookt upon the Contents of the same just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after the Preface, as also the 56 Page of the first Edition <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>

               <head>His pretended Witnesses the Waldenses, found not to be against Infants-Baptism, but for it, and what is said to the Contrary, answered.</head>
               <p>That the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were against Infants-Baptism he labours to prove by a four-fold Demonstration. (1) <hi>from their Confessions of Faith: (2) the Witness thereto by their most eminent men: (3) from the decrees of Councils, Popes, and Emperours, against the body of the people for the same: (4) from the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps thereof they have left in the several Regions, and Countries where they have been dispersed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I replyed in the first place: (1) That there are no such Confessions to be found; <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted</hi> p. 46. (2) That the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears by their Confessions of Faith, witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing how firmly they did assert Infants-Baptism, p. 40. and 64. of the same Book.</p>
               <p>To both which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> makes reply, (<hi>viz</hi>) that it may be manifest to the Reader that their Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fessions do exclude Infants from Baptism, and witha gives in a parallel betwixt what their Confessions say, and what (as he words it) I make them to say, and so leaves it to the Reader to judg, how fairly I have dealt therein; and truly 'tis my desire also that the Reader compare us with the Confessions, and see which of us hath dealt most fairly or foully with them.</p>
               <p>There are five Confessions of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> besides some passages out of a Treatise, to which Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> hath recourse for information touching their Faith and Practice about Baptism.</p>
               <p>There are two things, to be observed in US, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to these Confessions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:106704:61"/>1. What Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> picks out of them for his purpose as he conceives.</p>
               <p>2. Whether I have offered any Violation, by mangling the Confessions, or leaving out any thing that is material against Infants-baptism, which I desire the <hi>Reader</hi> the more diligently to note, because this is another of his great charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me in his Preface.</p>
               <p>1. The first Confession that is quoted by Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism</hi> bears date 1220, of which this is the 13 Article (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>They say we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg no other Sacraments but Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.</hi> I have not left out a word of this; and I told him in my answer, that to bring this Article, was rather a witness of his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than against Infants-Baptism, and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on second thoughts this is cashier'd, for we have it not in the Reply.</p>
               <p>The next is the 28 Article of another Confession, <hi>That God doth not only instruct us by his Word, but has also ordained certain Sacraments to be joyn'd with it, as a means to unite unto, and to make us partakers of his benefits, and that there be only two.</hi> In my Answer, I left out the begining of this Article, that is, [that God instructs us by his Word] which I am sure containeth nothing in it against Infants-Baptism; and also the latter part of the Article, which runs thus [belonging in Common to all the Members of the Church, under the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (<hi>viz</hi>) Baptism and the Lords Supper.]</p>
               <p>Another ancient Confession of Faith hath this, Artic. <hi>7. We do believe that in the Sacrament of Baptism, Water is the visible and external sign, which represents unto us that (which by the invisible ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106704:61"/>
                  <hi>of God operating) is within us, the Renovation of the Spirit, and mortification of our Members in Jesus Christ, by which also we are receiv'd into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Congregation of the people of God, there profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and declaring openly our Faith, and Amendment of Life.</hi> Here was left out a Parenthesis (<hi>viz</hi>) (by the invisible vertue of God operating) and the last Clause, by which also we are received into the Congregation &amp;c. And with respect to this Article, I have this saying in my Answer, namely, that there is a Harmony between all the Protestant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the World, and the <hi>Waldenses</hi> (in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.)</p>
               <p>The next is out of <hi>Vigniers History,</hi> where the words are thus: <hi>They expresly declare, to receive the Canon of the Old and New Testament, and to reject all Doctrines which have not their foundations in it, or are in any thing contrary to it: therefore all the Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church of Rome they condemn and abominate, saying she is a den of thieves, and the Apocalyptical Harlot.</hi> This Confession Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath left out in his Reply, and I know not the reason, unless it be beeause I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word of it exactly, and it would have hurt his <hi>Parallel</hi> if it had been set down.</p>
               <p>In their Ancient Confession, Artic. 11. <hi>We e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for an Abomination and Antichristian, all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, as a trouble &amp; prejudice to the liberty of the Spirit.</hi> And in their Ancient Catechism thus; <hi>When humane Traditions are observed for Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, then is he worshipped in vain, and which is done when Grace is attributed to the external Ceremonies, and persons enjoyned to partake of Sacraments, without faith and Truth.</hi> I have also set down every word of this,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106704:62"/>
and made this Paraphrase on it in my Answer. This is a good Testimony against humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but doth not in the least touch Infants<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism, as also against the Popish error, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism confers grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> from the work done: for that's the meaning of attributing Grace to the external Ceremony here mentioned.</p>
               <p>In their Ancient Treatise concerning Antichrist they say, <hi>that he attributes the regeneration of the Holy-Spirit unto the dead outward work of Baptizing Children into that Faith,</hi> [<hi>that Faith</hi> was omitted] <hi>and teaching that thereby Regeneration must be had:</hi> the words are, [Baptism and Regeneration, must be had] I left out [Baptism] because it seems to make it nonsense, as it is there placed.</p>
               <p>Also the conclusion of the Sentence was preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, which is [grounding therein all his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, which is against the Holy-Spirit.] Upon this Article I have thus Paraphrased in my Answer. Here at last, by good hap, we have the word Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren named, but not a jot serving Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his design, for they do not hereby except against Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens-Baptism, but only against the corrupt ends that Antichrist hath in it; for whether it be in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or grown Persons, it is an Antichristian, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Tenent, to ascribe Regeneration to the dead out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of Baptism; and this is that before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that Baptism confers Grace, <hi>ex opere operato.</hi> And because the <hi>Waldenses</hi> did deny that it did thus conser Grace, the Papists, did accuse them that they denied <hi>Gratiam Baptismi:</hi> And for refusing to have their Children Baptized with the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rites of Salt, Oyl Spittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they charg'd them with denying Insant-Baptism. This is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106704:62"/>
of <hi>Bishop Usher</hi> in his <hi>Succession of the Church,</hi> where he treats of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and their Faith at large. If I had been mistaken in my Paraphrases up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the above-mentioned Confessions, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should have rectified me, and forborn the out-cry which he makes in his Preface, for abusing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of the <hi>Waldenses;</hi> and some that look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a Book than the Preface will suppose me to be guilty of a notorious Crime. But as to this also I freely submit my self to the Judgment of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and refer it to his consideration, whether <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> be not by him rather abused, than vindicated. He chargeth me deeply of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in misrepresenting their Confessions in many material and considerable parts; but I perswade my self an impartial eye cannot discern it; but 'tis easily observed how unfaithful he is at the same time in misrepresenting my words, and fathering that on me, which is not mine, but his own Invention, on purpose, forsooth, that he might have a <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratum</hi> for his following <hi>Queries;</hi> for he makes me to say, that there was a Harmony betwixt all the Protestant Churches in the World, (<hi>in those Articles</hi>) and the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> because all that are for Infants-Baptism believe the same. Had I said those words in reference to every Article, it had been truth; whereas I do only speak it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to one of them, and that is to the third; and what is spoken by me, with respect to one of them, he represents as spoken of all, the better to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate his <hi>Quibling Queries.</hi> It is sad to see how much he doth Abuse those Confessions, how he doth wire-draw them; as if they were Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal with <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106704:63"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Record; how he draws <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> every thing out of any thing. Never was any Confessions in the world so prostituted to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt fancy; for thus he begins:</p>
               <p>1. Do all the Pedobaptists believe that Baptism and preaching the Word are joyn'd together to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the baptized parties, and that thereby they have union with Christ, and partake of his benefits? Observe how Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> stumbles at the Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, how he preverts the Article. For look back upon the Article, and you will find it doth not say that Baptism and Preaching are joyned together to instruct the Baptized party; Baptism is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Article, though it be included in the word [Sacraments]; afterward the Article speaks thus, That we are instructed by the Word, and then that God hath ordained the Sacraments to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, as a means to unite us to him.</p>
               <p>2. Do they indeed, saith he, believe the Lord's Supper to belong in common with Baptism to all the Members of the Church? why then do not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants partake of one as well as the other, since it belongs to them in Common, if Members of the Church? Why, if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would know the reason, it is this, Because though the Child has a right as a Member to all the Ordinances, yet he is not in a capacity to enjoy his right, thus; That persons may have a right to Ordinances, and yet in no capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to enjoy them, appears in such as are sick, or those that lose their Reason, that are Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>3. Do Paedo-baptists indeed with the <hi>Waldenses</hi> believe, that Water in Baptism is the usual sign, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the subjects thereof the invisible vertues
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106704:63"/>
of God operating in them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Renovation of the Spirit, and Mortification of their Members? and can it be truly said it is so to an Infant that is not capable to put forth any act of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or Mortification, or discern the least sign in the Water? Yes, it may be said, it is so to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, very well, and that upon as good a ground, as Circumcision shadowed forth Mortification of Sin, Regeneration, though the Israelitish Babes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood none of this. But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth ill again in altering the Article, as you may perceive by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, for it is not as he represents it: the Article runs thus; We believe that in the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, Water is the visible and external sign (which represents to us) [not representing to the Subjects] for unless I mistake, as it is so worded, it serveth more to his purpose.</p>
               <p>4. We agree with the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in the 4th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; for we have told Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> formerly that Baptism it self is a real, though implicit, profession of Faith, and the express verbal Confession of the Parent is reputed by God to be the Childs, and so it was under the Law, when the Parents humbled themselves, and confessed their sins, and brought their little ones with them, even they also are said to be humbled before the Lord.</p>
               <p>5. The 5th Query is precarious, taking that for granted, which we utterly deny, and that is, that the baptizing Children, is an Antichristian humane Invention.</p>
               <p>6. Do they believe, saith Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist grounds all Christianity, and Religion in the baptizing of Children, attributing Regeneration to the outward Work done contrary to the Holy-Spirit,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106704:64"/>
why then, saith he, do they baptize Children, which as acknowledged is the <hi>Basis</hi> and Foundation of the false Church, and contrary to the Spirit, and for which there is nothing but the Doctrine of Popes, and Antichristian Councils, to warrant it? Not to say any thing of these unworthy reflections, let the Reader once more take notice how he hath also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted this Article, look back, and you will see what a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he makes of it, and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoseth the Article into another thing; for do but observe, (1.) They do not say Antichrist grounds all Christianity in Baptizing Children; but if they had spoken it, it had not been against Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, but against placing too much in it. (2.) They say Antichrist attributes Regeneration to the dead outward work of Baptizing Children, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation must be had thereby, and herein they say, he grounds all Christianity. (3.) It is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scandalous and false for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to say, that there is nothing for Infants-Baptism, but the decrees of Popes and Antichristian Councils, when we have so fully proved the use of it some hundreds of years before the coming of the Pope, in the sense that the word is commonly taken, (<hi>viz.</hi>) for Oecumenical Bishop, challenging to himself, and usurping Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the whole Church: have we not before told him, of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> &amp;c. and was there not a Canon for it in the <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitan</hi> Council, and that before the Pope came in, or any of his Decrees?</p>
               <p>So that now, upon consideration of the premises, I suppose the unprejudiced Reader may be confirmed that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were for Infant-Baptism, by those very Confessions which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> cites against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:106704:64"/>
We shall now give you some account of some of their Confessions, which speak them expresly for it.</p>
               <p>There is an ancient Confession that we meet with in Dr. <hi>Ushers Succession of the Church.</hi> c. 8. p. 242. made by the <hi>Waldenses</hi> about the year 1176. as he takes it from <hi>Jacobus Gretserus</hi> his <hi>proleg.</hi> in <hi>Script. Edit. contra Waldenses.</hi> c. 1. and <hi>Hovenden's Annal.</hi> fol. 329. the words are, <hi>Nos Credimus unum Deum trinum &amp; unum patrem, &amp; filium, &amp; spiritum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> &amp;c. and in the body of the Confession there is this Article, <hi>Credimus parvulos salvari per Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> we believe Children are saved by Baptism: which though it speak Error according to the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those times, being about five hundred years since; yet it proves they were for Infant-Baptism, for <hi>Gretserus</hi> saith they were <hi>Waldenses</hi> that made this Confession, and not as is falsly suggested, that it was the Inquisitors Confession; for it was made before the Inquisitors, to purge themselves from the <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Manichean</hi> Heresies, of which they were accused.</p>
               <p>Another Confession, is that published by <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar Lydias,</hi> which was presented to <hi>Uladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where after they have given an account of their Faith in other points, they come to that of Baptism, and having spoken of Adult Baptism, they add, <hi>professio ista nostra etiam in pueros extenditur,</hi> our Profession concerning Baptism extends also to Children,</p>
               <p>But against this Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> objects, That this Confession said to be made by the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> to King <hi>Uladislaus,</hi> were not <hi>Waldenses,</hi> as they themselves acknowledg in the preamble. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells us out of <hi>Osiander,</hi> that they were a mixt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106704:65"/>
People of <hi>Calextines</hi> that separated from <hi>Rome</hi> in the business of the Cup: <hi>Hussites</hi> that went further than they; <hi>Thaborites</hi> that were more thorow for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and under these were comprehended the Brethren, or <hi>Picards,</hi> many of whom did oppose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism, whereas Dr. <hi>Burigenus</hi> that writ their Apology speaks otherwise, and gives this title to it, <hi>Apologia verae Doctrinae eorum, qui vulgò appellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Waldenses, vel Picardi, qui retinuerunt</hi> Johannis Hus <hi>Doctrinam;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) The Apology of the true Doctrine of those, who are commonly called <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> or <hi>Picards,</hi> who have retained the Doctrine of <hi>John Hus:</hi> so that this differs quite from the Tale which Mr. <hi>D.</hi> hath told us again and again. And whereas he speaks of the Title of the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby it appears they disclaim'd the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Waldenses,</hi> he might have done well to have quoted some Authour where we might find it: but in defect thereof, I shall bring you an Author, that gives the Title without any hint thereof, and that is <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi> in <hi>fasciculo rerum expeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum,</hi> &amp;c. Thus. <hi>Nos Homines depressi ac vestrae Majestati humiliter subjecti, contemptibili quoque no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Amicti,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Burigenus</hi> that translated into Latin their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession from a <hi>Bohemian</hi> Copy, mentions this Article concerning Baptism, <hi>Iam Baptismus Christi aeque ad Pueros, qui ex fide illi offeruntur &amp; consecrantur, atquè ad adultos attinet:</hi> The Baptism of Christ doth as well belong to Children, who are offer'd up in Faith, and consecrated to him, as unto grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

the charge of denying Infants-Baptism, and shew the reason why for a long time they forbore it, namely, because they could not endure to have it done in the corrupt Popish way: and in the third part of the aforesaid History, we have their Doctrine set down thus; <hi>And whereas Baptism is Administred in a full Congregation, and for this cause it is that we present our Children in Baptism, which they ought to do to whom the Children are nearest, as Parents.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> objects against the Confessions of <hi>Provence,</hi> so full to the point, that they were in a declining condition, that some of them went to Mass: what then? were they against Infant-Baptism before they declin'd? and did they take up the practice with the Mass? I believe Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth not think it: and he knows very well they recovered out of this Apostacy, after they had received those godly Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions from <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Truth, and gave proof thereof by their sufferings, in the violent persecution, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soon after, and was more raging than ever.</p>
               <p>There is one Confession more which Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers's</hi> Invention will not serve him to say any thing against, and therefore silently pretermits it, and it is that of <hi>Angrogne</hi> in the year 1535. where an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> from all the Valleys met, and there they signified what they understood of their Brethren of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> namely, that they sent into <hi>Germany</hi> their Pastors, to confer with <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> touching the belief they had time out of mind, where saith <hi>Perin</hi> in <hi>his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Waldenses lib. 2. cap. 4. pag.</hi> 57. when they had read certain Letters of encouragement sent from <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to those of <hi>Provence,</hi> concluded on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106704:66"/>
certain Articles as being conformable to the Doctrine which hath been taught from Father to Son for these many hundred years out of the Word of God: <hi>and Art. 17 is for Infants-Baptism, thus, Touching themat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament it hath been concluded by the H. Scriptures that we have two Sacramental Signs, the which Christ Jesus hath left unto us, the one is Baptism, the other the Eucharist, which we receive to shew what our perservance in the Faith is, as we have promised when we were baptized being little ones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This expression, <hi>As we have promised when we were baptized being little ones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> tells us, 2d <hi>Ed. pag.</hi> 313. is foisted into the Article, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and nonsensical, because an Infant is not capable to make a promise. But I don't judg Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> the fittest in the World to determine what is impertinent and nonsensical. And as wise-men as he, or any of his party, have affirm'd the same, and therefore that doth not prove it to be foisted in. For Instance, The Assembly in their larger Catechism tell us, that, Baptism is a Sacrament, &amp;c. <hi>whereby the parties baptized are solemnly admitted into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, and enter into an open and professed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, to be wholy and only the Lords.</hi> And in their very next Answer, tell us, the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are to be baptized. And Dr. <hi>Manton</hi> in the Supplement to the Morning Exercise Serm. 10. tells us, that <hi>Baptism is an open and real profession of Christ crucified, and that we must personally and solemnly own the Covenant made with God in Infancy.</hi> And many more I could produce, if need were, speaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after this manner; that yet understood themselves as well as Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> And why may we not suppose these <hi>Waldenses</hi> to be guilty of as much Impertinency and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106704:66"/>
Nonsensicalness as the Assembly and Dr. <hi>Manton?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. His 2d. Demonstration (as he calls it) is from particular eminent persons amongst them, which he would have us believe deny'd Infants-Baptism. As <hi>Berengarius</hi> in the 11th. <hi>Cent. Peter Bruis, Henricus,</hi> and <hi>Arnoldus</hi> in the 12th.</p>
               <p>1. For <hi>Berengarius</hi> he goes about to prove that he denied Infant-Baptism from <hi>Lanifrank,</hi> by <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi> out of <hi>Guitmond,</hi> by a Council called by H. 1. of <hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Thuanus,</hi> and then saith, that I except against none of these, but have this only for a Reply, that there were several Councils in which <hi>Berengarius</hi> was persecuted for the Real Presence, but no mention made of his denying Infants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>Seeing this general Reply doth not give Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> Satisfaction, I shall now be more particular; and convince him he had better have taken that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, than thus forced me to a more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination; by which I have made a further disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his guilt in abusing Authors. He begins with <hi>Launifrank</hi> to prove <hi>Beringarius</hi> against Infant-Baptism, and he tells us (2. <hi>Ed.</hi> p. 241, 242) out of the <hi>Magdeb. Cent.</hi> 11. cap. 5. p. 240, 243. [that <hi>Beringarius</hi> did publickly deny Transubstantiation, and Infant-Baptism under five heads; which <hi>Launifrank</hi> in his book called <hi>Scintillaris</hi> answered at large. And as for his denying Infant-Baptism, he answers (that is, <hi>Launifrank</hi>) by saying, he (that is, <hi>Beringarius</hi>) doth thereby oppose the general doctrine and universal consent of the Church.] And this is all Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath from <hi>Launifrank</hi> to prove <hi>Beringarius</hi> against Infant-Baptism. But this is a shameful mistake, and the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> say no such thing. They give us his <hi>Hypotheses de caenâ Domini:</hi> and his 6th Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106704:67"/>
against Transubstantiation, and <hi>Launifrank's</hi> answers to each: and tell us that <hi>ad Quintum &amp; Sextum,</hi> (that is to <hi>Beringarius</hi> his 5th and 6th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against Transubstantiation, (not against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism) <hi>Launifrank</hi> answers, <hi>Opposuit doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam perpetuam &amp; consentientem Ecclesiae Dei:</hi> So that this Authority is quite cashier'd; and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> must have an unparallel'd Confidence to attempt the retrieving him. The next is <hi>Cassander</hi> out of <hi>Guitmun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> who saith, that with the Real Presence, he denied Baptism to Little-Ones, though the latter not so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly as the former: but <hi>Guitmund</hi> and <hi>Cassander</hi> say, <hi>quem tamen Errorem in publicum non produxit;</hi> that is, <hi>he never publickly denied Infant-Baptism.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> translates it <hi>not</hi> [<hi>so</hi>] <hi>publickly,</hi> because else it might be presently queried, how then could <hi>Guitmund</hi> tell? and rather than lay such a stumbling-block in the way, he thinks it expedient to make bold with his Authors, and abuse them, than by telling truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive his Reader. This might be a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; but to give Mr. <hi>D.</hi> fuller satisfaction, I shall make a more particular inquiry into this business. And as for <hi>Guitmundus</hi> the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> tell us, <hi>Ait eum</hi> (Beringarium) <hi>de Baptismo Infan: &amp; de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugio non recte docuisse.</hi> Which proves him as much against Marriage as against Infant-Baptism. But Bp. <hi>Usher</hi> tells us in his book <hi>de successione, cap.</hi> 7. § 37. that <hi>Deoduinas Leodiensis,</hi> took it upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fame that <hi>Bruno</hi> and <hi>Beringarius</hi> did <hi>quantum in ipsis erat baptismum parvulorum evertere.</hi> And adds, <hi>deinde ex Leodiensis fide refert Guitmundus,</hi> so that <hi>Guitmundus</hi> took it from <hi>Leodiensis,</hi> who had it from common fame; which indeed arose from their deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be necessary to Salvation. As clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106704:67"/>
by <hi>Walden,</hi> charging <hi>Wickliff</hi> to deny it, who yet was so positive in the point as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath proved. And <hi>Usher</hi> also tells us that, <hi>In tot Synodis adversus Beringarium habitis nullam de Anabaptismo litem illi intentatam invenimus.</hi> Which further proves it. And whereas Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> insinuates (2 <hi>Ed. pag.</hi> 243, 244.) that <hi>Beringarius</hi> recants this opinion against Infant-Baptism, and then recanted his Recantation; there is not a word of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in his Recantation. He produceth also <hi>Thuanus</hi> to prove <hi>Beringarius</hi> and his followers were great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of Baptism after Faith (2. <hi>Edit. pag.</hi> 73.) and in his Reply <hi>pag.</hi> 116. He quotes his preface to his History to prove that the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Triers</hi> did persecute the <hi>Beringarians for denying Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi> It is true he tells us that the Arch-Bishop did <hi>eos diocesi sua expellere,</hi> because <hi>illius doctrinam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulis disseminarent;</hi> but that <hi>Thuanus</hi> should say he did it because they denyed Infant-Baptism, is one of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> mistakes, there being not the least sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any such thing in that Preface, or in the whole History that I can find.</p>
               <p>His last evidence to prove it, is a Council called by H. 1. of <hi>France,</hi> to suppress the heresies of <hi>Bruno</hi> and <hi>Beringarius</hi> for denying Transubstantiation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism: for which he quotes <hi>Bibliotheca Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum pag.</hi> 432. But I can't find either in <hi>Bibl. Pat.</hi> or the Councils, or any where else, (but in Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> book) that that Council ever charged <hi>Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> with denying Infant-baptism. Let Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> prove it if he can. And just after this rate doth he prove his matters.</p>
               <p>But suppose these Authors had affirmed what Mr. <hi>D.</hi> would make us beleive they did, yet it falls short
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106704:68"/>
of sufficient proof because the same sort of men charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> to be against Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and this we have acknowledged from Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> own pen in his <hi>Innocency and Truth vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,</hi> p. 127.</p>
               <p>The next of his Witnesses are <hi>Peter Bruis, Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Arnoldus;</hi> but of this I have spoken already that even the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> and <hi>Osiander</hi> (who relates what <hi>Peter Cluniacensis</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> say of them) do que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the Truth of what their wicked Adversaries lay to their charge, to which I refer the Reader, and shall only add what Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> says to Mr. <hi>Tombes:</hi> The truth is, saith he, these two men did for 20 years together so much spread the Doctrine of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and so plague the Bishops Mitre, and the Monks Bellies, that I wonder not though they charged any thing upon them, that might make them odious to the people. He that reads the railing Book of <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> will find, that he acknowledgeth most of what he layeth to their charge to be upon the report of others: He lays this to their charge, that Children that die before they could actually believe were damn'd, and that they did not altogether believe the Apostles, Prophets, no nor Christ himself. By their corrupt consequences, say the <hi>Magdiburgs,</hi> they would make them hold any thing, as before; To deny Chrisme, and Oyl, and Spittle in the baptizing of Children was all one with them. And if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> believes <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> did slander them in the other things, he must excuse us if we believe he did also in this about Infant-Baptism: One thing I shall mind the Reader with, and so pass on, and that is, the good Intelligence Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> holds,<note place="margin">☜</note> since almost all the Testimonies that he brings
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106704:68"/>
through-out all his Book, are borrowed either from <hi>Monks, Abbots, Jesuits, Inquisitors,</hi> or some Cankered <hi>Popish Priests</hi> that make no Conscience of loading the professors of the Truth with all manner of Calumnies.</p>
               <p>But, saith he, <hi>Cassander</hi> witnesseth the same in his Epistle to the <hi>Duke of Cleave (viz.)</hi> that <hi>Peter Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> and <hi>Henricus</hi> denyed Baptism to little ones, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that only the <hi>Adult</hi> should be baptized. 'Tis true, he saith so: and withal tells us [<hi>cum Baptismo &amp; fide etiam salutem et regnum Dei Infantibus ademe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quod ad credentes tantum et baptizatos pertine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re sensuerunt</hi>] with Baptism and Faith they took Salvation also from Infants, as judging it belonged only to Believers that were baptized: but how comes <hi>Cassander</hi> by this good intelligence? why, the <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Cluni</hi> told him so; and if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will not believe they damned all Infants, though the <hi>Abbot</hi> affirms it, why should we believe they denyed them Baptism for which he can produce no better proof? but if <hi>Cassander</hi> is a person of such credit with Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> I hope he will no longer reckon <hi>Peter Bruis</hi> and <hi>Henricus</hi> among the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Barbes;</hi> because he tells us in this very Epistle, that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were for Infants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> is also introduced to confirm it, how that they were condemned in the second Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Council, for rejecting Infants-Baptism: it is Common for the <hi>Popish</hi> Councils to condemn men for that which they never held. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us there is not the least proof of any such matter med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with in that Council.</p>
               <p>I let pass also <hi>Vice-comes,</hi> because he writes pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable lyes; how that <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> denyed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106704:69"/>
Infants-Baptism; and why? because (as Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> say's truly in his <hi>Reply, page</hi> 127) they did oppose and neglect to do it as the Church<note place="margin">☜</note> of <hi>Rome</hi> ordained it, without the Ceremonies of their Church, which was all one to them, as if it was not practised at all. We are much engaged to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> for this, he hath as it were spoken all in a word, given us a key to open the Mystery of the business, and rightly to understand why <hi>Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius, Peter Bruis, Arnoldus,</hi> were charged for denying Infants-Baptism. I must now prepare my self with Patience, for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is come to his <hi>Paroxysme,</hi> and would even move a <hi>Stoick.</hi> I perceive he is strangely transported with Passion, and makes Proclamation against me. <hi>Know,</hi> saith he, <hi>that hence you have a further discovery of his unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and want of Conscience, for daring thus to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the World with a Cheat, and that which he knows to be a mere forgery of his own—The Flame is not yet extinguished, but spreads into two pages more, and is rather increased. He hath injuriously belyed</hi> Osiander, <hi>belyed</hi> Cluniacensis, <hi>belyed</hi> Peter Bruis, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed the Truth, which by this forgery he would cover; abused the World, belyed and abused me, and much to be feared his own Conscience, by this piece of Folly and Falshood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what shall I say to all this? shall I implore an Increpation from above, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Danvers's</hi> Preface, <hi>I will not render railing for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being ever judg'd the sign of a bad cause, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to betake themselves to such courses, and thereby supply the want of matter with, Rage, Clamour and Noise.</hi> Who would not have judg'd Mr. <hi>D.</hi> by those lines a person able to command his Passion, yea a second <hi>Moses? Parsons</hi> the Jesuit, notwithstanding he wanted nothing but a Glass to view the <hi>Effigies</hi> of a <hi>Railer,</hi> yet he censureth the practice as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
               <p>But to speak something for Vindication from these foul, and shamefully-invective accusations: First, I confess my inadvertency in mistaking the <hi>Century,</hi> and from hence it was that I related things, charged upon the <hi>Albigenses</hi> of the 12 <hi>Cent.</hi> and applyed them to <hi>Peter Bruis,</hi> and <hi>Henricus of the 11th</hi> (though I find all of them joyned together by the <hi>Magdiburgs</hi> under <hi>Cent.</hi> 12th.)</p>
               <p>The occasion of this mistake was a cursory read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his Answer to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> (the Book being lent only for a day or two) where the said Doctor reckons up about 20 errors charg'd upon the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> as he hath it from <hi>Osiander.</hi> I profess, that I speak the truth, I had no design to misrepresent Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> pretended witnesses, and to cast a slur upon it; and I hope this is enough to satisfie the Ingenuous Reader, and may also work some Conviction in Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> of his uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Spirit, and the intemperancy of his Pen in such frequent Judgings of my Heart and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I did knowingly and out of design, go about to deceive the Reader: and what should tempt me hereunto? was it to cast Dirt on his Witness? How blind a thing is Prejudice! Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106704:70"/>
not Ignorant, that if that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been my Aim, I might have furnished my self with sufficiency of that nature even from <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> and <hi>Bernard:</hi> But he saith, I did it knowingly and went on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deceive; why so? because I picked only five particulars out of those twenty Articles that were laid to the Charge of the <hi>Albigenses:</hi> a Convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Argument! no doubt, though no body can fathom the Mystery of the Policy in so doing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I open it, which plainly is this. The reason why I transcribed no more out of Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> was, because I do not judg it commendable to write whole Pages and more out of Authors, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Names, as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> useth to do (2) It was done out of design, as he saith, because I knew <hi>Osiander</hi> saith, these things are not reported by <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> but by others; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I never read those things in <hi>Osiander,</hi> until Mr. <hi>Danvers's Reply</hi> came forth. (3) It must be so he concludes, because I neither mention <hi>Century, Book Chapter,</hi> or <hi>Page</hi> (for the greater blind no doubt) as he saith I use to do in other Quotations out of <hi>Osiander;</hi> whereas I have not mentioned, so much as one <hi>Chapter</hi> or <hi>Page</hi> out of <hi>Osiander</hi> in all my Answer to him.</p>
               <p>Thus Reader, thou see'st what this mighty Charge amounts to, and which is one of these heinous Crimes I have committed, mentioned in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to work prejudice against me: and if I were now given to Revenge, I could presently ballance accounts. He knows I have Advantage enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him for that shameful mistake of his in saying <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets that Promise <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. to be understood of the spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:106704:70"/>
when it was <hi>Estius</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> doth most expresly say the contrary (<hi>viz</hi>) that 'tis meant of the fleshly and natural Seed; and <hi>Estius</hi> declares his judgment against him. And if I were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to such <hi>Billings-gate</hi> language, I could retort upon him; He belyes <hi>Calvin,</hi> he belyes the <hi>Truth,</hi> which by that Forgery he would cover and hide, he abuseth the World with a Cheat, and much more fear his own Conscience by this piece of Folly and Falshood.</p>
               <p>3. As for his 3d Demonstration, that the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> were against Infants-Baptism, fetcht from the Catholique Emperours, and <hi>Popes</hi> Councils, and the rest of the Tribe that follows, <hi>Monkes, Abbots, Inquisitors,</hi> I shall believe it as much as that of <hi>Vice-comes,</hi> who saith not only <hi>Peter Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is &amp;c.</hi> was against Infants-Baptism, but also <hi>Calvin, Luther;</hi> nor will that serve Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> turn to tell us that they were so reputed, because they did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and neglect to Baptize Children as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ordained and practised, unless he can give us some assurance that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused and condemned by these Councils upon the same account.</p>
               <p>Moreover he tells us, <hi>Rainerius</hi> the Inquisitor in his Book <hi>Contra Waldenses,</hi> saith, <hi>de Baptismo dicunt quod ablutio quae datur infantibus nihil prosit, &amp;c.</hi> Concerning Baptism they say that that which is given to little ones profits nothing. And this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> would have noted, because I do positively deny, that <hi>Rainerius</hi> in the Catalogue of their Errors gives the least hint of any such thing, that they denyed Infants-Baptism. This is another of his great Charges against me in his Preface, where he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106704:71"/>
saith <hi>Rainerius</hi> tells us <hi>totidem verbis (i e)</hi> in so many words they denyed it.</p>
               <p>For Vindication of my self, let the Reader (1) know, That in my <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted</hi> p. 96. I quote Dr. <hi>Featly's Roma ruens</hi> for what I have said; who gives us a Catalogue of the Errors which <hi>Rainerius</hi> charged the <hi>Waldenses</hi> with in his Book <hi>Contra Waldenses, Chap.</hi> 4. and this of denying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism is not amongst those which he recites. (2) I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that the words he quotes don't prove, <hi>Rainerius</hi> charges them with denying Infants Baptism, for by <hi>nihil prosit,</hi> they intend only <hi>ad Salutem.</hi> But can Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> find any-where in <hi>Rainerius</hi> where he positively saith, the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were against the practice of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants? this I confess would be something to his purpose; but till then I perswade my self the impartial Reader will acquit me from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abused this Author, though Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> will not.</p>
               <p>Next he brings <hi>Favin</hi> the <hi>French-Chronologer</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying that in those times (<hi>viz</hi>) 12 and 13 <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies</hi> the <hi>Albigenses</hi> did deny Infants-Baptism e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming it superstitionus; no doubt as we have often made appear, their refusing those superstitious Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Chrism, Oyle, Spittle,</hi> annexed to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Papists, is the ground why they are by all Popish Writers represented to deny Infants-Baptism. Those two <hi>Abbots Cluniacensis</hi> and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of the 12 <hi>Cent.</hi> gave <hi>Favin</hi> this information; but <hi>Osiander</hi> says well, <hi>Hi autem Articuli Petro Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is ab adversariis adscribuntur;</hi> the Articles were charged by Adversaries: And then he adds, whether those Tenents were theirs, or no, <hi>non satis Certum est,</hi> it is not enough certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:106704:71"/>We are now come to another of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Charges, which will appear to be a strange mistake; so that I may truly say of him, if he cannot find a hole he will make one, to his own shame. In his <hi>Calumniating Preface</hi> he falsly represents me to have quoted <hi>Vice-comes,</hi> to prove that the Doctrine of opposing the Baptizing Infants of Believers, was no ancienter than the Anabaptists of <hi>Germany,</hi> and to make this good, he (with great Confidence) turns the Reader to page 60. of my <hi>Infants-Baptism As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,</hi> as if he should be sure to find it there: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as any body that will but peruse the page shall see, I quote <hi>Vice-comes</hi> to shew what a false account he gives of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> as if they denied Infants-Baptism; and besides, his Name is only in one place, in the Margent of my Book, and that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> who also quotes him for the same end, as is signified (<hi>viz.</hi>) to shew what little credit is to be given to Proofs from Popish-Writers against the <hi>Waldenses</hi> for denying Infants-Baptism, when they are so impudent, as to charge <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> with the same; who, (saith he) did in a special manner oppose this Error, and then he concludes thus: Unless some one dothout of their own Confessions give better evidence, I shall believe that this Doctrine of opposing of the Baptizing of the Infants of Believers is an Innovation no ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Anabaptists of <hi>Germany.</hi> And now let any man judge whether Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth not deal very unworthily, in accusing me, that I have abused the Reader by a Quotation from <hi>Vice-comes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how can the opposing the Baptizing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers be an Innovation no ancienter than the Anabaptists of <hi>Germany</hi> when we are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106704:72"/>
otherwise informed by <hi>Vice-comes</hi> in the same place where he accuseth <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anabaptists. For <hi>Vincentius, Victor</hi> (two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses made of one Mans name) <hi>Hincmarus</hi> of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> the <hi>Henerici</hi> and <hi>Apostolici</hi> (in <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Cluniacensis</hi> time) <hi>John Wickliff</hi> in his <hi>4th Book of Trialog. Walfrid, Strabo,</hi> (another <hi>Dichotomic</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of one Man, an excellent way to encrease the number of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Witnesses) <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> witnessed against it.</p>
               <p>In answer to these; as for <hi>Vincentius Victor</hi> I shall presently shew when I speak of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that he was not against Infants-Baptism. For <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> of <hi>Laudum,</hi> we have more than once vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him from this blot: the same we have done in the behalf of the <hi>Henricians,</hi> or <hi>Waldenses.</hi> And for <hi>Wickliff</hi> we have brought sufficient evidence to satisfie any rational Man, that he is so far from speaking a word in derogation of Infants-Baptism, that he is expresly for it. As for <hi>Strabo</hi> he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Infant-Baptism, and therefore when he saith none were anciently Baptized, but those who could profess their Faith, he intended only none that were Adult: But however we have given sufficient reason, why his word is not to be taken, being a false Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and a heedless Writer, condemned by <hi>Vossius,</hi> and others. Lastly, for <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> who is yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the former, hear what Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> speaks of them both. Must we (saith he) take the bare word of <hi>Vives,</hi> a Man of yesterday, or of <hi>Strabo</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, in things done so many hundred years before they were born? and that against the express witness of so many worthy men, who lived a hundred years before them? and I conceive he speaks to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106704:72"/>
purpose. For any indifferent Man will acknowledg, that <hi>Austin</hi> (who saith the Church always had, and always held Infant-Baptism) was more likely to know what was done in the Primitive times, than <hi>Strabo,</hi> who lived 400 years remoter from them, or than <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> that was above a thousand years further off from the times of which he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, than that ancient Father was.</p>
               <p>4. In the last place he attempts to prove the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> denyed Infants-Baptism, by the foot-steps found thereof, in those respective Regions and places where they had heretofore imprinted it, as <hi>Germany, Switzerland, Flanders, Holland, Bohemia, Hungaria, Transylvania, Poland, England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But as to this, I said in my <hi>Infants-Baptism As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,</hi> that for Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to tell us that the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers</hi> of Infants-Baptism, in <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>lower Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> (and in those other Countries) were the remains of those the <hi>Waldenses</hi> had before instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was his own private Conceit, forreign to all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story and hath no foundation in Reason or Truth; and whether I have not ground for that Assertion, let the Reader judg, when he hath perused what I have written in my Book from page 69, to 112. To most of which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> saith nothing at all, and therefore I conceive he is drain'd dry; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis true he persists in his former endeavours to palliate the horrid actings of the <hi>German</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, and asperseth me for my Reflections upon the story of <hi>Thomas Munzer,</hi> and <hi>John of Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly he presents us with further Testimony from a novel peice the <hi>Dutch Martyrology,</hi> that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> were against Infants-Baptism; concerning which I only say:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106704:73"/>1. That herein Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> produceth more Testimony than the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; For this Book is not to be found in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private Libraries, or the Booksellers Shops.</p>
               <p>2. It being it seems not yet translated into the English-tongue, though he hopes it may be in good time; if I could have met with it, I should not have understood, whether he relates things truly for want of an interpreter.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore we must take Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> word for all; both that there is such a Book, and that the passages he presents us with from thence, are truly translated.</p>
               <p>4. We dare not say of it, as the Papists do of Mr. <hi>Foxe's</hi> Book of Martyrs, that it is a Book of lyes; but this we say with Confidence, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of those Testimonies Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> takes from thence, are notorious untruths; and that <hi>Jacob Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Franck,</hi> are not to be credited having abused the World with such palpable false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods: neither is <hi>Twisk</hi> (another of them) found to be a true Chronologer, all which we shall suddenly make appear, when we come to shew their aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>5. Yea, some are of opinion that this <hi>Dutch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologie</hi> wherein we have such a Collection of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Martyrs for Anabaptism, is designedly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the Meridian of Anabaptistery, which whether it be probable, I leave to the Reader to judge, when he hath pondred the meaning of one passage, which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath quoted in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism, Edit.</hi> 2. p. 232. (viz.) <hi>Sebastian Frank</hi> (one of the Principal Authors frequently
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106704:73"/>
named in the Martyrologie) saith, that about the year 610 Childrens-Baptism was held in many places, of little esteem, by the learned endeavours of <hi>Adrianus,</hi> and others, and therefore the Popes set themselves to uphold it by the <hi>Braceren-Council:</hi> That the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and falshood hereof may appear, let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>1. That there is nothing of <hi>Adrianus</hi> extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Infants-Baptism, in the Century-Writers; but only the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> say, he was complained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by <hi>Gregory,</hi> to <hi>John Bishop of Larissa,</hi> That he turned away young Children from Baptism: But we have shewn before, that he was not against their Baptism, but only remiss in looking after the same in his Diocess; so that many Children died unbaptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which was then judged dangerous, and from hence he was reported to have turned them away from Baptism.</p>
               <p>2. There is none else in this Age, so much as sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected against the Baptism of Children, mentioned by the <hi>Century</hi>-Writers; and how grosly then is it said, of <hi>Sebastian Frank,</hi> that the practice thereof was of little esteem in this <hi>Century?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. How weakly and falsly, is that said that the <hi>Popes</hi> set themselves to uphold Infant-Baptism in the <hi>Braceren Council</hi> [in the 7th Century] because it was of so little esteem when the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> make mention of so many for it in this Century? As <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Bishop of Larissa;</hi> else <hi>Gregory</hi> would not have complained to him about <hi>Adrianus:</hi> And besides particular persons they mention the Council of <hi>Matiscons,</hi> 3 Canon for it, <hi>Cent.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 613. And by this we see what a false Historian <hi>Sebastian Frank</hi> is, and <hi>Jacob Merning,</hi> whom Mr.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106704:74"/>
                  <hi>Danvers</hi> brings as avouching the same, quoting the 204 pag. of the Dutch Martryology for it.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Sebastian Frank, Osiander</hi> Cent. 16 p. 121. tells us in plain terms, he was a ringleader of the Anabaptists, from whom his followers were called <hi>Frankists;</hi> and they taught, <hi>Omnia in sacris literis incerta, dubia, &amp; contradictoria esse;</hi> that is, all things in the Holy Scriptures are uncertain, doubtful, and contradictory, which is a most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaspheming of the Holy Scriptures; but may be true when applyed to his own History.</p>
               <p>Having thus found these <hi>Dutch</hi> Authors so tardy, we shall leave them for the present, and conclude with what we find related from our own Country-Man, the famous <hi>Bishop Usher,</hi> in his <hi>Succession of the Church,</hi> Chap. 7. Sect. 23. p. 196. being a saying of <hi>Windelstinus, Qui hodie dicuntur Protestantes, Novi sunt Waldenses;</hi> They who at this day, are called Protestants, are new <hi>Waldenses,</hi> which is confirmed by another saying of <hi>Poplinerus,</hi> who tells us, That <hi>Albigensium Religionem parum admodum ab ea dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepasse, quam hodie profitentur Protestantes,</hi> &amp;c. the Religion of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> doth very little differ from that which the Protestants at this day profess; as appears by the Fragments and Monuments of History written in their ancient Language; and then he further saith, that it appears by very ancient Manuscripts, that their Articles of Faith are <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Protestantium usquequaque conformes. Tout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formez a ceux des Protestans,</hi> altogether agreeing with the Protestants, <hi>Usher Succession, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19. p. 308.</p>

               <head>Mr. <hi>Danvers's pretended witness born by the Donatists against Infants-Baptism Confuted.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is full of Complaints of the great injuries he hath received; and amongst others this is one, that I tell him he hath nothing in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Donatists</hi> were against Infants-Baptism, but his <hi>ipse dixit;</hi> whereas he saith he hath given us divers Authorities for it. And the Reason of my saying so, was, because the <hi>Magdeburgs</hi> that do in a particular manner set before us what the <hi>Donatists</hi> held from point to point, do not charge them with Antipedobaptism; nor do any of the Church-Historians, <hi>Eusebius, Socrates, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret, Sozomen,</hi> or <hi>Evagrius,</hi> mention it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any of our modern Writers give any hint of it. Further I told him in my answer that <hi>Danaeus</hi> (who gives us the sum of their Tenents, and of all <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin's</hi> Disputes with them, in his <hi>Opusculum</hi>) menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not one word of their denying Infants-Baptism. Neither doth <hi>Zanchy</hi> who treats of them, and shews what they held in divers places of his Works, nor Mr <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Act.</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology</hi> (where there's a great story of them) speak any thing of their being against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism; no nor any other that ever I could hear of, but only Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and therefore I said as I did. And if our Antagonist had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <hi>tenacious</hi> of his Opinion, this had been (as is conceived) enough to have taken him off from his mistaken conceit. But all the thanks I have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106704:75"/>
for endeavouring to rectifie him, is still more and more Reproaches. Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> saith he, deals accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wonted manner very disingenuously with me; but wherein I pray?</p>
               <p>1. That I, saith he, having given so many Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and of such Antiquity to prove it, he yet tells me [as before.]</p>
               <p>To which I answer; I must needs say the same still, being not in the least convinced by Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers's</hi> Reply. For whereas he saith he hath given many Authorities and of <hi>great Antiquity,</hi> to prove it; most of them mentioned not only in the <hi>Treatise</hi> but <hi>Reply,</hi> are but of yesterday. <hi>viz. Seb. Frank, Jac. Merning,</hi> and <hi>Twisk,</hi> (if I mistake not, three German Anabaptists) <hi>Vicecomes, Spanhemius, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siander, Fuller,</hi> and <hi>Bullinger.</hi> As for the three first, it is sufficient to say concerning them, <hi>Istis Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoribus non stamus,</hi> we own them not; because they speak falsly in many things, and that which none of the ancient Writers do affirm. As for Instance, Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> tells us, <hi>Seb. Frank,</hi> and <hi>Twisk,</hi> affirm that <hi>Donatus</hi> taught that no Infant should be baptized, but only those that believed and desired it, which is false; and neither they nor Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can prove it out of <hi>Austin</hi> or any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writer. But suppose <hi>Donatus</hi> himself had been against Infant-Baptism; yet <hi>Una Hirundo non facit Ver;</hi> One Swallow doth not make a Spring; It will not follow that the rest of the <hi>Donatists</hi> were so likewise; no more than because Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> the Head of the Anabaptists doth conform, therefore all the Anabaptists of England do conform. Again, <hi>Jac. Merning</hi> saith, that <hi>Cresconius</hi> opposed <hi>Austin</hi> in that point, <hi>viz.</hi> of Infants-Baptism. But in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106704:75"/>
whole dispute between <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Cresconius,</hi> I can find nothing like it. And <hi>Vicecomes</hi> is as false as them; for he tells us, <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. were all of them against Infants-Baptism; and that <hi>Fulgentius</hi> a learned <hi>Donatist</hi> did deny, (if Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> mistakes him not) Infants-Baptism, and asserts only that which was after Faith. Whereas <hi>Fulgentius</hi> himself (<hi>de fide ad Petrum cap.</hi> 30.) expresly tells us, that Baptism is sufficient to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Original Sin from Infants; and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> hath so branded <hi>Spanhemius</hi> (in his Reply,) as a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry partial and unfaithful Writer, one guilty of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fictions and Chimeras,</hi> that 'tis strange to me he should produce him. And what do <hi>Osiander, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> and <hi>Bullinger</hi> say? why, that the <hi>Donatists</hi> and our modern Anabaptists were all one. But do they say in all things? I have already told Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> that they were one in regard of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in very many things, and drew the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between them. And we say <hi>Denominatio sumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a majori.</hi> And indeed the rigid Anabaptist does Symbolize with the <hi>Donvtists</hi> in nothing more than in confining the Church of Christ to their Party, so no true Church out of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Party. And if we will not renounce Infants-Baptism and be dipt after their way, he bids defiance to all overtures of Union and Communion; for he saith in his Preface to his <hi>Treatise of Baptism,</hi> that whilst such a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichrist is held fast, all Exhortations to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> in Church-fellowship and Communion, will signifie little.</p>
               <p>His other Authorities I confess are more significant to wit; <hi>Austin, Tho. Walden, Eckbertus</hi> and <hi>Emeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus;</hi> and therefore I shall a little examine his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106704:76"/>
out of them. (1) He tells us, <hi>Reply</hi> 134 [that <hi>Austin</hi> against the <hi>Donatists, Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 3, 4. c. 23. doth with much zeal and fury manage the Argument for Infants-baptism against them, bitterly cursing them that oppose it.] But I cannot find that <hi>Austin</hi> takes the least notice of Infant-baptism throughout the whole 3d Book; wherein yet (if Mr. D. may be believed) he manages that Argument with much Zeal and Fury: Nor in the 4th Book, till he comes to the 23d Chap. And there (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready informed him) he is so far from controverting Infants-baptism with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that he makes use of it as a <hi>medium</hi> in his arguing against them. (2.) He tells us, that <hi>Austin</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> (it should be <hi>Marcellinus</hi>) <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. c. 6. p. 724. opposed himself against them (the Donatists) for denying Infants-baptism. A great mistake! for all he saith of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> there as touthing Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, is this, <hi>viz. Octavum Errorem fuisse de Infanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, qui priusquam renascantur in Christo praeveniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur occiduo, Scriptum esse, raptus est ne malitia illius intellectum mutaret. Sap.</hi> 4. That is, His eight Error was concerning Infants that dye before they were Baptized, that they were taken away lest malice should change [corrupt] their Understanding, quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 4. Wisdom in the <hi>Apochrypha</hi> for it. And let the Reader judg whether this is to deny Infant-Baptism. (3.) He tells us that <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Walden</hi> do both affirm, that <hi>Vincentius Victor</hi> a Donatist, denied Baptism to little ones: <hi>Austin</hi> in his third <hi>Book de Anima</hi> c. 14. And <hi>Walden</hi> in his <hi>Book de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> Tit. 5. c. 33. fol. 118. As for <hi>Austin,</hi> there is not the least Syllable to be found of any such matter in that 14 Chap. Nay, so far is <hi>Austin</hi> from
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106704:76"/>
charging <hi>Vin. Victor</hi> with denying Infant-baptism, that in the preceding Chapter he tells you, his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was that only those Infants that dyed Baptized went immediately to Heaven; and as for others, they continued in Paradise till the last Resurrection, and were not till then admitted to the happiness of Heaven. <hi>Haec verba tua sunt</hi> (saith <hi>Austin</hi> to <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>) <hi>ubi te confiteris consentire dicenti, quibusdam non baptizatis sic temporarie collatum esse Paradisum ut supersit illis in resurrectione praemium regni caelorum, contra sententiam principalem, qua constitutum est non intraturum in illud regnum qui non renatus fuerit ex aqua &amp; Spiritu sancto. Quam sententiam principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem timens violare</hi> Pelagius, <hi>nec illos sine baptismo in regnum caelorum credidit intraturos quos non credidit reos. Tu autem &amp; originalis peccati reos parvulos confiteris, &amp; tamen eos sine lavacro regenerationis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvis, &amp; in paradisum mittis, &amp; postea etiam reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num caelorum intrare permittis.</hi> And <hi>Walden</hi> (in the place Mr. <hi>D.</hi> quotes) saith the same directly. <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius dixit eos</hi> (scil. Infantes) <hi>trahere originale pecea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, sine baptismo tamen duci posse in regnum caelorum in resurrectione finali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Eckbertus</hi> the Monk and <hi>Emericus,</hi> I can find no such matter in the <hi>Magdeb.</hi> that they likned the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in the 12 <hi>Cent.</hi> to the <hi>Donatists.</hi> And yet I deny not, but it might be so, because, as <hi>Perin</hi> saith, the Popish Priests did reproach them with the odious name of <hi>Cathari,</hi> because they prest after Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; by which name the <hi>Donatists</hi> were heretofore called, because they held a sinless state of Perfection attainable in this Life. And this may serve as a sufficient answer also to Mr. <hi>D's.</hi> last Argument to prove the <hi>Donatists</hi> against Infant-baptism, because
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106704:77"/>
they and the <hi>Novatians</hi> were the same in Principle with the <hi>Waldenses.</hi> It being only a foul Aspersion cast upon them by their malicious Adversaries. <hi>Posterior aetas</hi> (saith <hi>Danaeus) ad praegravandam bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam Evangelii causam, homines vere evangelicos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fami</hi> Catharorum <hi>nomine calumniata est.</hi>

               <p>Thus Reader, it is left to thy judgment (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> speaks) whether he hath sufficiently justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his sixfold Testimony, that the <hi>Donatists</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Infants-Baptism. I hope (whatever Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> may say to the contrary) I have sufficiently invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated all that he hath brougat for that end, and that thou wilt acquit me from the charge of disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in condemning his Witnesses without cause. So we are come to his last Witnesses the Ancient <hi>Britains;</hi> which may well be called his, because no Man ever before him affirmed they were against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Danvers</hi> is singular in his Opinion; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any <hi>Anabaptist</hi> that I have read of hit upon this Topick, to prove the Antiquity of their way; no not Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> (whose invention is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for Arguments, in that part of his Anti-paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism which I have lying by me, which consists of above 260 pages in <hi>Quarto</hi> being part of the 1500 which Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> says in his <hi>Preface</hi> was never yet replyed to. And 'tis no wonder that no body hath undertaken it; for as the Author of <hi>the History</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:106704:77"/>
                  <hi>of the Popes Nephews</hi> speaks, the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are Politick in writing large Volumns, on purpose to discourage the Protestants from answering them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> gives four Arguments that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains</hi> that inhabited <hi>Wales,</hi> when <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> was sent by <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> into this <hi>Island</hi> to preach the Gospel about the year 604. did bear their Testimony against Infants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>1. Because Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> out of <hi>Bede</hi> tells us, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Baptize after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> particularly explains to be in the point of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism.</p>
               <p>In answer to this I did (in my <hi>Infants-Baptism Asserted</hi>) 1. except against <hi>Fabian's</hi> Paraphrase upon the words, which <hi>Bede</hi> gives us from <hi>Austin;</hi> and that for these Reasons, 1. Because in the Preface to <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> we there read that what he relates of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is taken from <hi>Bede's Ecclesiastical History,</hi> in which there is no mention of the <hi>Britains</hi> denying to give Christendom to Children, for all that he saith is in his second Book, and the words are,—In as much as you do contrary to our custom, yea to the custom of the universal Church, nevertheless if you will obey me only in these three things, <hi>soil.</hi> That you keep your <hi>Easter</hi> in its proper time; administer Baptism, whereby we are born again to God, after the manner of the <hi>Holy Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Church, and preach the Word of God together with us unto the <hi>English</hi> Nation, we will patiently bear all other things which you do, although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our customs. But they answered they would do none of these. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates it thus, That they would not agree, refusing to leave the custom which they so long time had continued without the Assent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106704:78"/>
of them all which used the same. <hi>Fox. Act. Mon. 1. Book, p.</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>2. Because <hi>Fabian</hi> is not lookt upon as a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Historian, and therefore Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Book suspecteth him of divers mistakes, and follows not his relation of giving Christendom to Children in this story, as it is set down by him; for he gives us it in the words of <hi>Bede, viz.</hi> That they refused to baptize after the manner of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. None of the other Ancient Historians, as <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis in Polychron. Huntington,</hi> &amp;c. mention their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to give Christendom to Children; they only speak generally of refusing to baptize after the manner of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some other reasons were given which I let pass, having already said enough to shew on what a sandy foundation Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> builds this his peculiar Assertion, that the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Infants-baptism, he having nothing for it but <hi>Fabians</hi> conjecture, wherein he differs from all other Historians in the World.</p>
               <p>But saith Mr. <hi>Danvers, Fabian</hi> hath fully hit <hi>Bede's</hi> meaning: why? 1. Because <hi>Austin</hi> tells the <hi>Brittish</hi> Christians, that among many things, wherein they were contrary to the custom of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Universal Church, one was in this particular of Baptism; and this he conceives must needs be in their refusing to Baptize Children: and his Reasons are;</p>
               <p>1. Because as to the Baptizing the <hi>Adult</hi> they were not contrary to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I answer, though they were not contrary to them, as to the <hi>Subject</hi> of Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Adult;</hi> yet they might be, and were so (if so pure as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents them) in regard of the <hi>Adjuncts</hi> which the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106704:78"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> annext to Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> those Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious additions of Chrysm, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They both baptized the <hi>Adult,</hi> but not after the same manner: and this was that which <hi>Austin</hi> stood upon, he would have had them Baptize after their manner: But Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> objects,</p>
               <p>2. It could not respect the <hi>Mode</hi> of Baptism, that's strange; for doth he not tell us just before, p. 38. of his <hi>Reply,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who takes it from <hi>Bede,</hi> That they refused to baptize after the manner of <hi>Rome;</hi> and can he tell wherein the difference lies between <hi>Mode</hi> and Manner. But let us weigh his Reasons (which are as light as a Feather) why it could not respect the <hi>Mode</hi> of Baptism. His first is, Because the custom of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not <hi>Universal,</hi> but opposed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, &amp; not at all to be made out to be <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> He says true indeed, though it be not <hi>ad Rhombum,</hi> and though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, neither could be made out to be <hi>Apostolical;</hi> yet they are so proud as to term it so, and say what we can to the contrary, they do still arrogate as much to this day.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore, saith he, it must needs respect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-baptism; whether this be intended as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or a Conclusion, who can tell? it is brought in as a third Argument, and then it is <hi>idem per idem:</hi> It must needs respect Infants-baptism, because it must needs. But he wheels about again after a confused manner, and comes in with five other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. 1. Because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enjoyned, and imposed it to beget Infants to Regeneration, and therefore must intend the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and not the Ceremony. To which I reply;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106704:79"/>
1. It is very strange, that Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> mind should thus run altogether upon Childrens Baptism, when the work which <hi>Austin</hi> would have had them gone upon, was to Baptize the Adult Pagans, such as the <hi>Saxons</hi> then were, and to Preach the Gospel to them, and we reade not (unless I mistake) of any Children that he baptized at all, nor any of his company, although he sent to <hi>Gregory</hi> to know how long the baptizing of a Child might be deferr'd, there being no danger of Death. 2. How came the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> mind, of Childrens being born of God by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? for <hi>Austin</hi> spake not of this; but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Britains</hi> to administer Baptism, <hi>whereby,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are born again,</hi> as holding that grown Persons are born again to God as well as Children, according to the Judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the ancient Fathers. Doth not <hi>Just in Martyr</hi> say the same, speaking of the manner how the Christians were baptized: they go (saith he) to the Water and are regenerated, as we our selves were regenerated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that these are but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Cavils against Childrens-Baptism. 2. He urge<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> another, and that is, Because Infants-Baptism was universally received in this seventh Age, in other parts of the World for this end. This is such an Argument that I know not well what to say to it, unless it be that since Infants-Baptism was so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally received in other parts of the World, it's alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable it should be shut out of <hi>Wales.</hi> The third and fourth Arguments make but one, which is, because Infant-Baptism was received, and enjoyned as an Apostolical practice, and it had been childish and ridiculous to have said Baptism in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106704:79"/>
was Apostolical. Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> says true, It had been indeed ridiculous for <hi>Austin</hi> to have said Baptism in general was Apostolical, and therefore he speaks of the manner of Baptizing, which he would have the <hi>Britains</hi> observe as they did, that is, to do it in that superstitious way with <hi>Chrysm, Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. which is held by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical.</p>
               <p>And whereas I say the <hi>Britains</hi> did no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Infants-Baptism, than they did Preaching to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> He thus replys; True, having as much reason to reject the one, as the other. A strange As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion! For though Infants-Baptism be in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unlawful, yet the Preaching of the Gospel, one would think, should be lawful, and more reason there is to Preach the Gospel, than to Baptize either the Adult or Infants. But what makes Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> judg otherwise as to these <hi>Britains?</hi> It is because he conceives, by Preaching here must be understood <hi>Authoritatively,</hi> by being ordained by them, and not as a company of Lay-men, or Mechanicks. It seems than this Gentle-man is for Mechanicks Preaching; but that which is remarkable is, to see how much he hath overshot himself in the heat of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: For the <hi>Britains,</hi> to whom <hi>Austin</hi> addrest his Speech, were not Lay-men or Mechanicks, but seven <hi>Bishops</hi> and an <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <hi>Act. Mon. 1. Book,</hi> p. 107. Although 'tis true they admitted not <hi>Romes</hi> Supremacy over them, which was the main quarrel, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us out of <hi>Cluniacensi,</hi> who gives this Reason why they would not comply with <hi>Austin,</hi> because they would not admit of the Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> Supremacy over them, <hi>Ex Pet. Cluniacensi ad Bernardum.</hi> Reader,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106704:80"/>
thou must know that Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> gave five other Reasons in his <hi>Treatise of Baptism</hi> to confirm his former Position; and because I said in my Answer they were trifles, he tells me in his <hi>Reply</hi> that that is an excellent way of <hi>Answering,</hi> &amp; next to <hi>Bellarmin, thou lyest.</hi> But I must tell Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> I did not only say they were trifles, but proved them such. And because he doth so cunningly insinuate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I shall now repeat my Answer to his Reasons, adding a little, and submit it to judgment.</p>
               <p>1. His first Argument, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Infant-Baptism, was, <hi>Because they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves both in Discipline and Doctrine expresly to the Scripture.</hi> Before I speak to this, know, that he hath altered his note; for his first Argument in both his <hi>Treatises</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> was this, <hi>Because the</hi> Britains <hi>received the Christian Faith, Doctrine and Discipline from the Apostles and</hi> Asiatick <hi>Churches, who had no such thing as Baptizing Children.</hi> Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than he can tell, and a Negative Argument as to matter of Fact, is not valid, as I told him in my Answer: and besides, I minded him with that of the <hi>Magdeburgs,</hi> who expresly tell us that Infants-Baptism was in use in the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches, <hi>Cent.</hi> 3. c. 6. p. 124. He is so ingenious as to wave that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But to the 1st, as it is here in the Reply, which is, because they kept themselves in Discipline and Doctrine expresly to the Word. This he thinks will effectually do the business, that is, casheer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-Baptism from them. To this I answer. 1. To say they kept themselves expresly in Discipline and Doctrine to the Word, is more than Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> can prove, and it is more than <hi>Jeffery Monmouth</hi> speaks,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106704:80"/>
from whom he hath his intelligence. This therefore, that they keep to the express Word is his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate. 2. It is not true what he saith, nor can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> should believe himself; for no <hi>Anabaptist</hi> believes <hi>Episcopal Government</hi> to be so expresly set down in the Word, and Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> tells us as before, that no less than seven Bishops and an Arch-Bishop came out of <hi>Wales</hi> at <hi>Austin's</hi> Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; who were also so proud, that wanting some ceremonious Observance at their first coming to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> they took such offence, that in disdain and great displeasure they went away. And observe, Reader, the sense of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> upon this their carriage; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, saith he, I cannot see but both <hi>Austin</hi> and them were to be blamed, who so much neglected their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Duties in revenging their Temporal injuries, that they denied to joyn their helping hand to turn the Idolatrous <hi>Saxons</hi> to the way of Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which respect all private respects ought to give place, and be forgotten, and for which cause he conceived the stroke of God's Punishment did light upon them afterward. The business of Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism never entered into this good-mans mind, as if they refused to comply with <hi>Austin</hi> on that account, nor is it like that ever the <hi>Britains</hi> thought of it.</p>
               <p>2. His next Argument is, <hi>Because they were zealous Impugners of Tradition.</hi> But by the story we find no such Zeal unless it was against <hi>Austin</hi> for not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them: and besides, this Argument of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> is altogether precarious; for we have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before that though <hi>Austin</hi> held Infants-Baptism a Tradition, yet withal it was in his opinion ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Circumcision, and the Papists (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) affirm the warrantableness of it may be collected
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106704:81"/>
from Scripture. But to make short work with it, I deny that they were such Impugners of Tradition, if the Discpline of Arch-Bishops, and the observation of <hi>Easter</hi> be Traditions (as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> judgeth them to be;) for as the difference between <hi>Austin</hi> and them was not about the Subject of Baptism, but the Ceremony; so they differed not about keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> but only as to the circumstance of time, when it was to be kept. That the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> kept <hi>Easter,</hi> though not at the same time as the <hi>Romish</hi> Church did, see Mr. <hi>Fox Act. Mon.</hi> page 111. where mention is made of a Synod in which the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about keeping <hi>Easter</hi> was debated before <hi>King Oswie, Alfrid's</hi> Father; and 'tis said <hi>Coleman</hi> then <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> followed not the custom of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> in celebrating <hi>Easter</hi> from the 14th day of the first month, till the 28th of the same, against whom <hi>Wilfrid</hi> replied,—The <hi>Easter</hi> we keep, we have seen at <hi>Rome,</hi>—the same is used in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and finally all the World over, save only by these here present, with their accomplices the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Reason is, <hi>Because</hi> Constantine <hi>the son of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Parents was not Baptized till aged,</hi> so in his <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Baptism;</hi> but in his Reply, 'tis, <hi>not baptized in this Island.</hi> But we have shewn <hi>Constantius</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was no Christian at <hi>Constantine's</hi> Birth, and in all likelyhood lived and dyed a <hi>Pagan,</hi> though he had much respect for Christians; and even <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> himself was a <hi>Pagan</hi> for sometime after he was <hi>Emperor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Another of his Reasons is, <hi>Because the custom of the Britains was to baptize after Confession of Faith, being in Union and Communion therein with the French</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106704:81"/>
                  <hi>Christians;</hi> And I told him this was a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove they were for Infants-Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>French</hi> Christians afterward called <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> were for it, and had used it so many hundred years; witness the Confession at <hi>Angrogne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Old <hi>Salvo</hi> serve his turn, which is, That the ancient <hi>Waldenses</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Infants-baptism, though he cannot but grant the more modern were for it. For we have met with something of late that must needs convince him, and that is, that Infants-baptism was practised in the Country where the <hi>Waldenses</hi> do inhabit, near twelve hundred years since.</p>
               <p>For the Famous <hi>French Historian, John de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> in his History of <hi>France</hi> translated into <hi>English,</hi> tells us, p. 12. That <hi>Anno Christi 500, Clovis</hi> the great <hi>King of France,</hi> then an <hi>Heathen,</hi> desired to marry <hi>Clotilde</hi> Daughter of <hi>Chilperic</hi> Brother of <hi>Gondebault,</hi> King of the <hi>Burgundians,</hi> (whose Seat was then at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>Provence</hi>) <hi>Gondebault</hi> denyed <hi>Clovis,</hi> because of the difference of Religion: <hi>Clovis</hi> to remove this, promised her liberty of Conscience, so the marriage was concluded. And (saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) although <hi>Clovis</hi> were a <hi>Pagan,</hi> yet he was no enemy to the <hi>Christians,</hi> sitting himself to the humour of the <hi>Gauloys,</hi> who generally followed the Christian Religion: <hi>He suffered his Wife likewise to baptize her Children.</hi> So it's plain the <hi>Burgundians</hi> (from whence the <hi>Waldenses</hi> sprang) were for baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants; and belike it was also at that time the universal practice of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. The last of Mr. <hi>Danvers's</hi> Arguments, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were against Infants-baptism, is, because
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106704:82"/>
                  <hi>Austin himself was so raw and ignorant in the Rite,</hi> that when he came into <hi>Britain,</hi> and the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was here put to him (I know not by whom) <hi>how long a Child that was in danger of Death might stay unbaptized?</hi> he was fain to send to <hi>Rome</hi> for Solution. This is so raw an Argument indeed to prove the <hi>Britains</hi> were against Infants-Baptism, that instead of an Answer, it deserves to be laught at. For at this very day wherein Infants-Baptism is so generally practised, some take a liberty to delay longer than others who are for the speedy admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration thereof. And if this Argument doth import any thing, it is, that <hi>Austin</hi> himself was not so well studied as he ought to have been as to the time when Children should be baptized. What in the last place he speaks of <hi>Hilary,</hi> that none were baptized in the <hi>Western</hi> Churches but the <hi>Adult,</hi> is confronted in the beginning, where we have shewn that he hath no such saying in <hi>lib. de Trinitate,</hi> the Book referr'd to, and how he himself was for Infants-Baptism from his 2d <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Austin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his other witnesses, <hi>Munzer</hi> and <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> with the rest of that Faction, though he doth pertinaciously persist against the clearest evidences, in palliating or rather denying the horrid crimes laid to their charge, and withal (very disingenuously) reflects dishonour upon those of the Reformation, I shall not be at so much expence of time and Paper as to expose his gross aberrations herein, but qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly permit him to injoy the comfort and honour of such witnesses.</p>
