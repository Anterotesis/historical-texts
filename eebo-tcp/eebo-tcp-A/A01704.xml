         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y purpoſe (Right
Honourable) in the
dedication of theſe
ſermons, was to haue
ioyned your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
father with that
worthy Citie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was a principall
member, and had ſpeciall command and
authoritie: which place he much reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and loued, and where he was againe
much reſpected and honoured. The ioy
and ornament of the Citie, was his name
and countenance, the very report and
newes of whoſe deceaſe, was the cauſe
of many a watrie eye, and of many a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
heart. But their ſpeciall comfort and
<pb facs="tcp:3274:4"/>
ioy is, that the Lord hath in mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
ſo gratious an heire, ſo worthy a
ſucceſſor, ſo vertuous a fauourer, as of
all, that are honeſt religious: ſo moſt of
all, ſuch as haue beene the faithfull
friends and intire louers of your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
father: who himſelfe was a louer of
all learning, religion, and of all good
men; a true worſhipper of God, zealous
in the truth, a ſincere profeſſor &amp; friend
of the Goſpell; a fauourer of faithfull
Miniſters; a worthie member both of
Church and common-wealth: a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
dutiful, ſeruiceable, and rare ſubiect:
like Moſes in faithfulnes, in meekenes
and in zeale againſt Idolatrie: like Iob a
iuſt man, fearing God, and eſchewing
euill: like Nathaniell, a true Iſraelite
without guile. Finally, a man full of
grace, pietie, curteſie, humilitie, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and other, both morall and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
vertues. I am not able to commend
him, according to his deſerts: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a larger diſcourſe, and it would
perhaps proue an increaſe of ſorrow,
which is rather to be abated then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I will therefore bend my ſelfe
to adminiſter comfort for ſo great a
<pb facs="tcp:3274:4"/>
loſſe, a loſſe ſo generall to Church and
common-wealth. Friends and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Tenants and ſeruants, and for my
owne part, I cannot but beare a part in
ſorrow for the loſſe of ſo kind a Patron
and Benefactor, both to me and mine.
Yet this is the vſe of the prayſes of the
dead, not onely for imitation of their
vertues, but alſo for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of friends
aliue. And is this a ſmall comfort, Right
Honourable, that you had ſuch a father?
yea a comfort and bleſſing it is to be of
the ſeed of the righteous. It is a further
comfort, that you enioyed him ſo long
till your ſelfe came to ripeneſſe of
yeares, &amp; that he died in a good age, full
of daies, few of his Aunceſtors liued lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
and howſoeuer he left this life in a
ſtrange countrey, yet (no doubt) he died
in the true faith of Ieſus Chriſt (which
he ſincerely profeſſed all his life) and in
the honourable and faithfull ſeruice of
his gratious Soueraigne the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.
It is no wonder, that old men
die, rather it is a wonder in theſe latter
daies that any liue ſo long. Moſes in his
time made account of mans ordinarie
age, to be threeſcore yeares and ten.
<pb facs="tcp:3274:5"/>
Now the world decayes, and the daies
of our life is ſhortned. We heare daily of
the death of Infants, children, young
men, yea Princes taken away in the
prime and ſtrength of their yeares: what
maruell then though the ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ie?
when the apple is ripe it muſt needs fall;
when the candle is ſpent, the light muſt
needs goe out. This vſe we are to make
of the death of young or old, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
alwaies our mortall ſtate, and the
vncertaintie of our life, to be alwaies
readie and prepared, not to regard but
contemne the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt
of the eie, and the pride of life, pleaſures,
honours, riches, and the vanities of this
wicked world. Many moe comforts we
haue againſt exceſſiue and immoderate
ſorrowe for the death of our beſt and
deareſt friends, as to conſider what they
leaue, (a miſerable world) and whither
they goe, (to the hauen of happineſſe.)
The beſt ſort of the Heathen vſed three
remedies againſt ſuch kind of ſorrow.
Firſt, to conſider that death is common
to all and vnauoydable. Secondly, that
it is the end of miſerie and hauen of reſt.
Thirdly, that it is likely, that the ſoules
<pb facs="tcp:3274:5"/>
liue and are bleſſed. We haue the ſame
and more ſure comforts. We know that
our Redeemer liues, and that wee ſhall
ſee him as hee is. Wee know not onely
the immortality of the ſoule, but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reſurrection of the body; and that
thoſe that dye in the Lord are bleſſed.
Nothing comes to paſſe without Gods
pouidence, who is wiſe and mightie:
We pray that his will may be done both
of vs and in vs. It will nothing auaile vs
to torment our ſelues, we are borne to
dye; many thouſands are gone before
vs, and we muſt follow.</p>
            <p>Pardon my boldnes (right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
in preſuming to put you in minde
of theſe thinges, which (both by your
own priuate reading, and publicke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of many worthy men) you doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
know and vnderſtand ſufficiently.
Yet in my loue to your Honour, giue me
leaue to adde ſome further inſtruction.
It hath alwaies beene the endeuour of
Sathan, the common aduerſarie of mans
ſaluation, by all means poſſible, to draw
all ſorts, degrees, and ages of men, from
the true care and ſtudie of religion and
vertue: to the effecting whereof, hee
<pb facs="tcp:3274:6"/>
hath from euery eſtate his pretended
colours and faire pleaſing ſhewes of
perſwaſion &amp; allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, perſwading the
elder ſort, that it is a thing vnſeemely
&amp; vnbefitting their grauitie, to become
ſchollers in Chriſts ſchoole, ſeeing their
heads are filled with other matters:
namely, of the Common-wealth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
of this world. Hee can tell the
middle ſort, which are in the prime of
ſtrength and witte, that it is againſt all
equitie and reaſon, that ſuch ſhould bee
depriued of the pleaſures and delights
of the fleſh and the world. And as for
the younger ſort, hee will eaſilie make
make them beleeue, that it is not yet
time to ſerue God, that the points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are too high for them, and able to
dull and trouble their tender wits, buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
into their eares that wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe;
<hi>A young Saint, an olde Diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Thus by his will he would haue none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
becauſe he would haue none ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
but rather that all ſhould periſh
and come to vtter ruine and deſtruction.
It is a torment and vexation vnto him to
ſee any well diſpoſed in religion: but if
wee hearken to the counſell of God in
<pb facs="tcp:3274:6"/>
his word, wee ſhall ſoone finde Sathan
herein a lyer, a murtherer, a ſeducer:
For the Lord chargeth all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of men, to giue themſelues, and
that betimes, to religion and vertue:
commaunding his law to bee read and
publiſhed to men, women and children.

<pb facs="tcp:3274:7"/>
dangerous, and ſubiect to many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
eaſilie ſeduced and ouercome by
bad counſell and company: They had

Now beſides all this, giue me leaue
(Right Hon.) to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of one worthie example of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
young man; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> full of grace and
vertue, worthie to be imitated of Kings,
Princes, and Potentates. In this famous
patterne I obſerue theſe ſixe vertues.
The firſt is his rare chaſtitie, who being
tempted to follie by his miſtreſſe, did
flatly refuſe her, ſaying, How can I doe
this great wickedneſſe, and ſo ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God? He knew with <hi>Iob,</hi> that
this was is a wickedneſſe and iniquitie
to be condemned, yea that it is a fire
which ſhall deuoure to deſtruction, and
ſhall roote out all his encreaſe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
vertue in young <hi>

                  </gap>
               </hi> which is the
ground of all the reſt, is his religion, and
the true feare of God in his heart. All
his actions, and all his proceedings, doe
ſauour of the feare of God. It was this
that kept him from that groſſe iniquitie.
He aſcribes the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dreams,
not to himſelfe but to God. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth
to his brethren, that he feareth
God. And againe, when he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
knowne to his brethren, he ſaid, Be

his ſonnes; Theſe are my ſons (ſayd he)
which God hath giuen me. This is the
chiefe vertue in great perſons &amp; the beſt
Nobilitie.<note place="margin">3</note> A third vertue in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is his
faithfulnes to his Prince: He gathered all
the money that was found in the land of
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the
corne which hee bought; not for his
owne priuate vſe, but for the profit of
the King his maiſter: And as he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to preſerue the royall dignitie of the
King, and ſeeketh the wealth of <hi>Pharoah;</hi>
ſo hee hath a pittifull heart to the poore
diſtreſſed people, and is carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue
them. This is an excellent vertue
in great perſons which ſerue in the
Court, not to ſeeke their owne priuate

Prince, and yet to haue louing and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
hearts to the poore diſtreſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.<note place="margin">4</note>
The fourth vertue in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is his

is full of compaſſion and loue: When

this is a ſpeciall vertue required of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p>The fift vertue in noble <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and magnanimitie in ſuffering ſo
great wrongs and iniuries:<note place="margin">5</note> He was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
dealt with all by his brethren many
waies, being reuiled, ſcorned, and ſold
into Egypt by them; falſely accuſed by
his miſtris, and vniuſtly caſt into priſon
by his maiſter. In all his miſeries he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
his ſoule with patience; and when
it was in his power to bee reuenged of
his brethren, he bridleth his affections,
kindly entreateth them, and ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
euill with goodneſſe. Oh rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

is his kindneſſe, loue and dutie to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he inquireth of his brethren tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the life and health of his olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In time of dearth hee ſent prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

his father <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and preſented himſelfe

From whence we are to learne, that God
requireth the offerings of his people, for
the building of his tabernacle, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
<pb facs="tcp:3274:13"/>
his ſeruice: Againe, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
not a compelled, but a cheerfull
ſeruice; a true, ſincere, ioyfull heart and
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, And further we learne; that the
endeuour and labour of thoſe which any
way helpe the ſpirituall building, either
by coſt or counſell, ſo farre as they may,
is a ſeruice pleaſing to God. For we ſee
things there offered be of diuerſe kinds,
ſome more pretious, ſome baſe and vile.
There be difference of gifts in building
the ſpirituall tabernacle, ſome are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
with gold, ſome with ſiluer, ſome
with blew ſilke, and all profitable. Such
as God hath giuen, ſuch we are to bring,
and God will accept it. Some things
God appointed, that the pooreſt might
be able to offer, and no man ſhut out for
want of abilitie, they may bring wood,
ſtone, or at leaſt Goates haire. Euery one
in his calling as he hath receiued, muſt
doe his vttermoſt endeuour to further
the building. Some by preaching, ſome
by writing, ſome by gouernment, ſome
by countenance, ſome by coſt, ſome by
counſell, ſome by baſer ſeruices, which
yet are accepted, if they be done with
right affections. Indeed, we are to deſire
<pb facs="tcp:3274:14"/>
more, and the greateſt gifts of all, if we
would haue them: but let vs doe our vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
endeuour ſo farre as we can and
the Lord will accept it. Earneſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
is that ſpeech of a learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Origen: in Exod.</note> Lord Ieſu grant that I may haue
ſome monument in thy tabernacle: I will
wiſh if it would be, that ſome part of
that gold might come from me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the propitiatorie is made; or with
which the Arke is couered, or whereof
the candleſticke is made; or if I haue
no golde nor ſiluer, at leaſt I may be
found to offer ſomething that may helpe
forward the pillars and ſockets of them;
or that I may haue ſome braſſe in this
tabernacle, whereof the rings may be
made, and other things preſcribed by
thy word. O that it were poſſible for me
to be one of the Princes, or to offer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

and vnfruitfull in all.</p>
            <p>A holy, gratious, and deuout ſpeech:
we are all to be of the ſame minde and

<pb facs="tcp:3274:14"/>

chiefe Monarch, the diſpoſer, the chiefe
gouernor of kingdomes, that the happines
of Kings conſiſteth in maintaining true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Iuſtice; that impietie in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and falſe worſhip, is the ouerthrowe of
kingdomes, and as the whole ſtorie is of
great vſe and inſtruction to the Church:
ſo eſpecially the Chronicle of <hi>Dauid</hi> the
father, and <hi>Salomon</hi> the ſonne, they being
the firſt Kings that God gaue to <hi>Iſrael</hi> next
to <hi>Saul:</hi> yea indeed the firſt that God gaue
his people in loue, men qualified with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
graces, the one a Prophet, the
other a Preacher, both of them tipes and
figures of Chriſt Ieſus, the true <hi>Dauid</hi> and
<hi>Salomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſtorie is large and long, as you
may reade in the two bookes of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:3274:24"/>
and a great part of the firſt booke of the
Kings, and further in the firſt booke of the
Chronicles: and the nine firſt Chapters of
the ſecond booke. Touching <hi>Salomon,</hi> in
thoſe bookes, there is ſet downe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God towards him, in appearing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
twiſe vnto him, the ſingular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of wiſedome, honor and riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon him, the care of <hi>Salomon</hi> in
building the Temple, Gods houſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his minde, his ioy, praiſe and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
for the ſame: now this chapter in hand
containeth two generall heads. Firſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and pleaſant ſtorie of the Queene
of the ſouth. Secondly, the magnificence
and greatnes of <hi>Salomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This text is a branch of the firſt part,
and containeth a worthie commendation
of <hi>Salomon:</hi> Firſt commending the happie
gouernment of his familie: ſecondly, of his
whole kingdome: whatſoeuer is in theſe
two ſhort ſentences of ſcripture, all is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
and excellent, and of great force to
drawe reuerence and attention, whether
we conſider the perſon that ſpeaketh, the
partie to whom it is ſpoken, or the matter
and ſubiect it ſelfe: the ſpeaker no ſimple
nor baſe perſon, though the weaker veſſell
a woman, yet of great eſtate and maieſtie,

a famous, Royall Queene: the perſon to
whom this is ſpoken, is no leſſe a man then
<hi>Salomon,</hi> a moſt worthie and glorious King
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> beloued and choſen of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
all the Kings of the earth in riches,
honor, and wiſedome. A liuely tipe and
figure of Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, the
King of all Kings, and Lord of heauen and
earth. The matter and ſubiect here handled
and commended, is neither riches nor
pleaſure, nor the pompe, nor the glorie of
the world, but wiſedome, diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which ſhe ſaw and heard in <hi>Salomon,</hi>
and for the enioying whereof, ſhe tooke
ſo tedious, ſo long, and coſtly a iourney,
after her conference with <hi>Salomon,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhe heard him ſpeake ſo diuinely to her
ſelfe, and other ſtrangers, to his courtiers,
ſeruants and people, her heart being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured
with loue of this wiſedome, and
feeling the power and vertue of it, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in her ſoule, ſhe crieth and exclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
Happie are theſe thy men, happie are
theſe thy ſeruants, which ſtand euer before
thee, and heare thy wiſedome, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Before we come to this ſpeech it ſelfe, it
ſhall not be amiſſe to ſay ſome thing of the
ſpeaker, a woman, a Queene of excellent
vertues; the whole ſpeech it ſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3274:26"/>
her, for here ſhe ſpeaketh reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> commending and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his wiſedome; ſhe confeſſeth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth
the true God; ſhe acknowledgeth
him to be the diſpoſer of kingdomes, and
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his people: ſhe putteth <hi>Salomon</hi>
in minde of the dutie of a King. She is a
tipe of the calling of the Gentiles, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
ſhe is commended by Chriſt himſelfe
in the Goſpell, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>And though all the world, and all the
Kings of the earth, ſought to ſee <hi>Salomon</hi>
and to heare his wiſedome, yet this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is eſpecially named, &amp; commended,
and a whole ſtorie is written of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was a great matter, and almoſt a
wonder, that a woman ſhould take ſo
great, ſo troubleſome and tedious a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and it ſeemeth her zeale, and pietie
exceeded all the reſt. In the beginning of
this chapter, it is ſet downe whence ſhe
came, namely from <hi>Sheba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> being as Chriſt
ſaith, from the vttermoſt part of the earth:
that the fame of <hi>Salomon</hi> moued her to
come, that ſhe came with a great traine,
and brought with her ſweet odours, gold
and precious ſtones: the end of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
was, to proue <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> with hard que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
in matters of religion: and as ſhe ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3274:27"/>
neither paines nor coſt, but cheerfully
tooke vpon her ſo great a iourney: ſo when
ſhe is come, ſhe is carefull to learne and
enquire, of the true knowledge of God, to
be ſatiſfied and reſolued concerning all
points ſhe ſtood in doubt of: ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
her ignorance, and neglecteth no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to doe her ſoule good. And now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Salomon</hi> had anſwered all things to the
full; ſhe highly commends him, ſhe ſtirreth
vp his courtiers, ſubiects and ſeruants to
be thankfull for ſuch a Maiſter, Lord and
King: ſhe reioyceth, praiſing God for him:
and after in token of thankfulnes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth
vpon him, gold, odors, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtones: ſhe could not then perfectly
learne true religion in her owne countrie,
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the ſeate and ſchoole of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the ſcripture not being then in all
tongues, as it was after in the time of the
Apoſtles, therefore ſhe commeth ſo farre
to learne true wiſedome, both for her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
comfort, and the publike good of her
people: and now hauing found, felt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
it, ſhe both bleſſeth God the Author
and <hi>Salomon</hi> the teacher. In this example,
we are to obſerue diuers worthie notes
and markes of gracious and good hearers:
Firſt, in that ſhe ſeekes for wiſedome, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3274:27"/>
ſuch things as concerne the name of the
Lord, and that from <hi>Salomon,</hi> who was ſo
wiſe in ſo great a meaſure. Good hearers
muſt follow her example, not to ſeeke for
follie or fables, but for true wiſedome, and
that from the true Salomon Chriſt Ieſus in
his word and Goſpell: For the ſcriptures
onely as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 15. 16.</note> are able to make
vs wiſe vnto ſaluation. And the Pſalmiſt
ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſalme. 19. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The lawe of the Lord is perfect, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſoules, and giueth wiſedome to the ſimple.
Salomon</hi> himſelfe giues this counſell, <hi>Incline
thine eare, heare the words of the wiſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
thine heart to my knowledge.</hi> Secondly,
good hearers after this worthie patterne,<note place="margin">Pro: 22. 17.</note>
muſt refuſe no paines, nor labor for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of this wiſedome: The wiſe man
will haue vs call, and crie for it, to ſeeke it
as ſiluer, and ſearch for it, as for treaſures.
And againe, buy the truth, but ſell it not:
likewiſe wiſedome, and inſtruction, and
vnderſtanding, when Chriſt was borne at
<hi>Bethlem</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro: 23. 23.</note> there came certaine wiſe

a great and dangerous voyage to heare

            <p>The praiſes or diſpraiſes of men are little
to be regarded; they account ſome iuſt, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
vertuous, honeſt, which are nothing ſo;
what are theſe men the better for the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
ſpeeches of men, when God &amp; their
owne conſciences can tell them, that they
are no ſuch kind of men at all? but indeed
prophane, vniuſt, vile, and naught. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
are accounted in the mouths of men,
as wicked, and notorious hypocrites, what
neede they care for theſe ſpeeches, when
God and their owne conſcience doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that they are ſincere in hart, deſiring to
liue honeſtly and vprightly in the ſight of
God and men. The teſtimonie of a good
conſcience, is a ſufficient bulwark againſt
all falſe reports and ſlanders whatſoeuer:
but the common miſchiefe and poyſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, is the pleaſing ſpeeches of
flatterers and clawbacks, which doth feed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3274:38"/>
them in their humours, and magnifie them
to the skies, when there is litle or no cauſe
at all: Nay, when rather they are to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and diſpraiſed. There be two kindes
of perſecutors ſaith one, firſt, of ſuch as doe
diſpraiſe vs, and ſecondly, of ſuch as doe
praiſe vs: but the tongue of the flatterer
doth more hurt, and perſecute vs, then the
hand of a perſecutor: I had rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
of any, then to be praiſed of a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer:
no reproofe is to be feared of him
that loueth the truth, but he that flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
praiſeth,<note place="margin">Pro: 28. 23.</note> doth erre, and confirmeth
vs in error. Therefore true is that ſaying of
<hi>Salomon</hi> he that rebuketh a man ſhall finde
more fauour at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, then he that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
with his tongue.</p>
            <p>And the wounds of a friend are better
then the kiſſes of a flatterer. Therefore
ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 5.</note> Let the righteous ſmite me for
that is a benefit, and let them reproue me,

is to be praiſed who can truely ſay, I liue
not, but Chriſt liueth in me, and ſo not he
but the life of Chriſt is praiſed, the gifts
and graces of God whereſoeuer we finde
them, are to be reuerenced, honoured, and
magnified, with praiſe and ioy.</p>
            <p>And let the beſt take heed that they be
not deſirous of vaine-glorie. It is lawfull to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3274:39"/>
receiue due praiſe when it is offered, and
we are not vtterly to renounce and forbid
it: good men are not ignorant of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
that is in them, and therefore they
reioyce, that God hath giuen vnto men
ſuch good affections, to like ſo well of
thoſe good things which they praiſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and it is the gift of God to allowe
and approue of his graces, and to forbid
ſuch kinde of commendations, is not to
will nor deſire, that the faithfull ſhould
praiſe and approue thoſe things which are
worthie of due praiſe and approbation.
<hi>Salomon</hi> in this place, doth not refuſe, but
accept the iuſt commendation of this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
though it be of himſelfe in his owne
preſence, and in the hearing of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and yet we muſt beware that wee
be not moued to doe well, for the deſire
of praiſe, and that we ceaſe not from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, though wee be reuiled, and
hardly ſpoken of, and thoſe praiſes which
are giuen to vs, let them not reſt nor die
in vs, but let the glorie of them be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to God, the author, and giuer, of all
good gifts.</p>
            <p>A worthie Father writeth of himſelfe,
that in this reſpect he had cauſe to be
much grieued, becauſe he was ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3274:40"/>
and hee could hardly auoyde the pride of
heart: yet hee ſaith, that this was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that it was appointed of God, that
praiſe should bee the follower of a good
life:<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 2.</note> And howſoeuer <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let an
other man praiſe thee, and not thine owne mouth,
a ſtranger, and not thine owne lippes:</hi> yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Saints of God are forced to praiſe
themſelues, not for vain-glorie, but for the
glorie of God, the confirmation of others,
and for the ſtopping of the mouthes of the
aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>It is a worthy ſaying of the ſame Father,
Beholde (ſaith hee,)<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſalm. 144<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> it is found how thou
mighteſt praiſe thy ſelfe, and not be proud,
praiſe God in thee, and not thy ſelfe; praiſe
him, not becauſe thou art ſuch a one, but
becauſe hee hath made thee ſuch a one:
not becauſe thou canſt doe anie thing, but
becauſe he can doe ſomething in thee, and
by thee.</p>
            <p>Finally, this doctrine ſerueth for the
comfort of vertuous and good men, who
haue ſmall comfort and commendation in
the world, but rather diſpraiſe and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
they are diſgraced and deſpiſed of the
moſt: let them take this as ſome croſſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them: and howſoeuer they haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
it of the world, yet it may bee God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3274:40"/>
hath ſomething againſt them: and it may
bee if they had the praiſe of all men, it
would make them proud and high concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and God depriueth them of earthlie
glory, that they might more carefully ſeeke
heauenly and Eternall glorie. As for the
praiſe of men, it is but like a feather, toſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God: For the Lord God is the Sunne and

the day of praiſe and reward, and a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
to euery man, according to his

Saints, and be made maruellous in all them
that beleeue: then thoſe which by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in wel doing, haue ſought glorie, ſhall
certainely haue honour, immortalitie, and

remember that God hath the diſpoſing of

But to let this paſſe, and to come to the
maine point, &amp; chiefe doctrine of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which was the fift note obſerued of
a good hearer, to repoſe true felicitie and
happines in true wiſedome: This I meane
to vrge, fully, and largely, becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely
ſet downe in the text, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
all the reſt. For they which thus
eſteeme of it, will refuſe no paines to learne
and enioy it; will reuerence the teachers;
will be thankefull to God and them; For
the cauſe why few men doe deſire this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but are idle, careles, and vnwilling
to learne, the cauſe why fewe reuerence
their faithfull paſtors, few moue and ſtirre
vp any other to goodnes. Fewe reioyce in
the meanes of ſaluation, and praiſe God for
it, but rather loath &amp; contemne it, the cauſe
(I ſay) why moſt hearers are profane, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
churlish, froward, couetous, vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and vnprofitable: the cauſe of all is,
they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not rightly eſteeme of this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they thinke baſely and contempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
of it, preferring carnall wiſdome, and
all worldly things aboue it.</p>
            <p>But let this worthie woman, teach them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3274:41"/>
the true price, worth, &amp; eſtimation of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
Shee accounteth them happie that
enioy it; ſhe repoſeth the greateſt felicitie
of this life in it: ſhe might haue ſaid, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
are you which haue ſo ſumptuous and
beautifull a temple; ſuch a princely pallace,
which was twentie yeares in building, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
all that euer was, either ſince or
before: ſhee might haue ſaid, Happie are
you which haue ſo glorious and famous a
King, a mirrour &amp; wonder to all the world,
in pompe, wealth, and dignitie: ſhe might
haue ſaide, Happy are you which haue ſuch
Vineyards, Orchyards, gardens like Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
ſuch pleaſures and delights of all ſorts
and kinds: ſhe might haue ſaid, Happie are
you which haue ſuch ſtore of goodly Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Horſemen, and ſuch abundance of
gold and ſiluer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo many Targets of beaten
golde, and all drinking veſſels of golde and
ſiluer, being as common as ſtones in the
ſtrectes; but ſhee paſſing all theſe things
as nothing in compariſon, ſhe accounteth
this as the greateſt Happines, to heare and
enioy the wiſdome of <hi>Salomon;</hi> and in this
her iudgment, ſhe excelleth and ſurpaſſeth
many learned men, both before, &amp; ſince her
time, who haue erred &amp; gone farre aſtray,
touching the chiefe good and Felicitie of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3274:42"/>
man. About that queſtion of the finall
good, the Philoſophers haue kept a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
coyle among themſelues, ſeeking in
euery cranke and cauerne thereof, for the
true beatitude, for that is the finall good,
being onely deſired for it ſelfe, all their
goods hauing in their attainements, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
out of that alone: we doe not call
that the finall good, which endeth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that is, which maketh it nothing: but
that which profiteth it,<note place="margin">De ciuit: dei. lib. 19. cap: 1.</note> which giueth it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of perfection. Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defineth
the finall good, the ſame father, reiecting,
confuting, the varietie, multiplicitie, of
vaine opinions, by many Sects of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Cap: 4.</note> he ſetteth downe the Chriſtians
opinion of the chiefeſt good. If you aske vs
now ſaith he, what the Citie of God ſaith
to this poſition of the perfection of good
and euill, It will anſwere you preſently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life is the perfection of good, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
death the conſummation of euill.
And that the ayme of all our life muſt be to
auoyd this, and attaine to that other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is written, The iuſt ſhal liue by faith,
for we ſee not our greateſt good, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are to beleeue and hope for it, nor
haue power to liue accordingly, vnleſſe
our beleefe and prayer obtaine helpe of

him, who hath giuen vs that beleefe and
hope that he will helpe vs: but ſuch as <hi>Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi>
the perfection of felicitie in this life, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it either in the bodie or in the minde,
or in both, or to ſpeake more apparantly,
either in pleaſure or in vertue, or in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and reſt together, or in vertue, or in
both, or in natures firſt effects; Fondly and
vainely are theſe men perſwaded to find
true happines here. The Prophet ſcoffeth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaying, The Lord knoweth the thoghts
of men. Or as S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath it of the wiſe,
that they are vaine. Some of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
haue counted vertue in a perfect life,
ſome in the tranquilitie of the minde, ſome
proſperitie, with vertue, ſome to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſinne, and ſome haue counted it the
beſt happines to die well. <hi>Solon</hi> being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of <hi>Creſſus</hi> who excelled all in riches,
whether euer he ſawe a man more happier
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he. He named one <hi>Tellus</hi> an <hi>Athenian,</hi> a
priuate man, who had left his children and
kinſefolke well brought vp and inſtructed,
had happily ended his daies: and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
againe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> next to him he did thinke
to be happie, he named <hi>Cleobin</hi> and <hi>Bitis,</hi>
brethren, men of ſmall eſtate, who were
both dead, and left behinde them a great
name and praiſe of their pietie. The King
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3274:43"/>
being angrie ſaid vnto him, doeſt thou the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
put me in no place of happines? Yes ſaith
<hi>Solon</hi> I doe eaſily confeſſe that thou art a
King, flouriſhing with wealth and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but yet not to be called happie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou doſt happily end thy life. Of all
the Philoſophers <hi>Plato</hi> and his diſciples
came neereſt to true Chriſtianitie, and in
defining true happines, he determined,
that the end of all good was the attaining
of a vertuous life, which none could doe
but he that knewe and followed God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is any man ſaith he, happier by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes, and therefore he affirmeth,
that to be a Philoſopher is to loue God,
whoſe nature is incorporiall: the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
is then bleſſed when he enioyeth
God, he held God to be the creator of the
world, the light of vnderſtanding, the
good of all actions, the beginning of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the truth of doctrine, the happines of
life, he ſaith it muſt be a wiſe mans conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
meditation, to follow God and to be
like him, that is, to be iuſt, holy, wiſe. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he placeth beatitude, true bleſſednes
in the life to come: theſe are diuine and
heauenly points, and therefore he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Diuinus Plato.</hi> and ſome thinke, that he
had ſeene ſome part of the ſcripture, as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3274:43"/>
or Geneſes.</p>
            <p>And a man would thinke that he wrote
and ſpake like a Chriſtian, and in the
things aboue named, he and we doe agree,
but yet he was vaine in his imaginations,
and his fooliſh heart was full of darknes,
being ignorant of the true wiſedome, he
held diuers groſe errors, as the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of many Gods, the eternitie of the
world, and denied the reſurrection of our
bodies: but this we hold with him, that
there is no true felicitie in this life, but in
another, and therfore it is rightly ſaid, the
true beatitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is vnattaineable in this life,
for none liues as he liſt, but he is happie,
and none is happie but he is iuſt, yet the
iuſt liueth not as he liſt, vntill he attaine
that ſure eternall, hurtleſſe, vndeceiuing
ſtate, that he naturally deſireth, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perfect till he haue his deſire, but
what man here vpon earth can ſay hee
liues as he liſt, when his life is not in his
owne hand, he would liue faine, and he
muſt die, how then liueth he as he liſt,
when he liueth not as long as he liſt, but
if he liſt to die how can he liue as he liſt,
that will not liue at all? and if he deſire to
die, not to forgoe all life, but to change it
for a better, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liueth he not yet as he liſt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3274:44"/>
but attaineth that by dying.</p>
            <p>But admit this, he liueth as he liſt, and

all other things are affected for this, and
if this be loued as it ought to be (for he
that loues not beatitude as it ought to

chooſe but be deſired to be eternall.</p>
            <p>Againe, earthly riches can neither bleſſe
vs nor our Children with happines, we
muſt either loſe them in this life, or deeme
them to be enioyed after our death, by

We are ſaid to be happie heere on

And of this happines ſpeaketh this

Are not we to eſteeme it as the beſt, &amp; moſt
perfect happines, to enioy the preſence of
Chriſt, the true Salomon, and to bee with
him in his houſe, in euerlaſting glorie?</p>
            <p>Ieruſalem, the citie of God, the beautie
and ioy of the world, the temple of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
moſt glorious and beautiful, his owne

and pleaſant: So that happie might they be
counted which were citizens of ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which might worſhip God in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3274:48"/>
And indeed many came farre &amp; neere
to their great coſt and paines, to offer ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to God in that place: and happy might
they ſeeme to be, which liued and dwelled
in ſuch a Pallace: but all theſe were nothing
in compariſon of that Citie, of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
of that Pallace, whereof wee ſpeake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Thoſe were earthly, outward, mutable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and

Our Pilgrimage being ended,
we ſhall be indeed citizens of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and holy Ieruſalem, which ſhall be all of
pure golde, like vnto cleare criſtall, hauing
the foundations of the Walles grarniſhed
with precious ſtones, the gates of Pearles,
which hath no need of Sunne or Moone to

            <p>Heerevpon ſaith a Father, in the ſecret
ſpeech of his ſoule with God; O Lorde, If
thou for this vile bodie of ours, giue vs ſo
great and innumerable benefites, from the
Firmament, from the Aire, from the Earth,
from the Sea, by light, by darknes, by
heate, by ſhadowe, by deawes, by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
by windes, by raines, by Byrdes, by
Fiſhes, by beaſts, by Trees, by multitude

ſweete Lord, what manner of things, how
great, how good, and how innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are thoſe which thou haſt prepared in
our heauenly countrey, where we ſhall ſee
thee face to face. If thou doeſt ſo great

giue vs in thy Pallace? If thou giueſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in the worlde, to good and euill
men together, what haſt thou layde vp for
only good men in the worlde to come? If
thine enimies and friendes together, are ſo
well prouided for in this life, what ſhall thy
onely Friends receiue in the life to come?
If there be ſo great ſolace in theſe dayes of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3274:49"/>
teares, what ioy ſhall there bee in that day
of marriage? If our Iayle containe ſo great
matters, what ſhall our countrey and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
doe? And as there is no ende of thy

that felicitie is not, then what it is: there is
no death, no ſorrow, no wearines, no hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
no thirſt, no pouertie, no infirmitie, no
corruption; all is good, and greatly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
good: yea, and ſurely, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
good. All offices and callings, both of
Church and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, do there ceaſe:
there is an end of our Faith, hope, patience,

louing euery each one of them, euen as our

of eache of them then of our ſelues?
Surely, if neuer a one of the Elect ſhall be
capable of his owne Ioy, for the greatnes
of it, how ſhall hee be capable of ſo many
ioyes, for the happines of ſo many of the
Elect, for whome he ſhall feele as much ioy
as for his owne.</p>
            <p>What a Ioye ſhall it be, to ſee ſuch an

enioy it, in health, ſafetie, and honour, yet
ſhouldeſt thou eſteeme it as ridiculous and

ſhouldeſt thou deſpiſe the greateſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3274:51"/>
none can take it from vs, in compariſon of
which, all ioy is ſorrowe, all pleaſure is
paine, all ſweetnes is ſower, all beautie is
filthines. His countenance is pleaſant, his
words ſweete, his face delectable to looke
vpon: Yet there we may alwayes beholde
him, there wee may alwayes haue him, and
delight in him. This is the chiefe &amp; whole
felicity of man, to know, and loue his louer:
Hee that is ſure of this, will ſell all that hee
hath to get this treaſure: will count all the
things of this life droſſe and dung in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of that. The hope and aſſurance of
this, hath made the Saintes of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the worlde, to mortifie the fleſh, to
to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble their ſoules, to fight againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,

hauing reſpect to the crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
the place of pleaſure, euerlaſting life.</p>
            <p>This made Moſes to refuſe to be called
the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter, &amp; to chuſe

God. The one doth diſpoſe of ſpeeches
and actions, according to the nature of
the hearers, and buſineſſes; The other, is
alwayes like her ſelfe: laying open the
ſinnes of men, and the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them; offering CHRIST and his
benefites to all beleeuing, and repenting
ſinners: and finallie, vrging amendment,
and newnes of life. This is the ſumme and
courſe of Gods wiſdome without alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Againe, the wiſedome of the world,
doth deuiſe &amp; vtter eloquent ſpeeches, and
fine ſentences: the wiſdome of God, doth
vſe fit, graue, ſimple, &amp; plaine words: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth boaſt it ſelfe, &amp; doth lift vp the
mindes of men, this doth humble and caſt
them downe.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing there are ſo many and great
differences, how can they agree together,
and euer be reconciled? And therefore the
wiſedome of God, accounteth the wiſdom
of the world fooliſhnes; and the Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
baſely of the wiſdome of this worlde,
eſteeming &amp; counting it meere fooliſhnes.
And yet there is a lawfull vſe, of ciuill wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in this life, but in the life to come, it
hath no vſe at all: this heere is not to bee
contemned, but may bee vſed; and hath
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3274:56"/>
many commodities in this world, but it
doth nothing profit to ſaluation: it muſt
not meddle with Gods wiſedome, to check
or controule it, but rather ſubmit her ſelfe
to it, as a ſeruant and hand-maid, and to
keeepe her ſelfe within her owne compaſſe
and limits; and yet this wiſedome hath her
worthineſſe and excellencie, it is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then riches, pleaſure, or ſtrength;
for what are all theſe without wiſedome?
and therefore the Wiſe man ſayeth, That
wiſedome is good with an inheritance, and
excellent to them that ſee the ſunne: his
meaning is, that heritages, goods &amp; lands,
are the gifts of God, but wiſedome is farre
more excellent, and may be without them:
but riches or pleaſures without wiſedome,
will doe vs more hurt then good. Againe
he ſayeth, Wiſedome ſhall ſtrengthen the
wiſe man more then ten mightie princes
that are in the citie. Yet moſt doe glorie in
riches, and hunt after pleaſures, and few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
humane wiſedome and learning: moe
are fooliſh, ſimple, and ſottiſh that way,
then wiſe. Great good and profit comes by
the knowledge of naturall things, for they
doe publiſh the praiſe of the Creator, and
from them we may learne to know the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 1.</note> The heauens declare the glorie of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3274:57"/>
God, and the firmament ſheweth his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
worke. But this knowledge is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make men excuſable, but not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to ſaluation. But all ciuill &amp; humane
wiſedome is but a ſhadow, in reſpect of
true wiſedome, which doth excell al other,
as the heauen doth excell the earth: this
commeth and proceedeth from the holie
of holieſt, as it were from the kings ſecret
cloſet; the other from the common treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as it were from the outward courts of
the kings pallace: true wiſedome is beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
onely vpon Gods friends, the other
vpon his enemies alſo. It may be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
then of what wiſedome this woman
ſpeaketh, which ſhe calleth the wiſedome
of Salomon, and counteth them bleſſed
that heareth it. It is true that Salomon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in the knowledge of naturall things,
of liberall ſciences, and of publicke &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
gouernment. It is ſaid before in this
booke,<note place="margin">1. King. 4. 29. 30. 31.</note> that God gaue Salomon wiſedome
and vnderſtanding exceeding much, and a
large heart, euen as the ſand that is on the
ſea ſhore: &amp; Salomons wiſedome excelled
the wiſedome of all the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Eaſt,
&amp; al the wiſedome of Egypt, for he was wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man, &amp; he was famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all nations round about. But this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3274:57"/>
came to be inſtructed and ſatisfied, in
things concerning the name of the Lord:
ſhe came to Ieruſalem where was the Law,
the Temple, &amp; Salomon: ſhe had no doubt
at home many Philoſophers, many wiſe &amp;
learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which could ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly inſtruct
her in the knowledge of naturall &amp; worldly
matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> but they could not ſatisfie her, in
her doubts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning religion. Againe, the
effect &amp; power wrought in her heart by this
wiſedome, driueth her to great admiration,
ſhe repoſeth felicitie in it, it wrought in her
grace &amp; religion, confeſſing &amp; worſhipping
the true God, and acknowledging Iſrael to
be Gods people. No wit of man, no ciuil or
humane wiſedome, hath any ſuch power to
worke ſuch a worke. Now that Salomon
was a Prophet, &amp; full of diuine wiſedome,
his works extant amongſt vs doe proue it:
I meane his three worthie bookes of the
Prouerbes, Canticles, &amp; Eccleſiaſtes, which
are Canonicall, and his true bookes in the
Hebrew Canon. I pray you conſider with
me the ſumme of the diuine matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in thoſe bookes: The Prouerbes are
moſt excellent, not humane, but diuine:
all nations and tongues haue their peculiar
prouerbs, ſentences, and wittie counſels,
in fewe words, ſetting out great matter.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3274:58"/>
There be ſentences of Plato, Ariſtotle, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,
Seneca, but there is great difference
betwixt the Prouerbes and ſentences of
the wiſeſt Gentiles, and Prouerbs of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
for the other they are knowne in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and many of them are prophane, and
filthie, contrarie to faith and charitie; but
theſe are Propheticall, ſacred Scripture,
inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt: they containe
many things, which humane reaſon is not
able to ſee nor comprehend: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the word of God, and teach true
wiſedome, how we may attaine to it, and
ſtirre vp all to ſeeke and follow it; they
teach vs faith and pietie, the true worſhip
and feare of God, the true loue of God
and our neighbour: they are full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and exhortations, full of graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and ſweete conſolations; they informe
all men in the ſeuerall duties of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
<note place="margin">Prou. 8.</note> they commend vertue, and forbid
vice;<note place="margin">Prou. 9.</note> they ſet downe rewards for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and puniſhments for the wicked; they
ſpeake of Chriſt, the wiſedome of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the wiſedome of the Father. The
Canticles, intituled, The Song of Songs,
the moſt excellent and holie Song, is no
vaine nor idle booke, of wanton loue, as
carnall men may falſely conceiue and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3274:58"/>
but it is altogether myſticall, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſpirituall loue of Chriſt and
his Church. And thus writeth one of this
booke:<note place="margin">Aug. de ciuit. dei lib. 17. cap. 20.</note> The Canticles (ſayeth he) is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
ſpirituall, and holie delight, in the
Mariage of the King and the Queene of
this heauenlie Citie; that is, Chriſt and the
Church: but this is all in myſticall figures, to
inflame vs the more to ſearch the truth, &amp;
to delight the more in finding the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of that Bridegroome, to whom it is
ſaid there, Trueth hath loued thee: and of
that Bride that receiueth this word, Loue
is in thy delightes. As for the booke of the
Eccleſiaſtes, it doth intreate of the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
we haue now in hand, of the chiefe
felicitie of man in this life, that it is not
in humane wiſedome, nor in pleaſure, nor
in vertue, if it be conſidered as it is in it
ſelfe, nor in any publique or priuate ſtate
of life. Againe, he ſheweth what is true
felicitie, namely, to feare God, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him with a true and vnfaigned heart.
This booke maketh nothing for Epicures
and Atheiſts, though hee ſeeme to ſtirre
them vp to eating and drinking, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce,
as though this was the chiefe felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of man in this life.</p>
            <p>S. Auguſtine applieth that in the place
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3274:59"/>
before alledged, to ſpirituall eating and
drinking, &amp; to the participation of Chriſts
table. For he ſayeth, The Preacher cannot
meane of carnal eating, becauſe in an other
place of that booke he ſaith, It is better to
goe to the houſe of mourning, then to goe
to the houſe of feaſting: becauſe this is the
end of all men, and the liuing ſhall lay it to
his heart. Againe, the heart of the wiſe is in
the houſe of mourning, but the hearts of
fooles are in the houſe of mirth: yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it may be, and it is moſt likely, that he
ſpeaketh not in his owne perſon, but in the
perſon of Epicures, not allowing their
ſpeech nor practiſe.<note place="margin">Eccle. 2.</note> For doth he not ſay of
laughter and pleaſure, Thou art mad? And
doth he not in an other place ſcoffe and
threaten yong men for their vaine delights
and pleaſures, ſaying; Reioyce ô yong man
in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee
in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the
wayes of thy heart in the ſight of thine
eyes, but know, that for all theſe things
God will bring thee to iudgement. And
preſently after he giueth him this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
<note place="margin">Eccle. 12.</note> Remember now thy Creator in the
dayes of thy youth. And ô ye Atheiſts, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures,
and Libertines, marke and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the concluſion of that booke, as he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3274:59"/>
began, ſo he endeth, crying and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Vanitie of vanities (ſayeth the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher)
all is vanitie: and the laſt word of
his booke are theſe, Let vs heare the end
of all, Feare God, and keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:
for this is the whole dutie of
man, for God will bring euery worke to
iudgement, with euery ſecret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be good or euill. This is the chiefe
wiſedome of Salomon, which is extant,
written and recorded for the inſtruction
of all poſterities: this is true and diuine
wiſedome: and though it was not then
written when theſe words were ſpoken,
yet the ſame or the like he taught this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
ſhe receiued &amp; beleeued it, and with
great ioy doth heere, commend, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
it. Therefore true felicitie conſiſteth
in true and diuine wiſedome, which was
vnknowne to the Philoſophers, for their
wiſedome was earthlie, falſe, and contrary
to it ſelfe: and as there is one Creator and
gouernor of the world, one God, one truth,
ſo there muſt needs be but one true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
becauſe whatſoeuer is true &amp; good,
it cannot be perfect, except it be ſingular.
And therefore it is worthilie ſaid, All the
wiſedome of man conſiſteth in this one
thing, that he know and worſhip God: this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3274:60"/>
is our doctrine, this is our ſentence, and
therefore with as high a voice as I can, this
I teſtifie, this I proclaime, and this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
<note place="margin">Lactan. lib. 3. de fal. ſap. cap. 6.</note> this is that which all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
in their whole life ſought for, but
could neuer finde nor comprehend it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they held a falſe religion, or elſe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ouerthrew religion: let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
goe, which haue troubled the life of
man, for what ſhould they teach, or whom
ſhould they inſtruct, who haue not inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelues? whom can the ſicke man
cure, or whom can the blind rule or guide?
ſhall wee tarrie then till Socrates know
any thing? till Anaxagoras finde light in
darkeneſſe? or ſhall we ſtay till Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
draw out the truth? or till Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
dilate the paths of his minde? or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſilus
and Carneades perceiue and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand?
Behold a voyce from heauen
teaching the truth, and ſhewing to vs
light more cleare then the ſunne it ſelfe.
Why are wee iniurious to our ſelues, and
ſo ſlow to receiue wiſedome? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
worthie men haue ſpent themſelues
in ſeeking, and yet could neuer finde? He
that will bee wiſe and bleſſed, let him
heare the voyce of God, let him learne
righteouſneſſe, let him contemne earthly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3274:60"/>
things, receiue heauenly, that ſo he may
attaine to the beſt and greateſt good, to
the which hee was borne, caſting a ſide
all other religions: Let vs come to the true
religion and wiſedome, this true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
conſiſteth in the knowledge of our
ſelues, and in the knowledge of God, this
is the height of wiſedome, in compariſon
of which all knowledge is ignorance, and if
thou hadſt the perfect knowledge of all
Arts and Sciences, what would it profit
thee if thou knowe not thy ſelfe: thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt
abroad, and thinkeſt thou knoweſt
many things, and yet are blinde at home:
But ô bleſſed ſoule which is filled with
wiſedome of God, and happie is he who
deſireth to be wiſe in Gods ſight, for one
little drop of this true wiſedome, is more
worth, then a riuer and ſea of worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
In all the creatures the Lord doth
ſhew his wiſedome and power, but moſt
of all in man, creating him after his owne
Image and likenes: many knowe many
things, and yet knowe not themſelues:
they ſee others and paſſe by themſelues:
the better thou doeſt knowe thy ſelfe, the
better thou ſhalt knowe God. Set before
thine eyes the miſerie of thy body, and the
ſhortnes of this miſerable life, and ſo thou
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3274:61"/>
ſhalt come to GOD; thou muſt beginn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
with the knowledge of thy ſelfe: this will
humble thee, and make thee feare God.
If thou wilt knowe what thou art, looke
thy ſelfe in a glaſſe: The glaſſe of a man,
is an other man; If an other be earth, duſt,
and wormes, ſuch a one art thou, bee thou
neuer ſo Riche, or Honourable. If thou
wilt ſee what thou art, looke vpon a man,
(not aliue, but deade) what hee is, ſuch
were his predeceſſors, and what they are,
thou ſhalt be the ſame hereafter.</p>
            <p>If thou looke well vpon thy ſelfe, thou
ſhalt finde in thee ſufficient matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
thy ſelfe. What art thou in reſpect
of thy bodie, but a veſſell of corruption?
That bodie, which thou ſo tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt,
it ſhall rotte, and come to nothing.
What is more noyſome then a deade bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
What is more miſerable then mans
life? and moſt of all miſerable, in reſpect
of his ſoule, being without grace, an heire
and childe of perdition.</p>
            <p>This knowledge of our ſelues, the
firſt part of true wiſedome, will cut downe
all Pride, Ambition, and Impatience;
and from this proceedeth the knowledge
of God; and from the knowledge of our
ſelues: knowe GOD to be moſt iuſt, moſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3274:61"/>
mercifull, moſt wiſe, moſt good, and moſt
powerfull. And if thou wouldſt knowe
what GOD is, ſee what thou art to him,
and what hee is to thee. And if thou wilt
rightly knowe GOD, caſt off the loue and
wiſedome of the world.</p>
            <p>This double knowledge of GOD and
thy ſelfe, is neceſſarie to ſaluation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as from the knowledge of thy ſelfe,
there commeth into thee the feare of God;
and alſo from the knowledge of God,
there proceedeth the loue of God. So on
the contrary,<note place="margin">Bern: ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cant.</note> from the ignorance of thy
ſelfe, proceedeth Pride, and from the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of GOD, commeth Deſperation.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt found true wiſedome, if thou
wilt amend the ſinnes of thy former life;
If thou deſire with all thy heart Eternall
bleſſednes,<note place="margin">Bern: in Pro: 3.</note> thou haſt found wiſedome; If
thou taſte and ſauour all theſe things, as
they are, that thy ſinne bee bitter to thee,
and abhorred; that the thinges of the
worlde bee as Tranſitorie, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible;
that the perfect good things, bee
with thy whole deſires affected; In
theſe three things, thy mouth doth ſlowe
with Wiſedome: If in thy mouth there
bee confeſſion of thy ſinnes, the voyce
of praiſe, and of Thankes-giung, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3274:62"/>
the word of edification. The wiſe man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth
himſelfe, glorifieth God, edifieth
his neighbour: therefore in the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
there could be found no true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
becauſe ſome thought that all things
might be knowne: theſe were not wiſe:
others thought nothing could be knowne,
theſe alſo were not wiſe: the one becauſe
they giue too much to man, the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they gaue too little: this then is wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
not to thinke thou knoweſt all
things which is proper to God, nor yet to
knowe nothing which is proper to beaſts:
knowledge in man is ioyned with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
knowledge in vs, is from the ſoule,
which is from heauen: ignorance is from
the body, which is from the earth, ſo that
we haue ſome communitie both with God
and with beaſtes; with God in reſpect of
knowledge, with beaſtes in reſpect of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:
The more wee excell in diuine
knowledge, the nearer and the more liker
we are to God himſelfe, who is not onely
the fountaine and giuer of wiſedome, but
very wiſedome it ſelfe. But here may an
obiection be propounded, How is there
any true happines, ſeeing both in the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
holding, and enioying of wiſedome,
there is much care labour, ſorrowe, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3274:62"/>
vexation of minde. This Salomon himſelfe
confeſſeth, when he ſaith, I gaue mine heart
to knowe wiſedome &amp; knowledge,<note place="margin">Ecc: 1. 17. 18.</note> mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and fooliſhnes: and I knowe alſo that
this is a vexation of the ſpirit, for in the
multitude of wiſedome is much griefe, and
he that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth
ſorrow: this is true indeed, that in al trades,
callings, ſciences, there is great griefe and
labour. The Philoſophers no doubt tooke
great paines in finding out naturall things,
yet in many things, they were blinde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
in gouernment, either of common-wealth
or families: there is much care and
labour, in inuenting of counſell and griefe,
when our counſells are hindred, and haue
not good effect, and ſometimes we erre in
gouerning, and the wiſeſt men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſo wiſe as they ſhould be, and the
beſt wiſedome of man cannot foreſee all
dangers which follow, nor preuent them
with all their cunning. In Mechanicall
trades and handicrafts, what care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to learne them, to exerciſe them, and
to encreaſe daily in skill and knowledge of
them? and in diuine wiſedome, there muſt
be great care and labour to get it, to hold
it, to increaſe in it, it will not be gotten by
eaſe and careleſnes, but with great ſtudie
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3274:63"/>
and diligence, and much ſorrow is ioyned
with it.</p>
            <p>Good men are grieued, becauſe they
cannot ſo ſoone and ſo eaſily learn and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
as manie other can. Wee reade
&amp; heare many things, which do cauſe much
griefe vnto vs, as our owne ſinnes, and the
ſinnes of others; and the fearful iudgments
of God, which haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon men for ſin:
and the more knowledge we haue, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in ſin, without Repentance, the more
wee heape and multiplie the wrath of God
vpon vs, to our greater griefe and ſorrow:
and the more learning and knowledge that
men haue, the leſſe eaſe and reſt: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſeeke vnto them, and they are ready and
willing to inſtruct others as much as they
can: which cannot be done without ſtudie
and labour. The calling of the Magiſtrate,
and of the Miniſter, though excellent &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
callings, yet ſubiect to much vexation,
ſorrow, and danger, and exceeding paines.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, Who is ſufficient for
theſe things? And indeed, they be heauie
and intollerable burdens for anie mortall
man to beare, without the ſpeciall helpe
and grace of God. Beſides, the wiſer that
a man is, the more he ſearcheth, deſireth,
and ſeeketh for wiſedome ſtill: &amp; the more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3274:63"/>
he ſees his own ignorance; and this is griefe
and vexation of minde. There is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of wiſdome in this life; we ſee here
but in part, the beſt, and holieſt, and wiſeſt,
haue their wants, infirmities, &amp; ignorances.
Therfore the wiſe man (hauing feeling and
ſenſe of this, though he did excell in vertue
and knowledge; Yet he ſaith thus of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Surely, I am more fooliſh then anie
man, &amp; haue not the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of man: I

            <p>The greateſt wiſedome in man, is like a

The beſt men are woſt humble,

be borne againe. The naturall man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not the things of God, for they are

them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
yea, the ſpirituall man himſelf, though
he diſcerneth all things that are reuealed
to him by the ſpirit, yet he hath not full
and perfect knowledge in this life, perfect
felicitie is in the life to come: and though
wiſedome be not that felicitie, yet it is the
way to attaine vnto it, and the ſtudie of it
is ſweete, good and profitable: it is as ſault
to ſeaſon, and as honie to ſweeten all cares,
troubles and ſorrowes whatſoeuer: it is as
a precious medicine to cure all maladies,

happie becauſe of their ignorance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are free from the care and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of wiſedome: yet their cares and

Some may yet obiect: How is there
happines in wiſedome? whereas many
which profeſſe and preach it, and are of
great knowledge, yet prophane, without
religion, conſcience or pietie, their life
moſt vngodly and wicked, are theſe men
happie? We anſwere, that they are farre
from true happines and wiſedome. Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
accounteth all men vnregenerated
and wicked, to be very fooles, and ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
wretches. Ambroſe tepoſeth a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
life in honeſtie, that is, in the tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of conſcience, and ſecuritie of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
and therefore confuting the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
of whom ſome placed a happie life,
in not ſorrowing as Ieronimus, ſome in the
knowledge of things as Herillus: ſome in
pleaſure as Epicurus: ſome haue ioyned to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3274:65"/>
this honeſtie, as Calipho and Diadorus,
ſome in vertue, as Ariſtotle and his ſect.
But the Scripture ſayth, he placeth a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
life in the knowledge of Diuinitie,
and the fruite of good working: It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life (ſayth Chriſt) to know God,
and Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
ſayeth, Bleſſed is the man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

vices, it hath an inſeparable coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with other vertues. No man is wiſe

How is hee a wiſe man which knoweth
not his Creator? How is hee wiſe which
feareth not God?<note place="margin">Off. lib. 1. cap. 25.</note> ſeeing the feare of God
is the beginning of wiſedome. Onely that
wiſedome which is of God, is wholeſome
and ſauing, which according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of Saint Iames, is both pure, and
peaceable: for the wiſedome of the fleſh
is voluptuous, not pure: the wiſedome of
the world is tumultuous and troubleſome,
not peaceable: the wiſedome of God is
firſt pure, not ſeeking her owne, but that
which is Ieſus Chriſts: not doing her owne
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3274:65"/>
will, but conſidering what is the will of
God. Secondly, it is peaceable, not aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in her owne ſenſe, but reſting more
vpon the counſell and iudgement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Againe, the ſunne doth not warme
all whom it ſhineth vpon, ſo wiſedome
doth not alwayes giue power to thoſe
whom it teacheth, to doe that which it
teacheth. It is one thing to knowe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<note place="margin">Bern. in Cant.</note> another thing to poſſeſſe them. It
is not knowledge that maketh rich, but
the poſſeſſion of it. There be ſome which
deſire to knowe to that end onely, that
they might know, and this is filthie curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie:
and there be which deſire to know,
onely to ſell their knowledge for money,
for honor, and this is filthie lucre: and
there be which deſire to know, that they
themſelues may be knowne, and this is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
vanitie: and there bee that deſire to
know to edifie others, and this is charitie:
and there be that deſire to know to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified

The firſt wiſedome is a laudable life,<note place="margin">Greg.</note> and

of thoſe which are truely wiſe, and truely

Therefore let vs pray with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

               </gap> Lord, &amp; be mercifull vnto vs: as thou

We muſt not thinke then, that this woman
aſcribeth happines to the bare hearing of
Wiſedome: but this hearing, includeth
knowledge, Faith, and practiſe. Therefore
the Schoolemen make three kindes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
The one ſenſitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with outward eare,
an another Intellectuall, (that is) with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
the third, they call <hi>Auditus obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiuus;</hi>
that is, hearing with obedience.
The fooliſh Virgins they haue Lampes, but
no oyle in them, they haue onely a bare
profeſſion, and knowledge, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grace, or practiſe: but the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
haue their Lamps full of oyle, full of
Faith, obedience, holineſſe. Such as be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hearers, and not practitioners of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they be like vnto a man that behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his naturall face in a glaſſe, and when
he hath conſidered himſelfe, hee goeth his
way, and forgetteth immediatly what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of one he was: ſuch are fooliſh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
hearers. With true wiſdome, there
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3274:67"/>
is always ioyned true religion, &amp; ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore ſaith one; Wiſedome is no
other thing, but Truth it ſelfe, in the which
the true Felicitie ſhall be found: It is in no
place, it is euery where, it admoniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
it teacheth at home; it maketh all
better, and none worſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, he that loueth himſelfe being a
Foole, ſhall not profite in wiſedome. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it be poſſible to be ſuch a one, as
he deſireth to be, except he hate himſelfe, as
hee is. Both theſe muſt be ioyned together,
Religion and wiſdome: but men are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that will ſeeke religion without wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
and therefore they fall into falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
becauſe they haue left true Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
And ſome giue themſelues to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
without religion, but therefore their
wiſdome is falſe &amp; vaine, becauſe they haue

               </gap>are of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the true God, who
would guide &amp; inſtruct them in the way of
the beſt and happieſt wiſedome.</p>
            <p>Of this vniting of religion and wiſdome
together,<note place="margin">Lacta: de fal. ſap: lic. 4. ca. 3.</note> Lactantius writeth excellently:
Where Wiſedome (ſaith hee) is coupled
with Religion, there muſt of neceſſitie bee
true religion, and true wiſedome; becauſe
in worſhipping God, wee haue wiſdome:
that is, wee muſt knowe what is to bee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3274:68"/>
worſhipped, and how, and in being wiſe,
we muſt worſhip God: that is, we muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in truth and deed, that which we
know: where then is wiſedome with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to be found? euen there where the
one true God is worſhipped: where the
life and all our actions are referred to one
head: and he concludeth thus, in wiſedome
is religion, in religion is wiſedome, they
cannot be ſeparated nor put aſunder: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to be wiſe, is nothing elſe but to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
the true God, with iuſt and holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
And moſt worthily after he ſaith thus;
Wiſedome pertaineth to ſonnes which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
loue: religion to ſeruants which
requireth feare: as they are to loue, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
their father,<note place="margin">Lanct ibid Cap. 4</note> ſo theſe are to feare and
reuerence their maiſter: God being one,
becauſe he taketh vpon him both theſe
perſons of a father and a maiſter: we ought
to loue him, becauſe we are his children:
and to feare him, becauſe we are his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
And therefore it cannot be that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
ſhould be ſeparated from wiſedom,
nor wiſedome from religion, becauſe the
ſame God is he who muſt be knowne,
which is a part of wiſedome, and muſt alſo
be honoured, which is a part of religion:
but let religion goe before, and let wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3274:68"/>
follow, becauſe we muſt firſt know
God, and then we muſt worſhip him; the
fountaine of wiſedome and religion, is
God himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lfe. Therefore prophane and
wicked men are not truely wiſe, and ſo not
truly happie: the Lord complaineth of ſuch
people,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 28. 29.</note> they are a nation voyd of counſell,
neither is there any vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in them:
Oh that they were wiſe, then they would
vnderſtand this, they would conſider their

They would vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſaith he, the things
which are of God,<note place="margin">In quad: Epiſt:</note> the things which are of
the world, and they would foreſee the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of hell, then they would abhorre
hell, deſire heauen, and contemne the
earth. And this is true knowledge ſaith he,
to know that the Lord will come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though we cannot knowe when he
will come. And where as ſome wil ſay, that
all men know this, euen the wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
but ſaith he, this knowledge wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
repentance, amendment of life, and a
care &amp; deſire to liue honeſtly. And S. Iohn
ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3. 3.</note> That euery man that hath this hope in
him, purgeth himſelfe as he is pure; ſo that
true knowledge, and true ſanctin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cation,
goeth together. Therefore S. Iohn ſaith
in an other place, Hereby we are ſure that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3274:69"/>
we knowe him, if we keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
he that ſaith I knowe him, and
keepeth not his commandements, is a liar,
and the truth is not in him. So that this
ſtandeth as an infallible true principle,
that thoſe which are truly wiſe, are truly
happie in this life; and in the way to that
full and perfect happines in the life to
come. But now at laſt, to obſerue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the chiefe &amp; maine point, and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of this place, which is this, that the
way and meanes to make a people happie,
is rightly to heare and obey wiſedome:
this is the principall ioy and happines of
Gods Children in this life. And therefore
ſaith Salomon, Bleſſed is the man that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
wiſedome, and the man that getteth
vnderſtanding, for the merchandiſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is better then the merchandiſe of ſiluer;
and the gaine thereof, is better then gold;
it is more precious then pearles; and all
things that thou canſt deſire, are not to be
compared to her: length of daies is in her
right hand, and in her left hand, riches and
glory: her waies are the waies of pleaſure,
and all her pathes proſperitie; ſhe is a true
life to them that lay hold on her, and
bleſſed is he that retaineth her: ſee the
fruits of wiſedome, immortalitie, durable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3274:69"/>
riches,<note place="margin">Gen: 2.</note> eternall glory, true Ioy and peace;
ſhe is a tree of life to the ſoule, like that

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or like to the tree of life ſhewed to Moſes

22. verſ: 2. which brought forth
twelue fruits, and the leaues thereof were
for the curing of the gentiles: or like any
liuing good tree, which bringeth forth

Therefore the wiſe man ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro: 4. 13.</note> Take hold of

ſhe is thy life.<note place="margin">Pro: 10. 17.</note> And againe, Hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth

Such a tree is wiſedome. It is compared

Oh yee fooliſh men, vnderſtand wiſedom:

But Dauid proceedeth, and ſheweth what

hearing, meditation, &amp; ſuch other exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the word: he was not a ſimple, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
vnprofitable, and vnfruitefull hearer,
as many are which heare much and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

learned wiſedome, yea more wiſedome
then his enemies, more then all his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
more then the ancient, and that by
the power of the word, he refrained his
feete from euery euill way, and hated all
the waies of falſhood, and that his chiefe

was God that did inwardly teach him
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3274:73"/>
by his ſpirit, and ſo taſting the ſweetnes
of Gods grace in him, he found the word
and promiſe of God more ſweet to his

account and eſtimation Dauid had of
true wiſedome, eſteeming it his chiefeſt

And if this woman thus pronounce and
account the hearers of Salomon to be ſo
happie, how happie are they which doe
dayly heare the wiſedome of Ieſus Chriſt,
in the preaching and miniſtrie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell?
Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee,

<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 16, 17.</note> For verily I ſay vnto you, that many
Prophets and righteous men haue deſired
to ſee thoſe things which you ſee, and haue
not ſeene them; and to heare thoſe things
which you heare, and haue not heard them.
Now in the miniſtrie of the Goſpel, wee
heare and ſee Chriſt himſelfe: He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

We beſeech you as embaſſadors in Chriſts
ſtead,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> that you may be reconciled to God,
ſayeth S. Paul. And in another place, he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3274:73"/>
ſayeth,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> That Chriſt was deſcribed and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
before their eyes by the preaching
of the word. It was not the outward hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Chriſt himſelfe, or the ſight of his
perſon that made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bleſſed: for the Iewes
ſaw him, Iudas and other enemies to Chriſt
heard him and ſaw him often; But bleſſed
are they that haue not ſeene, and yet haue

hath ſent forth her maidens and
meſſengers to call and inuite vs to her feaſt
and banquet, happie are her gueſts, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

haue ſuch meſſengers is a ſpeciall and rare
bleſſing of God. In Iob it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Elihu, as a ſpeciall comfort in
the greateſt diſtreſſe and danger, to haue
a meſſenger, an interpreter, one of a

then will God haue mercie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

words we are taught, that it is a ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Gods fauour and bleſſing towards

that if it had ben poſſible, you would haue

then to haue his priuie counſell reuealed to

Nay, Is it not eternall life, to know GOD,

ſuch were the wicked &amp; malicious Iewes,

that they might be ſaued, to fulfill their

ſinnes alwaies, for the wrath of God is
come on them to the vtmoſt. Such a one

this alſo ſerueth to reprooue all thoſe
which may heare and will not, ſuch are all
Recuſants, Papiſticall, or Anabaptiſticall,
which refuſe to come to our aſſemblies,
and will not be partakers with vs, either of
the word or Sacraments: they haue other
meetings, &amp; haue gathered to themſelues
other kinde of teachers, and haue made
quite ſeparation from vs, and yet without
any iuſt cauſe or reaſon: and the true meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of wiſedome, doe truly deliuer the
doctrine of ſaluation, ſpeaking in ſinceritie
as of God, in the ſight of God, caſting from
them the cloakes of ſhame,<note place="margin">2. Cor: 4. 2.</note> neither hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the word of God deceitfully, but in
declaration of the truth, approuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
to the conſciences of all good men.
There be many worthie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our Church,
of excellent gifts and graces, whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie
hath beene powerfull, to call many
thouſands, from ſinne and error, to truth

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3274:78"/>
of ſoules: Our Church holdeth the
true foundation, it ſetteth it ſelfe, by doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine

haue ſuffred him. As if he ſhould ſay, If any
man can preach a better Ieſus, a better
Goſpell, a better ſpirit, they might hearken
to him, but indeed none could doe it. And
therfore he ſaith in an other place, Though
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3274:79"/>
that wee, or an Angell from heauen, preach
vnto you otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which we haue

we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now againe: If any

We preach the true Ieſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the
ſcriptures, that there is no Name vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that wee can be ſaued by but by him:
that hee is both true God and man; that he
is the King, the Prieſt, and Prophet of his
Church: we preach the true Goſpell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the doctrine of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
To this doctrine is ioyned the true

any of them can teach a better Ieſus, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Goſpel, a better ſpirit, we will harken to
them: The Papiſts they teach &amp; hold many
things corruptly of Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne
of God, ouerthrowing the power, and ende
of his comming, and derogating from him
the glory of our owne, and full redemption;
by their Maſſe, and manie Mediators, they
aboliſh the Prieſthood of Chriſt, by the

and quite ouerthrow the Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Chriſt, by their owne Inuentions,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3274:79"/>
and vaine Traditions: they take away his
Propheticall office: their Goſpell is full of

is a ſpirit of Error, of Ignorance, of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

            <p>It may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (ſome will ſay) that they hold
the ſame Ieſus, and Goſpell with vs; Let it
be graunted that they and wee agree in all
matters concerning Faith and ſaluation, as
it may appeare by their owne confeſſion of
Faith, wherin there is nothing, that is ſound
and Orthodoxall, but they receiued it from
vs: Many of them, ſpecially of their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and firſt beginners, were bredde and
borne amongſt vs; they had their faith, if
they haue any: their knowledge, the word
and Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from vs; they confeſſe, they
holde the ſame things with vs, and other
Churches, touching matters of Faith; the
more ſhame for them, to flie and run away
from vs, as though they had ſome better
Ieſus, ſome better Goſpell then wee haue:
where as all may ſee, that they haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And therefore their ſeparation is
moſt vnkinde and ridiculous. Let the beſt
reformed churches in the world, who haue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3274:80"/>
giuen vs the right hands of fellowſhip. Let
them (I ſay) be Iudges between vs &amp; them:
or let the ſcriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, truly opened

betweene vs. Let them ſhew &amp; bring forth

from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, you your ſelues, haue receiued
all the good things which you holde, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or profeſſe, in matters of Religion.
So that you might ſay as Carneados a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
was woont to ſay of his Maiſter
and reader Chriſippus; If it had not bene
for Chriſippus, I neuer had bene any body.
So might you ſay, If the pride of your heart
will ſuffer you: If it had not beene for the
church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, many of you could neuer
haue had, Bible, Faith, nor knowledge, in
the matters of your ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Now you doe very ill requite the fathers
that begot you, the mother that bare you,
thus to flie from them, to accuſe, ſlaunder,
reuile, and curſe them. Herein you deale,
as Ariſtotle dealt with his maiſtar Plato;
who hauing gotten great Learning from
his maſter, did after oppoſe himſelf againſt
him, and by all meanes ſought his diſgrace
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3274:80"/>
and diſcredit: Therfore Plato was wont to
call Ariſtotle a Mule; becauſe when ſhee
hath filled her ſelf with her mothers milke,
ſhe will beate her damme with her heeles.</p>
            <p>Plato ſignified by this, the ingratitude of
Ariſtotle; for when he had receiued from
Plato the principles of Phyloſophie, and
encreaſe of knowledge therein, he became
enemy to the ſchoole of Plato; and with his
Familiers and Schollers, did alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and ſtriue againſt Plato. If the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of theſe men bee not as harde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
againſt our Church, let any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; indifferent men iudge: And are they
not too neere like the Viper, who gnaweth
out the dammes bellie, and ſo liueth by the
death of her damme? But of the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
of theſe men, to God, their Prince,
and this Church, we ſhall ſpeake of it in an
other place; For this time I referre them to
the iudgment of two worthy men, writing
iointly vpon the 13. chap: of the Prouerbs,
13. verſe, the words are theſe: He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
the word ſhall be deſtroyed: but he
that feareth the commandement, hee ſhall
be rewarded. This ſentence (ſay they) will
preſſe ſo vpon the Browniſts, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
bitter deſpiſers of the Miniſtrie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, by ſeparating themſelues from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3274:81"/>
the Churches of God, and deprauing all the
holy meanes of ſaluation; howſoeuer they
prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſtand for ſinceritie, yet they reſiſt
it: &amp; taking vpon them to be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions for

on the word, yet being well ſifted, they
proue meere falacies &amp; haue no agreement

that though they cry and call vpon

that their hearts are hardned they cannot

he heareth not the prayers of impenitent

and therefore cannot be heard, for faith is
grounded vpon Gods word, which they
deſpiſe, contemne, and mocke. A like hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

in Gods ſight: the ſacrifice of the wicked
are abomination to the Lord: the prayers
that they make, though neuer ſo earneſtly
in their moſt neede, though it be in the
houre of death, the Lord will not heare
them, but reiect and abhorre them. And is
it not great reaſon and equitie, he doth but
ſerue them as they ſerue him; they wil not

heare him, when he calleth and cryeth to

why ſhould he heare them, when they call

ſo they which heare with a good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

bring forth fruite with patience. An vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

heare him to any purpoſe; who doth kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

being profane, whereas they might
haue had ſome meaſure of holines: the

and haue no care to encreaſe them:
they drawe vpon themſelues, diuers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
from God, as we hard before.
Nay theſe vnfruitfull hearers they offend
the Church, they do no little wrong to it,
becauſe they are vnprofitable members,
and can doe no good to others: whereas
we are borne not for our ſelues, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

SERMON.</head>
            <p>FRom this worthy ſentence of a moſt
worthy and gratious woman, we haue
alreadie, deliuered and handled, this
worthy doctrine, namely, that the chiefe
felicitie of this life, conſiſteth in hearing
and obeying true wiſedome: this we haue
largely confirmed and proued, and haue
made ſome vſe of it: gathering from hence
as a neceſſarie conſequence, the miſerable
&amp; wretched eſtate of ſuch as are deſtitute
of this wiſdome, of ſuch as ſeeke to hinder
and ſtoppe it, of ſuch as refuſe to heare it, of
ſuch as are contemners and mockers, and
of ſuch alſo, as are idle and vnprofitable
hearers: and yet ſtill we are to make ſome
further vſe of this doctrine, it ſerueth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
to reproue &amp; confute the vanity and
follie of ſuch as repoſe their chiefe felicitie,
either in carnal wiſdome, or in the glory of
the world, or in riches, or in pleaſures: Of
al theſe we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomething already,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3274:86"/>
yet let vs ſay ſomething more of the two
latter, namely riches and pleaſures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
moſt men doe repoſe true happines
in them: this is taken as a principle, that
thoſe are the happieſt men in the world,
which abound in wordly wealth, &amp; ſpend
their whole life, in mirth and Iollitie, in
earthly delights, and carnall Ioyes, but the
vanitie of theſe men ſhall eaſily appeare, if
true wiſedome may be iudge; Trauell not
too much to be rich, ſaith the wiſe man,
but ceaſe from thy wiſedome:<note place="margin">Pro: 23. 3.</note> Wilt thou
caſt thine eyes vpon that which is nothing?
for riches taketh her to her wings, as an
Eagle, and flyeth into the heauen. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that riches are of ſmall reckoning
and account, and that they are vncertaine,
flitting and fading, therefore there can be
no true happines in them. In an other
place, he doth handle this more largely, He
that loueth ſiluer ſaith he, ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
with ſiluer; and he that loueth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
ſhall be without the fruit thereof. His
meaning is, that ſuch as repoſe their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
in riches, are not happy but miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
becauſe they are like vnto ſuch as are
alwaies thirſtie and hungrie, and neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
he ſetteth downe many other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of ſuch men, that they haue not ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3274:86"/>
much as the fruit of their riches, becauſe
they dare not vſe, that which they haue,
they are torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with the deſire of more:
In the middeſt of all their wealth, they
want as well that which they haue, as that
which they haue not; and the more they
haue, the more they are to maintaine; as
ſeruants, friends, and many paraſites and
flatterers: and this miſerie alſo is incident
to ſuch, that they do ſo much thinke of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
and keeping their riches, that they
cannot haue ſo ſweete reſt and ſleepe as
many a poore man hath, their thoughts are
troubled, thinking ſometimes how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
others, and how others may deceiue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they are in continuall feare of theeues,
robbers, of fire and water, and of other
danger and loſſes; they are troubled in
their minds, thinking how badly they haue
gotten their riches, and how badly they
hold and vſe them: their riches turne to
their owne hurt and deſtruction, being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to them, of pride, couetouſnes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie,
and licentiouſnes, and ſometimes
very ruine of body &amp; ſoule. Theſe riches
are ſpent &amp; conſumed, by many waies, by
dilicate &amp; daintie fare, by coſtly apparell,
by ſmptuous buildings, by gaming, by
whoredome, by buying, by ſelling, by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3274:87"/>
how many waies are riches ſpent and
conſumed, by fire, by water, by warres, by
theeues, by vnskilfull and vnfaithfull Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
by prodigall wiues, and prodigall
children, by neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; vntruſtie ſeruants;
and thus riches periſh by euill trauell. This
is alſo an other miſerie, that they leaue the
owner, he can take nothing with him; he
knoweth not how ſoone he muſt leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
he hath heapt vp riches, and cannot tell
who ſhall gather them: it may be, neither

Of this ſpeaketh Salomon,<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 23.</note> when he ſaith:
It is a paſtime for a Foole to doe wickedly.

but of the vanitie of theſe men, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

And let Salomon deſide and determine this

might haue reiected his iudgement, as one
that neuer taſted the excellencie of riches
and pleaſures: but it is ſpoken by Salomon,
a famous and worthy king, who excelled
and abounded in all wiſedome, glory,
wealth, and pleaſures: hauing taſted of all,
he proteſteth and crieth out, that all is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

If thoſe ſayeth he,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ſup. Mat. Ho. 30.</note> which are occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied

this verſe vpon all their walles, vpon their

ſpecially if they would write it in their
conſciences, that they might alwayes haue
it before their eyes, and feele it in their
heart, that all is vanitie. And thus wee ſee
ſundrie enemies oppoſites to wiſedome,
we ſee the miſerable eſtate of ſuch as want
her, of ſuch as deſpiſe her, and repoſe their
happines in other things: And howſoeuer
many be againſt her, and ſhe hath but few

no more, becauſe heeretofore in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending

teſtimonies of holie Scripture; from
whence we may drawe ſufficient reaſons
and motiues, to ſtirre vs vp to carefull hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Now I adde another vſe, that ſeeing
our felicity lyeth in wiſedome, we muſt not
only carefully heare it, but alſo loue it moſt
deerely, and eſteeme it, aboue all things elſe
whatſoeuer. Some there be diligent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
but yet they doe not ſo highly eſteeme
of this wiſedome as they ſhould, neither
doe they ſhew the fruits of that loue which
this deſerueth: they thinke it good, but
not the chiefeſt good: but we are to loue
and eſteeme this wiſedome, not as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or common thing, but as it is indeed,
the beſt and the chiefeſt of all things: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it aboue all riches, pleaſures, or any
thing elſe in the world, be they neuer ſo
pleaſant, profitable, or excellent: eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
this as moſt good, moſt neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that we had better want all the beſt things
in the world, then this; and who indeed
will not thus eſteeme of this felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being
the greateſt felicity of this life, and that
which will leade vs to eternall happines?
Such an account and eſtimation had the

to God is, our true loue to his word: now

Such a deſire as worldlings haue to their

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3274:93"/>
deſire I ſay haue the Saints of God to this

hitherto, ſuffreth violence, &amp; the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
take it by force; his meaning is, that the
hearts of men were then inflamed with an
earneſt zeale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and greedie deſire to heare
the word: they did not coldly &amp; for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but with an earneſt &amp; violent affection,
follow &amp; ſeeke after this wiſdome: not the
idle &amp; careleſſe ſort, but ſuch as be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
violent, take &amp; receiue the kingdome
of heauen: he that taketh any thing by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
he doth vehemently deſire it, &amp; will
not want it, &amp; vſeth all power &amp; indeuour
to obtaine it; neither doth he feare to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelfe &amp; all that he hath to danger,
ſo that he may enioy it: the matter then
being ſo waightie, it muſt not be lightly
deſired &amp; ſought for, but with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
&amp; zeale. And therefore the Apoſtle
exhorteth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 2.</note> that as new borne babes, we
ſhould deſire the ſincere milk of the word,
that we may growe thereby. Infants they
deſire milke, &amp; that egerly, they cry &amp; yell
for it, nothing will ſtay them till they haue
it: &amp; their deſire is daily &amp; continuall. Such
deſires &amp; affections we muſt beare to true
wiſedome: &amp; as good foode is ſweet to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3274:93"/>
hungry, when it is eaten, ſo is wiſedome to
the ſoule if it be inwardly receiued and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted:
there wil follow exceeding delight
and ioy, but becauſe moſt hearers profeſſe
their loue to the word, &amp; ſhew their loue
by deſiring it, &amp; delighting in it, as it may
ſeeme to the eyes of the world, let vs ſee
ſome further ſignes to approue our true
loue to wiſedome, &amp; the account that we
make of it: firſt then, they that truly loue &amp;
truly eſteeme this wiſedome, they muſt
needes loue the publike aſſemblies, and
ſpecially the publike miniſtrie and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of wiſedome: ſome thinke it enough
to pray and read at home, but Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
muſt bee acknowledged, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
duties muſt giue place to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like:
this is the gate of heauen, the houſe
of God, the court of the Saints: here
ſhineth moſt clearely the louing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and face of God in his temple.
Doth euery man ſpeake of his glory? O
Lord ſaith Dauid,<note place="margin">Pſ: 26. 8.</note> I haue loued the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thine houſe, and the place where
thine honour dwelleth. And againe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced
when they ſaid vnto me, we will
goe into the houſe of the Lord: he loued &amp;
ioyed in ſuch meetings, becauſe of Gods
preſence, becauſe of the ſacrifices and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3274:94"/>
they are miniſtred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; for that he

&amp; ioynt prayers, &amp; the word of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
there read &amp; expounded: and as this
was Dauids ioy &amp; practiſe being a worthy
Prophet and King, ſo it is ſaid in an other
place,<note place="margin">Ezeck: 46. 10.</note> that the Prince ſhall be in the midſt
of the aſſemblies, he ſhall goe in with the
people, &amp; when they goe forth, they ſhall
goe forth together. And as Salomon built
an houſe for God, &amp; confec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Prieſts &amp; people, to offer publike ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

aſſemblies: &amp; ſuch as contemne theſe, they
doe not reade nor vnderſtand aright: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſo many precepts &amp; preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt

to come to publike meetings, to prayer,
&amp; to the reading of the ſcriptures, but they
thinke this ſufficient, &amp; that they need no
more at all: as for preaching, they care lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
for it; nay many do ſcorne and hate it:
theſe doe not rightly eſteeme or loue the
word; if they loued it read, they wold loue
it preached: &amp; the rather, ſeeing it is more

time, place, perſons: affections are more
moued, many are called &amp; conuerted, ſuch
as are called, are further confirmed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
by the power of preaching; for it
is ordained of God, not onely for conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſoules, but for confirmation, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and continuance in grace, and
therefore moſt needfull for all perſons,<note place="margin">1. Cor: 14.</note> be
they neuer ſo wiſe, ſtrong or holie: theſe be
the ſpeciall prerogatiues &amp; priuiledges of
preaching. And therefore the Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
&amp; eſteemeth of it, as the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
and profitable gift in the Church:
the cauſe why men doe contemne &amp; hate
preaching is, becauſe they are in loue with
their ſinnes, which are diſcouered by it.
Therefore Aha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hated Michaiah the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
as he confeſſeth,<note place="margin">1. King. 22. 8.</note> becauſe he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
not good vnto him, but euill. Light is
come into the world, &amp; men loue darknes
more then light, becauſe their deeds are
euill: for euery man that euill doth, hateth
the light: neither commeth to light, leaſt
his deeds ſhould be reproued: but he that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3274:95"/>
doth truth commeth to the light,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 19. 21.</note> that his
deeds might be made manifeſt: that they
are wrought according to God. Againe,
they hate this light of preaching, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
it, becauſe it is an enemie to their
carnalliberties ſincere &amp; ſound preaching
reproueth many delights, vanities, &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
which fleſh and blood would
faine retaine &amp; nouriſh: and therefore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men ſay, Let vs breake this bond, and
caſt this cord from vs: Let vs ſhake off
this yoake of Chriſt: but the godly do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the more loue it, becauſe it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
their ſins, &amp; is an effectuall meanes
to bring them to true repentance &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:
they loue the word read, &amp; they
loue it preached: reading is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
&amp; contemned, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended both
in the law &amp; the Goſpell: thereby we are
the better acquainted with the ſcriptures,
we are made thereby more profitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
reading helpeth our iudgements, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
&amp; memories; preaching helpeth
reading, and reading helpeth preaching:
they that beſt loue preaching, and ſeeke
moſt for Sermons, if they doe it with right
affections, they read moſt, and with more
comfort and profit: All the parts of Gods
ſeruice are to be practiſed by a Chriſtian,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3274:95"/>
no part of his ſeruice is to be neglected or
contemned: this is an other ſure ſigne of
our true loue to wiſedome, often in ſecret
to meditate of it, to conferre of it with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to reade the word, or to cauſe it to
be read vnto vs: by theſe priuate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Dauid proueth his loue to the word,<note place="margin">Pſ: 119. 97.</note> as
we haue hard before: loue will drawe our
affection to ſpeake and thinke often of
that which we loue: this is a more ſure
ſigne then the other, it may be ſome are
drawne to publike meetings by feare, by
examples, by lawe, by cuſtome, but when
we are alone in priuate, or fewe with vs,
then to ſpeake of the word, then often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to thinke and muſe of it, euen in our
priuie chamber, this is a ſure ſigne of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
loue. Againe, if we doe ſincerely loue,
and worthily praiſe this wiſedome, our
care and endeuour will be, to mainetaine
the dignitie and credit of wiſedome, by
our godly life and conuerſation: we muſt
be not onely profeſſors, but practitioners;
and how can they be ſaid to be the ſonnes
and daughters of wiſedome, which do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the examples and cuſtomes of follie?
theſe do ſtaine &amp; pollute their profeſſion,
&amp; are but like fooliſh builders, &amp; fooliſh
Virgines, not adorning the doctrine of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3274:96"/>
wiſedome, but diſhonouring it; Let your
conuerſation be ſuch ſaith the Apoſtle, as
it becommeth the Goſpell of Chriſt, that
which we loue, we ſeeke to credit, to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
and to honor it by all meanes we can:
we will not ſuffer it to be diſgraced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
by our default. The very heathen will
not ſuffer their falſe Gods to be diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or defaced, by any: and ſhall we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

               </gap> loue to this wiſedome, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
then to loue it, and moſt highly to
eſteeme of it, when it is generally diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
contemned and perſecuted of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3274:97"/>

when the profeſſion of it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and approued by the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
wiſedome then hath many friends,
but the tryall of true loue and friendſhip is
then, when moſt men doe appoſe and ſet
themſelues againſt the profeſſion of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
euen then to eſteeme it our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
euen then to loue it dearely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it: this I ſay is a true ſigne of loue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
Such a loue had Dauid, when many
were enemies and perſecutors of the truth,
Princes ſayth he, did ſit and ſpeake againſt
me, but thy ſeruant did meditate in thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
alſo thy teſtimonies are my delight
and my counſellers; the proud haue had
me exceedingly in deriſion, yet haue I not
declined from thy law. Againe, the bands
of the wicked haue robbed me, but I haue
not forgotten the law: the proud haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined
a lye againſt me, but I will keepe
thy precepts with my whole heart. The
profeſſion of wiſedome is not alwayes
peaceable, but oftentimes bringeth with
it hatred and contempt: our fleſh is ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to it, and Sathan doth trouble vs by
ſeducers and perſecutors: but wee muſt
ſtand firmely for the maintenance of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3274:97"/>
truth, and defend this our felicitie, though
it be to the loſſe of life and liuing: men do
ſtriue &amp; contend for maintenance of their
riches, their freeholds, and liues, and ſhall
not we ſtand for defence of that, which is
better &amp; more worth then all theſe things?
If any man come to me ſayth Chriſt, and
hate not his father and mother, and wife
and children, and brethren and ſiſters, yea,
and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
His meaning is, that we muſt caſt off
all affections to our deareſt friends, which
draw vs from Chriſt. And in the ſame place
he doth teach vs, that when we begin our
profeſſion, we muſt make full account to
hazard our credit, goods and life for it, or
elſe our beginning is raſh and vnaduiſed,
and men will ſcorne vs fooles, becauſe we
began and could not make an end. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
commendeth the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">1. Theſ 1. 6.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they became followers of him and
of the Lord, and receiued the word in
much affliction, with ioy of the holy Ghoſt.
And in another place he ſayeth,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29</note> that it was
giuen to the Philippians for Chriſts cauſe,
not onely to beleeue in him, but to ſuffer
for his ſake.<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 32, 33, 34.</note> And the Hebrewes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
becauſe after they had receiued

partly while they were made a

and partly while they became

The laſt vſe that I make of the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is a comfort to the true ſonnes and
daughters of wiſedome. Their ſtate is moſt
happie and bleſſed, and they are in the
right way to eternall happines, they haue
many diſcomforts and diſcouragements in
the world, and are accounted of all other
moſt wretched and vnhappie. But what
need they care for the blind, raſh, and falſe
iudgement of men, ſeeing for this cauſe
the world knoweth vs not, becauſe it kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
not God: and the voice of wiſdome,
the voice of God and good men, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
vs happie: and our owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth teſtifie to vs, that we walke in
the right path to euerlaſting bleſſednes.
Indeed the wicked they ſay, It is in vaine
to ſerue God: and what profit is it that we
haue kept his commandements,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 13. 14, 15, 16. &amp;c.</note> and that

euen they that worke wickednes are ſet

the Lorde hearkened, and heard it, and a
Booke of remembrance was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

your outward Priuiledges, Freedomes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
order of gouernment, wherein, it
may be, you excell ſome others. But I will
ſpeak of your chiefeſt Priuiledge, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and Ornament of your Citie, and the
beſt flower of your Garden: and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the plentifull and ſincere preaching
of the Goſpell: In reſpect whereof, ſome
doe truly thinke, and ſay (with this woman)
Happy are you, which may daily heare ſuch
wiſedome; And they may truely ſay in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſo many heauenly viſions, This is
the houſe of God, this is the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
and though many other places, are in
ſome ſort, partakers of this happines, yet
but fewe are equall with you in this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, conſider how long a time you
haue had a certaine, ſetled, and reſident
miniſtrie, for the ſpace of no leſſe then fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares; many in the meane time haue
beene deſtitute, as poore ſheepe without a
ſhepheard. Some haue had this meanes of
ſaluation very ſeeldome: and ſometimes
interrupted, and eclipſed.</p>
            <p>O happy are you, that haue had ſo great
a bleſſing, ſo many yeares continued; and
the greater bleſſing it is, not onely that you
haue had this word of Wiſedome preached
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3274:99"/>
amongſt you, but alſo ſoundly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by faithfull Paſtors and teachers: diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the word of Truth aright. Others it
may be, haue had the Word preached: but
corruptly, and erroniouſly, mixing Chaffe
and Wheate together: and flattering the
people in their ſinnes. This is alſo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bleſſing, that you haue the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
not onely ſo long, and ſo ſincerely,
but alſo in ſuch variety of gifts &amp; teachers,
of ſtrangers, of yout owne Countrey-men:
of young and olde: variety of teachers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
your ſelues, this is a ſpeciall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Thus you haue experience of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
graces and gifts of God, in diuers men:
and heerein God is good vnto you, if one
can doe you no good, another may.</p>
            <p>A worthy Father holdeth it profitable,
that of the ſame queſtions, many Bookes
ſhould bee made by ſundry men, in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
ſtile, though not in a differing faith,
all ſtomaches (wee ſee) are not alike. One
kinde of dreſſing pleaſeth one, which hath
no reliſh with an other: and yet the ſame
meate, ordered after another faſhion, may
fitte his appetite. As differences of meates,
ſo of humors and diſpoſitions of men: the
ſame matter diuerſly handled, may find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
with diuers men, which yet
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3274:100"/>
diſgeſted after one only faſhion, would
haue acceptance with feare; All fiſhes are
not taken with the ſame baite, all birds are
not caught by the ſame kind of voyce and
ſinging: I ſpeake not this to pleaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vaine
and curious humors, who without iuſt
cauſe diſtaſte and diſlike their faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
Loue your Paſtors, reuerence the
gifts of God in any, be they more or leſſe:
yet know that it is a bleſſing which many
want, to be in ſuch ſort as you are partakers
of the labours of ſundrie teachers. And
herein alſo your bleſſing is the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
you haue ſuch preaching, ſo often
and ſo plentifully, both vpon the Saboth
day, and at other times: howſoeuer ſome
may thinke this too much, and ſome mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
at it, and ſome loathe it, ſo that much
preaching is loathſome &amp; odious to ſome,
yet is this a rare bleſſing, which God hath
not imparted to many. In other things we
count plentie a bleſſing, and we neuer care
how much we haue, the more the better:
we neuer thinke we haue too much or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
God himſelfe doth promiſe it as a

things plentifully. Is it not a farre greater
bleſſing, to haue in ſuch abundance the

the people muſt take it as a bleſſing, to

whereas we are dullards and ſlobacks in

And though this goade and naile be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

they take paines to come, to take

theſe, without grace or vnderſtanding. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſay, happie are you, but they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feele nor ſee any ſuch happines. It may
be ſome of Salomons Courtiers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
thought it no great happines to haue
ſuch a maiſter, ſuch a diuine teacher, to be
partakers of ſuch heauenly wiſedome: but
yet this woman, a ſtranger, a Gentill, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
them happie; and happie were
they indeed, if they knew their owne hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.
And I doubt not, but many of you
doe acknowledge with ioy this to be the
chiefe happineſſe of your citie, to haue ſo
long time, ſo ſincerely, in ſuch varietie of
gifts, ſo plentifullie the true wiſedome of
Chriſt preached and publiſhed amongſt
you. Indeed the Lord hath not dealt ſo
with euery nation, with euery towne or
citie: Nay, the Lord hath ſtricken many
countreys and townes with palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but there is light, cleare light, the day
light, yea the cleare light of the ſunne, in
this worthie place where you dw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

places haue long endured, the moſt bitter
famine of the ſoule, they haue bin depriued

of life: but here hath bin many yeares plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
and others come hither to get food and
ſuſtenance for their ſoules. We therefore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3274:102"/>
brethren, as helpers, exhort you, that you
receiue not this grace of God in vaine, but
receiue with meekenes the word that is
grafted in you, which is able to ſaue your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oules. And here by your patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, let me ſtir
you vp to more care and diligence in reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Sermons on the weeke day. There
is great negligence and ſlacknes in ſome,
not onely of the common &amp; prophane ſort,
but alſo of ſome profeſſors of the Goſpel:
a fault I ſay, in neglecting ſo many Sermons
which they might heare, if ſlothfulneſſe,
worldlineſſe, or ſome idle conceit did not
hinder them. If wee did ſincerely loue this
wiſedome, and eſteeme it, as our chiefe
felicitie, wee would neglect no time nor
meanes, which is offered to vs: hee that
truely loueth the word, doth loue it at
all times. A Sermon in the weeke day
tryeth our true loue to the word. On the
Saboth day, men are compelled to come
by force of lawe: all ſorts of men come
then, Publicans and Phariſes, Atheiſts, and
time-ſeruers: but to come on the weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
when law doth not bind vs, when we
haue other occaſions to hold vs back, it is a
more ſure ſigne of our ſincere loue &amp; zeale
to the word. And though the Saboth day
be chiefly ordeined for diuine ſeruice and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3274:103"/>
Sermons, &amp; that day we are wholie to giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
ourſelues to ſuch exerciſes without diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and though the Lord giue vs liberty
to worke the ſixe daies, yet we owe him all
the dayes of our life: and euery day we are
to prefer heauenly things before earthly:
and the ſoule before the body, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is offered, whenſoeuer the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
though it bee to the loſie of the beſt
things we haue: Euery one is to anſwere
with Abraham, Heere I am: and with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell,
(after hee knew it to be the Lordes
voyce) ſpeak Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth.
And with the Apoſties, to be ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
all, when CHRIST calleth.</p>
            <p>Euery day we are to preferre Heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
earth: things moſt neceſſarie, before
things leſſe neceſſary: things publike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things priuate. This care and pollicie
we haue in the matters of the world. Euery
day wee muſt remember and practiſe theſe
holy ſcriptures; Thou ſhalt loue the Lord
thy GOD, with all thy minde, with all thy
ſoule: That wiſedome is the beginning,
that wee muſt firſt ſeeke Gods kingdome,
and labour for the meate that neuer peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth;
and that there is one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Oh that wee would often thinke with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3274:103"/>
our ſelues, how much we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to God,
how many duties he requireth of vs, how
many graces we want, how weake we are in
faith and knowledge; Oh that wee would
ſeriouſly remember the vanity of riches and
pleaſures, the ſhortnes of this life, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Worde, the great neceſſity and
vſe of it, in all the occaſions of our life: And
that we would conſider how dull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
we are, what meaſure of knowledge,
zeale, loue, and ſanctification is required of
vs: what account wee are to make, for not
hearing, for loſſe of many Sermons, which
we might haue heard, and what a bleſſing
the plentifull preaching of the word is, then
would wee thinke no time too much, nor
too long, that is ſpent about it: but would
ſay with this woman; Happy are they that
may alwayes heare ſuch wiſedome. And if
it be a happy thing to heare, then are they
vnhappy which heare not. Thoſe that keep
themſelues from hearing, they hinder their
owne happines.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, they goe to a Sermon, when
they haue nothing to doe: As who ſhould
ſay, they would not goe, if they had anie
thing to doe at all: but theſe doe not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteeme of wiſdome, preferring it before
all things; Nay, as it ſeemeth, they preferre
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3274:104"/>
all things before it. There is a promiſe of
bleſſednes made to ſuch as come, though
they be neuer ſo ſmall a number: But there
is no ſuch promiſe made to them, which
vppon light occaſions, abſent themſelues
from holy meetings. Nay, our Sauiour
Chriſt threatneth ſuch,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.</note> that they ſhall neuer
taſte of his heauenly Supper.</p>
            <p>There is nothing loſt, by ſeruing of God
at any time, to ſuch onely, he promiſeth all
bleſſings; godlines is great gaine, and hath
a promiſe of this life, and the life to come.
We muſt not leaue any dutie vndone which
God commands, for feare of loſſe.</p>
            <p>When the man of God, forbad Amaſiah
the king, to take the Armie of Iſraell with

This gracious woman, ſpent much, &amp; was

Chriſt freely offreth to them tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

came to Salomon a man, being onely a tipe
of Chriſt: but the Sonne of God, the true
Meſſias, the wiſedome of the father, came
of his owne accord to them; yea, he came
amongſt his owne, but his owne receiued
him not. She came to learne, to be reſolued
and ſatisfied of her doubts: Chriſt offreth
them diuine wiſedome, ſuch as is able to
ſatisfie and reſolue any that are willing to
learne, in all the matters of their ſaluation;
but they being carried away, by a conceit

this Queen, aboue all things preferreth this
heauenly wiſedome, as the chiefe treaſure

to Salomon, with a good minde to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued:
they indeed aske many queſtions,
&amp; propound many doubts to our Sauiour,
but with moſt wicked malicious mindes,
to catch, entangle, and intrappe him in his

ſo many as they can from honouring of
Chriſt. She accounteth it true happines to
heare Salomons wiſedome: they feele and
finde no ſuch thing, though they heare the
wiſedome of Chriſt. She a ſtranger admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

they moſt creul, &amp; vnthankfull, againſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

ſaith our Sauiour to theſe, That the

them, and ſhall be giuen to a nation which
ſhall bring forth the fruits thereof. Finally,
this woman obſerued all things that Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpake, or did, and wondreth: but they
are ſo blinde, that neither the power of his
doctrine, nor the greatnes of his miracles,
could moue them to admiration. She was

            <p>MAny worthy and excellent things
we haue heard alreadie, of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
woman, her great care, deſire,
and loue, to knowe the truth, in comming
ſo great a iourney to her great paines and
charge, her reuerencing and magnifying of
Salomon, and accounting, the hearing and
obeying true wiſedome, as the greateſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
in this life. We haue heard her exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
commended by our Sauiour Chriſt,
and alledged by him, to the ſhame and
condemnation of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and all the obſtinate and vnbeleeuing
Iewes, who did not receiue, but reiect
him, that was far greater then Salomon.
Now let vs adde the other example of the
Niniuites, applied alſo by our Sauiour to
the ſame purpoſe, againſt the Iewes, and ſo
let vs make ſome vſe of them both to our
ſelues. The men of Niniuie ſaith Chriſt,
ſhall riſe in iudgement with this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3274:109"/>
and ſhall conemne it, for they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the preaching of Ionas,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 32.</note> and behold,
a greater then Ionas is here.</p>
            <p>Heere is a like compariſon as before,
to the ſame vſe and ende; the Niniuites
being Gentiles, ſtrangers from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth
of Iſrael: yet at the preaching of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,
ſuffer themſelues to be reproued &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
theſe were Iſraelites, the ſeede of
Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom pertained the Adoption,
the couenant, the promiſes, the law, the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God, &amp; yet they wil not harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the
voyce of the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, the ſauiour of the
world. They had but one Preacher of the
word, the prophet Ionas: theſe had manie
prophets, yea Iohn the Baptiſt, &amp; Chriſt him
ſelfe, &amp; yet they did not belieue them. The
Niniuites in one day, at one Sermon, were
touched &amp; conuerted; To them the word
had bin preached a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time, many yeres, &amp;
yet they were not the better. They repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
at the preaching of Ionas, being confirmed
by no ſigne nor miracle: they ſaw daily new
ſignes and wonders wrought among them,
ſuch as neuer any did before, &amp; yet they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
both his Doctrine and miracles.
Theywere moued at the preaching of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
a ſtranger, being a Iewe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Iewes, a nation odious to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but theſe loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3274:109"/>
CHRIST, being their owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman,
borne among them. The Niniuites
endured Ionas his ſermon, threatning moſt
fearfull and general deſtruction vpon them;
but they hated Chriſt, and could not abide
him, but thought him worthie of death,
though he preached, &amp; offered to them, the
treaſures &amp; grace of mercie. Finally, they
belieued Ionas, a mortall and ſinfull man:
theſe would not belieue Chriſt, being not
onely man, but God, whom they could not
reproue of any ſinne, hauing ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
from the Law, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prophets, from
God the Father, from Iohn the Baptiſt, and
from his owne glorious works.</p>
            <p>And very notably doth one knit vp this
compariſon together in theſe words. The
Niniuites ſaith he, a nation ſtrange fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
Ionas, a wan vnknowne, &amp; of a baſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
came to them: No man commended
him vnto them before hee came, none fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
his comming, he wrought no miracles
at all, hee got no mans fauour by any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites,
hee promiſed no great matter, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
threatneth deſtruction, and he preached
no longer then three dayes: but CHRIST
was promiſed long before, by the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Prophets, often commended
by the teſtimonie of Iohn, and his Father,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3274:110"/>
proceeding from the ſame progenitors, of
whom they gloried: he had taught them a
good while, and wrought many miracles
among them, he beſtowed many benefites
vpon many, both vpon their ſoules and
bodies, he did not thunder or threaten
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie iudgements, but freely promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes, and freely offereth the
inheritance of eternall life: and yet they
ſay, he hath a diuell, and they purſue and
hate him to death: ſo farre are they from
being drawne to repentance by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
doctrine. Therefore moſt iuſtly doth
our Sauiour, both alledge the example of
this woman, and the example of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites,
to their ſhame and condemnation.
This may ſeeme very hard and heauie to
ſome, but it is moſt true, and confirmed by
common ſenſe and reaſon, that thoſe ſhall
be moſt ſeuerely puniſhed, which are not
moued, by ſuch meanes, as haue moued
many other; thoſe I ſay are in moſt heauie
caſe, which haue moe and greater meanes
of repentance, and yet haue not repented;
this will lye heauie vpon all contemners of
the word, vpon all falſe Chriſtians, vpon all
vnprofitable and vnthankefull hearers,
though they come of Chriſtian parents,
though they profeſſe, heare, and be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3274:110"/>
of the Sacraments: yet this will not
ſerue the turne, if they be inferiour to them
in grace and goodnes, and ſo condemned
by their example, that had either no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of religion, or leſſe meanes then
they: ſuch men ſometimes, to their ſhame,
the Lord ſendeth them, not onely to the
heathen, but alſo to the very bruite beaſts,
to learne of them;<note place="margin">Eſa. 1. 3. 2.</note> Heare ô heauens, and
hearken ô earth, for the Lord hath ſayd;
I haue nouriſhed and brought vp chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but they haue rebelled againſt me.
The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe
his maſters cribbe: but Iſrael hath not
knowne my people, hath not vnderſtood.
His meaning is, that the very bruite and
and dull beaſts, are more kind, and more
dutifull, to their Maiſters and feeders, then
many people are, to God their Creator,
preſeruer, and redeemer. And in an other
place,<note place="margin">Ier. 8. 7. 6.</note> he complaineth, ſaying; I hearkned
&amp; heard, but none ſpake right, no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
him of his wickednes, ſaying; What
haue I done? euery one turneth to the raſe,
as the horſe ruſheth into the battel: euen
the ſtorke in the aire knoweth her appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
times, and the Crane, the Turtle, and
the Swallow, obſerue the time of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
but my people knoweth not the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3274:111"/>
iudgement of the Lord. The meaning is,
that theſe birds doe better knowe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
the ſeaſons of Summer, Winter, cold,
and heate, then his people did the times of
mercy and iudgements. The greater means,
the longer time, and the more plentifull
we haue it; the heauier ſhalbe our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
if we profit not by it. And therefore
our Sauiour Chriſt, did moſt of all vpbraide
and threaten thoſe cities where he preached
moſt, and wrought moſt miracles, becauſe
they repented not. Woe be to thee Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin,
ſayth he, woe be to thee Bethſaida,
for if the great workes which were done in
you, had beene done in Tyrus and Sydon,
they had repented long agoe in ſack cloth
and aſhes: but I ſay to you, it ſhall be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for Tyrus and Sydon at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then for you. And thou Capernaum,
which art lifted vp to heauen, ſhalt be
brought downe to hell; for if the great
workes which haue beene done in thee,
had beene done among them of Sodom,
they had remained to this day: but I ſay to
you, It ſhall be eaſier for them of the land
of Sodom in the day of iudgement then for
thee. In theſe places he did many of his
greateſt workes, and that a long time, yea
ſo many &amp; ſo great workes, as might haue
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3274:111"/>
moued the very Infidels to repentance, his
works doe comprehend his doctrine: for
the more confirmation of his doctrine,
theſe people they heard Chriſt teaching,
they receiued and entertained him, they
ſaw his miracles, they accepted his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
both corporall and ſpirituall, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and priuiledges were very great, which
he vouchſafed them, he did not deale ſo
with euery Nation, Citie, or Towne. It is
a great mercie to haue a Prophet, though
it be to our coſt &amp; paines, but Chriſt came
to them freely, vndeſired, vnſought for. It
is a mercie to haue the word without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but they had both his word and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
It is a fauour to ſee Chriſt, and to
heare him, though it were but once, but
they heard and ſaw him many times, and
yet they are vnthankefull and diſobedient.
But let vs more neerely conſider, what
Chriſt ſpeaketh of the citie of Capernaum,
it was a famous citie of Galilie, and had
ſome ſpeciall prerogatiue aboue the reſt:
for the Sonne of God, beginning his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and prieſthood, he did chooſe that
citie as his Pallace and Sanctuarie; there
he liued and dwelt amongſt them. This is
the chiefe glorie of Cities, to entertaine
Chriſt and his Goſpel. This doth as it were
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3274:112"/>
lift them vp to heauen, but if they repent
not, but ſtill continue their ſinnes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
the mercies of God, their iudgement
ſhall be the heauier. The grace of God is
tyed to no place nor perſon, he will ſpare
none if they abuſe his mercies: and this
maketh much to the ſhame and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Pope of Rome, who glorieth
that he is Chriſts Vicar, Peters ſucceſſor,
and that Rome is the Metropolitane and
Mother-Church of all the world. Though
this be moſt falſe, yet if it were true, he
muſt know, that the more promiſes and
priuiledges they haue, they muſt looke for
the greater iudgements. Idolatrie, pride,
vncleaneſſe, vnthankfulneſſe, increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and other like ſinnes, haue bin the ruine
and deſtruction of many famous Cities,
which haue had greater promiſes, &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
priuiledges then euer Rome had. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
and fearefull is the example of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
which was called the citie of God,
the holie citie, a figure of the ſpirituall and
heauenly Church, of the which the Pſalmiſt
ſpeaketh excellent things. God is knowne
in Iuda, his name is great in Iſrael, that
there are thrones for iudgement, euen the
thrones of the houſe of Dauid: Pray for
peace of Ieruſalem; let them proſper that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3274:112"/>
loue thee.<note place="margin">Eſa: 2. 3.</note> The Prophet Eſai ſaith; The law
ſhall goe forth of Syon: the word of the
Lord from Ieruſalem. What Citie had euer
greater priuiledges? and yet according to
Chriſt prophecying, it is long ſince come
to miſerable ruine and deſolation: the
Iewes that were once the people of God,
haue beene long ſince reiected: the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
branches are caſt off, and they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a lamentable ſpectacle to all the
world; for the contempt of Gods word,
and abuſing of his mercies. The like feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
examples we haue, in the ſeuen Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Aſia, of the which S. Iohn ſpeaketh
in his Reuelation, they were planted by
the Apoſtles themſelues, they profeſſed the
Goſpell of Chriſt, they had the word and
Sacraments, they had all the prerogatiues,
priuiledges, and markes of true Churches,
yet are they long ſince quite ouerthrowne,
for their vnthankfulnes and diſobedience
to the Goſpell. What then ſhall become
of Papiſts, Athiſts, Recuſants, deſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is moſt grieuous and miſerable, as their

S. Peeter ſaith, that they are alreadie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and therefore neuer likely to be
ſaued. What then ſhall be the fearefull
ſtate of thoſe, which ſhall be ſubiect to
greater deſtruction &amp; damnation? &amp; ſuch
are all careleſſe and vnprofitable hearers,
which profit not, nor yet are brought to
repentance, by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
theſe are in harder caſe, then the
Iewes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Infidells, or the Sodomities,
becauſe they haue greater meanes,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 4.</note> and a
more cleare light, then euer they had: he
that knoweth his maiſters will and doth it
not, ſhalbe beaten with many ſtripes. If I
had not come and ſpoken to them ſaith
Chriſt, they ſhould not haue had ſinne, but
now haue they no cloake for their ſin. His
meaning is, that their ſinne had beene the
leſſe, if he had not come; ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt, his death and paſſion, his
glorious Goſpell, offering grace and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all, doth not eaſe, leſſen, or excuſe

ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly &amp; ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully, as you haue heard. And
yet many are in darkenes vnder the light,
being very ignorant, not knowing the
principles of holy religion, not being able
to giue a reaſon of the true faith. Others,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3274:114"/>
though they haue knowledge, yet they
haue not truly repented, but liue ſtill in
their old ſinnes: other, and moſt of all,
though they profeſſe repentance, and that
they haue forſaken their old courſe of life,
yet they bring not forth fruites of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they ſeeme to hate euill, and yet
doe no good: at leaſt they leaue many
good things vndone, they faile much, to
the diſcredit of the Goſpell, in practiſe and
obedience; they make ſmall conſcience
of many duties of pietie, equitie, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
they make a ſhew of godlines, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the power thereof. So that we may
complaine, as the heathen man complained
of the careleſnes of many hearers in the
Philoſophers ſchooles,<note place="margin">Senec.</note> Some ſaith hee,
come to heare, but not to learne, as to a
ſtage play, for recreation ſake, to delight
their eares, they are carried away with the
ſpeech, with voyce, with fables: a great
part of ſuch hearers thou ſhalt ſee in the
Philoſophers ſchoole, they goe thither,
when they are Idle and haue nothing to
doe, they goe not to this purpoſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any law or rule of life, that ſo they
might amend their manners: with the ſame
mindes, and with the ſame purpoſes, many
reſort to heare ſermons. The Prophet
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3274:114"/>
complaines of ſuch hearers,<note place="margin">Ezeck. 33. 30. 31. 32. &amp;c.</note> or rather the
Lord by the Prophet, ſaying, Thou ſonne
of man, the children of thy people, that
talke of thee by the walles, and in the
doores of the houſes, and ſpeake one to
an other, euery one to his brother, ſaying,
Come I pray you, and heare what is the
word that commeth from the Lord, for
they come vnto thee, as the people vſe to
come, and my people ſit before thee, and
heare thy words, but they will not doe
them; for with their mouthes they make
ieſtes, and their heart goeth after coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes;
and loe thou art vnto them as a
Ieſting ſong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of one that hath a pleaſant
voyce, and can ſing well, for they heare
thy words, but they doe them not. And
when this commeth to paſſe, for loe, it will
come, then ſhall they know, that a Prophet
hath beene among them. We haue had
(bleſſed be God) a flouriſhing Church a
long time, the Goſpell ſoundly preached,
in many places of our land: many men in
the Church of great learning and gifts,
many zealous and forward profeſſors of
the truth, the fame of theſe things hath
comforted other Churches, hath cauſed
many ſtrangers to come amongſt vs, and
to liue with vs: Oh that I might truly ſay,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3274:115"/>
as this woman ſayd to king Salomon in
the two former verſes before this text: It
was a true word ſayth ſhee that I heard in
my owne land, of thy ſayings, and of thy
wiſedome, howbeit, I beleeued not this
report, til I came and had ſeene it with my
eyes: but loe, the one halfe was not told
mee, for thou haſt more wiſedome and
proſperitie, then I hane heard by report;
oh that the ſtrangers that are or haue bene
amongſt vs, might truely ſay, wee ſee and
perceiue by experience, more zeale, more
religion, more ſinceritie, more pietie and
goodnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we heard of before we came.
But may they not to our great ſhame, may
they not ſee much defection and declining
from the zeale of former times, much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,
Poperie, and prophaneneſſe, much
hypocriſie, and diſſimulation, great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the word and miniſters, much cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and blaſphemie, much oppreſſion in
Church and Common-wealth; and finally,
may they not ſee moſt places full of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
full of wantonneſſe, and moſt filthie
vncleaneneſſe; and therefore we may iuſtly
complaine, as other haue done long ſince,
in their times, and cuntries, let vs heare the
complaints,<note place="margin">Bulling. in Mat. 12.</note> &amp; lay them to our own hearts,
the Goſpell is preached amongſt vs, and a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3274:115"/>
bleſſed life is offred to vs by Chriſt, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is required of vs, but obedience, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and honeſtie of life: but we doe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
contemne this diuine and holie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
therfore the Niniuites and this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhal condemne vs. I ſpeake nothing of
perſecutors and oppreſſors of diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but I ſpeake of ſuch as profeſſe the
Goſpell amongſt vs: the common ſort doe
very badly ſpend the Saboth day, which
ſhould be conſecrated to diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
others had rather giue themſelues
to drinking, and playing, then to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or hearing; many Citizens &amp; Towneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
looke to their Shops and Trades,
or elſe they take iourneyes, or if they
bee at home, they are prophanely occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
or if they come to the Sermon,
their mindes are at home; they are like
Idols, that haue eares and heare not,
eyes and ſee not; they doe not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and marke, nor beleeue thoſe things
which are ſpoken of the contempt of this
world: againſt couetouſneſſe, oppreſſion,
and deceit; If they be ſomewhat neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
touched, they gruntle like Swine, they
barke like Dogges; ſuch as are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and haue knowledge, beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate

and ſimple ſtile of preaching agreeing to
the Scripture, to haue ſmall ſweetneſſe or
delight in it, they ſtand vpon eloquence
and mans wiſedome; it is grieuous to
them to heare a plaine ſimple Preacher,
though he ſpeake with power of the ſpirit.
Great perſons, men of ſtate and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

be vnto you Scribes, and Phariſes, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
which ſhut the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

will ſhew, that the Prieſts of the Iewes did
all things for couetouſnes, and who knew
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3274:116"/>
by the ſcriptures that Chriſt was come,
and they conſidered, becauſe Chriſt was
beleeued and receiued, that the cuſtome
of ſacraficing and offering would ceaſe,
and that the ſacrifice of righteouſnes
would preuaile: but they did ſhut the
doore of truth, when they decreed, that if
any ſhould ſay he was the ſonne of God, he
ſhould be ſhut out of the Synagogue: ſo
now hereticall miniſters, they doe ſhut the
doore of truth; for they know, if the truth
be made manifeſt, the Church would leaue
them, and they ſhould be caſt downe from
their places. What then is the ignorant
people to be excuſed? No, for if thou
wouldſt buy thee garments, thou ſeekeſt
to ſundry Chapmen, and where thou maiſt
haue the beſt garments, and the eaſieſt
price, thoſe thou takeſt: and therefore thou
muſt ſeeke and ſearch for teachers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
where truth is, and where is error:
It is not forbidden to know the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all men, and to chooſe that which is
beſt, according to the ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
Proue all things, and hold that which
is good. If for worldly buſines thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
goe to a place thou knoweſt not, thou
doſt not ceaſe from thy purpoſe, becauſe
thou knoweſt not the way, but thou doeſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3274:117"/>
trie this, and that way, thou doſt aske, ſeek,
and enquire, and ſo findeſt the right way:
If thou wilt enter into the truth of the
ſcriptures, ſometimes pray, ſometimes
ſearch the ſcriptures, ſometimes ſeeke by
good workes, ſometimes enquire of this
miniſter, ſometimes of that: that ſo thou
maiſt ſee, who they be that haue the keyes
of knowledge. If theſe things be not done,
it is becauſe the word of God is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
nor the promiſe of bleſſednes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
nor the laſt iudgement feared. Where
is this care of ſearching, and the truth to be
found? where is that diligence of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?
Men are readie to heare, receiue,
and beleeue any thing, like children,
they are carried away with any kinde of
doctrine, they are ſtill ignorant, and fall
into many errors, becauſe with this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
they will not diligently and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeeke for the truth where it may be
found. All others are carefull and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to learne, and ſeeke the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and skill (as much as they can) of
their trades and ſciences, onely Chriſtians
are idle, careles, and ignorant in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Harken I pray you (ſaith the ſame
father) is it not an abſurd thing, that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3274:117"/>
Phyſition, the Shoomaker, and Weauer,
and generally all workemen, ſtriue for the
profeſſion of their Arts: but a Chriſtian
cannot bring a reaſon of his religion:
thoſe Artes being neglected, are but the
loſſe of money, the contempt of religion
is the loſſe of the ſoule: and yet we are
ſo madde, that we imploy all our care and
thoughts that way, and we make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
of the neceſſarie defence of our
ſoule; for this cauſe, the heathen knowe
not their error, but take offence, and
mocke vs; for they being in error, doe
all things for the defence of their errors:
We (being profeſſors of the truth) can
ſay nothing for defence of it; and for this
cauſe, the very heathen doe condemne
our doctrine of weakenes, they ſuſpect
in vs ſome fraude, and fooliſhnes, and
ſo they ſpeake euill of Chriſt, as of a liar:
we are the cauſe of this blaſphemie. Saint

in vaine were the ſaying of Chriſt,
Be wiſe as ſerpents,<note place="margin">Chri: in Iohn.</note> and innocent as doues:
Let vs bluſh, and be aſhamed, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan
woman,<note place="margin">Hom. 3.</note> was ſo carefull in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that her worldly buſines could not
hinder her from the doctrine of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note>
We enquire nothing in the knowledge of
heauenly things, but are careleſſe and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
all things. Which of vs (I pray you)
when we come home, doth any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a Chriſtian? who doth ſearch? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate?
or remember the ſcriptures? The
ſcriptures are giuen, not onely that you
ſhould haue them in your bookes, but alſo
in your hearts: I doe not forbid to get you
bookes: nay I doe admoniſh you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you, that you get them; yet ſo, that
you doe oftentimes repeat, both the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and the ſenſe, in your minde: that by
it, that may be made pure. For if in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
houſe the Goſpell of Chriſt is, the

the diuel ore ſinne, touch that ſoule, which
is familiar with the diligent reading of it:

therefore ſanctifie thy ſoule, and ſanctifie
thy body, this ſhall come to paſſe, if thou
haue alwaies in thy minde, and tongue, the
Goſpell of Chriſt. Seeing therefore, there
is ſuch ignorance, impenitencie, prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
diſobedience and vnthankfulnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

diſputing doubtfully of vice and
vertue: but wee contemne the faithfull
preachers, deliuering vnto vs the certaine
and ſure word of God. The Romanes ſhall
condemne vs, who gaue ſuch honour to
the obſcure writings of Sybilla, that in all
doubts they reſted vpon them: we neglect
the ſcriptures, which are able to reſolue vs
in all doubts, and to comfort vs in the
greateſt extremities. The Papiſts ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
vs, who make more account of
their own traditions, then we do of Chriſts
Goſpell. They are more conſtant in errors,
then we in the truth: they goe further to a
maſſe, then we to a ſermon: they are more
liberall in mainetaining of Idolatrous
Prieſtes, then we aree to maintaine the
Lords faithfull miniſters. They take more
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3274:119"/>
care and paines, in drawing as many as
they can, to their idolatrous ſuperſtition:
then we are to drawe men to true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They liberally maintaine their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and fauourers; we ſuffer many true
profeſſors and Chriſtians to want.</p>
            <p>Our forefathers, who liued in blindnes,
ſhall condemne vs: who were full of good
deeds, abounding in hoſpitalitie, libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and almes deeds, dealing iuſtly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
and vprightly in their contractes,
and bargaines.</p>
            <p>Many amongſt vs vnder the Goſpell,
are couetous, miſerable, and vnmercifull,
full of deceit, and crueltie.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſerable worldlings ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme
vs: who doe ſo much followe the
world, and beſtowe ſo much care and
paines vpon it, neglecting no time, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of gaine: whereas we are ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
careleſſe, and negligent in heauenly
things. Theſe two examples of the Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites,
and this woman alledged by our
Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell, againſt the
vnthankefull and diſobedient Iewes, may
as truly and as iuſtly be applied againſt vs.
The Niniuites ſhall riſe in iudgement and
condemne this generation; They hearing
but one Ionas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one ſermon, threatning
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3274:119"/>
deſtruction, beleeued God, repented of
their ſinnes, and ſhewed the fruites of
their faith and repentance: but how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſermons haue we heard, and that by
ſundrie men, and a long time? ſermons
of mercy, alluring vs by the ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of God; and ſermons of iudgements,
threatning &amp; thundring euerlaſting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
and yet where is our repentance?
where are the fruites of our faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?
A fewe ſermons, or one ſermon,
was ſufficient to witnes againſt vs; how
much more ſuch a multitude of ſermons,
ſo long continued? By the mouth of two
or three witneſſes euery thing ſhall be
eſtabliſhed: And the Apoſtle accounteth
his ſermons and Epiſtles, as witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Corinthians: And if the very
ſhaking off the duſt of the feete of Gods
ſeruants, be a ſufficient witnes againſt
an vnthankfull people: how much more
ſhall they themſelues, their continuall
labours and ſermons, teſtifie againſt
them, to their vtter shame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
            <p>And if our Sauiour Chriſt pronounce ſo
hard a ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt Chorazin, Bethſaida
&amp; Capernaum, amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he preached
but a ſmall time: what ſhall become of vs,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3274:120"/>
that haue had the Goſpell preached ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ſo long a time. Our Sauiour prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
publikely in the world, but three
yeares onely: he taught in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he beſtowed but ſome of that time in
thoſe Cities. Now if one yeares preaching,
two or three yeeres preaching be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
to drawe vpon an impenitent people,
ſuch heauie iudgements and damnation:
what ſhall become of thoſe, which haue
had the Goſpell preached, ſome tenne
yeares, ſome 20. ſome 30. ſome 40. ſome
50. yeares? and yet haue beene, and are ſtill
moſt vnthankfull, and vnprofitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
The lawe of nature was ſufficient to
make vs inexcuſable, much more the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
lawe of God written, and moſt of all, if
to these two be ioyned the Goſpell of
Chriſt, theſe are three heauie witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs. But to come to the example we
haue in hand, and to make ſome ſpeciall
vſe of it to our owne ſoules; This woman
the Queene of the South, ſhall riſe in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp; condemne this generation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we liue. She trauelleth far, taketh vpon
her a great, long, teadious, dangerous,
painefull and coſtly iourney: but many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs, are ſecure, idle, and ſloathfull;
fewe or none will labour for it. Nay, they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3274:120"/>
will ſcarce haue it, receiue it, though they
may haue it with eaſe, without any coſt or
labour. If any haue care and conſcience to
ſeeke for wiſedome abroad, wanting it at
home: ſuch are derided, ſcoffed, hated, and
perſecuted, by the moſt ſort of men. This
woman reuerenceth her teacher, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
nothing too deare for him. Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
their faithfull teachers, little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their doctrine, ſeeking their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and offering them iniuries: and as for
maintenance, they thinke a litle, too much,
they grudge to giue that little, which the
lawe alloweth, in many places, and hardly
can any be drawne to voluntarie contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
and if they be, they are ſoone
wearie of it.<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> The Children of Iſrael doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
voluntarie gifts, for the building of the

and they were ſo free, and gaue ſo much,
that the Lord ſaid to Moſes, The people
bring too much, and more then enough
for the vſe of the worke which the Lord
hath commanded to be made.<note place="margin">Exod 36.</note> And in an

And Dauid the King, reioyced with great

and bleſſed God, for their franke offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Where are ſuch people? where are
ſuch hearts? ſo free and liberall to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Gods houſe? In an other place, The
children of Iſrael, they pulled their eare-rings
from their eares, to make a golden
Calfe: and Baalls Prophets are richly and
liberally maintained. Our forefathers haue
beene very bountifull, and prodigall, in
maintaining Idolatrous Prieſts: they gaue
indeed too much to the Church, euen the
very wealth and fatte of the world: but we
are come to an other extremitie, they gaue
too much, we giue little or nothing: nay
that which is worſt of all, we take away
that, which was giuen by others. Oh what
account ſhall theſe make, which ſpoyle &amp;
robbe the Church, Nay which robbe God
himſelfe? If Chriſt ſhall ſay to thoſe, which
haue not releeued and harboured his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
Depart yee curſed to euerlaſting
fire: ſhall not thoſe be partakers of that
heauie ſentence, to whom the iudge may
truly ſay, I had meate &amp; drinke of my own,
but you tooke it from me: I had houſe and
harbour, but you thruſt me out? Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they be that are not readie, &amp; willing,
to releeue, and maintaine, the faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
they thinke baſely of the word: they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3274:121"/>
doe not truly loue it, nor take it to be their
felicitie: for as loue is painefull to ſeeke for
wiſdome, ſo it is bountiful, to maintaine it.
Want of maintenance is the decay of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
&amp; religion, &amp; by this pollicie, Sathan
doth hinder &amp; keep backe many from this
calling, and diſcomfort many that are in it.
Therefore not onely this woman, but alſo
many other, as the Iewes and our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yea Iezabell in maintaining Baalls
Prieſts, ſhall condemne, the miſerablenes,
the couetouſnes, the hard dealing and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe
of this our age, againſt the true
miniſters of the Goſpell. Againe, this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
accounteth it the chiefe happineſſe in
earth, to heare true wiſedome; we preferre
euery profit before it, wee ſpeake and
thinke baſely of it, we haue neither true
deſire nor delight to be exerciſed in it;
either publikely or priuately; we eſteeme
too much of follie, we haue no true reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to hazard life or goods for this
wiſedome: nay we deface and diſcredit it
by our bad liues; and therefore we doe
not truely loue it, nor make it our ioy or
happines: and therefore this woman ſhall
riſe in iudgement againſt vs, and her
example doth make much to our ſhame
and condemnation. Finally, this woman
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3274:122"/>
was with Salomon but ſome ſhort time,
ſhe could not ſtay long, hauing a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
it may be, ſhe ſtayed ſome fewe
weekes, or monethes, and in ſo ſhort time,
ſhe is called, and conuerted, by the force
and power of Salomons wiſedome: we
haue had a long time, a greater wiſedome
then Salomons, and yet it hath had no ſuch
power for the good and conuerſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and let vs here ſet downe our reſt a
little. The word of the Lord is mightie
through God, to caſt downe holdes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
downe the imaginations, and euery
hie thing that is exalted againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and bringing into Captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
euery thought to the obedience of
Chriſt; It is able to conuert ſoules, and to
redreſſe the waies of young men, be they
neuer ſo leaude, wilde, or wanton: This
wiſedome is of that power (if it enter into
thy heart and delight thy ſoule) that it
will preſerue thee from the waies of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men and women. It is a preſeruatiue
againſt all ſinne. It is compared, to a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and to a fire, which are of great force:
by the hammer and fire, the ſmith buckles
and bends the hard yron to his vſe and
purpoſe; and is not the hammer of Gods
word, able to bruiſe, and buckle, &amp; breake
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3274:122"/>
our ſtonie and hard hearts? the fire hath
power to enflame, to conſume, to purge,
and ſhall not the fire of Gods word be as
powerfull, to kindle zeale in our hearts, to
conſume ſinne, and to purifie and clenſe
vs within? This word is compared, to a
ſhaft or an arrowe, which ſtriketh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
deepely: and is not the word able to
ſtrike our hearts, and to pearce them
through; It is compared to raine, which
ſinketh and ſoaketh into the earth, and
ſoftneth the hard ground; and ſhall not
ſo many ſweet ſhowers and deawes from
heauen, enter into our hearts, ſoften them,
and make them fruitfull in grace? finally,
it is the power of God to ſaluation, and
ſharper then any two edged ſword; and
can it not wound vs, and cut downe out
ſinnes, the enemies of our ſoule? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, That ſuch is the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
that it is able to conuert an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell;
there hath beene great power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
philoſophie, in drawing men from
the hatred of ſinne, to the loue of vertue.
A Philoſopher could ſay, when he ſaw a
vitious man, that he himſelfe had beene
as bad, if he had not giuen himſelfe to the
ſtudie of Philoſophie: And ſhall not the
profeſſion, ſtudie and preaching of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3274:123"/>
wiſedome, be of greater power to
vs: there is an example of one Polemon of
Athens, a wild and Luxurious young man,
delighting and reioycing in infami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; like
ſome of the ſwaggering youths of our
daies; this young man ſpending a whole
night in drinking and wantonnes, after the
Sunne riſing, returning home from his rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes,
he entred into the ſchoole of Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,
the Philoſopher, not to learne,
but to laugh, and deride him. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
omitting the matter he was intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of, began to ſpeake of modeſtie and
temperance; and he did it with ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
and authoritie, that he ſo moued the
young man, that he ſhewed open ſignes
of ſorrowe and repentance, and after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
his luxurious life. A worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to the ſhame &amp; condemnation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
both old and young in our age, which
heare daily many worthy ſermons, full
of grace, and power, and yet they are
impudent, deſperate, graceleſſe, and hard
harted; nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can moue them to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
and humiliation for their ſinnes: If
ſuch be the power of naturall Philoſophie,
farre greater is the power of heauenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
As one doth moſt ſoundly and truly
deſcribe it: Onely the heauenly doctrine
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3274:123"/>
ſaith hee (the which alone is wiſedome,<note place="margin">Lactant inſtit: lib: 3. Chap. 26.</note>)
bringeth to paſſe thoſe things, which the
Philoſophers were neuer able to doe. The
commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God (becauſe they are
ſincere and pure,) of how great force they
are in the hearts of men, daily experience
doth ſhew it. Bring me a man inclined to
anger, ill tongued, vnruly, and raſh, with a
few of Gods words I wil make him as qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
as a lambe: Bring me a couetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
a greedie ſcraper, and a niggard, hence
forth will I make him liberall. Bring me
one that is fearefull of death, and of paine,
ſtraightway, he will deſpiſe both gallous
and fire, and dangers, yea the torments of
the Brazen Bull: Bring me him, that is a
leacher, an adulterer, a ruffion, and a rioter;
henceforth ſhalt thou ſee him ſober, chaſte
and continent: Bring me a cruell perſon,
&amp; one that thirſteth after blood, ſoone ſhal
that furie be changed into clemencie and
mercy: Bring me an vniuſt man, vnwiſe, &amp;
ſinfull, he ſhall ſtraitway be iuſt, wiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
&amp; harmeleſſe; ſo great is the might
of godly wiſdome, that being powred into
the hart of men, it will at once, euen at one
puſh, expell and driue out fooliſhnes. Hath
euer yet hitherto any of the Philoſophers
performed theſe things? Or if he were
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3274:124"/>
willing, were he able to doe it? who when
they haue ſpent their whole time in the
ſtudie of Philoſophie, yet neuertheleſſe
are not able (if nature doe a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it) to make themſelues, or any others
the better therewith. Their wiſedome
therefore, how much ſoeuer it can doe, yet
doth it not roote out vices, but hide them;
but a fewe of Gods commandements doe
ſo throughly and wholy change man, and
ſo make him new, that thou canſt not
knowe him to be the ſame man he was.
The meaning of this worthy man is, that
the wiſedome of the word excelleth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
the wiſedome of nature, be it neuer
ſo abſolute: And howſoeuer Philoſophers
ſometimes might make ſome men aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of their vices, and to forſake them:
yet they could neuer throughly conuert
any, becauſe they could not teach them
true religion, and the feare of God, which
is the beginning of all true wiſedome. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples we haue of the power of
Gods word, in the calling and conuerting
of mens ſoules. By this, both this woman
and the Niniuites were conuerted. Peter
preaching euen to thoſe Iewes that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Chriſt, their hearts were pricked, and
they ſaid, Men and brethren what ſhall we
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3274:124"/>
doe? And by that ſermon he wonne three
thouſand ſoules to God: Oh the mightie
power of the word, if the Lord lay his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
hand to it.<note place="margin">Act: 16.</note> Paul preached to Lidea,
ſhe gaue attendance to Pauls preaching:
the Lord opened her heart, and ſo both ſhe
and her houſe was conuerted: In the ſame
manner was the Iaylor and his houſehould
conuerted. In an other place, the word was
of ſuch power, that the beleeuers came and
confeſſed, and ſhewed their workes, and
many alſo of them, which vſed curious
Artes, brought their bookes and burned
them before all men, and they counted
the price of them, and found it fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
peeces of ſiluer (which was of our
money about 2000. markes) ſo the word
of God grewe mightily and preuailed.
Thus we ſee, that the word hath beene
heretofore of great power to winne ſoules
to God. Is it now become weake and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
nay the fault is not in the word, but
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tubbornnes &amp; hardnes of our harts,
which will not suffer it to enter, nor giue it
any place. The word is the ſame it was, it
is the ſame ſeede, but is now ſowne in a
bad ſoyle, and therefore it will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, nor
cannot fructifie; And that you may know,
whether the word hath this power in you
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3274:125"/>
or no, for the conuerſion of your ſoules,
remember this worthie &amp; excellent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
for your inſtruction and direction.
When any is conuerted to the Lord, the
vaile is taken away: therefore the cauſe of
taking away the vaile, is our conuerſion to
God; From whence we may gather, that
whilſt in reading the ſcriptures, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of them is kept from vs, and
whilſt, that which is written is abſcure
and ſhut vp from vs, we are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
to the Lord: for if we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
(no doubt) the vaile would be
taken away. Let vs ſee what it is to be
conuerted to the Lord. But that we may
the more clearely knowe, what is to be
conuerted, let vs firſt ſee, what is to be
auerted, that is turned from the Lord.
Euery one then, that when the words of
the lawe is repeated, is occupied in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fables, he is auerted; Euery one
which is bound with the cares of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
with the deſires of riches, and
of the glory, and honour of the world,
he is auerted; that is, turned from the
Lord: He which ſeemeth to be eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from theſe things, and ſitteth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the words of the law, and is attentiue
with his countenance &amp; eyes, but his heart
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3274:125"/>
and thoughts are wandring, he is auerted;
that is, turned from the Lord. What is it
then to be conuerted and turned to God?
If we caſt all theſe things behind our
backes, and giue our ſelues in ſtudie,
in deeds, in minde, and care to the word
of God, to meditate in his lawe day and
night,<note place="margin">Oreg: in Exod: Hom: 12. Chap 41.</note> letting paſſe all other things, let
vs giue our ſelues to God. Let vs be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in his teſtimonies: this is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
to the Lord. If thou wouldeſt haue
thy ſonne to learne the liberall ſciences,
doſt thou not free him from other things?
for this cauſe, thou doſt prouide a ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter
and bookes, and thou doſt ſpare
for no coſt, to haue thy purpoſe brought
to paſſe. Which of vs doth ſo giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to the ſtudie of Gods lawe? who
doth with ſuch ſtudie and labour, ſeeke
for heauenly things, as he doth for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and earthly? and why doe we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that we are ignorant of that, which
we learne not? Some of you, ſo ſoone as
they heare that reiected which is read,
they ſtraite goe away, there is no inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of that which hath beene ſpoken,
no conſcience, no remembrance: where
as it is ſaide, Aske thy fathers, and
they will tell thee: Aske thy teachers,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3274:126"/>
and they will teach thee: Some tarrie not
ſo long, till the lectures be ended; ſome
though they heare, vnderſtand not, being
in the lower parts of Gods houſe, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
with fables, of whom I dare ſay,
that when Moſes is read, there is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a vaile vpon their heart, but there is a
wall ſet betwixt them. If he that is preſent
which doth heare and is attentiue, and
doth enquire and diſcuſſe of thoſe things
which he heareth, and that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vnderſtand, he doth aske the meaning
of others, and ſo learneth, he that ſhutteth
his eares leaſt he ſhould heare, and turneth
away his face from hearing: how is the
vaile taken away from his heart? Let vs
take heed then, that when Moſes is read,
when Paul is read, there be not a vaile vpon
our heart. Certainely if we heare negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and haue no care to learne and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
not onely the ſcripture of the
Lawe and Prophets, but of the Apoſtles
and Euangeliſts, we are hidden and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with a great vaile, and I doe feare, that
by the negligence and fooliſhnes of our
heart, that the diuine volumes are not only
hidden from vs, but ſealed: as if a booke
ſhould be giuen into the hands of man to
read, and he anſwereth, he cannot read, or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3274:126"/>
that it is ſealed. And therefore we muſt
haue a care, not onely to learne the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but we muſt entreate the Lord, by
ſupplications day &amp; night, that the lambe
of the tribe of Iudah may come &amp; vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe,
to take this ſealed booke and open it:
And indeed, it is Paul that planteth, and
Apollo watreth, but it is God that giues
the encreaſe; he is the author of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
the author of the word, the giuer of
all gifts and graces to his ſeruants. Good
ſeede is ſowne in ſundrie grounds, but it
doth not fructifie in all: Man ſpeaketh to
the outward eare, but God muſt ſpeake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to the heart: or elſe the word will
haue no power to conuert the ſoule. The
Goſpell is heard (ſaith a father) ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
and ſome beleeue not: They which
beleeue, they heare and learne from the
father: they which beleeue not, they heare
outwardly, but they neither heare nor
learne inwardly: that is, to them it is giuen
to beleeue,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 14.</note> to the other it is not giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So
ſaith our Sauiour to the Apoſtles: To you
it is giuen to know the ſecrets of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, but to others it is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<note place="margin">Act: 13. 48.</note> It is ſaid in an other place: As many
as were ordained to eternall life beleeued,
when Paul &amp; Barnabas preached. Though
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3274:127"/>
Prophets ſpeake to vs, though Apoſtles,
though Salomon, though Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
though Angels and Chriſt himſelfe
ſpeake: yet they ſhall nothing auaile to
conuert vs, except God open our hearts.
The Lord raigneth,<note place="margin">Aug: de benedict: Eſau. &amp; Iac.</note> both vpon the corne
and vpon the thornes; but hee ſendeth
Raine vpon the Corne, for the barne, and
vpon the thornes for the fire, and yet it is
the ſame raine: ſo the word of God is
powred vpon all, let euery one ſee what
roote he hath, let him ſee whether he
draweth the good raine, if he drawe it to
engender thornes, is the raigne of God
to be accuſed, before it come to the
roote? that is a ſweete raine, till it
come to a bad heart. Now that the
word may haue more power in vs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
let vs caſt off naturall blindnes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ſecuritie, our olde ſinnes and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cares: let vs come with hungrie, and
humble hearts, denying our ſelues, and
deſirous to learne: let vs come with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for our ſinnes, and a ſincere
loue to the word; And aboue all things,
let vs pray hartily, and continually to
the father and founder of all good gifts,
for the bleſſings of all good leſſons and
inſtructions to our ſoules; let vs confeſſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3274:127"/>

<note place="margin">Ier: 17. 14.</note> Heale me ô Lord and I ſhal be whole;

               </gap>t
my praiſe, turne thou vs vnto thee ô Lord,
and we ſhall be turned. And indeed the
calling and conuerſion of a ſinner, is the
great worke of God; as great as the worke
of our creation: And indeed, what is our
conuerſion? but an new creation: for God
(that commandeth light to ſhine out of
darknes) is he, which ſhineth in the he arts
of his children conuerted. It is he, that
muſt, make both the eare and the heart
tractable and flexible. It is he, that both
muſt make vs willing to doe good, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
able to doe good. It is he, that muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
perſwade the heart, and by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
teach vs inwardly, before we can be
truely conuerted. Let therefore miniſters
of the word, giue attendance to reading,
exhortation, and doctrine. Let them ſtirre
vp the grace of God, that worthy thing
in them. Let them be faithfull and wiſe
ſtewards, in diſpoſing the ſecrets of God.
Let them preach ſincerely, diligently and
feruently. Let their affections and life be
vpright and holie. Let them be wholy
poſſeſſed with the deſire of Gods glory,
with the loue of Chriſt, and with loue to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3274:128"/>
the ſoules of the people, and then their
miniſtrie ſhall be acceptable to God. If
not powerful to conuert, yet to confound:
their recompence ſhall be with the Lord:
their labour ſhall not be in vaine in the
Lord. We are vnto God ſaith the Apoſtle,
the ſweet Sauiour of Chriſt in them which
are ſaued, and in them which periſh: to
the one we are the Sauiour of death vnto
death: and to the other, a Sauiour of life
vnto life: and who is ſufficient for theſe
things? And ſeeing that Paul is nothing,
Apollos is nothing: but the effect and
bleſſing is of God: Let them ſtriue and
wraſtle with them, by humble and hartie
prayer, continually, vehemently, priuately,
and openly, for the aſſiſtance of his ſpirit,
and the bleſſing of their labours: that he
would perſwade Iapheth, that he might
dwell in the tents of Shem, that he would
circumciſe the hearts and eares of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and take from them, the vaile that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth,
as ignorance, prophanes, vnbeleefe,
hardnes of heart, and ſuch like. That he
would power water vpon the thirſtie, and
floods vpon the drie ground. That hee
would take away their ſtonie hearts, and
giue them hearts of fleſh: that ſo they
might walke in his ſtatutes: finally, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3274:129"/>
he would giue them vnderſtanding hearts,
that they might be fulfilled with the
knowledge of his will, in all wiſedome.
That they may diſcerne the things that
differ; that they may be pure, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence, vntill the day of Chriſt. That
they may walke worthy of the Lord, and
pleaſe him in all things, that the ſame
ſignes of conuerſion may be ſeene in their
people, as were truely found in this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And indeed, many, if not all, the
notes of good hearers, which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
I obſerued in her, are true ſignes
and notes of her calling: In that ſhe takes
ſo great paines, and beſtowes ſo much
coſt, to ſeeke for true wiſedome: In that
ſhe is ſo carefull to enquire, and ſearch
out the truth of religion. In that ſhe ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
and thinketh ſo reuerently of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
her teacher, repoſing true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in true wiſedome, and ſtirreth vp o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be of her minde: theſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
other, are ſignes and tokens of her
conuerſion.</p>
            <p>She ſpeaketh not like a Pagan, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
or Idolater: but like a worſhipper
of the true God: ſhe bleſſeth him, and
confeſſeth him to be the diſpoſer of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
and acknowledgeth Iſraell to be
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3274:129"/>
Gods people; and howſoeuer before, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by ſecret inſpiration, or by report,
ſhe heard of the true God, of his worſhip,
and of Salomons wiſedome: yet now ſhe
doth fullie taſte the truth of it, in her
owne ſoule: the ſecrets of her hearts are
made manifeſt, ſhee worſhippeth God,
and ſaith plainely, that God was in that
place.</p>
            <p>The diuine wiſedome of Salomon had
parſwaded this daughter of Iapheth, to
come to the tents of Shem, to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the viſible Church, and to imbrace
the truth of religion, and no doubt ſhe
went ioyfully home, and indeuoured (by
all meanes poſſible,) to eſtabliſh the lawe
and worſhip of the true God in her owne
countrie.</p>
            <p>Our Sauiour (as you haue heard) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
this woman, and ioyneth her
with the Niniuites, who no doubt truely
repented, though many of them fell away
afterwards. It is true, that all the Kings
of the earth ſought the preſence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
<note place="margin">ver: 24.</note> to heare his wiſedome, that God
had put in his heart, as we may ſee in this
chapter.</p>
            <p>I doe not ſay that all theſe were called
and conuerted. It may be many of them
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3274:130"/>
came to heare and ſee newes, rather for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
then diuine wiſedome; to ſee the
glory and royaltie of Salomon: the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Temple, and his Pallace, which
he had builded, or vpon ſome other ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

commended, yea a whole ſtorie is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of her, and not of the reſt: the cauſe

her labour, but got fruit and profit by her

of her conuerſion. Indeed ſomething is

this King is prefigured the vocation of the

ſpeaketh religiouſly, reioycing when he
heard Salomons words, and bleſſing the

apparant in this woman: If ſhe amongſt
others be a figure of the calling of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
then it muſt needs follow, that ſhe
her ſelfe was alſo called, for though God
made a ſeparation betwixt Iewes and
Gentiles, and choſe to himſelfe for a time
the ſeed of Abraham, ſo that the generall
calling of the Gentiles was not before
Chriſt his comming in the fleſh: yet God
had alwaies ſome amongſt them, as King
Hyram, Naamon the Syrian, Iob, this
Queene, and others. She ſeekes for true
wiſedome from Salomon, and finds it. The
Church ſeekes for the treaſures of all
knowledge, comfort, and ioy from Chriſt.
She commends and magnifies Salomon:<note place="margin">Cant. 2.</note>
the Church magnifieth Chriſt, accounting
him as her well beloued husband. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth

And as in this woman, we haue a figure of
the calling of the Church of the Gentiles:
ſo in Salomon we haue a tipe and figure
of Chriſts Salomons kingdome, a figure
of Chriſts kingdome: his wiſedome, a
figure of Chriſts wiſedome: his glory, a
ſhadow of Chriſts glory: his riches, a tipe
of Chriſts ſpirituall riches: his Temple,
a tipe of Chriſts Temple.</p>
            <p>And as Salomon doth kindly accept
the gifts and preſents of this woman,
though hee had no neede of them; ſo
doth Chriſt as kindly accept the ſeruice
of his Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore this ſhould encourage

then Salomon ſhould giue this Queene;
namely, hee giueth to vs himſelfe, his
body and blood, his ſpirit, his word, all
ſpirituall graces, yea life eternall. For
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3274:131"/>
howſoeuer there is ſome reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Salomon and Chriſt, yet he is
more excellent then any Patriarke, Prince,
Prophet, or Saint whatſoeuer. Salomon
a King of the earthly Ieruſalem: Chriſt
the King of the ſpirituall and heauenly
Ieruſalem, of the militant and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Church. Salomon a King of peace,
of outward and earthly peace. Chriſt
the King of inward and euerlaſting peace.
Salomon excelled all Kings of his time
in wiſedome and knowledge: Chriſt the
founder and treaſurer of wiſedome: Of
his fulnes haue we all receiued, grace for
grace, for God hath not giuen him the
ſpirit by meaſure. Salomon a Prophet, a
Preacher; Chriſt as the King of all Kings,
ſo the Prince of all Prophets and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
Salomon and all the reſt ſpake by
him, Salomon but a man: Chriſt both
man and God, Omnipotent, Creator of
all things.</p>
            <p>Salomon a greeuous ſinner: Chriſt
pure, vndefiled, without ſinne; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of repenting ſinners, meriting life
for them, and making his word effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in them.</p>
            <p>And now let vs further note, from this
religious woman, that religion belongeth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3274:132"/>
to women: God is their Creator, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are to ſerue him. The firſt woman
was created in the image of God, which is
true wiſedome, holines, and righteouſnes,
which was loſt by the fall of their firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and they muſt ſeeke to recouer it in
Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who died for them, as well as for
men. They are partakers of both the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:
they haue ſoules to ſaue as well
as others: they are the weaker veſſels, and
ſooner ouercome of Sathan: they haue
many ſpeciall infirmities: they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of many bleſſings and deliuerances
from God. Therefore religion, the feare of
God, and diuine wiſedome, appertaineth
to them.<note place="margin">Luk: 8.</note> Beſides theſe reaſons, we haue
plentie of holy examples in the ſcripture,<note place="margin">Luk: 10.</note>
as Euah,<note place="margin">2. Iohn:</note> Sarah, Rebecca, Debora, Marie,
and Elizabeth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.</note> with many other, holie and
religious women. If then religion belong
to women, then much more to men. As
they excell in place and power, ſo they
ſhould excell in grace and wiſdome. They
ſhould be examples of zeale, and pietie,
and teachers of their wiues and families.
This ſerueth for the confutation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
who locke vp the ſcriptures from
men and women, teaching that doth not
belong to them, to ſearch the ſcriptures.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3274:132"/>
This alſo maketh againſt prophane and
careleſſe women, who are altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in the matters of religion, as though
it did not belong to their Sexes at all.
Here are alſo reproued wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
husbands, who doe not further, but
altogether hinder their wiues, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
and zeale of religion. And moſt curſed
are all Athieſts &amp; carnall men, who ſcorne
and deride any profeſſion or ſhew of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in women. And finally, here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and incouragement for all forward
and religious women: this may be to ſtirre
them vp to proceed, &amp; go on, in the way of
godlines, hauing ſo many, both reaſons
and examples ſet before them, mouing
and enforcing them to the zeale of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And as it appertaineth to all men and
women in generall: ſo more eſpecially,
to Gentiles. Nobles, Lords, Ladies, Kings,
and Queenes: as they excell and ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others in diet, in apparell, in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and dignities; ſo ſhould they goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them in ſpirituall graces: As they haue
receiued more bleſſings from the Lord, ſo
are they more tied and bound to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
and more zeale, pietie, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
is required at their hands, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſaying of our Sauiour: To
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3274:133"/>
whom much is giuen, of him much ſhall be
required. Their places and honours, ſhould
be inducements to pietie: as Samuel ſaid
to Saul: The Lord ſent me to annoynt
thee King ouer Iſrael,<note place="margin">1. Sam: 15. 1.</note> now therefore obey
the words of the voyce of the Lord. As if
he ſhould haue ſaid, becauſe God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
thee, thou art bound to obey him.
It is their chiefe honour to honour God.
Thoſe that honour me,<note place="margin">1. Sam: 2. 30.</note> I will honour ſaith
the Lord. The examples of great perſons
doth moſt good or moſt hurt: If they be
godly, they are a meanes to winne many
ſoules to God, by their good examples to
drawe them to the exerciſe of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If they be wicked, they infect &amp; dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>we
many to deſtruction with them. Therefore
religion doth chiefely concerne great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Here is a Queene religious, and here
is King Salomon, a profeſſor and teacher
of religion: and Bethſeba his mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
a good Queene, a fit wife for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.
She ſaith, who ſhall finde a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
woman, for her price is far aboue the
Pearles: And though ſhe commend care
and painefulnes in ſuch a woman, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
for her familie; yet the chiefe thing
that ſhe commendeth in ſo great a perſon,
is vertue and religion; Strength and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3274:133"/>
(ſaith ſhe) is her clothing,<note place="margin">Pro: 31. 10. 25. 30.</note> and in the
latter day ſhe ſhall reioyce. She openeth
her mouth with wiſedome, and the lawe
of grace is in her tongue. Fauour is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
beautie is vanitie; but a woman that
feareth the Lord, ſhe ſhall be praiſed.
Theſe be the words of a woman, of a
Queene, of a religious woman, of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
mother, inſpired by the holy Ghoſt;
directing her beloued ſonne Salomon,
what he ſhould chiefely require in the
choyce of a wife. A glaſſe for women to
looke into, though they be neuer ſo high
or great in the world: wherein they may
behold and ſee, what things are chiefely
required of them, for their credit and
comforts: namely, vertue, wiſedome, and
religion.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>VVE haue heard alreadie many
things in commendation of this
worthie and famous Queene: and yet ſtill
we muſt perſiſt vpon that argument. For
as the words before, ſo ſtill, the words of
this text are greatly to her praiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
She praiſeth the true God, ſhe
confeſſeth that it was of his meere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that Salomon was preferred to the
kingdome; She gathereth thereby, that
God loued Iſrael, and would preſerue it:
She ſheweth the end, why he was placed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3274:134"/>
in his throne: ſhe ſpeaketh diuinely of the
bleſſing, dignitie, and dutie of a good
King. The words containe a thankſgiuing
and congratulation, for the preferment of
Salomon, to the kingdome of Iſrael: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we are firſt to obſerue her pietie to
God; and her loue to Salomon. Her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to God, in that ſhe diſtinguiſheth him
from Idols, and falſe Gods; and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
and bleſſeth him, as the true God:
She calleth him the God of Salomon: not
that he was proper, and peculiar to him,
(for he is the God of all the world) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſhewed ſpeciall loue, and fauour
to Salomon; ſo is he called the God of
Abraham, of Iſaacke and Iacob, the God
of Daniell. It is an honour to vs, in that he
vouchſafeth ſo to be called. It is the glory
of Saints, that as <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> Apoſtle ſaith, their God
is not aſhamed of them, to be called their
God. It is a happie thing then, to be the
friend of God, he hath ſuch in memorie,
they are within his ſpeciall care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
And as the Pſalmiſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Pſ: 144. 15.</note> Bleſſed
are the people, whoſe God is the Lord.
She bleſſeth this God, ſaying: Bleſſed be
the Lord thy God: A common manner of
thankſgiuing in the ſcriptures, we are ſaid
to bleſſe God, and God is ſaid to bleſſe vs.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3274:135"/>
He bleſſeth vs, when he beſtoweth his
bleſſings vpon vs; we bleſſe him, when we
giue him thankes, for his bleſſings beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
An example of both,<note place="margin">Ephe: 1.</note> we haue in theſe
words of the Apoſtle: Bleſſed be God,
euen the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
who hath bleſſed vs with all ſpirituall
bleſſings in heauenly things, here are the
bleſſings of God vpon the faithfull, and
here againe the faithfull doe praiſe and
bleſſe God for the ſame.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 6.</note> Thankſgiuing is
a part of Gods worſhip, &amp; a part of prayer,
and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith;<note place="margin">Theſ: 5. 17. 18.</note> In all
things let your requeſts be ſhewed to
God, in prayer, and ſupplication, with the
giuing of thankes. And againe, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
and in all things giue thankes; for
this is the will of God in Chriſt Ieſus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you. By this we teſtifie our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and loue towards God: It is a debt
due to him, and all the tribute we can pay
vnto him. It is a benefit to our ſelues: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by it, we are imboldned to craue
more bleſſings of him. It is the finall end
of all Gods benefits. Let vs therefore offer
the ſacrifice of praiſe alwaies to God,<note place="margin">Heb: 13. 15.</note> that
is, the fruit of the lippes, which confeſſe
his name. Now we are to praiſe him for
all bleſſings, euen for the leaſt, whether
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3274:135"/>
ſpirituall,<note place="margin">Gen: 24.</note> or temporall. Abrahams ſeruant
praiſed God, for proſpering his iourney.
Melchiſedecke bleſſed God,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Abraham and Lot from the hand of
their enemies. Chriſt himſelfe whenſoeuer
he eate,<note place="margin">Iohn: 6. 11.</note> though it were but barley bread,
and a fewe fiſhes, lift vp his eyes, and
gaue thankes;<note place="margin">1. Cor: 10. 31.</note> and therefore the Apoſtle
wiſheth vs, that whether wee eate, or
drinke, or whatſoeuer we doe, we doe
all to the glory of God. If we are to
praiſe God for the leaſt benefites, much
more for the greateſt; If for earthly, much
more for heauenly; If for the foode of
the body, much more for the foode of
the ſoule; If for deliuerance from the
enemies of the body, much more for
the deliuerance from the enemies of our
ſoules. Neither are we to praiſe God
onely for our ſelues,<note place="margin">Phil: 1.</note> but alſo in regard
of others,<note place="margin">Coll: 1.</note> the Apoſtle (in his Epiſtles
written to the Churches) giueth thankes
for the faith, loue, and ſpirituall graces,
beſtowed vpon them. King Hyram when
he had heard of Salomons wiſedome, and
Raigne, reioyced greatly and bleſſed
God for him: And this Queene doth
the like, here in this place. How much
more had the ſubiects of Salomon, cauſe to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3274:136"/>
reioyce and praiſe God for ſuch a King;
And this is the dutie of good ſubiects, as
to pray for their gouernours, ſo to bleſſe
God continually, for the manifold bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
they enioy through their good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment:
but of this I purpoſe to ſpeake
in an other place. Now as we haue ſeene
the pietie of this woman to God: ſo let vs
ſee her loue to Salomon, reioycing ſo
greatly at his preferment, and proſperitie.
For this is the fruit of loue;<note place="margin">Rom: 12. 15.</note> To reioyce,
with them that reioyce, and weepe with
them that weepe, and to be of like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Enuie (ſaith one) is the daughter of pride;
But this mother pride cannot be barren:

Except wee haue true Religion, Faith, and

<hi>(Salomon</hi> ſaith) as ſnowe in ſummer, and

            <p>Now let vs ſee the manifold teſtimonies
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3274:140"/>
of Gods loue to Salomon. Before he was
borne, God choſe him to build his houſe,
preferred him before his father in that
worke, and promiſed to eſtabliſh his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
So ſoone as he was borne, he was
called Iedidiah, becauſe the Lord loued
him. He had a good father Dauid, a good
mother Bethſeba, and Nathan the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
as his tutor and teacher. While his
father liued, he was annoynted King with
ioy and conſent of his father and people.
He was a yonger brother, therefore had
no right to the crowne by birth; yet was
choſen extraordinarily to be King, by
God himſelfe, (in like ſort was both Saul
and Dauid choſen) but afterward Kings
were created by election, or blood. God
appeared twiſe to him, and ſpake famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
with him. He gaue him his deſire, and
more too. He was King not of heathen or
infidels, but of Iſrael, Gods choſen, of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
that holy Citie. He built a moſt
glorious Temple, prefiguring the true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Temple of God. He had peace in all
his countries from Dan to Berſheba. The
Amorites, Hittites, Perezites, Hiuites, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites
(which the children of Iſrael were
not able to ſubdue) he made them all tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries
and bondmen. He had wiſedome
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3274:140"/>
and vnderſtanding exceeding much, and a
large heart, euen as the ſand, that is on the
Sea ſhore; being wiſer then any man: and
hee was famous throughout all Nations
round about, and there came of all people
of the earth to heare his wiſedome, and hee
exceeded all the Kings of the earth, and all
the world, both in riches and wiſdome, and
all the world ſought to ſee <hi>Salomor,</hi> to heare
his wiſedome, which God put in his heart.
So that whatſoeuer God promiſed to <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wee thinke him famous, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

powerfull, glorious, and worthie then the
<hi>Babylonian, Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings?
Was hee more famous then <hi>Alexander,</hi> the
Conqueror of the world, or mightier then
<hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Augustus?</hi> or richer then
<hi>Croeſus?</hi> Hee is compared onely with the
Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He had not onely wiſdom,
not onely glorie, not onely power: but all
thoſe together; and herein is no king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to him: what ſhould we ſay more?
his felicitie was admirable &amp; vnſpeakable,
and is largely ſet out in this chapter, and in
the former chapters of this book: So that he
had ſundry &amp; ſingular teſtimonies of Gods
loue towards him. But ſome will ſay, why
did God loue him? or how could hee loue
him? and why did he beſtow ſo many gifts
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him? to his own ruine &amp; deſtruction (as
it may ſeem). For into what horrible &amp; mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
ſinnes did he fall, as we may ſee in the

deſcribed; &amp; alſo the anger of God againſt

            <p>What a fearfull fall is this of ſuch a great
perſon? of ſuch a King, a Prophet, a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
and that in his olde age, euen then he

then his heart was turned from the Lorde

            <p>The loue of out-landiſh women drewe

him with diuers aduerſaries, all the daies of
his life. He troubled and vexed the Lord,
therefore the Lord vexeth him. Hee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Gods worſhip, and therefore the Lord
diuided his kingdome.</p>
            <p>This fall of <hi>Salomon</hi> is moſt fearfull, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
and lamentable; Nay, it is incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Who would belieue this? or thinke it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?
but that it is written and recorded

the law of nature? the written law
of God, the ſweete counſell of thy father
and mother, and the good counſell which
thou haſt long ſince giuen to others? Hath
ſenſuallity, proſperity, pleaſures, and luſts,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3274:145"/>
wholy poſſeſſed thee, blinded thee, and
taken away they heart? O pittifull, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
wofull, and fearefull fall! The
greatneſſe and hainouſneſſe of this ſinfull
fall, haue made ſome learned Fathers to
doubt of the ſaluation of Salomon: And
ſome to put him in the number of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
and damned: their reaſons are
theſe: Firſt, becauſe his father Dauid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Prophet, ſaith of him in the place
before alledged: That if he forſooke the
Lord, hee would caſt him off for euer.
Tis true, if Salomon did finally forſake
him without repentance. Againe, they
ſay that the Scripture maketh mention of
his grieuous fall, as we haue heard before,
out of the next Chapter following; but
there is no mention of his repentance,
though his death bee there named. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it found, that hee tooke away the
Idols, which hee had erected. But it may
be, his repentance was late, and hee could
not take them away ſuddenly. Againe, he
is not numbred by the Apoſtle in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of the faithfull.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> Though Samuel
and Dauid his father, and diuers others
bee there named: yet all the faithfull of
the Old Teſtament are not there numbred,
nor all holy Kings: for there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there of Iehoſephat and Heſechias.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:3274:146"/>
Againe, ſome doe alleage, that ſentence of
God out of the Prophet, ſaying, I will
ſpeake ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly againſt a nation, or againſt
a kingdome; to plucke it vp, and to roote
it out, and to deſtroy it; but if this nation
(againſt whom I haue pronounced) turne
from their wickednes, I will repent of the
plague, which I thought to bring vpon
them: and thus they gather from this place,
that becauſe God plagued Salomon by
ſundrie aduerſaries to his death, and neuer
tooke away this plague; that therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
repented not, but died in his ſinnes.
But that ſentence of Ieremie is not rightly
applied, becauſe God doth oftentimes
correct penitent ſinners with temporall
puniſhments; and thus he did to Dauid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his repentance: He forgaue him his
ſinnes, but yet he did correct him diuers
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, by temporall corrections. It is true
indeed, that all penitent ſinners are ſure,
to be freed from eternall and euerlaſting
puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And it may rather be thought
that God doth threaten and afflict Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
to drawe him thereby to repentance;
and no doubt, if he had any ſparke of grace,
or diuine wiſedome left in him, ſuch afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and corrections, one after an other,
would drawe him to true humiliation and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3274:146"/>
repentance. The Fathers, ſome of them
ſpeake very hardly and heauily of this fall
of Salomon. Dauid the ſonne of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall
Ieruſalem ſaith one, raigned in the
earth, and was much commended in the
ſcripture. His pietie and true humilitie
ſo conquered his affections, that he was
one of them, of whom we might ſay with
him;<note place="margin">Aug: anit: dei. lib: 17.</note> Bleſſed are thoſe, whoſe iniquitie is
forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.
After him his ſonne Salomon raigned in
all his kingdome,<note place="margin">Chap: 20.</note> beginning to raigne in
his fathers time, he began well, but ended
badly: proſperitie (the mouth of wiſedom)
did him more hurt, then his famous and
memorable wiſedome profited him.<note place="margin">Chriſ: 2.</note> An
other ſaith, that Salomon receiued a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wound,<note place="margin">Cor: Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

roſe againe, that he warred and thence
receiued a crowne, but ſo did not his ſonne
Salomon. And an other;<note place="margin">Bern: de paſſ: dom: Chap. 14.</note> Who was wiſer
then Salomon? but departing from the
commandements of God, and ioyning
himſelfe to heatheniſh women, he built
Temples to their Gods, yea to diuels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much the more deiected, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in follie, as before he was lifted vp in
wiſedome. An other compareth Salomon
with Chriſt, ſaying, that he did much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3274:147"/>
him, becauſe Chriſt had wiſedome by
nature, but Salomon did aske it by prayer,
and in the end poſſeſſed it not. Theſe
things are heauie, to ſpeake, and thinke
of, and they are ſome blot and blemiſh to
Salomon: but yet it is hard and vncertaine
to determine of the damnation of any; and
as the former reaſons, may be anſwered,
ſo, as I take it, there be ſtronger arguments
to proue the repentance and ſaluation of
Salomon: And firſt, call to minde thoſe
great promiſes, which God maketh to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
touching this his ſonne Salomon, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, I will be his father, and he ſhall
be my ſonne;<note place="margin">2. Sam: 7. 14. 15.</note> and if he ſinne, I will chaſten
him with the rodde of men, and with the
plagues of the children of men: but my
mercy ſhall not depart away from him, as
I tooke it from Saul, whom I haue put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
before thee. A plaine teſtimonie of
Gods loue to Salomon, and of his election
to ſaluation. And howſoeuer ſome doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that mercy of God, to the mercy of
ſucceſſion in the kingdome; and that God
would not vtterly cut off his ſeed from
thence, as he did to Saul: yet that mercy
may be further extended, to the pardoning
of the ſinne of Salomon, and ſauing of his
ſoule. And if God be his father, and he his
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3274:147"/>
ſonne, how can he finally fall and periſh?
Are any of the ſonnes and children of God
damned? Is God a father to the reprobate?
and are the reprobates his children? doth
he correct them gently in loue, as fathers
vſe to chaſten their children? or doth he
not rather puniſh them in his furie and
rage, in his iuſtice and ſeueritie? In an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place: when Salomon was borne, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
called his name Salomon, and it is ſaid
that the Lord loued him.<note place="margin">2. Sam: 12. 24. 25.</note> For the Lord had
ſent by Nathan the Prophet, therefore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
called his name Iedidiſah, that is, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of God. For that is the reaſon of the
name, becauſe the Lord loued him. That
is one of his titles: Beloued of God. And it
is ſaid twiſe (in that place) the Lord loued
him:<note place="margin">Iohn: 13.</note> and in this our text, this Queene ſaith
as much, that God loued him. Now thoſe,
whom God loueth, he loueth to the end.
And thoſe whom God loueth, how can
they finally and totally fall away? Though
they fall, they cannot fall away; though
they ſinne, they muſt needes riſe againe by
repentance, and ſo be ſaued. And I haue
neuer read in all the ſcripture, that God
doth profeſſe any ſuch loue to a reprobate.
God ſaith of Iacob,<note place="margin">Rom: 9. 12.</note> I haue loued him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was choſen; &amp; I haue hated Eſau,

becauſe he was reiected. Againe, we haue
heard alreadie that Salomon was a figure
and tipe of Chriſt Ieſus, the ſonne of God,
the Sauiour of the world. Againe, he was
alſo as we haue heard, inſpired by the holy
Ghoſt, and a writer of the holy ſcripture.
Some reprobates haue ſpoken the truth,
and haue preached and prophecied, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam
and Iudas: but the Prophets and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of holy ſcripture are all elect and ſaued
(ſo far as we know.) Our Sauiour Chriſt
ſaith, that the wicked ſhall ſee Abraham,
Iſaacke, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in
the kingdome of God: and themſelues
thruſt out of doores. Now Salomon was a
preacher, a Prophet, a writer of ſcripture,
and therefore we doubt not but he hath
his part in the kingdome of heauen. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the booke of the Preacher, is called by
the Hebrewes, the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance of Salomon:
and ſo it ſeemeth, by the firſt beginning
and entrance of it: where he cryeth out,
Vanitie of vanities, all is vanitie. They be
the words of one, that had taſted of all the
pleaſures in the world that could be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and yet at laſt being wearie of all, and
renouncing all, he repoſeth all true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this life, in true religion and the feare
of God. This may ſerue to ſatisfie vs,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3274:149"/>
touching the repentance and ſaluation of
Salomon: And now becauſe we (vpon
ſome iuſt occaſion) haue made ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
not impertinent, nor vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
(and becauſe this fall of Salomon is
abuſed by many) let vs (before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further) deliuer ſome good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and vſes, touching this his fall. Firſt
then conſider, how dangerous the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
the great wealth, and honours of the
world are, and therefore let vs not (too
much) deſire them, nor ſet our hearts, or
delights (too much) vpon them. For
(thorough the corruption of our nature)
many wax proud, contemning God and
men, iniurious to themſelues and others,
being wanton, luxurious and Laſciuious.
And therefore the Lord ſaith to his people
Iſrael:<note place="margin">Deut: 8. 10. 11. 12. &amp;c.</note> When thou haſt eaten, and filled thy

and his lawes, and his ordinances which I

and thy beaſts and thy ſheepe are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and thy ſiluer and thy gold is multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3274:150"/>
and all that thou haſt is increaſed;
then thine heart be lifted vp, and thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Lord thy God, which brought
thee out of the land of Aegypt, and out of
the houſe of bondage.<note place="margin">Deut: 32. 15.</note> And in an other
place, he complaineth of that people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
He that ſhould haue beene vpright,
(when he waxed fatte) ſpurned with his
heele. Thou art fatte, thou art groſſe, thou
art loaden with fatnes; therefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke
God that made him, and regarded
not the ſtrong God of his ſaluation. How
ſhould I ſpare thee? (ſaith the Lord) thy
children haue forſaken me, and ſworne by
them which are no Gods; though I fed
them to the full,<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 7. 8.</note> yet they committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
&amp; aſſembled themſelues by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in the harlots houſes; They roſe vp in
the morning like fed horſes; for euery man
neighed after his neighbours wife. Again,
I did knowe them in the wildernes,<note place="margin">Hoſe: 13. 5. 6.</note> in the
land of drought, as in their paſtures, ſo
were they filled; they were filled, and their
heart was exalted; Therefore haue they
forgotten me. Oh that the great men of
the world, the Potentates, Princes, States,
Nobles, and all the wealthy of the earth,
would reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber this, who (by their power
and wealth) take libertie to ſinne, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3274:150"/>
to liue licentiouſly without controule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and are infatuated by worldly
cares, and pleaſures, whereas the end of
all outward bleſſings is to make vs more
thankfull,<note place="margin">Pſ: 105. 44. 45.</note> and more holy: God gaue his
people the lands of the heathen, and they
tooke the labours of the people in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the end of this and of all their former
bleſſings is, that they might keepe his
ſtatutes, and obſerue his lawes. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that great proſperitie is ſo dangerous;
let vs pray with the wiſe man, Giue me
not pouertie,<note place="margin">Pro: 30. 8. 9.</note> nor riches: feed me with food
conuenient for me, leaſt I be full, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thee: and ſay, who is the Lord? or leaſt
I be poore, and ſteale, and take the name
of my God in vaine. Great abundance is
dangerous, and extreame pouertie is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
the competent eſtate is the beſt,
and let vs be content with it, and let euery

ſaying;<note place="margin">Ier: 9. 23. 24.</note> Let not the wiſe man glory in his

            <p>Againe, by this example we ſee, that
great and good Princes are ſubiect
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3274:151"/>
to falling; ſome haue good beginnings,
and continue long, and yet in the end they
decline and fall away. Nero in the firſt fiue
yeares of his raigne, was of ſuch libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
clemencie and gentlenes, that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all Princes that were before him, he
either for gaue or elſe diminiſhed all tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and payments. He was ſo gentle and
fauourable to all degrees, that he would
admit them to come to ſalute him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
did ſalute them himſelfe by name: He
made many good lawes: but although he
did theſe and ſuch like things, with great
honour at the beginning of his raigne:
yet (at the laſt) forgetting the Imperiall
dignitie, he opened his wantonnes, his
fleſhly pleaſures, his riot, his Auarice,
his crueltie: Oftentimes he attempted to
kill his owne mother Agrippina: She eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
often, at laſt the Centurion (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
towards her with a naked ſword
in his hand) ſlew her; ſhe putting forth
her belly, cried out, That hee would
ſtrike that part firſt, for this bellie (ſaith
ſhe) is to be pierced through with Iron,
which brought forth ſuch a monſter.
Then the (Centurion thruſt his ſword
into her bellie, and ſo ſlew her with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
woundes; after this horrible murther
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3274:151"/>
was done, Nero being both without feare
and ſhame, beheld the Carkaſſe of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being ſlaine. He killed Seneca his
maiſter, and Burrus one of his gouernours.
What will you more? he ceaſed not to
kill whom he pleaſed, and that for what
cauſe ſoeuer he pleaſed. Tyberius (who
ſucceeded Auguſtus) raiſed vp of himſelfe,
(at the beginning of his raigne) no ſmall
hope of goodnes: but afterwards, proued
a very Tyrant, and moſt filthy man. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
the great, at the firſt ruled iuſtly
and valiantly: but after he was ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with the daintie delicates of
Paſia, that he became proud, leacherous,
a drunkard, a murtherer: by the which
vices he both ſhortned his owne daies,
and made himſelfe to be deteſted of
his owne Macedonians. Conſtantine the
great, vnhappily ended his empire, He
purſued the good Biſhop Athanaſius: He
brought home the Heritike Arrius, and
became an Apoſtata. Mauritius of a long
time gouerned happily, but afterwards
he became ſo cruell, ſo couetous, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
that he was hated of his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and ſlaine by Phocas. There be
many ſuch examples; but there is one
before our eies, the wiſeſt Prince that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3274:152"/>
euer was, a long time gouerning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
and vertuouſly: but in his old
daies, falling in moſt groſſe and beaſtly
manner. Of whom it may be ſaid, as it
was ſaid of Origen. <hi>Vbi bene nemo melius,
vbi male nemo peius,</hi> where he did well,
none did better: where he did euill, none
did worſe: I meane in reſpect of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled
and filthy luſt, ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the beſt and the wiſeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are ſubiect to the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
to the allurements of the world,
fleſh and ſinne, and may decline and
fall away from good beginnings and
proceedings; let all good Chriſtians and
good ſubiects, pray hartily and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to God; not onely to make their
Princes good, but alſo to hold, keepe,
continue, and encreaſe them in goodnes.
And ſeeing that all of vs, are ſubiect to
the like temptations, let vs all be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
not onely to begin well, but alſo
to holde on and continue to the end:
remembring that fearefull ſentence of
God, ſaying: If the righteous turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

            <p>Happie is that young man, that hath

            <p>It is not ſufficient that we haue bene
good, except we continue ſo ſtill: the
righteous (ſaith Dauid) ſhall flouriſh

in the Courts of our God, they ſhall
bring forth fruit in their age.</p>
            <p>Young men muſt remember their
Creator in their youth, the powers of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3274:153"/>
their body and minde is then fitteſt for
the ſeruice of God: They are ſubiect to
death, as well as others: they muſt giue
their beſt time, and firſt fruites of their
age to God; They cannot tell how ſoone
they may die, and they muſt come to
iudgement as well as others, and the
pietie of their young age will be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and a credit to them in their old age;
and therefore let them be carefull of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and holy conuerſation in their
tender yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let old men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
take heed of vices, and doe nothing,
that is vnſeemely to their age: And (in
very deed) the beautie and ornament of
the elder ſort is the true knowledge of
God, and heauenly wiſedome, and an
vnblamable life: they may ſet, that no
age is free from danger; If the diuell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceiue vs in our youth, he will not
leaue vs, but will deceiue vs in our age (if
he can) ſome in this age, are guiltie of
Salomons ſinnes, both of vncleannes and
Idolatrie. Some are ignorant, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
ſome vniuſt, ſome ouercome with
lying, ſome with drunkennes, and the
moſt in their olde age, are ſubiect to
impatience, and couetouſnes, and are
vnwilling to die, and leaue this ſinfull
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3274:153"/>
world: but let them of all other be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of wiſedome &amp; vertue, let them flie
from the luſts of youth, &amp; follow after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
faith, loue &amp; peace, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
call on the Lord with a pure heart.<note place="margin">Tit. 2 3.</note> Let the
elder men be ſober, honeſt, diſcreet, ſound
in the faith, in loue, and in patience: the
elder women likewiſe, that they bee of
ſnch behauiour as becommeth holines, not
falſe accuſers, not giuen to much wine, but
teachers of honeſt things. Oh, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
a thing is it, when gray-headed men
miniſter iudgement, and when the elders
can giue good counſell? Oh how comely
a thing is wiſedome to aged men? and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and prudence to men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
The crowne of olde men is to haue
much experience, and the feare of God is
their glory. They are to giue themſelues
to continuall prayer and deuotion, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and hearing of the word, to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of the ſhortnes of their life, and of
the happineſſe and eternity of the life to
come. Worthy is the example of <hi>Barzillai</hi>
the Giliadite: who went to conduct King
<hi>Dauid</hi> ouer Iorden, and King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayd
vnto him, Come ouer with me, and I will
feede thee with me in Ieruſalem: I am this
day foure ſcore yeere olde (ſayth hee) and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3274:154"/>
can I diſcerne betweene good or euill
hath thy ſeruant any taſte in that I eate?<note place="margin">2. Sam. 19. 31. 35. 37.</note> or
that I drink? can I heare any more the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voyce of men or women? wherefore
then ſhould thy ſeruant be any more a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?
thy ſeruant will goe a little way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
with thee, I pray thee let thy ſeruant
turne backe againe, that I may die in my
owne City, and bee buried in the graue of
my father and of my mother. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that the pleaſures of the Courte
was not fit for him, though he was a man of
great account, &amp; ſubſtance, yet being old,
his minde was of death, of his graue and
buriall. Happy is he that hath ſo liued both
in young, and olde age: that hee can ſay
(with good Ambroſe ſeeing his friendes
weeping about him at his death) I haue not
ſo liued, that I am aſhamed to liue ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, neither am I afrayde to die,
becauſe we haue a gracious &amp; good Lord.
Now let young &amp; old, and all ſorts of men
and women, eſpecially Princes, and great
perſons: let all (I ſay) take heede of theſe
two vices where with Solomon is touched,
namely, vnbridled luſt &amp; Idolatrie. God
is a holy and pure ſpirit, hee hath ordeyned
mariage as a bridle and remedie againſt
vnclearle and vnlawfull luſt, and wee are
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3274:154"/>
to liue chaſtelie in virginitie, and ſingle
life, which is the firſt degree of chaſtitie:
or elſe to liue in mariage (the ordinance
of GOD) which is the ſecond degree
of chaſtitie. But the Deuill, he is a foule,
filthie, and vncleane ſpirit, an enemie to
mariage, to chaſtitie, and honeſtie: and
therefore, from the beginning hee hath
ſought to defile, and pollute, that holy
inſtitution of GOD, by multitude of
wiues, by fornication, whoredome, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
and other wandering, wanton, and
vagabonde luſtes. Theſe are againſt the
law of nature, againſt the law of God
written, againſt ciuill honeſtie, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Theſe deſtroie and conſume the
goods, the good name, the body and
ſoule. And (as Bertheba ſayeth to her
ſonne Salomon) Such vncleaneſſe is the
deſtruction of Kings: ſo it is the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many others, men and women, of
many great houſes, townes, countries,
and kingdomes. Therefore (ſayth Iob)
If my heart haue beene deceiued by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or if I haue laide waite at the doore
of my neighbour: let my wife g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vpon her.<note place="margin">Iob. 31. 9. 10. 11. 12.</note> For this is a wickednes and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
to bee condemned; yea this is a fire

that ſhall deuoure to deſtruction, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
ſhall roote out all mine increaſe.<note place="margin">Hoſe. 4. 11.</note> And it is
moſt true (which the Prophet ſaith) that
whoredome and wine take away the heart.
And indeede, ſuch ſinfull pleaſures, they
take away witte, and vnderſtanding, grace,
and religion: they take away credit, riches,
and health; yea the comfort of ſoule and
body. It is a great curſe, and heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, to be giuen ouer to ſuch vile
and filthy luſts. And this Salomon confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
vpon wofull experience, ſaying, I
haue compaſſed about,<note place="margin">Eccle. 7. 27. 28. 29. 30.</note> both I &amp; my heart
to know and to enquire &amp; to ſearch wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and reaſon, and to know the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
of folly, and the fooliſhnes of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and I finde more bitter then death,
the woman whoſe heart is as nets and
ſnares, and her hands as bands: hee that is
good before God, ſhall be deliuered from
her, but the ſinner ſhall bee taken by her.
Behold (ſayth the Preacher) this haued
founde, ſeeking one by one to finde the
count: and yet my ſoule ſeeketh, but I find
it not: I haue found one man of a thouſand;
but a woman among them all, haue I not
found. His meaning is not to diſgrace good
women, but that women are eaſily drawne
to wickednes, and being wicked, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3274:155"/>
men in wickednes: and are of great
power to draw &amp; allure others to the ſame.
And that fewer women are good then men;
finally; he ſpeaketh vpon his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp; tryall, that he for his part amongſt
ſo many found none at all good; and this is
ſome teſtimony of his repentance: Theſe
words being ſpoken, and that booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
written (as ſome thinke, &amp; as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
after his grieuous fall: But wee
ſee by that place, that it is a token of Gods
anger, to bee giuen ouer to ſuch vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and it is a iuſt iudgement vpon our
prophaneſſe, neglect, &amp; contempt of Gods
ſeruice: and therefore the Apoſtle ſayth,
That becauſe men regarded not to know
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 28.</note> hee deliuereth them vp into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
minde, to doe thoſe things, which are
not conuenient: he gaue them vp to their
hearts luſts, and to vile affections. Becauſe
men are careleſſe in religion, &amp; of the true
honour of God: therefore the Lord giueth
them ouer, to ſuch filthy and odious ſinnes,
to their vtter diſhonour and ſhame in life,
and death, and after death: ſo that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall
of ſuch (though they haue beene of
neuer ſo high account in the world) is but
vile, rotten, and curſed. Therefore let vs
hearken to that bleſſed Exhortation of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3274:156"/>
Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note> ſaying: Dearely beloued, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you as ſtrangers and pilgrimes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayne
from fleſhly luſtes, which fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſoule. And let vs not forget thoſe
words of another Apoſtle:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15. 16. 17 18. &amp;c.</note> Know yee not
(ſaith hee) that your bodies are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt? ſhall we then take the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Chriſt, &amp; make them the members
of an harlot? God forbid. Doe yee not
know, that hee which coupleth himſelfe
with an harlot is one body: for two (ſaith
he) ſhalbe one fleſh; but he which is ioyned
to the Lord is one ſpirit. Fly fornication: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ſin that a man doth, is without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
but he that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth fornication, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
againſt his owne body. Know yee not
that your body is the temple of the holy
Ghoſt which is in you, whom yee haue of
God? and ye are not your owne, for ye are
bought with a price. Therfore glorifie God
in your body and in your ſpirit; for they are
Gods. Another ſin which we are to auoide,
and which was Salomons ſinne, is Idolatry.
It is ſaide (as we haue heard) that he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with Idolatrous women: that for the
loue of them, he built high places, hee
wrought wickedneſſe in the ſight of the
Lord, &amp; continued not to follow the Lord
as did Dauid his father: &amp; that his hart was
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3274:156"/>
not perfect with the Lord his God. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his ſinne was, that hee matched
with Idolatrous wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
law of God: And therefore it was ſin
ſo to match. We are to auoide all vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſociety, &amp; familiarity with the wicked:
&amp; therfore Iehoſephet is reproued,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 19. 2.</note> becauſe
he helped the wicked, &amp; loued them that
hated the Lord: for he ioyned in the affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with Ahab, but the wrath of the Lord
came vpon him for it.<note place="margin">Pro. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9. 27.</note> Salomon ſaith, The
wicked man is an abhomination to the iuſt;
&amp; he that is vpright in his way, is an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the wicked. There can be no
ſound nor true friendſhip betwixt thoſe
that are diuers &amp; contrary in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14 15. 16.</note> Therfore, ſaith the Apoſtle, be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally
yoked with Infidels, for what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
hath righteouſnes with vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes?
&amp; what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion hath light with
darknes? what concord hath Chriſt with
Belial? what part hath the beleeuer with
the Infidell? and what agreement hath the
temple of God with Idols? The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
thus of his people, ſaying, Iuda
hath tranſgreſſed, &amp; abhomination is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Iſrael, and in Ieruſalem, for Iuda
hath defiled the holines of the Lord, which
he loued, &amp; hath maried the daughter of a
ſtrange god. The LORD will cut off the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3274:157"/>
man that doth this,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 11. 12.</note> both the maiſter &amp; the
ſeruant, out of the Tabernacle of Iacob
and him that offereth an offering to the
Lord of Hoaſts. Such curſed and croſſe
matches, was the cauſe that God deſtroyed
the firſt world with the generall flood: And
ſuch matches (at this day) are the cauſes of
prophaneneſſe, Athiſme, Popery, and much
wickedneſſe. For what comfort or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
can they looke for, which haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to God in marying? But onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
pleaſures, and riches. The example of
Salomon is fearefull, that ſo great &amp; wiſe a
man, of extraordinary gifts and graces, is
allured and drawne to Idolatry, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
with the loue of heatheniſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
And yet (it may be, and it is likely)
that Salomon himſelfe did not worſhippe
thoſe Idols, or thinke them to be gods, or
that there were any diuine power in them:
neither did he bring them into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor commaund any to worſhip them;
but this was his fault, that hee did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
the worſhipping of them, but graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ſuffered ſuch Idolatry, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his women: So that he fell, as Adam
fell; who did eate of the forbidden tree,
not becauſe that he thought thereby to be
like vnto GOD, or wiſer then hee was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3274:157"/>
made: but leaſt he ſhould offend his wiſe,
ſo that hee preferred the loue and good
will of a woman before the word of his
God. So Aaron knewe well enough, that
there was no Godhead nor diuine power
in the golden Calfe; yet fearing leaſt the
people ſhould ſtone him, he yeelded to
their furie, he made an Idoll, and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the feaſt of it. In like manner, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
knowing Idols to be nothing, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouercome with the flattring intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of wicked women, he graunted to
them diuers kindes of Idolatrie. It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for any Prince, to ſuffer and tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
any Idolatrous worſhip, for the loue
or fauour of any, be they neuer ſo neere or
deare vnto them. Nay, we muſt all learne
generally, not to harken to the voyce of
our deareſt friend, though it be our owne
lawfull wiues, if they goe about to drawe
vs to any kind of ſinne whatſoeuer. This
was the cauſe of Adams fall (as we heard
euen now) This was the cauſe of that ruine
of Ahab, and his houſe: becauſe he hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the voyce of his wife Ieſabell, and
being perſwaded by her, moſt vniuſtly
tooke away Naboths vineyard, and alſo
moſt cruelly tooke his life away from him.

to ſinne againſt God, or offend his diuine
Maieſtie; our loue to him ſhould bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then to any mortall creature whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
The Heathen could ſay, <hi>Amicus Plato,
amicus Socrates, ſed maior amica veritas:</hi>
Plato is my friend, Socrates my friend, but
truth is a greater friend. So may wee ſay,
Our fathers, our mothers, our brothers
and ſiſters, our wiues &amp; children, are neere
and deare friends vnto vs: but yet Chriſt
is our greateſt and beſt friend; he hath done
and can do moſt for vs: And therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould draw vs from his loue. And
touching Idolatrie, it is moſt odious and
abhominable in the eyes of God. It is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
whoring from God. A denying and
forſaking of his Maieſtie; it hath beene the
ruine of many Nations and Kingdomes.
And therefore in no caſe to bee ſuffered
nor tollerated for the loue of any.<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 25.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord ſaith to his people; The gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Images of their gods, yee ſhall burne

that is on them, nor take it vnto thee, leaſt
thou be ſnared therewith: For it is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
before the Lord thy God.
Bring not abhomination into thy houſe,
leaſt thou bee accurſed like it: But vtterly
abhorre it, and count it moſt abhominable.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3274:159"/>
And in another place, we are forbidden to
hearken to the Prophet that doth perſwade
vs to goe after other gods, and that ſuch a
one being conuicted and condemned by
the Iudge,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. 8.</note> is to die the death. Nay, though
it bee our ſonne, or daughter, or wife, or
brother, wee muſt not conſent to him, nor
pittie him, nor ſhew him mercy: but thou
ſhalt kill him (ſayeth the Lord) thy hand
ſhall bee firſt vpon him to put him to death;
and then the hands of all the people. And
this is the direct law of God: Hee that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
to any gods ſaue the Lord onely
ſhall bee ſlayne. There muſt bee then no
ſufferance at all of any kinde of Idolatrie.
This was Salomons ſinne, and therefore
it is ſayde that his heart was not perfect
with God, as the heart of his father Dauid
was: For howſoeuer hee ſinned in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and murther, and in numbering the
people: yet he repented preſently, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
did the like againe; and he had alwaies
this ſinceritie and perfection of heart, that
he neuer defiled himſelfe with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;
neither did hee ſuffer the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe

that he tooke away all the abhominations,
out of all the countries that perteyned to

that were found in Iſrael, and compelled all
that were found in Iſrael, to ſerue the Lord
their God. This bleſſed King, a worthie
preſident of full and perfect reformation,
he tooke away not onely groſſe Idolatrie,
but all Reliques and remnants, all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
prouocations, appearances &amp; ſhewes
of Idolatrie. One thing more, very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
and pertinent, wee are to learne
by Salomons fall: namely, Not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
though we doe ſee Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
learned Preachers, and great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
men of gifts aboue others, to be

ſinnes: wee are indeede to be grieued,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3274:161"/>
and much to lament, when wee ſee or
heare ſuch things: but yet wee muſt not
bee diſcouraged in our profeſſion, and in
the trueth of religion. Men of greateſt
gifts, haue beene ſubiect to great ſinnes:
As Adam Noah, Lot, Abraham, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Aaron, Dauid, Sampſon, and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Sathan doth moſt enuie ſuch, hee
ſtandeth at the right hand of Iehoſua: Hee
will winnow and ſifte (to the very branne)
the Apoſtles of CHRIST, as hee himſelfe
warneth them. Indeede the bad liues of
Preachers and profeſſors, are ſcandalous
and offenſiue; and hinder many in the way
of ſaluation; and maketh the worde and
profeſſion ill ſpoken of by many; yea loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed

by workes then by word. The houſe
and conuerſation of a Preacher is ſet on a
hill, all ſee it and looke vpon it; it is as it
were a guide and teacher to others; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
hee doth, others thinke that they
may doe the like: that word is willingly
receiued of the hearer, which is vttered
from the Preacher with compaſſion of
minde. He hath learned to ſpeake truely,
that hath firſt learned to doe well. And
then doth the ſeede of the word bring
forth fruite, when the pietie of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

others; wee muſt firſt come to God our

This law is layde vpon the Preachers, that
they lighten them by liuing, which they are
carefull to perſwade by ſpeaking. For the
authoritie and power of ſpeaking is loſt,
when the voyce is not helped by worke.
No man can ſtand in the valley and ſpeake
from the mount:<note place="margin">Chryſ. ſup. Mat. 5.</note> Where thou ſtandeſt, from

If thou wilt not doe righteouſneſſe,
why doeſt thou make thy ſelfe a teacher of

a maiſter of that, whereof thy ſelfe will be
no ſcholler, nor Diſciple? Finally, there be
three kindes of negligent Prelates:<note place="margin">Hugo.</note> Some
who liue well, and ſuffer their people to
liue ill. Some who liue ill, &amp; compell their
people to liue well. Some who liue ill,
&amp; will haue their people to liue ill: Thoſe
which liue wel, &amp; ſuffer their people to liue
ill: they goe before them in example; but
they doe ſinne becauſe they reproue not
their errors. Though they liue well: yet
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3274:163"/>
they muſt of neceſſitie giue account of the
flocke committed to them, to the Lord of
the flocke. Thoſe which liue ill, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
their people to liue well: They do call
thoſe that goe aſtray, but they kill thoſe
which are rightly ſtrong: They call by
words, they kill by examples. Of the third
ſorte we are not to ſpeak at all. But though
this be true, that the ſinnes of Preachers
and profeſſors bee thus offenſiue to other,
and hurtfull to themſelues: yet neyther
preaching nor profeſſion is to be caſt off or
condemned. Phiſitions (oftentimes) liue
contrary to their owne rules: and Lawyers
liue lawleſſe: And yet both Phiſicke and
Law is good. A warrant from the King
is not to bee deſpiſed, though the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
bee naught. In all profeſſions, and
callings, ſome are good and ſome bad.
The callings are not to bee condemned,
becauſe of the badneſſe of them which
are in them: All fleſhe is graſſe, and
the glorie thereof like the flower of the
fielde: All men are ſubiect to ſinne and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but the word of the Lord abideth for
euer. It is pure, holy, iuſte, and good:
though thoſe which profeſſe and teach it,
be neuer ſo bad: Gold is not the worſe,
though a Thiefe handle it, no more
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3274:163"/>
is the word of the Lord (which is more
pure then gold, being ſeuen times tried in
the fire) though wicked men profeſſe and
teach it. This is the counſell of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat: 23. 2. 3.</note> ſaying; The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

ſaith one vpon that place, he that
doth euill, doth iniurie to the ſeate. Sitting
in iudgement, if thou liue well, and teach
well, thou ſhalt be iudge of all; If thou liue
ill, and teach well, thou ſhalt be iudge of
thy ſelfe onely? for by teaching well, thou
doeſt teach thy people how they ought to
liue; but by liuing ill, thou doſt teach God,
how he ought to condemne thee: If they
liue well (meaning the preachers) it is
their gaine: If they teach well, it is your
gaine (ſpeaking to the people). Take that
therefore which is yours, and trouble not
your ſelues about that which is an other
mans: for often there proceedeth good
doctrine from an euill man, euen as the
vile earth bringeth forth precious gold:
Is that precious gold contemned, becauſe
the earth is vile and baſe? euen therefore
as the gold is choſen, and the earth is left:
ſo receiue you the doctrine, and leaue the

Auguſtine ſpeaking of this example of
Salomon,<note place="margin">In Pſal: grad:</note> ſaith thus. If Salomon be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God, why are his writings of ſuch
authoritie in the Church? that wee may
know (ſaith he) that the words of God
are not therefore true, becauſe they were
ſpoken by Salomon; but becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from God by Salomon: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
therefore he wrote well, it muſt be
aſcribed to God; and as for his ſin, it muſt
be left to himſelfe. The ſame may be ſaid
of Balaam, who though he was an euill
man, yet he deliuered good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Oracles. Dauid ſinned grieuouſly:
yet his Pſalmes, are moſt bleſſed, diuine, &amp;
ſacred; ful of ſweet comforts and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
to be imbraced, beleeued, reuerenced,
and practiſed of all good men. Peter, his
fall was moſt greeuous, in denying his
maiſter; yet his ſermons, his doctrine and
writings, are in no caſe to be reiected, but
to be receiued and followed of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as holy, and canonicall ſcripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by the holy Ghoſt. Thus the falls of
the Saints are abuſed ſundrie waies; ſome
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3274:164"/>
men doe excuſe all their faults; ſome by
them take occaſion to diſgrace and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
the Saints: and ſome take occaſion
thereby, to practiſe the like ſinnes in
themſelues; but theſe are all deceiued and
doe erre foulely. For they are not written
to any ſuch purpoſe; but rather that we
may learne, and ſee the corruption of all
men by nature,<note place="margin">Ambr: in Luk:</note> and that we may know the
Saints were but men, and therefore not to
truſt in them, but in God. And this vſe
doth one make of this example of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that God ſuffered him to erre, leaſt
we ſhould erre. Many things are written
(ſpecially in the Pſalmes) of Chriſt in the
perſon of Salomon: Now we might take
thoſe things, to be ſpoken altogether of
Salomon himſelfe, but that we ſee, he hath
ſo grieuouſly fallen; whereupon we are
conſtrained, to paſſe thoſe excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
from Salomon to the Meſſias: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we are admoniſhed in the ſcriptures,
that Chriſt knew no ſinne; and we ſee that
Salomon ſinned ſo hainouſly, we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
thereby, that Salomon was not
the Meſſias. And by ſuch examples, the
mercy of God is made manifeſt, to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſinners: And they may gather comfort
from thence, that if they haue the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3274:165"/>
they ſhall haue the like fauour &amp;
mercy:<note place="margin">Greg: in Hom:</note> And therefore (ſaith one) I conſider

            <p>WE haue heard the reioycing and
thankſgiuing of this woman, for
the Raigne of Salomon, and ſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe ſawe the loue of God, both to
Salomon and to Iſrael, in placing ſuch a
King: We haue heard the happines of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
the great and extraordinarie gifts
of God beſtowed vpon him, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
ſignes of Gods fauour towards him,
and that God by his owne mouth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
and by a ſpeciall name giuen to Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
profeſſeth his loue towards him. And
therefore howſoeuer he fell, moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly,
and therefore deſerued no loue, but
rather hatred, and to be caſt off for euer:
yet no doubt, but God did loue him ſtill,
and in time brought him to repentance
and ſaluation. Now let vs from theſe
words, of this bleſſed woman (ſeeing
Gods loue in placing Salomon) let vs (I
ſay) learne and obſerue from hence, that a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3274:166"/>
good King, is a rare, and a ſpeciall gift of
God, and a token of his loue to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For it is ſaid here, Becauſe God loued
Iſrael to eſtabliſh it for euer: therefore he
made Salomon King ouer them. When
God meanes to bleſſe a land, and to doe
any good vnto it, he giueth it good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
when he meaneth to correct and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
a people, he ſendeth wicked men to
Raigne ouer them. So that it is God that
giueth Kings, ſometimes in loue, ſometime
in anger.<note place="margin">Eſa: 3. 2. 4.</note> He threatneth to take away the

Woe to thee ô land, when thy King is a

that is,<note place="margin">Eccle: 10. 16. 17.</note> when they are without wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

that in his daies the righteous ſhould flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:

redeeming their ſoules from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite

from all wrong. Behold then, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
the benefite and comfort of a good
King: He is a father, a paſtor, a nurce, to
the Church, and common-wealth; He is
as a wall, and prop, to ſtay vp the tender
boughes of the vine. He is like the ſhadow
of a great tree, refreſhing his ſubiects; He
is as it were a common ſoule to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whereby the body of the Church and
common-wealth is ſtayed and vpholden:
And as the ſunne is to the planets, and
the planets to the ſtarres; ſo is the King
with his counſell, iudges and magiſtrates,
to the common-wealth; From thence it
hath life, comfort, and light. A good King
is much more excellent and better, then
a good ſubiect: His goodnes more large,
moreample, &amp; profitable, then the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of others. As much difference as there
is betwixt a priuate familie, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
betwixt one houſe and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
betwixt a litle riuer and the ſea: ſo
much difference there is, betwixt a good

and openly.</p>
            <p>The neceſſitie and commoditie of kings,
may be ſeene in the vniuerſall order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The chiefe Philoſophers, Plato, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,
and Apollonious, did ſee and feele,
that as generally there is one chiefe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and maker of all things, and as among
the ſtarres, the ſunne beareth the chiefe
light; as among Bees, there is one chiefe
king; as the flockes and heards of beaſts
haue one guide and ruler; finally, as the
cranes doe follow one leader; So there
ought to be in a common-wealth one
king as head, by whom all the members
may conſent. And this reaſon of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
(declared by the inſtinct of
nature) God hath more euidently opened
in the holy ſcripture, and maketh mention
of kings, and doth approue and allowe
their authoritie with his owne mouth, as
we haue heard before; and the words of
this woman doth approue and teſtifie the
ſame. She bleſſeth God for this king, who
had ſet him in his owne throne. She ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
God the author of this kind
of gouernment: ſo that the authoritie of
kings is a ſacred and diuine ordinance.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:3274:169"/>
But it will be obiected: How is God the
author of this kind of gouernment? when
as Salomon was but the third King that
Iſrael had: they had no King at all before
Saul, who was a wicked King, giuen to
them not in loue, but in wrath, and that
at the vnlawfull and turbulent deſire of
the people: wherein they ſinned both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God and Samuel. For thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
That the Elders of Iſrael,<note place="margin">1. Sam: 8. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.</note> gathered
them together, and came to Samuel vnto
Ramath, and ſaide vnto him: Behold thou
art olde, and thy ſonnes walke not in thy
waies: make vs now a King to iudge vs
like all nations. But the thing diſpleaſed
Samuel (when they ſaid giue vs a King
to iudge vs) and Samuel prayed vnto the
Lord. And the Lord ſaide vnto Samuel:
Heare the voyce of the people in all that
they ſhall ſay vnto thee: for they haue
not caſt thee away, but they haue caſt
me away, that I ſhould not raigne ouer
them: As they haue euer done ſince I
brought them out of Egypt euen vnto
this day (and haue forſaken me, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
other gods) euen ſo doe they to thee.
Now therefore hearken vnto their voyce:
howbeit, yet teſtifie vnto them, and ſhew
them the manner of the king that ſhall
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:3274:169"/>
raigne ouer them. Behold heere are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
great and ſmall, affecting and deſiring
a king, hauing had none before: yet their
deſire is diſpleaſing to God and Samuel;
the reaſon is, why God miſliked their
petition, becauſe they did now caſt off
that forme of gouernment which God
himſelfe had ordained for them. They
aske that which would be hurtfull vnto
them, and that with an obſtinate and
bad minde.<note place="margin">Deut: 17. 14. 15.</note> But it will be obiected, that
they had a commandement and warrant
from God: who ſaid thus vnto the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
when thou ſhalt come into the
land, which the Lord thy God giueth
thee: and ſhalt poſſeſſe it, and dwell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
If thou ſay I will ſet a king ouer me,
like as all the nations that are about me,
then thou ſhalt make him ouer thee, whom
the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe; from among
thy brethren ſhalt thou make a King ouer
thee. Thou ſhalt not ſet a ſtranger ouer
thee, which is not thy brother. Behold
here the allowance of God, to chuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
a king; ſo he be not a ſtranger. And
whereas it is ſaid, the Lord ſhould chuſe
them a king; they come in this place to
him, that be would make choyce of a king
for them: how doe they then offend in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3274:170"/>
this their petition and deſire? Indeed their
deſire is not ſimplie euill of it ſelfe, for if
it were ſo, it might not haue beene graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but their deſire is not to this end,
to haue the word of God performed,
but to ſatisfie their owne humors. They
ſhould haue ſtayed Gods time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but they diſtruſt God, and are moſt
vnthankfull to Samuel, deſpiſing him in
his olde age; neither doe they aske a king
according to Gods appoyntment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
But let vs haue a king (ſay they)
as other nations haue, be he good or
bad. But yet if God would (as it fell
out after) giue them a king: why is he
angry with them for asking a king? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they did aske it with a bad minde,
offering ſome iniurie to Samuel: yet in
his ſecret will and purpoſe, his meaning
was to giue them a king: He diſliked in
this people, their diſtruſt and difficience:
who relied more vpon man, then God:
their bouldnes, in attempting, ſo raſhly
and ſuddenly to erect a new forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.
He miſliked the contempt of
his owne gouernment, in that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him their king, they ſought a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
king, after the example of other
nations, and ſo they were wearie of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3274:170"/>
Gods order. And yet, the gouernment
of kings doth not ſhut out the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, but God doth raigne by
kings, as well as he reigned by iudges.
The king is the miniſter of God, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
and deputie: he ſitteth in his place
and throne, and God is the author of
his office and authoritie, as we may ſee in
this place. And this forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath beene of many nations much
deſired.</p>
            <p>This principalitie or kingdome was firſt
begun (as it is thought) by the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who could liue no while without a
king. And we finde (in the booke of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which is moſt ancient) that the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
had their kings, one after an other.
And whereas in the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale, there hath beene (long ſince)
three ſortes or kindes of gouernments ſet
downe, the one <hi>Monarchie,</hi> an other <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratie</hi>
when the beſt gouerne; the third
<hi>Democrati,</hi> or popular ſtate, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people haue a ſtroake, in ruling the
publike weale. The firſt kinde of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is thought as good as any, if not the
beſt of all: For when counſell or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is in the power of one: In the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the common-wealth, all things are
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3274:171"/>
more eaſily performed. In the other two
kinds of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, one oftentimes ſaith
one thing, and others will not graunt it,
and they are not eaſily agreed: Heere one
hath a ſtroake, the preheminence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
of commaunding and graunting.
The whole world is ruled and gouerned
by one, and what can be better or more
wiſely gouerned? The gouernment by
Iudges, was not very ſtrong; but almoſt
voluntarie, and therefore more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible:
but in the gouernment of a king,
there is more maieſtie in their kingly
pompe, and glory, which is a more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and a wonder to the people, and is a
meanes to keepe them in better order and
ſubiection: The name of a king hath beene
alwaies famous, great, moſt glorious,
and ſacred, amongſt all nations of the
world: But ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this people: They egerly
deſired a king, and when they had him,
they would not receiue him, but many of
them deſpiſed him. And thus they dealt
with the Lord, many times before and
after this. They deſire deliuerance out of
Egypt, and when they are deliuered, they
deſire to returne thither againe They
deſire Manna from heauen, when they
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3274:171"/>
were in the wilderneſſe: when they had it,
being ſweete and heauenly food, they loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
it, and made light account of it. They
deſire to turne out of Babilon into their

people ſhouted &amp; ſayd, God ſaue the King.
And when Saul went home to Gibiah,
there followed him a band of men, whoſe
heart God had touched. Againe it may
be obiected: how is God the Author of the
calling and authority of Kings? how doe
they ſit in his throne? When many of them
are moſt wicked in life, and vniuſt, and
corrupt in gouerning; when all things are
full of confuſion and diſorder: but we are
to looke to the good wee haue of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3274:172"/>
And wee are to know, that both
bad Gouernours, and corruptions in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,
the ſinnes are not of God but
from themſelues. God doth neyther allow
nor commaund them, but forbid and deteſt
them. And yet there is ſome profit in bad
Magiſtrates: Many good lawes, and ſome
forme of iuſtice amongſt them. Wicked
Gouernours, are as plagues &amp; puniſhments
for the ſinnes of the people: Becauſe when
they are good, we receiue not that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
at the hand of God thankefully, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
our ſelues to his lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
but abuſe the goodneſſe of God
to our ſinfull and beaſtly luſts:<note place="margin">Tyndal.</note> Therefore
doeth God make a ſcourge of them, and
turne them to wilde beaſts (contrary to the
nature of their names) euen to Lions,

The childe, as long as he ſeeketh to auenge
himſelfe of the rod, hath an euill heart: for
he thinketh not that the correction is right,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3274:172"/>
or that hee hath deſerued it, neither repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
but reioyceth in his wickednes, and
ſo long ſhall hee neuer bee without a rod;
yea ſo long ſhall the rod bee made ſharper
and ſharper. If he acknowledge his faulte,
and take the correction meekely, and kiſſe
the rod, and amend with the learning and
nurture of his father and mother, then the
rod is taken away. So, if we reſiſt euill Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
ſeeking to ſet our ſelues at libertie, we
ſhall (no doubt) bring our ſelues into more
cruell bondage, and wrappe our ſelues into
much more miſerie &amp; wretchednes: For if
the heads is ouercome they will make their
yoakes ſorer. If the people ouercome the
Rulers, then make they away for a more
cruell nation, which hath no right to the
Crowne. If wee ſubmit our ſelues to the
chaſtening of God, and meekely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

and kiſſe the rod, &amp; amend our liues:
Then God will take the rod away: that is,
he will giue the Rulers a better heart; or if
they continue their malice, and perſecute
thee for well doing, hee will deliuer thee
out of their tyrannie. When Iſrael ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againſt GOD, hee gaue them vp

repented, hee ſent them deliuerance.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3274:173"/>
A Chriſtian man (in reſpect of God) is but
a paſſiue thing, a thing that ſuffereth onely,
and doeth nought; as the ſicke, in reſpect
of the Chirurgion or Phiſition doth ſuffer
onely. The Chirurgion ſlancheth, cutteth
out the dead fleſh, ſearcheth the wounds,
thruſteth in tents, burneth, ſeweth, ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and putteth coraſiues to draw out the
corruption; and laſt of all, layeth too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
playſters, and maketh whole. The
Phiſition giueth purgations and drinks to
driue out the diſeaſe, and then with reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues
bringeth health. Now if the ſicke
reſiſt the razor or ſearching yron, doth he
not reſiſte his owne health, and is the cauſe
of his owne death? So likewiſe is it of vs,
if we reſiſt euill rulers, which are the rods
and ſcourges, wherewith God chaſtiſeth
vs, the inſtruments wherewith God doth
ſearch our wounds, and bitter drinkes to
driue out ſinne, and coraſiues to draw out
by the roote the coare of the poxe of the
ſoule, that fretteth inward. Thus a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
receiueth all things at the hands of
God, both good and bad, both ſweete and
ſower, both wealth and woe: and he doth
take good Princes as a ſpeciall belſsing,
and bad Princes as a iuſt iudgement ſent
for ſinne. But it will bee obiected, That
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3274:173"/>
the Lord ſayth of ſome Rulers, that they
raigned not by him:<note place="margin">Hoſea. 8. 4.</note> They haue ſet vp a
King (ſaith hee) but not by me; they haue
made Princes and I knew it not. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that the people of Iſrael had ſet vp
Ieroboam, by whom they ſought their

Gods worde or will, but their owne
luſts and affections:) But wee muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

through their owne corruption: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoeuer is good in gouernment is
from God; and hee doth vſe the Diuell as

                  </gap>7.</note> It is ſayd by Daniel, that God
changeth the times and ſeaſons: He taketh
away Kings, and ſetteth vp Kings. And
Daniel ſaith thus, to the proud King Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadnezer:
O King, thou art a King of
Kings, and the God of heauen hath giuen
thee a Kingdome, power, ſtrength and
glorie. And when Pilate ſayde to Chriſt,
Knoweſt thou not that I haue power to
crucifie thee, &amp; haue power to looſe thee?
Ieſus anſwered, Thou couldeſt not haue
power at all againſt me, except it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
thee from aboue. But it may bee yet
obiected, That the authoritie and office of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3274:174"/>
Kings, is not of diuine inſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seeing
Saint Peter calleth it an ordinance of man,
and that place is abuſed by the Pope, to
the diſgracing of Chriſtian Princes. The
meaning is not, that the power of Princes
and Magiſtrates, is onely a deuiſe of man,
and onely from man; But as one ſaith. <hi>Eſt
ordinatio diuina, ſecundum ſubſtantium ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
humana, ſecundum modum ac finum:</hi> It is
a diuine ordinance, in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
and it is humane, in reſpect of the
manner and end. The office and power of
the King is from God: The maner of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and gouerning the common-wealth, is
in many things humane, and the end is for
the good and preſeruation of man: and ſo
are lawfull Paſtors, though their calling be
diuine; yet they are choſen, approued, and
ordeined, for the benefite of men. And thus
the Apoſtle defineth a High Prieſte: To
bee taken from among men, and is ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for men, in things perteyning to God:
And ſo is a King taken from among men,
ordeyned for men, in things pertayning
both to God &amp; men; That is, for the good
both of the Church and Common-wealth.
As for the Popes office and vſurped ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
it is meerely humane; nay it is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall,
and againſt the examples and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3274:174"/>
of holy Scripture. Hee hath no
true nor iuſt warrant, from the Law, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Euangeliſts, nor Apoſtolicall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
But of this, it may be wee ſhall
ſpeake more hereafter. It is ſufficiently
proued already, and it ſhall appeare more
plainely hereafter, that the office and
power of Princes is diuine &amp; ſacred. Now
becauſe ſome Kings are giuen of God to
his people in loue and mercy, and ſome in
wrath &amp; iudgement: Let them try them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
whether it may be ſayd of them, as
it is ſayde of Salomon in this place, That
God in loue to them, and in loue to his
people, hath ſet them in his owne throne.
Let them know then, that ſuch a King (as is
giuen of God in loue) is both qualified
with gifts fit for his calling, and will and
muſt neceſſarily performe the duty of his
place: as this Queene teſtifieth of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the words following. It is ſayd of
Dauid, that as hee was choſen from the
ſheepe-folds, to feede Gods people in Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,
and his inheritance in Iſrael:<note place="margin">Pſa. 78. 70.</note> ſo hee
fedde them according to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
of his heart, and guided them
by the diſcretion of his hands.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 8. 15.</note> And
it is ſayde of him (in another place)
that hee raigned ouer all ISRAEL,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3274:175"/>
and executed iudgement and iuſtice:<note place="margin">Pſa. 101. 1.</note> and
hee himſelfe proteſteth, that he gouerned
his Court, Church, and Common-wealth,
according to the true rules of mercy and
iudgement. And it is ſayde of Salomon,
that all Iſrael feared him; for they ſaw that
the wiſedome of God was in him to doe
iuſtice, and to performe faithfully the duty
of his place and calling. A learned writer
vpon that Pſalme 78. ſayeth, God did
chooſe Dauid to this end, that hee ſhould
feed his people; and therefore he fed them.
He choſe Saul to afflict his people, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he afflicted them. For marke what the
Lord ſayd to the people that would needes
haue a King; hee threatneth them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them that King in his wrath. This
(ſayth he) ſhall be the manner of the King
that ſhall raigne ouer you:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8. 10. 11. 12. 13. &amp;c.</note> Hee will take
your ſonnes, and appoynt them to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
and to bee his horſemen, and ſome
ſhall runne before his Chariot. Alſo hee
will make them as Captaynes ouer thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,
and Captaynes ouer fifties, and to
eare his ground, and to reape his harueſt,
and to make inſtruments of warre, and the
things that ſerue for his Chariots. He will
alſo take your daughters, and make them
Apothecaries, and Cookes, and Bakers.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:3274:175"/>
And hee will take your fields, and your
vineyards, and your beſt Oliue trees, and
giue them to his ſeruants. And he will take
the tenth of your ſeede, and of your vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
and giue it to his Eunuches and his
ſeruants. And he will take your men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
and your maide ſeruants, and the
chiefe of your young men, and your Aſſes,
and put them to his worke. Hee will take
the tenth of your ſheepe, and you ſhall be
his ſeruants: and you ſhall cry out at that
day, becauſe of your King, whom you haue
choſen you, and the Lord will not heare
you at that day. But it may be, ſome will
ſay, May Kings thus oppreſſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth?
no, they haue no ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
by their office: But this King was
ſent in wrath from God, to plague this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and therefore hee doth plague them.
Samuelthreatneth to that people, the demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
of thoſe liberties which the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
enioyed before vnder the Iudges He
admoniſheth them of the hard eſtate
which was to enſue. This was Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his iuſtice, for the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
For God is in heauen, hee may doe
whatſoeuer hee will; his wayes are all iuſt
and righteous. But as for Kings, they n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay
not doe what they liſt, they are bound to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3274:176"/>
the lawes of God, to the lawes of charitie,
equitie and righteouſneſſe. But thoſe
which are giuen in wrath, they ſhall vexe
and afflict the people. Chriſt ſayd to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Feede my ſheepe. It was ſayd to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
Deuoure, deſtroy, beate downe,
ſeduce the people, becauſe they receiue
not the loue of truth, that they might bee
ſaued: Therefore he deſtroyeth, ſeduceth,
and deceiueth as many as hee can. The
Lord threatneth in Zacharie:<note place="margin">Zac. 11. 16.</note> I will raiſe
vp a ſhepheard in the Land, which ſhall
not looke for the thing which is loſt, nor
ſeeke the tender lambes, nor heale that
which is hurt, nor feede that which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vp: he ſhall eate the fleſh of the fat,
and teare their clawes in peeces. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Chriſt ſayth, That a thiefe, commeth
to ſteale, kill, and deſtroy. So that by
their deedes. practiſes, and fruites, both
of Princes and Miniſters, it may bee eaſily
gathered, whether they bee ſent to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in loue or wrath. But of the dutie of
ſuch Gouernours as are giuen in loue, wee
ſhall ſpeake hereafter. Now as the dignitie
of Kings appeareth, in that their calling is
ſo diuine, and from God himſelfe: ſo in
this alſo, that they are in his place and
throne, and haue ſo many honourable titles
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3274:176"/>
giuen vnto them in the Scripture. They are
called nurcing fathers and mothers, ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
of the people, leaders, keepers,
helpers, Gouernours; yea, in ſome ſenſe
Sauiours; and God doth giue them his
owne name, counting them gods: not by
nature; for ſo they are men like other men,
borne and conceiued as other, and ſhall
dye like men: But they are gods by office,
they are the Vicegerents and Images of
God. This is a great honour, great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
and dignitie, to be admired and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced
of all men. Yet let mee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
you, that the ſame, or the like titles
and dignities may be applyed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Miniſters of God; though they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
and taken by moſt men, as vile,
baſe, contemptible, and the very off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the world: And many which doe
magnifie, and almoſt adore great perſons,
Gouernours, and Magiſtrates (it may bee
for feare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſie, ſcorne, contemne, and
diſgrace the calling of the Miniſters, as
much as they can. But let them know,
that there is ſome likenes and affinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the calling of a Magiſtrate, and the
calling of the Miniſter. As good Princes are
the bleſſings of God, ſo are good miniſters;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3274:177"/>
as we haue heard before, when wee intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of true wiſedome. As the calling of the
Magiſtrate is ſacred and diuine, ſo is the
calling of the Miniſter; it is the holy Ghoſt
that appoynted Ouer-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eers in the Church;
and it is Ieſus Chriſt that giueth gifts to
men, to become Paſtors and teachers in the
Church. Thoſe glorious titles (before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of) they belong alſo to the Miniſters of
God: They are paſtors, fathers, nurces,
and in Gods ſtead. Magiſtrates are to be
honoured; ſuch as rule well in word and
doctrine are worthie of double honour.
The ſame is the end of both their callings,
to ſuppreſſe and beate downe ſinne: But
our power is ſpirituall, therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
euen the power of God to ſaluation;
power to conuert ſoules, to beate downe
Sathan and ſinne, and to bring into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
euery thought that doth rayſe it ſelfe
againſt God. By the Magiſtrates care, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
and power, wee liue in peace, and are
defended from forren &amp; domeſticall foes.
By the miniſterie of the word, the ſword
of the ſpirit, wee are armed againſt our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
enemies, and enioy true peace of
conſcience: And therefore the miniſterie
of the word is truely called, the ſtreugth
and life of a land. When Eliſhai ſaw Eliah
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3274:177"/>
taken vp into heauen, he cryed, My father,
my father, the Chariot of Iſrael, and the
horſemen thereof. It is ſinne that weakens
a land, it is religion and pietie that maketh
it ſtrong. By the preaching of the word
ſinne is weakned, and all vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is increaſed &amp; confirmed. The want of
this word, is the famiſhing of mens ſoules:
the plentie of this word, is the life of their
ſoules. Magiſtrates are keepers and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayners
of both the tables of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
and ſo are all faithfull Miniſters.
Magiſtrates are to execute outward pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
vpon offenders. Miniſters haue
power to reproue, to binde, and exclude
notorious offenders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our bodies, goods
&amp; liues, are ſubiect to Princes; but al power,
worſhippe, and maieſtie, are ſubiect ſo the
word which wee preach: And as they are
rebels to Princes which reſiſt their power,
ſo are they rebels to God, which ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
againſt the doctrine, counſels,
and exhortations of his faithfull Miniſters.
And finally, as good Magiſtrates doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and encourage good ſubiects, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
honours and countenance; ſo good
Miniſters are carefull by all means poſſible
to comfort good Chriſtians by the ſweete
promiſes and mercies of God, and by the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3274:178"/>
aſſurance of remiſſion of ſinnes and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.
Seeing therefore there is ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
both in the titles and callings of
Magiſtrates and Miniſters, there ſhould be
alſo an agreement and vnion in affection
betwixt them. They are intirely to affect
and loue one another. The Miniſters are
to guide and direct the Rulers by the
word, and they againe are to defend them
by the ſword. This the Lord teacheth,
when hee appoynted two brethren to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
his people, Moſes and Aaron, the
one to gouerne, the other to teach. It
went well with Saul, ſo long as he hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Samuel the Prophet. Dauid had
Gad and Nathan neere vnto him, as his
faithfull Counſellers. Hezekiah the King,
was directed by Eſaiah the Prophet. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Magiſtrates are to countenance good
Miniſters, and to encourage them. Wee
teach and perſwade all men to obey the
higher powers. We pray for you publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and priuately, and ſtirre vp others to
doe the like. Wee ſet foorth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of your callings: We threaten dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to rebels and traytors. As for our
calling, although diuine and ſacred, yet
odious and contemptible to the worlde,
becauſe wee reproue the ſinnes of all men:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3274:178"/>
we endure many hard ſpeeches, vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and iniuries of wicked men: the eyes
of many, their eares, hearts and mouthes
are open againſt vs. Wee are ſubiect to
many temptations and infirmities. Wee
haue many diſcomforts and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Who is to comfort, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and defend vs, but the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates?
And you muſt not bee offended
though we ſometimes iuſtlie reproue your
opon ſinnes, in open place. It is our office
to reproue ſinne in all; as it is your dutie
to puniſh ſinne in all. As you muſt not be
partiall, and not haue reſpect of perſons
in iudgement; ſo we muſt not be partiall
in reproouing. We doe it (God, knoweth)
in dutie, loue and conſcience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you are to take it in good part. All
holy men, though they were Kings and
Princes, haue beene content patiently to
receiue iuſt reproofe: And the ſinnes of
Magiſtrates and great perſons doe moſt
hurt of all other; and therefore moſt of all
to be reprooued. If wee be careleſſe and
idle in our place; If we be flatterers &amp; time
ſeruers. If we be corrupt &amp; falſe in our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine;
If we be wicked and diſſolute in life;
Let vs bee cenſured according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.
But if our care be to do good, to take
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3274:179"/>
what paynes we can in our places, to winne
foules, to beate downe ſinne and Poperie,
to liue honeſtly, and keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in all things: If neyther our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
nor life can bee iuſtly touched, why
ſhould you be ſtrange vnto vs? why ſhould
you keepe backe from vs your fauour, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
and countenance?</p>
            <p>It is the chiefe end of the office and
calling of a good Magiſtrate, to defend
and countenance all good and honeſt men,
much more the faithfull and paynefull
Miniſters of God.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing Magiſtrates and Miniſters
haue the ſame authour, the ſame names
and dignitie, let them ioyne together
for the beating downe of ſinne, and bee
helpers and comforters one to another;
and let the higheſt of all remember,
ſpecially thoſe which make ſmall account
of our calling; let them remember and
lay vp in their hearts theſe worthie places
of Scripture. Remember that caueat
which GOD giueth to his people:<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 19.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that thou forſake not the Leuite
as long as thou liueſt vpon the earth.
And againe:<note place="margin">Pſa. 10. 15.</note> Touch not mine annointed,

was ſpoken euen to Kings and Princes,

to their rebuke and ſhame. And neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

ſerue, to humble good magiſtrates, both
in the ſight of God and men; to remember
in what low and baſe aſtate they haue
beene heretofore, though they be now
aduanced.<note place="margin">Gen: 32. 10.</note> They may ſay to God in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie

not many truly ſay, that though they be

gouernours and rulers of others, yet they
haue beene ſubiect to thoſe whom they
gouerne. Nay the greatnes of their place,
the honor and dignitie that they are in,
ſhould not make them proud: for if they
looke well to the great and manifold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
required, they ſhall haue no cauſe to
be lifted vp, but rather to be humbled
and caſt downe: they are not called to the

in luxurie and licenſiouſnes, but
faithfully and carefully to performe all
the duties which God requireth of good
gouernours in holie ſcripture: to gouerne
well, is a matter of great difficultie, care,
labour, and danger: many times in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
men, they diſpleaſe God; and in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God, they diſpleaſe men; ſo that they
can hardly ſo behaue themſelues, but that
they ſhall diſpleaſe the one or the other:
What wiſedome, humane and diuine, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in good gouernors, or elſe they
muſt ſee with other mens eies, he muſt
ſpeake with other mens tongues, and they
muſt be wiſe by other mens heads: go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
without true wiſedome, are like
a ſhip without an anker, like birdes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
winges. A wiſe gouernour is like ſalt
to ſeaſon others, he is as the eie and the
heart of the people. What courage and
magnanimitie is required in good rulers,
for the ſuppreſſing of the rebellious and
wicked, and for doing of iuſtice without
partialitie? and what care, diligence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
labour, and toyle, for the right
gouernment of ſo many, and ſo many ſorts
of men. The heathen could ſay, that the

deed ſaith one, it ſeemeth to me, that it is
the art of all artes, the diſcipline of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines,
to gouerne man, which of all

diuers in will. An other ſaith, that to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne,
is not onely a dignitie, but an art;
yea the greateſt of all other: for if they
rule ouer other things which are without
man, the skill and the cunning is better
then all the things themſelues: how much
more is the gouernment ouer men moſt
excellent, ſeeing that men doe excell all
other things? There are diuers kindes of
artes, one excelling an other, there is the
art and skill of husbandrie, of carpentrie
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3274:183"/>
and building,<note place="margin">Chry: in 2. Cor. 7.</note> which are very neceſſaire,
and doe ſerue for the helpe and conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this life: there be other artes, which

is moſt neceſſarie, which God
himſelfe ordained and commaunded ſo
ſoone as he had made man: for it is poſſible
for a man to liue without moſt of the other
arts, but without husbandrie it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to liue; without it, all the reſt are to no
purpoſe; yet kings doe gouerne husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and there is ſome likenes betweene
husbandrie and gouernment: the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is a ſetter of plants, ſome he proyneth,
ſome he cheriſheth, and cauſeth to growe:
ſome he cutteth downe and pulleth vp by
the rootes: good gouernours are like hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen;
by husbandrie, the badnes of
the earth, &amp; the wildnes of the plants are
made better: by weedes, the plantes and
ſeedes are hidden &amp; choakt; but the good
husbandman, is carefull to plucke them
vp: ſo by good lawes men are made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the wicked which hinder &amp; hurt
others, are reſtrained &amp; ſuppreſſed: and as
husbandmen haue many things to hinder
their planting and ſowing, as wild beaſts,
tempeſts, haile, floods, drought, ſo haue
gouernours hinderances and enemies to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3274:184"/>
their gouernment, which they will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
auoyde as well as they can. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of husbandrie, as it ſetteth out the
neceſſitie and excellencie of gouernment,
ſo it ſheweth the great care and labour
that is ioyned with it: for who is more
carefull and painefull then the husband
man? let therefore magiſtrates be humbled
in conſideration of the vertues and duties
of their great calling: and yet for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humiliation, let them remember
their owne infirmities and wants to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
their dutie as they ought. Let them
remember that they are ſubiect to the
temptations of the diuell, of the fleſh, and
the world: and let them knowe, that they
are ſubiect to the common miſeries of
this life, and to other miſeries and croſſes,
incident and peculiar to their calling: and
let them in no caſe forget, that they muſt
giue account to the great Iudge and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
of all the world, how they haue
behaued themſelues in their places and
callings: It ſhall be ſaid to them, to euery
one of them, Come, giue account of thy

they muſt knowe, that they cannot tell
how long they ſhall enioy thoſe places of

honour and dignitie, being ſubiect to
death as well as others; and they cannot
tell how ſoone they may be taken away.
Agathon had wont to ſay, that a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
muſt alway remember theſe three
things. Firſt, that he ruleth men; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he muſt rule according to lawes;
and thirdly, that he ſhall not alwaies
rule. The conſideration of this latter
poynt of the ſhortnes and vncertaintie
of this life, that we muſt certainely die,
and we knowe not how ſoone, is able to
humble, the mightieſt potentate in the
earth. The higheſt of them all may ſay, I

ſaith in an other place, after the death

man fallen this day in Iſrael. But bleſſed
be God, who is ſtill more mercifull to

yet let vs not forget that heauie

that is the true vſe of all iudgements:
and let vs learne to depend wholy and

man.<note place="margin">Pſal: 146. 3.</note> Remembring that counſell of
Dauid, put not your truſt in Princes,
nor in the ſonne of man, for there is

the God of Iacob for his helpe, whoſe
hope is in the Lord his God which made
heauen and earth, the ſea 'and all that
therein is, which keepeth his fidelitie
for euer. And let this and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the death of great perſons, put
all in minde (though they be neuer ſo

children of men, of what ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſoeuer they be; And thus though
gouernours and magiſtrates take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by the dignitie of their places, yet
both this, and many other cauſes, may
moue, drawe, and induce them to true
humilitie. And now let vs drawe neerer
to the deſcription of the ſeuerall duties
required of Chriſtian gouernours, both
in this and in many other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Lord doth not onely in his

all chriſtianitie, but alſo the ſeuerall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of all ſtates, degrees, and callings, as
of fathers &amp; children, maiſters and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
husbands &amp; wiues, kings &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
wherein we may ſee the fulnes

and ſpeaking to all ſorts of men. Againe,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3274:187"/>
we learne this leſſon by it, that it is not
ſufficient for vs to performe the generall
duties of Chriſtianitie, but alſo the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
duties of our ſeuerall callings. And
we may ſee the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our natures,
that euery one is willing and readie to
heare the duties of other men, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and litle regarding what doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
and appertaine to themſelues. The
ſeruant is content to heare the dutie of
his maiſter, and the maiſter is content to
heare the dutie of his ſeruants; children
are content to heare the dutie of their
parents, and parents are content to heare
the duties of children. Husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to heare the duties of wiues, and
wiues are content to heare the duties of
husbands. Miniſters are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to heare
the duties of the people, and people are
content to heare the duties of miniſters.
Subiects are content to heare the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their Princes, and Princes are
willing to heare the duties of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
But fewe or none are ſo readie or
willing to-heare and learne their owne
duties. For redreſſe of this corruption,
let euery one ſay with the kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3274:187"/>
Dauid, I will heare what the Lord
will ſay concerning me. And of al other,
the ſcriptures doe often and plentifully
ſpeake of the duties of Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
in Exodus, in Deutrinomie, in
the Prouerbs of Salomon, in the Lawe,
in the Prophets, in the Goſpell; and
many preachers, many times, in many
places, vpon iuſt occaſion doe handle
this doctrine of the Magiſtrates, and
this is not ſuperfluous, becauſe it is a
matter of great importance: for if they
doe their duties, the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
flouriſheth: otherwiſe there
is decay and ruine. Againe, their office
is hard and difficult, much holines,
much wiſedome and faithfulnes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of them, their charge and burden
is great, they haue many hindrances and
enemies, they are ſubiect to many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
therefore they had neede of much
&amp; daily inſtruction, &amp; ſo much teaching,
&amp; ſo many ſermons, ſhalbe ſo many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
againſt them if they do not regard
&amp; follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to come to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good rulers, their firſt care muſt
be, that if they wil wel &amp; profitably rule
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3274:188"/>
others, they muſt firſt gouerne and rule
themſelues. The very heathen haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
thoſe the beſt Emperours and
rulers, which could rule their owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
they haue thought &amp; ſaid, that
we neede not ſo much feare our armed
enemies, as our owne deſires and luſtes:
that it is a farre greater worke to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our ſelues, then to ouercome our
enemies. And thus ſaith one very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly,
If thou wilt haue all things ſubiect

his Maieſtie to his gratious ſonne, of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memorie, ſaying; That hee is not
worthie to rule others, that cannot rule
himſelfe. Inordinate affections, more
dangerous and powerfull then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the body, thoſe are vanquiſhed
by ſpirituall power: this is the beſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie;
and ſuch bee truely noble. Baſe

Againe, Princes are tyed to God
in a double bond; Firſt, in that they are
men; Secondly, in that they are Rulers
of men: In pietie and thankfulnes they
are to goe before others. The highnes
of their place aggrauateth their fault:
Their glorie is to ſhine before others.
He is better (ſaith Salomon) that ruleth
his owne minde, then he that winneth a
Citie. Such as winne Cities, ſpoyleth
and deſtroyeth: He that ruleth himſelfe,
doeth hurt and ſpoyle no man; he is at

wicked nature.<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 12.</note> It is abhomination to
Kings to commit wickedneſſe; for their

and loathſome are their ſinnes.<note place="margin">Hoſe. 4. 7.</note> As

I will change their glorie into

are fooliſh;<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 4. 5. &amp;c.</note> for they know not the way
of the Lord, nor the iudgement of their
God. I will get me to the great men,
and will ſpeake to them; for they haue
knowne the way of the Lord, and the
iudgement of their God: but thoſe
haue altogether broken the yoke and
burſt the bonds; wherefore a Lion out
of the forreſt ſhall ſlay them. Theſe
are moſt vnkinde to God, who doe thus
requite his kindneſſe, for their great
preferments and dignities. Magiſtrates
of all others muſt bee vnrebukeable, the
eyes of all are vpon them: A ſpot or
a mote in the ſun is ſooneſt ſpyed: their
good example doth much good; if they
fall, others follow; they leade others to
hell. It is a ſtaine to their place, to their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3274:189"/>
dignitie &amp; titles, to be ſtained or tainted
with any groſſe ſinne: They are called
gods; and therefore they muſt bee like
God in hating ſin; they muſt be like God
in holineſſe &amp; righteouſnes. Rulers muſt
out go the people, not in pleaſure &amp; luſt,
but in temperance, in vertue, &amp; magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitie.
It is the ſaying of the heathen;
He is not worthie to gouerne, that is no
better, neither hath moe vertues then
they which he gouernes: they are to be
firſt doers of that which they command:
they muſt leade the way to vertue, and
practiſe that which they command. It is
written of Lycurgus, that he ſet downe
no law, whereof hee himſelfe had not
ſhewed an example and practiſe in his
owne perſon. Ageſelaus would be the
firſt doer of that he commanded others
to do. Sinnes of great men are examples
&amp; priuiledges to others: whatſoeuer they
do, they ſeeme to command. As a great
branch cut from a tree, bringeth downe
many ſmall ones with it: And as when a
great Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth forth of his palace, a
multitude follow him: ſo doe ſubiects
ordinarily follow the examples of their
gouernours good or bad: yea the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3274:190"/>
in ſubiects to pleaſe Princes, and to
immitate their actions, is of more force
then lawes &amp; puniſhments: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
true is that ſaying of a heathen man;
That Magiſtrates, in matters of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and vice, doe not onely conceiue
it, but ſpread it, and as it were, water
their ſubiects with it. And againe, wilt
thou haue thy ſubiects good? bee thou
good: The Prince by well doing tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the ſubiects to do well. Examples
of Princes neuer reſt where they begin,
but doe breake foorth, and ſcatter farre
and neere, the world noteth their words
and deedes; neither can they be hidde
more then the beames in the ſunne.
Good Rulers are to puniſh all ſinnes in
others; and how can they do this, if they
be guiltie of the ſame, or of greater, or
more grieuous ſinnes? And what a
a ſhame is it to be called Rulers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
and yet to be ſeruants and
ſlaues to ſinne? yea, to as many ſinnes as
doe rule and raigne in them? Diogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
had wont to ſay, that harlots were
as Rulers, and Queenes to Kings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they might commaund what they
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:3274:190"/>
would; and that they would denie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them as they did to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
Of this there is example in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,
who graunted to Herodias,<note place="margin">Mat. 14.</note> a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
dauncing Damſell, halfe of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Rulers are often carried away
with the conceit of their dignitie, as
though they had a priuiledge to doe as
they liſt; and they haue flatterers about
them, which will ſoothe them, and ſet
them on in this conceit. Monſtrous was
the ſaying of the Stepmother of Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
Caracalla; for when hee was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with her beautie, that hee deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to marry her, and ſighed and ſayd,
<hi>O ſi liceret,</hi> O that it were lawfull: She
ſhamefully anſwered, <hi>Si libet lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> If
thou liſt it is lawfull: for Princes doe
giue lawes, and not receiue lawes. A
moſt vntrue ſpeech in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the law of nature; as well confeſſed
Dioniſius, when his mother would haue
maried otherwiſe then became her age:
ſaying, Oh mother, the ciuill lawes of
man may bee changed and altered, but
the law of nature cannot bee changed.
Herodotus writeth; That Cambiſes,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3274:191"/>
King of Perſia, coueting to marry with
his ſiſter, asked his Counſellers whether
there were any law to permit the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to marry with the ſiſter. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
after deliberation, that they
could finde no ſuch law; but they found
a law, whereby it was permitted to the
King of Perſia to doe what he liſted. A
moſt wicked anſwer, when the queſtion
was of the law of nature. Oh vild flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and pernitious paraſites, the very
bane and poyſon of Kings and Rulers.
It is ſinne and wicked affections, which
are as rebels and traytors, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Rulers are firſt of all to ſubdue in
themſelues. <hi>Hoc opus hic labor eſt:</hi> This is
the greateſt worke, the greateſt labour,
cunning, victorie &amp; conqueſt. Sampſon
ouercame many of the cruell &amp; mightie
Philiſtims; yet was hee ouercome by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
luſt. Alexander conquered a great
part of the world; but yet he could not
conquer nor tame his owne drunkennes,
luſt and anger. Hercules ouercame and
tamed many monſters; but at laſt hee
became a ſeruant and ſlaue to Omphala:
of whom one writeth thus: Hercules
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3274:191"/>
(ſayth hee) famous for his vertue, and
counted as it were a god amongſt the
gods: but he defiled the world with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
luſts and vncleanneſſe. How could
there bee any diuine thing in him, that
was a ſeruant to his owne vices? and
thoſe things which hee did are not to be
counted diuine vertues: for what great
matter was it to ouercome a Lion or a
Beare, to kill wilde and fierce Horſes
with their rider?<note place="margin">Lactant. lib. pri. inſtit. Chap. 9.</note> Theſe are the works
of a ſtrong man, yet of a man; and thoſe
things which hee ouercame were fraile

by the ſtrength of man: But to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the minde, to ſuppreſſe wrath, it
is the part of the mightieſt man, which
he did not neyther could doe. He that

I account him moſt like to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
And hee onely is to bee iudged

and yet cannot rule themſelues. And let
them further know, that their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is no diſpenſation for ſinne; and that
God hath puniſhed great perſons for
ſuch faults as might ſeeme but ſmall in
our eyes; As you may ſee in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Elie and Dauid: and alſo in the
example of Heſekiah: God did grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie
puniſh them, the one for pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring

that ſaying, For all that are vnder thee,

By that which hath beene ſaid, and by the

do reigne not for themſelues, not for their

the good of others, for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
of the Church &amp; Common-wealth.
As the head careth for the body, the
ſheepheard for the ſheepe, the father for
the children: ſo muſt Magiſtrates chiefly
be carefull for the common good of their
people. The Heathen could ſay that wee

in euery priuate perſon, to ſeeke the

may, how much more is it required of
Kings, Magiſtrates and Miniſters, who are
not priuate, but publicke perſons? As the
Candle ſpendeth it ſelfe for the comfort

there muſt be no priuiledge, no immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no impunity, the greateſt and the
higheſt muſt be ſubiect to ſuch lawes, and
bee willing to performe them, as well as
the meaneſt, for ſuch Lawes are more
neceſſary then the walles in a Citty,
which are for beauty and defence; but a
Citty may ſtand without wals, it cannot
ſtand without Lawes, ſuch good Lawes
of equity and righteouſneſſe, they are
the very Life and Soule of a Citty or
Kingdome. To Lawes there muſt bee
ioyned of neceſſſity. Iudges and Officers,
which giue vigour and life to Lawes, the
Office of theſe is to doe Iudgement and
Iuſtice; that is, to know Cauſes and then
to pronounce ſentence accordingly, that
ſo euery man may haue right, this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Gods Office, they are in his place, &amp;
therefore to deale vprightly: Worthy is
that counſell of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Iudges in
his time,<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 16. 17.</note> ſaying: <hi>Heare the controuerſies
betweene you brethren, and iudge righteouſly
betweene euery man and his brother, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3274:203"/>
ſtranger that is with him; yee ſhall haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of perſons in iudgement, but ſhall heare
the ſmall as well as the great, yee ſhall not
feare the face of Man, for the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is GODS.</hi> The like counſell gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
good King <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> to his Iudges:
ſaying;<note place="margin">2. Chron. 19. 6. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed what yee doe, for yee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
not the iudgements of man, but of the
Lord, and hee will bee with you in the cauſe
and iudgement: Wherefore now let the feare of
the Lord be vpon you, take heed and do it, for
there is no iniquity with the Lord our God,
neither reſpect of perſones nor receiuing
rewards.</hi> And remember that counſells
<hi>Conſider the matter, conſult and giue ſentence:</hi>
Iudgement muſt proceed from the light
of reaſon, and not from Paſſion, both
parties muſt be heard, euery one muſt
haue freedome to ſpeake, that there may
bee true and vpright iudgement; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of Iuſtice are theſe, negligence,
and want of ſkill, vnneceſſarie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
delaies, deſire of gaine, reſpect of
friends and kindred, fooliſh pitty, and
ſometimes ſlauiſh feare; but all theſe and
ſuch like hinderances of Iuſtice, good
Magiſtrates muſt auoide and caſt off. To
Lawes and Iudgement there muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Execution, for what are Lawes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3274:203"/>
of Execution, but euen like bels without
clappers. Lawes are like vnto young
children and Infants, which are left deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
without parents, and yet haue porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and patrimony, but would ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it, or others would deceiue them of
it, except they haue faithfull Tutors and
Guardians to guide and protect them; ſo
haue Lawes need of faithfull Patrones
and Keepers, or elſe they will bee brought
into contempt, by the forgetfulneſſe,
negligence, and corruption of ſome, and
the malice of others. For what better is
it to haue Law-makers, and faithfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepreters
of the ſame, except they bee
carefully kept and defended. Therefore
due puniſhments to offenders, are to bee
iuſtly and rightly executed. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

is a miniſter of Iuſtice and Law,
the iudgements is the Lords and not his;
the impunity of the wicked is hurtfull to
themſelues, by this meanes they runne
into further ſinne, and they do encourage
others to do the like; it were better to
turne looſe, wilde Boares, Beares, and
Woulues, amongſt the people, then ſuch
peſtilent men, by the puniſhment of ſuch,
the Common-wealth and the Church, is
freed from the note of infamy, and it is
no ſmall honour to God. And by this, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others are terrified from ſinne, and are

yea, the danger of infection is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued

who deſcernes betwixt things vniuſt and

becauſe hee would haue theſe momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary

And this part of Iuſtice is for the credite
and honour of the Magiſtrate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith <hi>Salomon, Hee that ſaith to the

Therefore ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>To do

What kind of offenders, wee ought to
puniſh more ſeuerely, wee may haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Law of God, that thoſe
whom hee appointed to die ſhould not
bee ſpared, for wee muſt not make our
ſelues more mercifull then God is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
wilfull murther is death by the
Law of Princes, and it is death by the
Law of God. Yea, before the Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<note place="margin">Gen 9. 6.</note> it was ſaid to <hi>Noah: Who ſo ſheddeth
mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud bee ſhed,
for in the Image of God hath hee made him.</hi>
And in the Law Written,<note place="margin">Leui. 24.</note> He that killeth

               <hi>The man that committeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery

               <note place="margin">Deut. 22. 22.</note> 
               <hi>the Adulterer and the Adultereſſe ſhall
die the death.</hi> Theft was not ſo ſeuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
but they were to make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and reſtore foure-fold that which
they had ſtolne: Theft, in our age, is more
ſeuerely puniſhed, it is certaine that
Theft is a grieuous ſinne againſt the Law
of God, againſt Equity and Iuſtice; but I
ſee no reaſon, why the Theefe ſhall dye a
ſhamefull death, and the Whore-maiſter
eſcape with leſſer puniſhment, ſeeing
that <hi>Salomon</hi> compareth the Theefe and
the Whore-maiſter together, &amp; ſheweth
in diuers reſpects that Adultery is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more grieuous ſinne then Theft,
becauſe the Theefe may make reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 27. 30. 32.</note> and ſo can neuer the other. This is the
corruption of Nature, that men make
more account of money and goods, then
of religion or honeſty, and Adulterers
being ſpared, and left aliue many queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are rayſed and propounded, which
can hardly bee anſwered; Namely, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the innocent party, or nocent party
may marry, whether they may be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
againe or no. Let the Adulterer and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3274:207"/>
Adultereſſe, according to the Morall
Law of God, die the death, and then
theſe queſtions will bee idle and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.
And as Magiſtrates may puniſh
Murtherers, by the ſame reaſon they may
as well puniſh Heretickes, Idolatours,
falſe Prophets, for indeed theſe they
murther mens ſoules, they runne a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from God, and they rob him of his
honor. We heard partly before, that falſe
Prophets and Idolatours, were to die the
death, and wee haue examples of good
Kings and Rulers, which haue put ſuch
to death; and if the Magiſtrate bee the
keeper of both the Tables, then hee is to
puniſh the tranſgreſſion of the one as
well as the other; and if the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the firſt Table, bee more hainous
and grieuous then the tranſgreſſions of
the ſecond Table, there is no reaſon why
they ſhould bee leſſe, and more ſlightly
puniſhed. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the children of

when men are mad, they miſlike
force and chaſticement; but when they
come to their right minde, they are glad
that they are corrected for their good
&amp; recouery. Not euery one that ſpareth,
is a friend; nor euery one that ſmiteth, an
enemy: <hi>Better are the wounds of a friend,
then the kiſſes of an enemy.</hi> It is better to loue
with ſeuerity, then to deceiue with too
much lenity. He that bindeth a mad man,
and hee that raiſeth him vp that is in a
deadly ſleepe, he is troubleſome to both,
but he loueth both. God doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach, but puniſh. Let heretickes firſt
bee ouer-throwne and confuted; if that
will not ſerue, vſe religious ſeuerity. The
ſame Father ſaith; firſt I was of this mind,
that none were to be compelled to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

withall by the word, by diſputation, by

for this my Citty <hi>Hippo,</hi> being altogether
of <hi>Donatus</hi> ſide, was conuerted to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke
vnity, by the feare of Emperiall
Lawes. Princes and Gouernours are in
no caſe to ſuffer any hereticall or falſe
worſhip in their kingdomes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let them hearken to this counſell, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them by a learned man: Let Princes
(ſaith he) take heed, how they ſuffer any
wicked rites and ceremonies to Infidels,
within their Dominions. <hi>Salomon</hi> was
guilty of this fault, not that he compelled
any of his ſubiects to worſhip Idols, but
that he granted to his Wiues and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
being out-landiſh women, places
and altars, wherein they might worſhip
ſtrange Gods. But God was angry with
him, and requited him according to his
fall: for as he diuided Gods worſhip, ſo
God diuides his kingdome, giuing part of
it to his ſonne, and part of it to <hi>Ieroboam.</hi>
This fault of his did ſpread it ſelfe to the

other wicked Kings, had diuers wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3274:209"/>
and deteſtable worſhips at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
and were ſharply reproued of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
for them: And ſurely the Magiſtrate
cannot be but reproued and condemned,
when he ſuffereth Idolatry, ſeeing he hath
the ſword for the puniſhment of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
therefore it muſt be granted, that
either Idolatry is no ſinne, or elſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is to puniſh it as well as other
ſinnes. The Magiſtrate muſt bee carefull
to defend the Common-wealth, and to
prouide as much as may be, that no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
nor hurt come vnto it. But Idolatry is
the cauſe of famine, peſtilence, warres,
and other moſt grieuous iudgements, and
therefore in no caſe to be ſuffered, or tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated
in a Chriſtian kingdome, and all
ſuch tranſgreſſors of the firſt and ſecond
Commandement, and of the reſt of the
Commandements of the firſt table, are to
bee puniſhed, as well as the tranſgreſſors
of the Commandements of the ſecond
Table; and indeed falſe Prophets, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
Idolaters, Papiſts, Ieſuites, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
Priſts, do more hurt to a kingdome
then murtherers, adulterers, or theeues,
ſeducing, killing &amp; poyſoning the ſoules
of many thouſands; neither is it to bee
counted cruelty to cut off theſe and ſuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3274:210"/>
like offendors, ſeeing it is warranted by
the authority and commandement of
God himſelfe: It is not cruelty to cut off
the cruell, though they account it ſo; but
hee that ſmiteth and taketh away the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
in that they are euill, is the Miniſter of
God, and of the Law; therefore the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
doe not defile themſelues with
bloud, in puniſhing and executing wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
perſons: for they haue a warrant from
the Lord ſo to do, the Lord is with them,
and doth aſſiſt them; and ſuch executions
of notorious perſons, by the hand of the
Magiſtrate, is as a ſacrifice pleaſing to
God. And leaſt it ſhould be a trouble to
the Magiſtrates minde, or a corſie to his
conſcience, or any impairing to his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to deale ſo ſeuerely as may be thought
with ſuch offendors; the Lord himſelfe
doth comfort and encourage the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
for whereas he commandeth, that
wicked children curſing their parents,
ſhall dye the death; and likewiſe adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and other offendors, he addeth and
repeateth it often to the comfort of the
Magiſtrate, <hi>His bloud be vpon him;</hi> as if he
ſhould ſay, let not Iudges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
trouble themſelues at the death of
ſuch offendors, as though they were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3274:210"/>
guilty of their bloud: nay, their bloud is
vpon themſelues, they are guilty of their
owne bloud, they haue deſerued death,
and are worthy of it; they haue caſt away
themſelues, and haue iuſtly drawne vpon
themſelues ſuch grieuous puniſhments,
by their owne wickedneſſe and iuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts.
It is my commandement and will
that ſuch ſhall dye, and therefore I cleare
you as innocent and guiltleſſe; you are in
my place, you are my ſeruants and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and in this work of iuſtice you haue
done me faithfull ſeruice. But here may
be a queſtion propounded, whether Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Rulers may not remit and pardon
the faults of great offendors. To remit
iuſt puniſhments is againſt the direct law
of God, and procureth and draweth the
wrath of God vpon the Magiſtrate.<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 15.</note> 
               <hi>So be it.</hi> Againe, <hi>You ſhal not

thy neighbour iuſtly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 21. 12.</note> The Prophet ſaith, <hi>O
houſe of Dauid, execute iudgement in the

becauſe of the wickedneſſe of your workes.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:3274:211"/>
The Magiſtrate is the keeper of Iuſtice
he is to do right to euery one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee may not realeaſe whom hee liſt.
To execute iudgement is a good worke, it
is profitable to the Common-wealth, it
decaieth and taketh away ſin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be hindered or ſtopt of any. It
is a ſpeciall part of the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
to puniſh the offendors, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is iuſtly, without partiality, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
it. Iuſt iudgement is the Lords, &amp;
not his, and therefore not in his power to
remit it; he is the Miniſter of the lawes, &amp;
therefore to do nothing contrary to law.
When <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was requeſted of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>
the Poet, to pronounce a certaine
vniuſt ſentence, in his fauour; he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vertuouſly: As making verſes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Rules of poetry, thou canſt bee
no good Poet: ſo can I bee no good
Prince, if I giue ſentence contrary to law.
<hi>Solon</hi> ſaid, that the ſafety of the Common-wealth
conſiſteth in theſe two points, that
rewards be diſtributed after the deſert of
vertue, and puniſhments after the quality
of the offence. Iuſtice (ſaith one) know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not father, knoweth not mother, but
knoweth the truth; accepteth no perſon,
but followeth God. God is a iuſt Iudge
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3274:211"/>
againſt wicked perſons, and if any do ſtay
Iuſtice and Iudgement through bribes or
rewards, their ſinne and corruption is the
greater; and a Iudge may be aſhamed to
ſay to any offender, What wilt thou giue
me to ſhew thee fauour, or doe thee Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?
Is not this as if it ſhould bee ſaid;
What wilt thou giue me to deny my ſelfe,
to looſe my Office, and to ſell God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
There bee three things (ſaith one)
which hinder Iuſtice; the fauour of
friends, flattering praiſe, and receiuing of
rewards. But this latter is of greater force
then the two other. There may be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
why puniſhments may be delayed, or
leſſened: ſome offenders are greater then
others, and are ring-leaders to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
theſe deſerue more ſharpe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Others are ſeduced, and fall by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:
theſe are more mildly to be dealt
withall. But the inferiour Magiſtrates can
do nothing in ſuch caſes, without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and counſell of the ſuperiour. As
there be differences of offenders and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
ſo there be differences of lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the which they doe offend. Some
lawes haue their ground &amp; warrant from
the law of God and Nature: to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſers
of theſe, there ſhould bee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3274:212"/>
granted no fauour or remiſſion. There be
other poſitiue written lawes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
concerning leſſer and ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
in theſe the Magiſtrates haue power
ſometimes vpon good occaſion, to remit
and pardon; ſo that it be not againſt the
glory of God. To this agreeth the words
of his Maieſty to his gracious ſonne:
There be ſome horrible crimes (ſaith he)
not to be pardoned, as Witch-craft, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
murther, inceſt, poyfoning, falſe
coine; and ſo hee concludeth, that fauour
is to be ſhewed in leſſer matters, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in ſuch as concerne our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
cauſes. But ſee here the corruption
of our nature, we are more ſeuere in our
owne cauſes, then in Gods cauſe: wee
ſtriue and contend, and make a ſtirre for
our riches, poſſeſſions, glory and credite,
if any goe about to diminiſh and impaire
them, how violent, cruell and implacable
are we? But if it be the cauſe of God, how
modeſt, how gentle and milde are we? Is
not this to preferre our ſelues before
God? The children of Iſrael, contrary to
Gods commandement,<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.</note> ſuffer the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
and the <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> women to liue.
<hi>Saul</hi> ſpareth <hi>Agag,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Num. 25</note> and the remnant of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malecke.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15</note>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3274:212"/>
               <hi>Benhadad</hi> contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
And thus men are willing to
ſpare where God would not haue ſpared,
and where they ſhould bee moſt patient
and kinde, there they are cruell: Whereas
in our own cauſes we ought to be patient
and mercifull; but as for the cauſe and
glory of God, we are to be in it moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and ſeuere. And there bee ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
whom the Lord will haue cut off
in all ſeuerity, without any fauour, pitty
or compaſſion.<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 14. 16.</note> He ſaith of <hi>Amalecke; I
will vtterly put out the remembrance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malecke

from generation to generation.</hi> And
he chargeth his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when
they had reſt from their enemies,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 17. 18. 19.</note> and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
the good Land hee had promiſed
them, that then they ſhould not forget to
execute theſe his iudgements on thoſe
people, and roote them quite out. The
reaſon why God did ſo hate and purſue
this people, was their hard and cruell dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
againſt the children of Iſrael; and
therefore long after, when <hi>Saul</hi> was King,
hee giueth him this charge,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 3.</note> ſaying; <hi>Goe

Remember</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the children

O daughter of Babel, worthy to bee deſtroyed,
bleſſed ſhall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou

<hi>Babylonians,</hi> groſſe Idolaters. And yet
as there muſt bee vpright iuſtice in all
good Magiſtrates, ſo to this alſo there
muſt bee ioyned clemency and mercy;
there is vſe and place of both, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Mercy both of them may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed;
but true Mercy and Clemency
is an excellent vertue to all Chriſtian
Princes and Gouernours. They are in the
place of God, who is full and rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and compaſſion, and whoſe mercie is
ouer all his workes; they are to follow,
the example and nature of God, whoſe
Image they repreſent and carry; they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3274:214"/>
and rule, not beaſts, but men; and
therefore all humanity is to bee vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, they are to puniſh with
griefe and compaſſion.</p>
            <p>A Phyſition giueth to a patient, his
friend, ſome bitter potion, which hee
could bee content in loue to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
but onely that hee knoweth, that
it will bee for the good and health of his
friend. And thus Magiſtrates are to
thinke of puniſhments, as of medicines,
whereby the guilty may be amended, and
others by their examples terrified. When
the guilty is to be condemned, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
is to thinke thus with himſelfe;
This puniſhment this party hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and God hath decreed it for him, and
therefore it is for his good: It is cruelty to
delight in the puniſhment and torment of
others,<note place="margin">Iudg. 1. 7</note> as that King did, who had ſeuenty
Kings, the Thumbes of their hands and
feet cut off, gathering bread vnder his
table. This cruelty is againſt the nature of
God, and it is a vice, not of a man, but of
a wilde beaſt. It is cruelty alſo to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue,
and too much rigorous in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
tranſgreſſors, and therefore it is ſaid;
<hi>If ſo be the wicked be worthy to bee beaten,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 25</note> 
               <hi>the
Iudge ſhall cauſe him to lye downe, and to bee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3274:214"/>
beaten before his face, according to his treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
to a certaine number.</hi> Where there is
mercy and diſcretion, there puniſhments
are according to the treſpaſſes: But it is
cruelty, for ſmall faults and offences, to
enioyne extreme, ſeuere, and rigorous
puniſhments; and it is the greateſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all, to puniſh in body or goods, ſuch
as haue not deſerued it, and ſuch as are
honeſt and innocent. Therefore Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
muſt remember, that not onely he
that iuſtifieth the wicked, but he alſo that
condemneth the iuſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 17. 15.</note> euen they both are
an abhomination to the Lord. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from cruelty and raſhneſſe; and it
is contrary to loue, mercy, and iuſtice, and
it is againſt the end and the calling of the
Magiſtrate, who is ordained, not only for
the puniſhment of euill doers, but for the
praiſe of them that doe well, he is to be a
defence, a protection, a ſuccour &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort

               <note place="margin">3. Iohn.</note>
that hee had good report of all men,
and of truth it ſelfe; yea the Apoſtles
themſelues bare record of him. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints

bee hard and heauy againſt their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:

will ſurely heare his cry; then ſhall my wrath

ſo hee hath a care of all his ſonnes

mee: If thou refuſe to let him goe, behold I
will ſlay thy ſonne, euen thy ſirſt borne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke (ſaith a learned Father vpon
that place) marke the Title that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to his Church, and meditate on it
earneſtly, hee calleth it his Sonne, yea
his firſt borne, noting therein to all fleſh,
that it is to him, as a man-childe to the
father, yea as the the firſt borne, which
commonly is loued moſt tenderly,<note place="margin">Babin. in Exod.</note> and
in greateſt honour. Now then thinke
with your ſelfe, what hurt is in you to the
fruite of your body, and to your firſt
borne, thinke how you could endure to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3274:216"/>
ſtand and looke vpon the abuſe offered
by any, to the whole, or any part, as to
ſee but a legge, or an arme cut off by
bloudy butchers: then thinke of God
to his Church, and euery part of it,
whoſe affection ſo much excelleth yours,
as God excelleth man, and holineſſe and
perfection, miſery ſinne and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And a little after: <hi>Tell Pharaoh hee
had beſt take heede what hee doth: for I
will make his Sonne and firſt borne feele it,
if hee hinder mine, and will not let them goe
to ſerue mee.</hi> The world you know, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
and deſpiſeth vs, counting vs
the Refuſe of the people, or what may
bee baſe and vile; but this loue is life, and
this regard with God is honour moſt
high: In the comfort whereof wee may
ſuppe vp theſe earthly ſcornes, if his
Grace bee with vs. And ſo much the
rather wee may doe this, becauſe hee
accounteth all the reproches, iniuries,
ſtormes and hard dealings done to his
ſeruants, as done vnto himſelfe. And
therefore there came a voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

All good Princes and Gouernours euen

iuſtice and wiſdome, but alſo he is full
of goodneſſe and mercy Paſtors &amp; ſheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
are not only with diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
with lenity, to lead &amp; guid their flocke.
A good father doth bring vp and rule his
children in as much loue and kindneſſe as
may be. A good ruler muſt be of the ſame
mind to the people, as the good father of
a family is to the houſhold. And what is a
ruler of a City, or a kingdome, but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of many childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is not to abate his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3274:217"/>
authority by too much lenity, nor the
peoples loue by too much ſeuerity.
Hearts of honeſt men are gotten by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
kindneſſe and goodneſſe, ſo they wiſh
well, and ſpeake well; and they deſire the
continuance and increaſe of their Rulers
aduancement.</p>
            <p>There bee three things (ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine)</hi>
in a Gouernour. Firſt, a Calling: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
a feare of him: Thirdly, a loue
towards him. Calling is requiſite, to the
end hee may beare himſelfe chearefully
in a good conſcience; yet if hee bee not
both loued and feared, hee cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in his Calling: Let him therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
himſelfe to procure loue by benefits,
and feare by puniſhing wrong done, not
againſt himſelfe, but againſt the Law.
The Heathen man could ſay, that a
Ruler muſt bee affable in ſpeech, eaſy to
bee ſeene, and ſpoken to, in countenance
amiable, kind to the iuſt, ſharpe to the
wicked. Such a Ruler is beloued, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and reuerenced by the whole Citty;
ſuch a Ruler, by his owne benefite is ſafe,
hath no need of defence, the heartes of
the people are his armour,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> his inuiſible
ſtrength and munition is the loue of the
Cittizens, and what is more pleaſant,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3274:217"/>
then to liue with the deſire, wiſhing, and
good-will of all men. Who dare ſet
himſelfe againſt ſuch a one, vnder whom
there flouriſheth peace, righteouſneſſe,
ſecurity, dignity; and vnder whom a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
rich Citty aboundeth with plenty
of all goodmen.<note place="margin">Greg.</note> Thoſe which gouerne
the people, if they will haue their Throne
ſurely eſtabliſhed, let their countenance

more then a ſtudy and care of loue
towards his people, for it doth not onely
make a father that hee hath begotten a
child, but alſo that hee loue him after hee
hath begotten him. If Nature hath need
of ſo much loue, how much more Grace?
&amp; thus all the Prophets and Rulers, that
were famous amongſt the Hebrewes, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes, Samuel</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi>
haue ſhined and excelled in loue to their
people. Others haue ſaid, that preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Princes conſiſteth in the integrity of
Religion, &amp; in the loue of their Subiects,
and theſe things procure the loue of the
people: Not to bee too ſtrange to them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3274:218"/>
to be humble and courteous, to ſpeake
kindly to them, to bee willing to ſee their
Subiects, and to ſhew themſelues to
them as much as may bee; to heare cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

<hi>Abſolon,</hi> though hee was a wicked
man, and had a wicked cauſe, yet he had
this pollicy by kindneſſe to draw the
hearts of the people to him. <hi>When any

there muſt needs bee difference and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
it muſt needs bee ſo, for pollicy

God is no accepter of perſons, but in
euery Nation hee that feareth him, and
worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted of
him, whether hee bee poore, or rich,
Prince or Subiect.<note place="margin">Tindal.</note> Excellent is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of a Gracious man; let Kings (ſaith
hee) if they had rather bee Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
then ſo called, giue themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to the wealth of their Realmes,
after the example of Chriſt, remembring
that the people are Gods, and not theirs;
yea, they are Chriſts inheritance and
poſſeſſion, bought with his bloud; the
moſt deſpiſed perſon in this Realme, is
the Kings brother, and fellow Member
with him in the Kingdome of God and
of Chriſt. Let him therefore not thinke
himſelfe too good to doe them ſeruice,
neither ſeeke any other thing in them,
then a father ſeeketh in his children; yea,
then Chriſt ſought in vs, though that the
King in his regiment bee in the roome of

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3274:220"/>
all things in reſpect of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that all men may ſee, that
hee ſeeketh nothing but the profite of
his Subiects. Worthy is the example of
good <hi>Mordechai,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſter chapter 2. chap. 3. ch. 4.</note> who when hee was a
priuate man, yet hee was a faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

proud <hi>Hammon,</hi> comming of that
curſed ſeed of <hi>Agag,</hi> informeth the King
of him and the poore Iewes, as though
they were enemies to the State; yet both
hee and they were faithfull both to God
and the King, as it was plainely proued
afterward. At that time, and in that ſtate,
his care was for the Church of God, hee
vſed all meanes, and ventured all danger,
for the helping of Gods people. After
that the enemy of God, and of the
Church, <hi>Hammon</hi> was cut off, and Gods
people had deliuerance, ſafety and ioy,
then <hi>Mordechai</hi> his faithfulneſſe being
knowne to the King, then (I ſay) hee was
aduanced to great honour, and behaued
himſelfe as a worthy Ruler, for it is ſaid
that <hi>Mordechai the Iew was the ſecond
vnto King</hi> Ahaſhueroſh, <hi>and great among
the Iewes, and accepted among the multitude
of his brethren, who procured the wealth of
his people, and ſpake peaceably to all his ſeed.</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:3274:220"/>
Wherein wee are to obſerue three things
neceſſary in good Rulers, firſt to haue the
fauour of the people: ſecondly, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their wealth: and thirdly to bee gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and louing to them. This good Ruler
being aduanced, hee doth not forget
himſelfe, hee is not high-minded, hee is
not careleſſe of his place, but imployeth
all his trauell, for the good and preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church. This care had good
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who though hee was ſafe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and great with the King, yet when
hee heard of the diſtreſſe of his Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
hee is moued with compaſſion, hee
mourneth, weepeth, and faſteth for them,
hee prayeth heartily to God, hee goeth
to the King for his fauour, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and vſeth all meanes that hee can,
and endureth many reproches and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
for the comforting of the people,
and for the building of the wals of the
decayed <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus wee ſee, deſcribing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of good Kings and Gouernours, we
ſee (I ſay) the neceſſity, the authority,
the excellency, the bleſſing of good
Kings, &amp; the happineſſe of good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
by them the wicked, and notorious
tranſgreſſours of the firſt and ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3274:221"/>
are cut downe. Good Subiects are
countenanced, Iuſtice, Peace, Honeſty,
and all vertue is maintained and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In this gouernement, the Wiſedome,
Juſtice, and Goodneſſe of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mankind, is moſt cleerely to bee
ſeene. His Wiſedome is declared by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which is in deſerning vertues and
vices, and in the Societies of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
vnder lawfull gouernment, and in
contracts, guided and diſpoſed by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous
Wiſedome. The Iuſtice of God
appeareth in Ciuill Gouernment, in that
hee will haue open ſinnes puniſhed by
the Magiſtrate, and when they that are
in authority do not take puniſhment on
offenders, then God himſelfe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
draweth them vnto puniſhment,
and proportionably doth lay vpon grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
ſinnes, grieuous puniſhments euen
in this life, as it is ſaid; whoſoeuer taketh
the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword,
and Whore-mongers, and Adulterers
God will iudge. In theſe puniſhments
God will haue to bee ſeene the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of vertues and vices, and will haue
vs learne that God is Wiſe, Iuſt, True,
and Chaſte. The goodneſſe of God alſo
towards Man-kind, is ſeene, in that hee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3274:221"/>
preſerueth the ſociety of men after this
order, and for that cauſe doth hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, that from thence his Church may
bee gathered, and will haue Common-wealthes
to bee places, for
the entertainement of
his Church.</p>

he is to be careleſſe of the good, for thoſe
that be good themſelues, will haue a care
of thoſe that are good, ſeeing God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is carefull of them. And as for the

and the remouing, puniſhing, and

and maintaine their owne liberties, and
to recouer by warres, that which hath
beene vniuſtly taken away from them.
And as in warres there muſt bee a good

            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:3274:224"/>
And as Rulers are to defend their peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
from the force and violence of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
abrode: ſo they muſt not ſuffer
them to bee oppreſſed at home by their
owne Countrey-men. And indeed this
is moſt vnnaturall and intollerable, that
one ſubiect ſhould oppreſſe another, that
Chriſtians, Countrey-men, and brethren
ſhould vexe and torment one another by
hard and cruell dealing in the time of the

            <p>Wee haue not this many yeares (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God) beene much troubled with
violence of forraigne foes, but haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
peaceable a long time. And though
our enemies haue ſometimes made at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
and aſſaults againſt vs, yet the

            <p>Our greateſt troubles, exactions, and
oppreſſions are amongſt our ſelues one

of the Magiſtrates calling to relieue and
defend the oppreſſed. And he may more
eaſily, and ſooner, with leſſe charge and
danger defend his owne ſubiects, againſt
domeſticall oppreſſours, then ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in combate againſt mighty, many,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3274:224"/>
and cruell enemies abrode. Priuate men
may not reuenge their owne wrongs, but
they are in place to doe it for them. It
is their office to relieue the oppreſſed,
and to auenge their cauſe. As a father o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his children is both Lord and Iudge,
forbidding that one brother ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
himſelfe of another, but if any
cauſe of ſtrife bee betweene them, hee
will haue it brought to himſelfe, or his
Aſſignes, to haue it iudged and corrected:
So God forbiddeth all men to auenge
themſelues, and takes that office into his

               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> 
               <hi>but if thou doe euill, feare: For hee
beareth not the ſword for naught: for he is the
Miniſter of God, to take vengeance on him
that doth euill.</hi> It is almoſt impoſſible that
a manſhould be an equall and indifferent
iudge in his owne cauſe, luſts &amp; appetites
do ſo blind vs. And when thou auengeſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3274:225"/>

O bleſſed and gracious ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming

a gracious Prince, a patterne of

the tender care, pitty, and loue of her

that in thoſe times, being in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her Maieſties raigne about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

All the Prophets, and the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is full of curſings and threatnings
againſt all kind of oppreſſours. So that
their ſtate muſt needes bee fearefull and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3274:228"/>
damnable which liue and die in ſuch a
caſe. Our God is a God of truth and
mercy, the Law of God is Equity and
Righteouſneſſe, and the Lawes of the
Land (wee doubt not) are grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reaſon and Iuſtice; and they were
made to this end, that euery man might
haue his own, that all good Subiects may
be releiued, and defended, againſt-wrong
and iniury, againſt the violence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite
of men. Now good Magiſtrates
muſt ſee good Lawes executed, for the
reliefe of diſtreſſed people. And that ye
may the better bee ſtirred vp to performe
this duty: Let mee ſet before you two
worthy patternes and examples of good
Magiſtrates. The one is the example of
<hi>Iob</hi> who ſpeaketh thus of himſelfe.<note place="margin">Iob. 29. 11. 12. 13. 14. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>When
the eare heard mee it bleſſed mee, when the
eie ſaw mee it gaue witneſſe to mee; for I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the poore that cryed, and the fatherleſſe
and him that had none to helpe him. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of him that was ready to periſh came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mee, and I cauſed the widdowes heart to
reioyce, I put on iuſtice and it couered me, my
iudgement was a Robe and a Crowne; I was
the eie to the blind, and I was the feete to the
Lame, I was a father to the poore, and when I
knew not the cauſe, I ſought it out diligently.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3274:228"/>
I brake alſo the lawes of the varighteous
man, and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</hi>
A worthy example for Iudges, Iuſtices,
and Magistrates to imitate and follow.
<hi>Iob</hi> ſheweth before in what credite and
fauour hee was among the people: when
hee came to the place of Iudgement,
yong men being aſhamed of their looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
feared his grauity, great perſons
were ſilent and acknowledged his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
all that heard him praiſed his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
dealing, all loued him and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
him, and admired him, all were
affraid to offend him; By what meanes
came hee to ſuch authority, and credite?
hee got it not by any corrupt meanes, as
by pride, pompe, flattery; but by vertue,
by good gouernment, by iuſtice, and
mercy. Another worthy example is <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
who though hee was a Courtier,
and liued in the Kings Pallace at caſe and
pleaſure, yet hee pittieth his deere coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen
the Iewes, he mourneth and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for them. And afterward when the
poore people laied open their want and
extremity, in time of dearth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the hard dealing of the rich
men, oppreſſing them by Vſury; he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
their cries, pitties their eſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3274:229"/>
the oppreſſours, and reformeth
them. The poore people complaine that
the times were ſo hard, that they were
faine to pawne their Lands, to make their
ſonnes and daughters bond-ſlaues, and
that their owne Country-men would
lend them nothing freely to ſerue their
neceſſity withall; but dealt thus hardly
with them, with pinching and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them with Vſury; the reaſon to
moue pitty is, that they were of the
ſame nature, of the ſame fleſh and bloud
with them. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of theſe diſtreſſed people is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with inward compaſſion, chargeth
the rich men with their oppreſſions, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
an aſſembly againſt them; to ſhame
them hee alleageth the example of Gods
mercy, who hath redeemed them from
the Heathen, and therefore that they
ſhould bee mercifull to their brethren;
Hee chargeth them that their doings is
euill and wicked, that they feared not
God, that they gaue the Heathen cauſe to
blaſpheme God, that they dealt as cruelly
as the Infidels; Hee cauſeth them to bind
themſelues with an oath to reſtore that
which they haue vniuſtly taken, hee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
thoſe that will not keepe their oath,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3274:229"/>
hee moueth them, by his owne example,
to mercy, liberality, and hoſpitality; hee
and his lend money and corne to the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
hee kept at his Table an 150.<note place="margin">Nehe. 5.</note> Iewes
daily in this diſtreſſe. Both theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> are as looking-glaſſes
and mirrours for Magiſtrates to
looke into; wherein they may ſee what
care and counſell, what pitty and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
they are to haue, to eaſe and releiue
the oppreſſions of their people: And this
will be greatly to their comfort, credite,
and honour; And indeed it may be a great
diſcomfort, and diſcredite to Princes, to
ſuffer their people to bee abuſed by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours
and tyrants, eſpecially, when it
lyeth in their power to helpe and relieue
them.<note place="margin">Lattimer.</note> A reuerend Father, and bleſſed
Martyr, in a certaine Sermon, before a
King of worthy memory, ſheweth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the honour of a King conſiſteth. It is
(ſaith hee) the Kings honour, that his
Subiects be led in true Religion, that his
Prelates and Cleargy bee ſet about their
worke in Preaching and Studying, and
not to be interrupted from their charge.
Alſo it is the Kings honor that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
bee aduanced, and that the
dearth of things bee prouided for, and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3274:230"/>
commodities of the Realme, bee ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
as it may bee to the ſetting of his
Subiects on worke, and keeping them
from Idleneſſe, and herein conſiſteth the
Kings honour and Office. Furthermore, if
the Kings honour (as ſome men ſay) ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in great multitude of people; then
theſe Graſiers, Encloſers, and rent-raiſers
are hinderers of the Kings honour. For
where there hath beene a great many of
Houſholders and Inhabitants, there is
now but the Shepeheard and his do, ſo
they hinder the Kings honour moſt of all.
And indded theſe bee the words of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:
In the multitude of the people is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 14. 28.</note> 
               <hi>and for want of the people
commeth the deſtruction of a Prince.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
and aboundance of people is a
great bleſſing of God, and a credite and
ſtrength to the Prince. They are not Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
or Sheepe, but men, that muſt fight for
Prince and Country, if the enemies ariſe
and aſſault the Land. And there be many
oppreſſions amongſt vs beſides theſe:
Oppreſſours in the Church and in the
Common-wealth, oppreſſions in euery
Court, in buying and ſelling, and in other
dealings amongſt men to the hinderance
and vndoing of many poore people. But
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3274:230"/>
to let paſſe the many kinds of oppreſſions
(which the true Magiſtrate is to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and ſo farre as hee can to redreſſe and
remoue) I ſpeake onely of that one kind
of oppreſſion (that is) biting and cruell
vſury, which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> reformed among
his people: I will ſpeake of this becauſe it
is moſt common and generall, &amp; yet moſt
pernicious &amp; deteſtable, though many do
count it no ſin at all. Vſury had wont to
be called the woe and ſin of Citties, and it
ſeemeth that as pride, and other ſinnes,
had their beginnings in great Citties: ſo
had vſury, but it hath paſſed from Citties
to the Country, to Townes and Villages.
Euery place, &amp; all ſorts of perſons in the
Land are infected with this peſtilence &amp;
leproſy; high, &amp; low, rich and poore, men,
women, and children, fathers &amp; mothers,
Maiſters, and Dames, ſons &amp; daughters,
men-ſeruants and maide-ſeruants, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men,
tradeſ-men, and Labourers;
yea, &amp; ſome that go from dore to dore, to
beg and craue of others, haue learned
this trade of vſury. Free lending is hardly
to be found; charity is waxen cold, &amp; this
iniquity hath gotten the vpper hand: ſo
that this ſinne is not onely now a woe to
Citties, but a woe to Townes, to Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3274:231"/>
and to priuate houſes. It is the ruine
and decay of many poore people in moſt
places of the Land; nay, it is the decay &amp;
ouerthrow of many worthy and great
houſes and families in the Land. It hath
bitten them, it hath eaten them, it hath
deuoured &amp; conſumed them to nothing;
It is pittifull and lamentable, that ſuch a
deſtroying and murdering ſin ſhould bee
ſuffered, or tollerated in a Chriſtian Land.
Thoſe that be true Chriſtians indeed are
to abſtaine from all appearance of euill:

Another ſaith that it is robbery, Another
that it is the death of life. The ancient

One ſaith that Vſury ſwalloweth vp mens
goods and Lands, &amp; large Patrimony, as
it were a Sea, &amp; yet the Sea is neuer filled.
The Seas, for the moſt part, are for profite
and gaine, but the Vſurer can no man vſe
but to his owne hinderance: In the Sea
there is profite of many things, but with
the Vſurer ſhipwracke of all things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hee that taketh vſury, committeth
extortion, rauen, and pillage. If hee will
ſay, I haue nothing elſe to liue by; ſo may
the Theefe ſay, the Bawde, the Witch, the
Sorcerer. Some compare the loane of

for then the venemous poyſon diſperſeth
into euery member: So he that beginneth
with vſury, thinketh for a time that hee
hath a great benefite, but vſury runneth
through all his riches, and conuerteth all
he hath to debt. Another father being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
what vſury is, ſaith; It is a poyſon of
patrimony: And being aſked what is vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
permitted by Law, hee ſaith that it is a
Theefe that before hand giueth warning
what he mindeth to do. Some ſay that a
Vſurer is worſe then all ſinners: hee is
worſe then a theefe, for he robbeth in the
night, but the Vſurer robbeth day and
night. He is worſe then hel, for in hel one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the wicked ſhall bee puniſhed; but the
Vſurer ſpoyleth and puniſheth both the
good and bad, &amp; ſpareth neither holy nor
vnholy. He is worſe then a Iew, for one
Iew will not take vſury of another, but
the Vſurer will take vſury of his Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
brother. Hee is worſe then death, for
death killeth but the body, the Vſurer kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
bodies and ſoules. He is worſe then
<hi>Iudas,</hi> for he ſold Chriſt but once for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pence; but they ſell Chriſt continually
as often as they can. <hi>Iudas</hi> reſtored that
which he had vniuſtly taken: but the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
neuer make reſtitution.</p>

Some compare the vſurer to an hogge
or pigge, that while he liueth, is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and good for nothing: hee will euer
be rooting vp the earth, running through
hedges, and eating vp good corne: So
doth the vſurer much hurt while hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
Indeed when the hog is dead there
is ſome profite: So it may be when the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
dyeth, the poore ſhall get ſomthing.
How many Sermons haue been preached
in this and other places againſt vſury?
how many Bookes and Treatiſes both
long ſince, and of late haue beene written
by the beſt learned men of our owne
Countrey, againſt this monſtrous ſinne?
Giue mee leaue to put you in minde of
ſome of them, to the further ſhame and
condemnation of greedy vſurers. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and reuerend <hi>Iuell</hi> (whoſe workes are
now to be ſeene in euery Church) writing
vpon the Epiſtle of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the
fourth chapter, doth bitterly inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vſury, ſaying; That no good and
godly man will vſe it: that all that feare
Gods iudgments abhorre and condemne
it: that it is filthy gaine, and a worke of
darkneſſe, a monſter in nature, the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of mighty kingdomes, the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of flouriſhing ſtates, the decay of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3274:235"/>
wealthy Citties, the plague of the world,
the miſery of the people. It is theft, the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
is worſe then the thiefe, it is the
curſe of God, and the curſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
this is vſury.</p>
            <p>There was neuer any religion (ſaith he)
nor ſect, nor ſtate, nor degree, nor profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of men, but they haue diſliked it a
Phyloſophers, Greekes, Latines, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
Diuines, Catholickes, Heretickes, all
tongues and nations haue euer thought an
vſurer as bad as a thiefe; Nature proueth
it, if ſtones could ſpeake, they would ſay
as much. He threatneth to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
all vſurers of that Citty where hee
preached, to publiſh their names, &amp; ſhame
them, that all men may know them and
abhorre them, as the plagues &amp; monſters
of the world. And thus hee concludeth;
Tell mee, thou wretched wight of the
world, thou vnkinde creature, which art
paſt all ſence and feeling of God, which
knoweſt the will of God, and doeſt the
contrary: how dareſt thou come into the
Church? It is the Church of God which
hath ſaid; Thou ſhalt take no vſury. How
dareſt thou reade or heare the word of
God? It is the word of God that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vſury, and thou knoweſt it, how da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3274:235"/>
thou come into the company of thy
brethren? vſury is the plague and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and vndoing of thy brethren, and
this thou knoweſt: How dareſt thou look
vpon thy children, thou makeſt the wrath
of God fall downe from heauen vpon
them: thy iniquity ſhall bee puniſhed in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the third &amp; fourth generation, this
thou knoweſt. How dareſt thou looke vp
vnto the heauens? thou haſt no dwelling
there. Thou ſhalt haue no place in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of the moſt high. In many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Treatiſes vſury is arraigned, conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
condemned by ſundry verdicts, it is
proued ſcandalous, and of bad report, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the law of God, againſt the law of
nations, againſt iuſtice, honeſty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
All ſhifts, excuſes, obiections and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
are taken away and remoued.
And whereas ſome learned men do ſeeme
to fauour, &amp; in ſome ſort to tollerate this
ſin, yet it is with theſe and ſuch like cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and limitations, To deale as he would
be dealt withall, to lend freely where they
borrow vpon neceſſity, and that the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers
gaines be ſo much more as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
at leaſt that the Common-wealth
haue no hurt by it. But before the vſurer
will be tied to theſe conditions &amp; excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3274:236"/>
he will firſt giue ouer his trade. And
that all that hath beene ſpoken might at
leaſt perſwade ſome vſurers to lead a new
courſe, to reſtore their ill-gotten goods,
to lend freely, in mercy, loue and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Theſe vſurers to whom <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
ſpake, were touched at this one ſpeech,
and as it ſeemeth, confeſſed their fault, &amp;
amended it, and ſhall men which confeſſe
Chriſt, after ſo many bookes written, and
ſo many Sermons preached againſt them,
ſhall they yet continue in this enormious
ſin without repentance and reſtitution?
how ſhall they then eſcape the vengeance
and damnation to come? Howſoeuer, let
Magiſtrates, as their duty requires them,
after the example of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> be carefull
to eaſe their people of this heauy burden
and oppreſſion. Let the Magiſtrate (I ſay)
by counſel, by example and reproofe, and
by all poſſible meanes that they can, ſeeke
(if it may be) to reforme theſe oppreſſors,
at leaſt to ſhame and reſtraine them. And
pitty it is that there be not ſeuere &amp; ſharp
lawes for the puniſhment of theſe, as well
as of other notorious offenders. We may
wiſh (as one long ſince) Good Lord God
ſend to <hi>England</hi> ſome <hi>Solon</hi> for the redreſſe
of this, who took away the vſurers bookes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3274:236"/>
and their gaines from them, and forbad
ſuch filthy lucre, and brought in an eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this burden, for that all debters
were diſcharged from all ſuch creditors
which had lent their money for vſury and
gaine; or at leaſtwiſe were eaſed from
the vſury of it. Thus did <hi>Solon</hi> in the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of vſury. A ſharpe kind of dealing
no doubt, and a ſtrange, but in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
ſharpe corroſiues muſt needes
bee vſed, when lenitiue ſalues will not
ſerue.</p>
            <p>I reade that long before the Conqueſt
King <hi>Edgar</hi> that iuſt gouernour, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
Magiſtrate againſt all leud officers in
this Land, did amongſt other his good
deedes, make proclamation, that all the
Wolues ſhould bee killed in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales,</hi> becauſe they were rauenous beaſts,
and deuourers of ſheepe and other cattel,
to the great hinderance and harme of his
ſubiects. And to haue this the beter done,
he apointed many to bring for their fines
and reuenues Wolues heads yearly, ſome
more, ſome leſſe, and ſuch as could not
bring Wolues heads in, paid their fines
and reuenues in money. Now ſuch force
tooke this good order in this Land,
that within a while there was not a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3274:237"/>
Wolfe to bee had nor found, neither in
<hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Wales.</hi> That learned man
wiſheth, that likewiſe all vſurers ſhould
ſuffer the paines of death, or be baniſhed
this realme for euer, that there might
hereafter no more vſurers bee found in
<hi>England,</hi> then are Wolues to bee had this
day. He doth not ſee but that it is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to haue a law againſt vſurers, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theeues, and a great deale more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
theeues ſteale many times for neceſſity,
whereas vſurers rob and vndo all men for
greedy gluttony: the one ſtealeth a
crowne in the high way, the other rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
men in the high ſtreet of all that they
haue: the one ſtealeth a little to ſuſtaine
nature, the other ſcratcheth vp the whole
treaſure of <hi>England</hi> to ſerue his owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
and wretched deſire, to the vtter
vndoing of thouſands. And if theſe lawes
ſeeme bloudy (although the hanging of
poore wretches for ſmal matters, is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing bloudy at all) then would I
that the old lawes of <hi>England</hi> were put in
execution, ſuch as are called King <hi>Edwards</hi>
lawes of the common lawes of <hi>England,</hi>
whereof one was, that the goods of an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
after his diſceaſe ſhould turne to the
benefite of the Prince, when twelue men
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3274:237"/>
had found by proofe, that the party diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
was an vſurer in his life time. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
that learned man in that learned
diſcourſe againſt v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yeares agoe, alledgeth many ſharpe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
appointed by the ciuill &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
lawes. And leaſt he ſhould ſeeme of
ſmall credit for to ſpeake too hardly, and
without proofe, let vs ſee what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Iuell</hi>
in a letter ſpeaketh of that booke; What
it ſhould worke in others I cannot tell
(ſaith he,) for mine owne part if I were an
vſurer neuer ſo greedily bent to ſpoile &amp;
rauen, as vſurers be, yet would I thinke
my ſelfe moſt vnhappy if ſuch perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
could not moue me: for what man
would not be afraid, to liue deſperately in
that ſtate of life that hee ſeeth manifeſtly
condemned by Heathens, by Chriſtians,
by old Fathers, by the ancient Councels,
by Emperours, by Biſhops, by Cannons,
by Decrees, by all Sects of all Religions,
by the Goſpell of Chriſt, by the mouth of
God. And if it be ſo, is not vſury to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and reſtrained by all poſſible
meanes? It is the decree of a Counſel, that
a Cleargy man an vſurer ſhould be degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and therefore it is counted a deadly
ſin. Another Councell condemneth all for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3274:238"/>
Heretickes, who held vſury lawfull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
decreed, that manifeſt vſurers
ſhould bee depriued of the communion
and fellowſhip of the Chriſtians in their
life, and of Chriſtian buriall after death,
till their heires had reſtored their vſury.
Conſidering therefore the danger and
hurtfulneſſe of this ſin which ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reigneth amongſt vs, let all good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
(I ſay) continually ſet before
their eyes, this worthy example of good
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> hauing the like care and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
that he had towards his people, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all meanes they can to eaſe them of
heauy burdens, and to ſuppreſſe vſury, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,
and all kinde of oppreſſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.
Herein they ſhall bee like God

And not onely ſuch as be oppreſſed with
wrongs and iniuries are to bee reſpected
of the good Magiſtrate, but alſo all they
whoſoeuer, that be in want and neceſſity,
not being able to maintaine themſelues.
All theſe (I ſay) are to be prouided for by
the care and prouidence of good Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
and this is a part of Iuſtice, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Righteouſneſſe. This is a ſpeciall
part of their office to relieue and helpe the

poore, by their example, counſell and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

but his owne: for the earth is the Lords,
and all that therein is; and all the beaſts
of the forreſt are his, and all the beaſts on

aske it to thy hurt and hinderance, but to

to put out money and riches to good and

Lawes, agreeing to the Lawes of God,

commanding and enioyning prouiſion

want: And I know there bee many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

the needy eſtates of their brethren,
ſtretching forth their hands to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife;
yet conſidering the hardneſſe of

the multitude and great number of the

put on you the bowels of mercy, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of ſo many, and let it not grieue

you to helpe and releiue them, but freely,

to your diſtreſſed brethren, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
you (Right Worſhipfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates

according to your place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
to ſee this ſeruice and worke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
by your counſell and example to
perſwade and draw as many as you can
to this duty. And as for thoſe that are
rich; yet cruell, couetous, hard-heartd,
and vnmercifull, compell and force them
by rigour of Law, to giue that to good
vſes which they are vnwilling to giue at
all. All the poore vnder your gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be they neuer ſo many, they are
your cure and charge, you muſt ſee them
prouided for, if any of them periſh
through your default, their bloud ſhall
bee required at your hands. The good

the good Magiſtrate is not onely to bee a

an eare, an eye, and a foote for them; to
ſpeake, to heare, to ſee, to go, to do what
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3274:246"/>
lyeth in him, both for the defence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of the poore. As God forbiddeth
all cruelty and priuate reuenge in the
ſixth Commandement; ſo he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all care and meanes to preſerue the
liues of our brethren; now releife of the
needy is a meanes to preſerue life, he that
releeueth not when he may, and when
there is great neceſſity offendeth againſt
this Commandement, and is a murtherer.
<hi>Non pauiſti, occidiſti<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

for want of food which they ſhould
haue by the care of good Gouernours
and charitable good people; many (I ſay)
for want of meanes and prouiſion, doe
decay, pine, and periſh, which is moſt

doubt of your care and dilligence
to performe this ſo worthy and neceſſary
duty: I know you are dayly put in minde

of theſe things, and therefore I will ceaſe
to vrge this point any further. Onely by

God hath ſo ordained, and appointed in

poore as long as the world endureth. Let

ſtate, ſeeing God (who knoweth what is
beſt for them) hath ſo decreed it in his
Wiſedome: It may bee if they had riches
they would abuſe them in pride and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe;
he can (if he ſee good) turne
their want into plenty, Let them know
that many worthy men haue beene in
want and neceſſity; Let them take their
pouerty as a croſſe, and let them be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and humble, the rather becauſe
ſometimes their owne idleneſſe and
looſeneſſe of life hath cauſed it, let them

Let them depend vpon God and caſt
their whole care vpon him, and though
they bee poore in the world, let their
chiefe care bee to bee rich in grace, in
knowledge, and in faith, and ſo they ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3274:247"/>
bee ſure to bee greatly in the fauour of
God:<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 10. 12. 13</note> Let euery one of them ſay with

I am inſtructed both to bee full and to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and to abound and to haue want, I am
able to doe all things through the helpe of

bee kind and pittifull to thoſe which bee

towards their Benefactors; and
though ſome rich-men bee hard-hearted
&amp; vnmercifull to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let them not curſe,
but bleſſe, and pray to God for them,
who is able to mollifie and ſoften their
hard hearts: for it may bee God in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
doth turne the hearts of men from
them, becauſe they haue turned their
eares and hearts from him: they haue
beene hard hearted againſt God, againſt
Gods word, and againſt their brethren,
and therefore the hearts of others are
iuſtly hardened againſt them. Let them
remember and follow the example of
poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which though the rich
man dealtmore cruelly with him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did
his dogs, &amp; had no pitty at all of ſo poore
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3274:248"/>
a creature, yet this poore man did neither
grudge, repine, nor curſe: and therefore
being full of faith and patience, he was
receiued into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
ſeeing that God hath ſuch a great
care of the poore in making ſo many
Lawes for them, in giuing ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps
for their reliefe, and taketh their
cauſe to be his owne, and ſeeing he hath
appointed Miniſters to ſpeake for them,
and Officers and Magiſtrates; yea, Kings
and Princes for their defence and reliefe:
Let the poore (I ſay) bee carefull to ſerue
&amp; feare that God, which is ſo carefull of
them; let them reuerence and loue the
Miniſters &amp; louingly embrace that word
which doth perſwade, moue &amp; prouoke
all men to the duties of mercy, loue, &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality;
Let them honor the Magiſtrates
who are appointed as fathers vnto them,
who take care and watch, and take conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
paines to comfort and helpe them:
And let them ſay in their ſoules, bleſſed be
God for good Gouernours: And thus we
haue heard many good parts of good
Gouernours, that by their meanes the
wicked are puniſhed, the good are praiſed
and countenanced, euery man poſſeſſeth
his owne; oppreſſions and wrongs are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3274:248"/>
ſuppreſſed, the poore and needy are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
and relieued, and all theſe benefits
&amp; duties this gracious Queene includeth
in theſe words <hi>Equity and Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
One duty yet remaineth, which is alſo a
part of Equity, and that is to eſtabliſh and
mainetaine true Religion; this is the firſt
&amp; chiefe duty of a good Prince, though I
haue referred it to the laſt place. Good
Princes are not onely to haue a care of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in puniſhing the wicked, &amp; of mercy
in defending the good, and releeuing the
diſtreſſed; but alſo to plant and maintane
the worſhip of God in their Kingdomes.
Thus much wee haue heard already, that
Religion &amp; Diuine Wiſedome belongeth
to all ſorts &amp; degrees of men, to rich and
poore, to yong &amp; old, to men, women &amp;
children, and moſt of all to Princes &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
who are to be giudes and ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
to others. We haue examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes of a religious Queene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ſo great and long a iourny to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
in the truth of religion, &amp; repoſing
the greateſt happines in true &amp; heauenly
wiſedome: Here alſo is the example of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
a mirrour of Religion and Diuine
Wiſedom to all the world; who alſo plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and eſtabliſhed the true worſhip of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3274:249"/>
God in his Kingdome. We haue heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that God is the authour of the callings
of Kings and Princes, that they are in his
ſteed and carry his Name and Image; &amp;
therfore they, of all others, are to be moſt
Religious, &amp; to be moſt carefull that the
true God, who hath ſo highly aduanced
them, may bee worſhipped and ſerued in
their Kingdomes: And this is Equity and
Righteouſneſſe to command &amp; eſtabliſh
the Law and Seruice of their Creator and
Protector: And further wee haue heard,
that it is the duty of Gouernours to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
and roote out all falſe worſhip, all
falſe doctrine, hereſie, and idolatry: as all
theſe are to bee remoued; ſo in ſteed of
theſe, good Princes are to plant true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
&amp; to eſtabliſh faithfull Teachers
in their Kingdomes: They muſt be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion and Piety to others, they
muſt guide their families ſo carefully, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly,
that they may be patternes and
preſidents to others, If Religion be firſt in
their owne hearts, &amp; alſo planted in their
houſhold and families, they will be alſo
carefull that all the people committed to

others. And here is a further bleſſing of
a good King, that wee haue not onely by
his meanes, iuſtice, peace, and ciuill hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
protection of body and goods; but
alſo true Religion, and the worſhip of
the true God, and the Goſpell of Chriſt
commanded, and enioyned, and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
amongſt vs by many good Lawes
and Statutes.</p>
            <p>Now for a concluſion of the duties of
good Gouernours, let them remember
theſe counſels, directions, and examples.
A worthy King by his laſt will gaue this
aduiſe to his ſon and ſucceſſour, ſaying;
Be deuout in the ſeriuce of God, bee in
heart pittifull, &amp; charitable to the poore,
&amp; comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thy good deeds, keep
the good Lawes of the Realme, take no
Subſidies, nor releiſe of thy Subiects, but
vpon vrgent neceſſity, &amp; for to profite the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3274:251"/>
Common-wealth vpon iuſt cauſe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.
<hi>Iulius Pollux,</hi> Gouern or of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Commodus</hi> in his youth, giueth him
theſe titles, calling him Father of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Gentle, Louing, Merciful, Wiſe, Iuſt,
courteous, Couragious, deſpiſing Mony,
not ſubiect to Paſſion, but commanding
ouer himſelfe, ouercomming Luſt, vſing
reaſon, quick of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit, Sober, Religious,
carefull for his Subiects, Conſtant, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer,
adorned with Authority, ready in
his affaires, prouided to doe well, ſlow to
reuenge, Affable, gracious in ſpeech, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-hearted,
a louer of the vertuous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of peace, valiant in warre, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of good manners to his ſubiects, a
maker of good lawes, and an obſeruer of
the ſame. There was a worthy Table (as
is recorded) found at <hi>Thebes,</hi> by <hi>Marcus
Aurelius,</hi> and at his death giuen to his
ſonne as a precious Iewell, conteining
theſe proteſtations and ſentences follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing:
I neuer exalted the proud rich
man, neither hated the poore that was
iuſt: I neuer denied iuſtice to the poore
for his pouerty, neither pardoned the
wealthy for his riches: I neuer benefited
nor gaue reward for affection, nor puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for paſſion onely: I neuer ſuffered
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3274:252"/>
euill to eſcape vnpuniſhed, neither good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
vn-rewarded: I neuer committed
the execution of manifeſt iuſtice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neither determined that which was
difficult by my ſelfe alone: I neuer denied
Iuſtice to him that asked it, neither Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to him that deſerued it: I neuer puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in anger, nor promiſed benefite in
mirth: I was neuer careleſſe in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
neither faint-hearted in aduerſity: I
neuer did euill vpon mallice, nor commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
villany for couetouſneſſe: I neuer
opened my gate to the flatterer, nor gaue
care to the backe-biter: I alwayes ſought
to be loued of the good, and feared of the
wicked: Laſtly, I alwayes fauoured the
poore, that were able to doe little, and
God, who was able to do much, fauoured
me.</p>
            <p>A mirrour for Magiſtrates, a patterne
for Princes, and happy are they that in the
end of their gouernement can truely
ſay thus: at leaſt let Gouernours ſtriue
and endeuour to the vtmoſt of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
to learne and practiſe theſe leſſons,
and to performe all other duties of their
callings.</p>
            <p>And thus we haue heard the chiefe and
principall doctrines concerning the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3274:252"/>
as the neceſſity, authority, and
dignity, and duty of their callings. This
doctrine is neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y and profitable often
to bee vrged, and ſerueth for many good
vſes. By this the Magiſtrate may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and comforted in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the parts of his calling, hauing
his allowance and warrant from God.
By this hee is ſtirred vp and prouoked to
zeale, and religion, and holineſſe of life,
ſeeing hee carrieth vpon him the name,
the place and Image of God. By this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
he may ſee the greatneſſe, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and the heauy burden of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which may bee a cauſe ſufficient to
humble him in the ſight of God and men.
In conſideration wherof he may ſay with
the Apoſtle, <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
And let him pray with <hi>Salomon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Giue vnto
thy ſeruant an vnderſtanding heart, to iudge
thy people, that he may diſcerne betweene good
and bad: For who is able to iudge this ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a people?</hi> This doctrine ſerueth alſo to
reproue, conuince, and condemne all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
traytors, and ſeditious ſpirits, which
make inſurrection againſt their lawfull
Soueraigne. And hereby all good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
are encouraged to loue, honour and
obey their lawfull Rulers; and with this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3274:253"/>
Queene, to bleſſe and praiſe God for the
happineſſe of good Gouernement. And
conſidering the manifold bleſſings which
wee receiue by good Rulers, as Iuſtice,
peace, puniſhment of euill doers, defence
againſt forraigne and domeſticall foes,
reliefe for the poore, comfort to the
good, fruition of liberty, yea freedome
of the Goſpell, and true Religion. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
(I ſay) ſo many and ſo great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
which wee enioy vnder Chriſtian
Magiſtrates, let vs all with this Queene,
bleſſe God for ſo happy gouernement.
And indeede all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtian
hearts haue iuſt cauſe to reioyce and
praiſe God for his Maieſties happy reigne
amongſt vs, both for his entrance and
continuance. What feares? what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
and doubts had we at the death
of our late Soueraigne? What boaſting,
what hopes and triumphing of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries?
who made account they had
that day which they long looked and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for.</p>
            <p>They had ſpoken it often, and thought it
often in their hearts, ſaying and thinking
with <hi>Eſau;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>One thing more I obſerue worthy of
commendation, both in this Queene, and
in <hi>Salomon:</hi> It is worthy of memory in her
that ſhee made choyce of ſuch a Teacher
and Schoole-maiſter: And indeede ſhee
could not at that time make a better
choyce in the world. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> made
choyce of <hi>Donatus</hi> for his Schoole-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
in Grammer, and <hi>Victorinus</hi> for Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke,
and <hi>Gregery Nazianzene</hi> for The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.
<hi>Theophraſtes</hi> made choyce of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>
to be his teacher: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made
choyce of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> made choyce
of <hi>Socrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were all wiſe in their choyce, but
this Queene goeth beyond them all,
chooſing <hi>Salomon</hi> for her Teacher, who
excelled all men in the world, both in
humane and Diuine wiſedome. And as
ſhe made choyce of him, ſo ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to bee taught by him, and profited
much by his inſtructions, as wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
heard. Yea ſhe ſo profited, that in
ſome ſort ſhe teacheth him, and putteth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3274:255"/>
him in minde of his duety: Shee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
Gods mercies towards him, and
admoniſheth him of the end of his place
and calling.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy of commendation in
<hi>Salomon,</hi> that as hee was willing to teach
her, ſo he is content to bee taught by her.
And if <hi>Salomon</hi> had but remembred this
her admonition, it might haue beene a
pretious preſeruatiue againſt thoſe horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and groſſe ſinnes, into which he moſt
fearfully fell in his old dayes. But he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the loue and mercies of God towards
him, he forgot his high place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he forgot the end why God had placed
him, and the rules of Equity and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.
Yet this is worthy of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in him, that at this time hee doth
not, as ſome would haue done, reiect the
admonition of this woman, being farre
his inferiour. He might haue ſaid; Doeſt
thou take vpon thee to teach me, ſeeing
thou cameſt to learne of me? I know my
duty wel enough, I need no teaching. But
<hi>Salomon</hi> doth take in good part her good
counſell, and doth ſtill moſt louingly and
kindly entertaine her.</p>
            <p>From hence we are to learne, that wee
muſt be content to receiue good counſel,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3274:255"/>
admonition, and inſtruction from any,
though they be farre our inferiours. Such
as bee truely humble and lowly in their
owne eyes, are content to receiue good
doctrine from meane perſons: they are
not aſhamed to learne of any, yong or
old, learned or vnlearned, good or bad,
men or women, they are not aſhamed to
confeſſe their ignorance, wants and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
they do not contemne the plaine
ſtile of teaching, which is agreeing to
Scripture: they can be content to receiue
good drinke, not onely in cups of gold
&amp; ſiluer, but alſo in cups of pewter, wood
and ſtone.</p>
            <p>Worthy is that counſell of an ancient

ſcorne to receiue admonition from the

Miniſters are reiected, or little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
becauſe they themſelues are men of
no great eſtimation in the world. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
is that example of the Eunuch, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer
of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> who did ſo willingly
hearken to <hi>Philip,</hi>

him: for this noble man reading the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

<hi>Philip,</hi> &amp; took him into the chariot
with him. It is pride of heart, and want
of humility, that cauſeth men to ſcorne
good inſtructions from meane perſons,
The Lord ſendeth ſuch proud men to
the very beaſtes, to learne from them.
