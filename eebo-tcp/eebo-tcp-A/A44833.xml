         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN ANSWER To a book called A JUST DEFENCE AND VINDICATION <hi>Of Gospel-Ministers, and Gospel-Ordinances;</hi> put forth by <hi>J. G.</hi> In which he pretends an Answer to <hi>E. B's. Tryal</hi> of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> and other things against the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary hath manifested, that he is altogether Ignorant of the <hi>Gospel-Ministry</hi> and <hi>Ordinance,</hi> as will appear to him that reads this <hi>Answer,</hi> with desire to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Truth; and so to receive Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And instead of clearing the Truth in any Particular, he hath falsly charged <hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Churches</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with such things of which they were never any of them guilty, as will appear in the following Testimony.</p>
            <p>Given forth from him who desires the Edification and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all in the things appertaining to the Kingdom of God, RICH. HUBBERTHORN.</p>

            <head>An Answer to the Priests Defence.</head>
            <p>WHatsoever is written or acted against the Truth, and those that walk in it, is but a fulfilling of the Scripture of Truth, which saith, <hi>The way of the wicked is darkness, and they know not at what they stumble,</hi> Prov. 4. 19. Although the stumbling-stone be the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of many generations; in rejection of which many go about to build and would be approved, one of which I shall here mention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Gaskin,</hi> who would Defend and Vindicate the <hi>Priests, their Preaching, Practice</hi> and <hi>Maintenance,</hi> though contrary unto <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Apostles,</hi> his <hi>Light</hi> and his <hi>Words</hi> declared in Scripture, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>And first, That his Testimony may be received, he begins in an appearance of faigned humility, and begging of Pardon for his slips and impertenences and rudeness of stile, used against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> saying, <hi>his work is not with eloquency, nor humane Arts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Examination of which, we do find that he hath often slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and used much impertenency of speech and rudeness of stile, and neither Eloquency, Spirituality or true Humanity in his works, many of which being so plainly seen to all, is accounted not worth Printing again; but somthing here is mentioned, by which all the other may be Compared and Judged.</p>
            <p>Again, divers Reasons are alleadged as a cause of Printing <hi>J. G. his Defence of the Priests,</hi> first he saith, <hi>The great Malice and Envy against the Ministers, and the many Letters and Printed Books sent by</hi> Quakers, and <hi>the great growth and encrease in Errors, and because many of his old Friends and Acquaintance are</hi> (as he saith) <hi>seduced from the Church, and to strengthen such as are wavering through ignorance and weakness, and to clear himself,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that it might be seen &amp; come into many hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> He that would accomplish those things before named, to wit, subdue Malice and Envy, and Errors, and instruct the ignorant, and him that is out of the way, and strengthen the weak, he must be such a one as is led by the Spirit, and walks in the Light of Christ, which is so much hated and contemned by <hi>Priests</hi> and their <hi>Defenders;</hi> that first those things may be subdued in themselves, and then <hi>Minister</hi> against them in others; but none of those things can be done by that spirit which hath ruled in <hi>J. G.</hi> but that his latter Reasons, which he saith, moved him to Print, may be fulfilled; that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>That it may
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35878:2"/>
be seen, and come into many hands;</hi> and that to thy own shame, when they read and consider thy unlearned Lodgick, wherein thou goest to prove, that it is not sufficient to bring us to Heaven to be freed from fin; for thou saist, <hi>A Horse hath no sin;</hi> and so by thy comparison a man without sin, is but as a Horse; so that thou hast truly said, <hi>Thy work is without Eloquence or Humane Art:</hi> but seeing thou hast taken in hand to put things to publick view, in thy next prove, who those men are upon the Earth that are without sin, &amp; are not sufficient for the Kingdom of Heaven; and whether was it any thing that did separate man from God, but sin? And was not <hi>Christ</hi> onely made manifest <hi>to take away sin?</hi> And is not man perfectly Righteous, when his sin is taken away and made the Righteousness of God in him, Which takes it away, to wit, the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, which all the <hi>Nations</hi> of them that are saved, must walk in his Light? and it is those that hate the Light, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst freedom from sin, that have no understanding of the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which is like the <hi>Horse</hi> or <hi>Mule,</hi> whose mouth must be held with Bit and Bridle, and are like the Beast that perish; but they that are freed from sin, are not so, neither is the <hi>Horse</hi> their Comparison; but herein thou hast shamed thy self and thy <hi>Ministers,</hi> that they should be so ignorant, as neither to teach thee better Doctrine before thou didst <hi>write,</hi> nor correct thee when thou hadst <hi>written;</hi> but to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer such a thing to appear in this <hi>Nation,</hi> where Light is broken forth, that the state of freedom from sin, is no better than the state of a <hi>Horse;</hi> but as the Scriptures saith, <hi>Your folly shall be made manifest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men;</hi> which Scripture is daily fulfilling, and we are satisfied in it.</p>
            <p>Again, to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndicate the Priests of <hi>England</hi> to be Ministers of the Gospel, thou bringst many Scriptures, whereby thou wouldst prove them to be lawfully called, though they be out of the Power of God, and want the Power of that which they teach, page 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As the sons of</hi> Eli (thou saist) <hi>were lawful Priests, though they were wicked men;</hi> and this is a fit comparison, as thou may read in the first of <hi>Samuel.</hi> 2. 12. Now the <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Eli</hi> were <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Belial,</hi> they knew not the Lord; and so according to this, thou hast rightly compared the <hi>Priests;</hi> for though they have the name of being called, yet know they the <hi>Lord</hi> no more than the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Belial</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Again in the same page thou saist, <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees were called to teach, and</hi> Judas <hi>was a true Apostle;</hi> from which thou wouldst prove the <hi>Call</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> to be a true <hi>Call</hi> to the <hi>Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the <hi>Priests</hi> did <hi>Minister</hi> as truly as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> did; that is, read or speak the <hi>Scriptures</hi> truly, then thou mighest
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35878:3"/>
exhort the People, to do as the <hi>Priests</hi> say, but not to do as they do; but seeing that they do not truly speak the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences pervert it, as thou hast done in thy Book; it is not therefore a good Doctrine, to bid the People either do as they say, or as they do, because they both say falsly &amp; do falsly; and as for thy comparing of them to <hi>Judas, as for his being called and receiving part of the Ministry;</hi> that, they are not like unto him in, because as yet they have no part nor lot in that matter; but for his Treachery and Covetousness, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Bag, and betraying the Lord of Life, for pieces of money, in that, they may be compared to him.</p>
            <p>But thou saist, <hi>The wickedness of the Person doth not disanul his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, being lawfully called thereunto, until he be degraded from that Office;</hi> And to prove it, thou bring'st several Scriptures, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 34. 3. where the <hi>Shepheards</hi> eat the Fat and cloath with the Wool, and did not feed the Flock; <hi>Esa. 56. 10, 11. They are dumb Dogs that cannot bark, sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying down, loving to slumber, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his Quarter, come ye</hi> (say they) <hi>I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our selves with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant;</hi> and these, saist thou, were truly called.</p>
            <p>From which Example your <hi>Ministers,</hi> as thou thus provest, are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called to the work of the <hi>Ministry;</hi> but when these <hi>Ministers</hi> and People read thy Book, they will not much commend thee for such a Defence for them; But how dost thou prove that those before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were lawfully called unto the work of the <hi>Ministry,</hi> being wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Persons? But when thou read'st the Scripture over again, thou maist see that those are such as the <hi>Lord</hi> said, <hi>did run and he sent them not, and said, the Lord saith, when he had not spoken unto them,</hi> Jer. 14. 14. Now in this Vindication, thou hast not done any thing of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented confuting <hi>E. B.</hi> his Book called <hi>A Just and Lawful Tryal of the Ministers and Teachers of this Age;</hi> but hast rather confirmed it, for he truly compared them unto those spoken of before mentioned, and thou hast compared them, as to the <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Eli,</hi> which were <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> and knew not God; and so his Book yet stands in force (for a Tryal to such) <hi>unanswered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again as for thy pleading for Tythes for such as are like the <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Belial,</hi> thou hast no <hi>Precept, Practice</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> in Scripture to plead for such a thing, neither as such, nor as the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And whereas thou mention'st, <hi>Act.</hi> 4 and <hi>Act.</hi> 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These Scriptures, speak nothing of <hi>Tythes,</hi> nor of any <hi>Maintenance</hi> to the <hi>Ministry;</hi> but onely how that when <hi>they had planted a Vineyard,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35878:3"/>
they might eat of the fruit; and when they had gathered a Flock, might eat of the milk; and when they had sown spiritual things</hi> (amongst a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>they had power to eat and power to drink;</hi> and so it was ordained that <hi>they who Preached the Gospel should live of the Gospel;</hi> but it was not ordained that those who Preached the <hi>Gospel,</hi> should live by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Maintenance,</hi> or by making <hi>Merchandize</hi> of mens Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, of which the <hi>Priests</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for which thou writest this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, are guilty.</p>
            <p>Again, thou goest about to Defend the <hi>Prie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts sprinkling of Infants,</hi> saying, <hi>It is a Sign or Seal of Salvation,</hi> page 64.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be true that all Children thus sprinkled with water, <hi>have the Seal of Salvation by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, &amp; are by this Baptism made partakers of Grace, and United into the Church as Members of the Church;</hi> Why do you say both <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Professors,</hi> that there is no falling from Grace? have not many been so engrafted into the <hi>Church,</hi> and received that Seal, whom you now call <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers?</hi> why do you so confound one Principle with another, for we have been already so ingrafted into the <hi>visible Church,</hi> and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that Grace, which you say, its impossible to fall from.</p>
            <p>And thou bring'st <hi>Calvins</hi> words, which saith, <hi>That although there be but a little water cast upon our heads, yet notwithstanding it is not a vain figure, for the Heavens are opened upon us, and God speaks in it, as it were from Heaven, and Christ is there present with his blood, as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the usage and operation of the Sacrament,</hi> and saith, <hi>Baptism is a Token and Proof of our Cleansing, or a Seal and Character whereby God confirmeth unto us that all our sins are cancelled and abolished, and that they may never be rehearsed nor imputed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then by this he that hath a little water cast on his Head, he hears <hi>God</hi> speak in it, and <hi>Christ</hi> being present with his blood, washes away all sin; and this is a proof of his Cleansing. So, why dost thou and the Priests speak and write against us, as being fallen from <hi>Grace,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the <hi>Truth,</hi> seeing we have received as well as you, <hi>the Seal of the Covenant and Proof of Cleansing; and cannot fall from it,</hi> if your Doctrine be true; but as for <hi>Spinkling Infants,</hi> thou hast not brought one Scripture to prove it; but saist <hi>Baxter</hi> against <hi>Tombes</hi> hath proved it, and quotest <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as if their words were plainer proof for thy purpose, then any Scripture; for there is no <hi>Scripture</hi> without invented consequences, that is a precept for it; and when thou hast wearied thy self and canst not prove it, thou saist, whatsoever may be proved from the <hi>Scripture</hi> by consequence, to be the scope and meaning of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is sufficient proof, page 73.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35878:4"/>
Again thou askest us a question, <hi>To shew thee one Command or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Scripture, for the Baptizing of those that are growen up, whose Parents one or both were Christians by professing the Gospel of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If thou knew the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or didst weigh thy own words, it would stop thee from asking such foolish &amp; unlearned Questions; for thou thy self confessest, that those which were growen up were <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> and that they had also received the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> before they were <hi>Baptized;</hi> and as for them, or their <hi>Parents,</hi> being called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by their Profession, many <hi>beleivers were</hi> Baptised and followed <hi>Christ,</hi> before the name <hi>Christians</hi> was given to them, as thou may read <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. that after much people was gathered, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Churches,</hi> they were first called <hi>Christians</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their Parents were called by Profession, that is nothing to that which thou art about to prove <hi>(sprinkling of Infants)</hi> but to conclude thy proof for <hi>Infants Baptism,</hi> thou quotes <hi>Rob.

            </p>
            <p>And hereby thou mayest know the first <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Inventor</hi> of this your <hi>practise;</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and not the <hi>Apostles,</hi> so when thou writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain do not so undervallew al the <hi>Quake's,</hi> as thou hast done in this thy book, as to say <hi>that they dare not read Latine Books, nor have read Histories,</hi> and thou sayest, <hi>we count it a sinn for Ministers to learn La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> But these are but false aspersions, for we do not account it sinn <hi>to learn Latine, Greek,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew,</hi> neither are we a fraid to read them, but we so far do read and know them, that we have found out the <hi>Priests</hi> deceipt, by pretending that of the <hi>Tongues</hi> which they had <hi>not;</hi> and though you <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Practise that which you know not where it had it's beginning,</hi> yet we know how deceit came in, and how it hath overspread you with darknesse and ignorance, and because <hi>you see not,</hi> therefore you judge us to be blind, <hi>but the

Light of knowledge is arisen,</hi> in which we see before the <hi>Pope,</hi> his <hi>holy Water mingled with salt or sprinkling Infants was,</hi> and see the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of those dark <hi>inventions,</hi> and our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> tends to the bringing of <hi>People,</hi> to know a <hi>true living foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for all their practices,</hi> and that the darknesse of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> of <hi>men</hi> may not alwayes keep people in blindnesse; to <hi>practise</hi> the <hi>Popes inventious,</hi> instead of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Christ Doctrine,</hi> who by the bright shining <hi>of his light</hi> is leading <hi>people</hi> to his <hi>Baptism,</hi> which is <hi>by one spirit into one body, by fire and by the Holy-Ghost,</hi> and such can no longer be kept in that, which doth not so much as wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth of the flesh, but comes to the <hi>Answer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and witnesseth the <hi>Baptism</hi> which saveth, as the <hi>Apostle Peter saith, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and such are come <hi>to the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, to fill up thy book thou hast charged many false things upon us, and so findst thy self work, by enlarging thy lyes one after another.</p>
            <p>As first thou sayst <hi>some of us have affirmed that Christ did never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from the grave, and that his body is rotted within the grave,</hi> and that <hi>some of us have made a mock of his Doctrine of Justification, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and the intercession of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These things are thy <hi>own,</hi> and were never affirmed by any of <hi>us;</hi> but on the contrary <hi>that Christ is arisen from the dead</hi> and <hi>is become our first fruits, and by the imputation and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession are we Justified, and of God is he made unto us Justification and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again thou saist, <hi>we neither know nor understand what your Ministers preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Yes,</hi> we both know and understand, <hi>that they preach lyes in the Name of the Lord,</hi> and we know and understand <hi>that thou art going about to make a defence and vindication for them</hi> in so <hi>doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again thou sayst <hi>the Quakers say, it matters not whether a man doe any good works, seeing they make him not good:</hi> Page 41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is <hi>false,</hi> for none of the <hi>Quakers</hi> ever said so; for our <hi>goodnesse</hi> is of the Lord and not of works, and because we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> from him therefore doe we those things that please him, and are <hi>obedient</hi> to his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Commands,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Page (43.) <hi>that we say a man is saved by hearkning to the light within him and obeying the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We never said <hi>that by hearkning or obeying, that man is saved;</hi> but by him which they are to hear and obey are they saved, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

hearkning to his <hi>voyce,</hi> and obeying of him to whom he is <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is no Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Page 47. Thou sayst <hi>the Quakers instead of blessing and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Enemies, curse them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is <hi>false for we blesse, and curse not,</hi> but all <hi>cursed practices, words,</hi> and <hi>actions, we testifie against,</hi> and for this cause are we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted thy enemies, because we tell thee the truth.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is of the number of the rest a <hi>false accusation,</hi> for <hi>selfe</hi> is that, which we beare witnesse against in all, <hi>justifying</hi> nothing but what God <hi>justifieth,</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> nothing but what God <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, page 49. Thou sayest <hi>the Quakers are so proud to think, and say, they are more perfect then the Apostle Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> When did any of the Quakers say, <hi>they were more perfect then the Apostle?</hi> but it seems thy tongue is at liberty to make a refuge for the Priests, and fill a volume of paper with lyes.</p>
            <p>Again, page (51) thou sayst, <hi>that many of the Quakers go up and down naked, to manifest that they are as perfect, as</hi> Adam <hi>was in Innocency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Their going <hi>naked</hi> is as a <hi>Sign</hi> unto thee, &amp; the <hi>Priests,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord</hi> is now <hi>stripping</hi> of the <hi>sheeps cloathing,</hi> that all may see your <hi>shame and nakednesse,</hi> and that which you have been <hi>covered with</hi> is but as <hi>leaves,</hi> and a <hi>Formal Notional Profession of God,</hi> without his <hi>Life, Power or Spirit,</hi> and you must be as <hi>naked</hi> from this <hi>covering,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be <hi>Innocent,</hi> as ever any <hi>Quaker</hi> hath been from their <hi>cloaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, page (56. 57) thou sayest that we do condemn not only the <hi>Churches</hi> now in being; but all that ever have been; the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia, Corin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is but an addition to thy former lyes, for those <hi>Churches</hi> we do own, and all such as do walk in their <hi>life,</hi> and are guided by their <hi>Spirit,</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> was in <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. but thou hast appeared to be of another <hi>Spirit,</hi> and hast manifested thy self to be a condemner of those <hi>Churches,</hi> as well as of us, as in page 55. thou saist <hi>in the Church at Corinth that there was such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt members among them, as you can scarce find in the worst of your Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So of that which thou falsly chargest us, thou art truly guilty thy self, and so hast condemned those <hi>Churches,</hi> and Iustified your selves: But what corruption was it that was so bad in those <hi>Churches,</hi> that is not in the worst of your <hi>Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35878:5"/>
Again, as a proof for thy condemning your own <hi>Churches,</hi> thou brings <hi>Brightmans,</hi> words saying, <hi>behold whatsoever is first, that is true, and whatsoever is later, that is false, Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>page</hi> 113. So that hereby, by thy old <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> thou hast proved all your <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to be false, for the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia, Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> these were the first; but the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>England Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbytery,</hi> these are latter, therefore false.</p>
            <p>Again, pag 60. Thou sayest, <hi>the Quakers say they are so perfect, that they cannot grow in knowledge nor grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Quakers never said so,</hi> but on the contrary, <hi>we do grow in knowledge and in grace,</hi> whereby we se, and comprehend, how <hi>thou</hi> and the <hi>Preists</hi> do grow in rage, enmity, and false accusations against us, and we know also, that you must fulfil your measure of Iniquity, <hi>and that all manner of evil must be spoken against us falsly,</hi> and so we are satisfied, because we suffer not for evill doing, but for well doing.</p>
            <p>Again, page 61. Thou chargest us <hi>not to obey the commands of Christ, but do teach men to break his commands; twice in one page, and again in the next page.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All which doth but <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>manifest</hi> thy unbridled tongue, under which is the <hi>poyson</hi> of <hi>Aspes,</hi> but if <hi>thou,</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> could in <hi>meeknesse</hi> and <hi>simplicity</hi> prove, that wee have either <hi>broken</hi> any of his Commands, or taught others to break them; then we would be <hi>convinced,</hi> and thou should be counted <hi>a reprover</hi> and <hi>instructer</hi> in <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousnesse;</hi> but on the contrary we see, that <hi>bitternesse</hi> and <hi>a lying spirit</hi> hath possessed thee, and that thou only <hi>invents</hi> and <hi>Imagines</hi> false things to fil up thy book, which we were never guilty of, which never any sober man, that had but the parts of a man, would ever lay to our charge, seeing, that both our <hi>principles,</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> witnesseth to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Again, to make thy Vollume large, in page 82. thou brings the same lyes over again, charging us to say, <hi>That we are more fuller of the Spirit then the Apostles, and of more knowledge, and stronger in Faith then the Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Affirmation is thy <hi>own,</hi> and not <hi>ours;</hi> and therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to be <hi>Condemned,</hi> where it did <hi>arise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 83. thou saist, <hi>The Quakers will have no Order;</hi> and page 84. thou saist, <hi>We are wise in our own conceit, and that we think our selves, wiser than Christ, or his Apostles, or Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which is but multiplying lyes, and so not worth much speaking unto, but onely that <hi>People</hi> may see, how thou hast run out thy self till thou hast no order over thy <hi>tongue,</hi> nor over thy <hi>Pen,</hi> which hast been

so long time, as above <hi>half a year,</hi> in adding <hi>lye,</hi> unto <hi>lye,</hi> to make <hi>a Defence for the Priests;</hi> and so it appears that <hi>Truth will not defend them;</hi> and thy <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>lyes,</hi> will not <hi>long defend them; for God will sweep away the refuge of lyes, and he that loveth and telleth a lye</hi> (as thou hast done) <hi>hath no part in the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 94. thou accusest <hi>Sara Blackborow, as concerning a Woman speaking in the Church, as if she had said that the flesh was the Woman;</hi> from which thou concludes, <hi>That then the flesh must be married to Christ, and so would make up absurdities from thy own words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is thy Ordinary way of proving <hi>Errour,</hi> first <hi>to affirm a lye</hi> of thy own making, <hi>charging it</hi> upon <hi>another,</hi> and then draw a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <hi>Answering</hi> this lye: but <hi>Sara Blackborow,</hi> nor any other of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> have ever said, that <hi>the flesh was the Woman:</hi> but that which <hi>Sara Blackborow said,</hi> was, <hi>That the flesh was to be silent, and that which spoke in thee, was that which was silly, and was ever learning;</hi> but when any doth <hi>Pray</hi> or <hi>Prophesie,</hi> whether <hi>man</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> and speak forth that which <hi>God</hi> hath made manifest; that is, <hi>The Spirit of the Father in both, and is not to be quenched, for there is neither male nor female, but all is one in Christ and in the Spirit,</hi> from which <hi>Preaching and Prophesying proceeds; and the Promise is, that daughters as well as sons shall Prophesie:</hi> And in the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> they might all <hi>Prophesie one</hi> by <hi>one, that all might hear, and all might be edified;</hi> but thou saist, <hi>Those women that did Prophesie, it was not in the Church;</hi> Where then did they Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, if not in the <hi>Church?</hi> Or what was the Church? For it is written, 1 Thes. 1. 1. <hi>That the Church is in God;</hi> And where must a <hi>woman</hi> be when she <hi>Prayes</hi> or <hi>Prophesies,</hi> if not <hi>in the Church which is in God?</hi> And where was it that <hi>Philips</hi> four <hi>Daughters</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, whether in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>out of it?</hi> And where was it that that <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> did <hi>Minister,</hi> whether in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>out of it?</hi> And <hi>Pheba,</hi> a <hi>servant</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> whether she might not <hi>Pray</hi> nor <hi>Prophesie</hi> in it? And <hi>Priscilla,</hi> who was <hi>a helper of Paul in Christ, and laboured with him in the Gospel,</hi> Rom. 16. <hi>Might not Pray</hi> or <hi>Prophesie in the Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to speak the Truth in plainness to thee, that which thou <hi>Cavel'st against; Is not the woman nor the man, simply considered,</hi> But it is the <hi>Spirit speaking in either,</hi> which thou cannot <hi>bear;</hi> for where <hi>the Spirit of the Father speaks in man</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> thou sets thy <hi>self against it to oppose it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thou saist, <hi>Susan Bond</hi> said, <hi>Christ was the Husband, and of him they were to be taught;</hi> and thou saist, <hi>Sara Blackborow did like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Who could like it <hi>ill?</hi> Was not that <hi>a good Answer?</hi> And thou thy self must own <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>thy Teacher,</hi> and <hi>learn of him,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:35878:6"/>
before ever God will make use of thee in his <hi>service</hi> or <hi>work,</hi> though the Priests may make use of thee <hi>for their Defender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again page 99. thou saist, <hi>We deny that any should either Rule in the Church, or have any Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, we do not <hi>deny the Head of the Church, which is Christ,</hi> to <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>to have all the honour;</hi> but <hi>we deny any Priest to bear Rule by his means,</hi> or <hi>to receive the Honour due unto Christ;</hi> for we see they are such as <hi>seek Honour of one another, and not the Honour which belongs to God onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas thou goes about to Vindicate, <hi>That wicked men may sing Psalmes;</hi> and to prove it, makes this Argument, <hi>If any be merry, let him sing Psalms; Now wicked men are merry as well as godly, though they haue no true cause,</hi> Ergo. page 87.</p>
            <p>

foolishly and falsly, to say that the Lord commands those things to be done, and those he commands to do them, in doing of which it is not good to them but sin; Where hast thou learned? or where dost thou read of such a <hi>doctrine,</hi> that wicked men are commanded of <hi>God,</hi> to do such things, which in doing is not <hi>good</hi> to them but sin?

            <p>In page (107.) thou saist, <hi>our Quaking fits, many are of opinion that they are diabolicall, by a kind of witcheraft, and said, thou hast heard strange relations of Enchanted Ribbons, and giving drink after, &amp;c.</hi>
