         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There be three things which be especially required in Histories of this nature, to make them perfect: first Truth, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

                  </gap>,</hi> foisted in by our owne inuention, to smooth the passage of our story.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an explanation in discouering, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sequels of things, but also the causes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons drawing to the conclusions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, iudgement in distinguishing things by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing the best, and disallowing the contrary.</p>
            <p>For the first, stories should be true, or at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble<note place="margin">Histories should be true</note> truth, because by so much, they are more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, by how much they resemble truth the neerer; and so much more gracefull, by how much more probable and doubtfull: we haue many Histories (euen of this kinde) mixed, that comprehend in them nothing lesse then truth: yet by their smooth carriage, and their proper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> circumstances with such aptnesse drained and disposed, they haue been taken for truth, and registred amongst workes of more s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rious consequence.</p>
            <p>Such were those <hi>Apologae Fabulae</hi> (whereof we haue in part spoken before) which contained in them many pitthy and graue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and worthy obseruation in the excellentest Moral: these are fitly called by <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mirrors of Mans life, Patternes of Manners, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of truth.</hi> Their neere resemblance of truth, made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6467:39"/>
the reader more attentiue, subiecting his eare to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses probable, more then to things surpassing the bounds and limits of beliefe, as producing vnheard of miracles (meere conceptions of the braine) pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticke Chymeras: A Gyant immured in a rocke, yet able to pierce it through, win a whole Monarchy with his owne single hands, lead a multitude of Kings cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, and returne home without a wound. Here strange Inchaunted Castles, Ladies and Knights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in most base seruitude by an Airy Monster: there admirable victories purchased vpon incredible, oddes: and to be belieued, it pleaseth the Painter so to deliniate their vertues.</p>
            <p>But of these erronious stories there be some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue no methode, planting an <hi>Arcadie</hi> in a <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanny:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Absurdities in Historians of our time.</note> as if by some super-natural accident there were a transplantation of Regions, or some Earth-quake in the Authors braine, whence this immane Colosse of an irregular Discourse proceeded. Which strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations be not vnlike to your Lanskip; where vpon the sea, whatsoeuer we see, by land, seemes in our saile to go with vs: Euen so do these vain Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make strange obiects vnto vs, of places impossible, transiting whole Countries to make an impolished straine of pastorall musicke (one good Bell-weather would make as perfect harmony) sound well in a Clownes eare.</p>
            <p>To be short, my opinion positiuely is this: That Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian which can ioyne profite with a modest delight together in one body or frame of one vnited discourse, grounding his story vpon an essentiall truth, deserues the first and principall place: and he who (vpon a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned discourse) can proportion it to a likenesse of truth, merits the next. As for him that (like one of Duke <hi>Humphreyes</hi> Knights) obserues neither meane nor measure, but gorge their own insatiate appetites with full messes of vntruths (without probability) should be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6467:39"/>
dealt withall, as that wandring <hi>Italian</hi> Squire was vsed, for his monstrous lying: Tost in a Blanket, till his erring spirit by suffumigations, or some such like meanes, were canuased out of him.</p>
            <p>Great blemishes these be to so reputed a Profession, aiming neither at profite nor modest delight, but imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating your Mercenary Actors, spurt out some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soene ieast to make a prophane Rogue applaud him: and sure if the strict doome, and censure, of banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were to be inflicted vpon any kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, rather should it be pronounced against such as these then any. The Pagans haue abhorred them and much more odious should they bee in a Christian Common-wealth, where vertue should be the scope of all our actions.</p>
            <p>They are like some Comoedies wee reade now a daies; The first Act whereof is in <hi>Asia,</hi> the next in <hi>Affrica,</hi> the third in <hi>Europa,</hi> the fourth in <hi>America:</hi> and if <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> or <hi>Marcus Paulus</hi> had found out a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For the second: Their should be an explanation in<note place="margin">Explanation in discouery of causes.</note> discouery of the causes, with a direct and graduall proceeding to the sequels: As thus; in description of a solemne Iust, or Tournament, it is necessary for the Historian to show the cause why such solemnities

            <p>In these explanations, the Reader should not be delayed, or frustrated too much in his hopes, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary

ambages: We should not trifle out the time in vaine and impertinent repetitions, it cloies and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates the appetite too much: not vnlike to your great feasts, reseruing the choycest dainties for the end, when the appetites of the Guests are satisfied before they come: It is a good frugall course, and includes an Occonomicke pollicy, their best dishes may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferued for another time: He that discouers euents and sequels without their precedent causes, is as one that would draw a Riuer dry, without knowing whence the Spring is deriued: applying the conclusions of things, as it pleased the <hi>Ethnickes</hi> in ancient time, to reserre them to the arbitriment of Fortune; making euer this womanish argument: <hi>The euent was so, because it was so; and it was so because fate would haue it so:</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Titus</hi> opinion, <hi>Potestates fato dari:</hi> But these which thus apply the course of all conclusions to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, be as blind as Fortune: Nay, farre more; for though Fortune be blind, yet she is not inuisible: But these men are not onely blind in the eye of common sence, but invisible in the composure of their owne Arguments; their Conclusions being as blind as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
            <p>In making likewise our iudgement of Histories, and considerately applying it to our present interests, we must specially regard the dispositions of the Agents, and dilligently remarke how they are affected in minde, this is the least dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>uing ground of forming opinion: By the nature of the Agent, coniecturall euents or reasons of euents may be drawne: As if an ambitious man be imployed in Embassage twixt Prince and Prince, he is to be suspected that his Treaty will be lesse happy, in that his illimited Passions oftimes, rather aggrauate then allay causes of ciuill discord.
