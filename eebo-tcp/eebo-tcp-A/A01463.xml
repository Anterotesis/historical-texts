            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And therefore as God is goodnes it ſelf, we by participacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, be good. As god is lyght it ſelfe, we

And as our goodnes light and wyſedome by participacion, is no addition, or derogacion to goddes goodnes, lyght, or wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in eſſence or being, no more is our merityng, deſeruyng, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction: a derogacion or ſupple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the merites of chriſtes paſſyon, but onely a due vſynge of them, by the gyfte of his grace.

The effecte of chriſtes paſſion hath a condicion. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I trauailed to inſtruct doctour Barnes, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared this propoſicion vnto hym
<pb facs="tcp:3003:29"/>
neyther darkely nor confuſely. And whye ye ſhulde call it ſo, I ſe not, for both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is certayne, and the wordes commonly vſed and vnderſtanded. Theffecte of Chryſtes paſſyon, is the worke therein intended (that is to ſay) to reconcyle man to god and brynge him to ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherein, I aſked Barnes, whether he toke the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte of chriſtes paſſion to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to man, or with a condicion on mans behalfe. If it be abſolute and without condicion, then ſhal all men be reconciled and ſaued. For ſeinge Chriſte dyed for all: if nothinge elles were required on mans behalfe, it ſhoulde extend to all men, and then ſhulde no man be dampned, but all ſaued at the laſt, as the Origeniſtes ſaid. Here vnto Barnes fyrſt aunſwered, as ye ſaye nowe, that he knewe no condicion, but yf a man beleued. I
<pb facs="tcp:3003:30"/>
aſked hym then: whether he wolde graunt there was that one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion? He ſaid yea, he wolde graun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that, for els he muſt haue agreed to an inconuenience, that all men ſhall be ſaued, whether they bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or no. And herevppon the firſte propoſicion that ye nowe cal darke, was agreed vnto, that the effecte of chryſtes paſſion had a condycyon. I aſked Barnes then, whether the fulfillyng of the condicion, dydde dymynyſſhe the glory of Chriſtes paſſion? that is to ſaye: Whether the paſſyon of Chriſt were more gloriouſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme man, whether he beleued or no? and ſo doynge nothynge? or els when man by gods gyfte wrought the worke of belefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame? Whervnto he ſaid that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s belefe dyd nothyng diminiſhe the glory of chriſtes paſſion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hadde before graunted,
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:3003:30"/>
that belefe was a condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which decerned them that ſhall enioye the fruyte of Chryſtes paſſion, and them that ſhall not: thus we termed that propoſicion, that the fulfyllynge of the condicion, required in man: dydde nothynge diminiſſhe the glorye of Chriſtes paſſyon. And thus farre we agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I only diſſentinge from hym, that where he ſayde, he knewe but one condicion, that is to ſaye bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, as you do nowe. I ſayde becauſe he came to me as a ſcoler, I wolde lerne him mo condicions required in man, and amonge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other, tolde hym of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had in his open ſermon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed agaynſte me. To forgyue his neyghbour or els he ſhuld not be forgyuen. And concluded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he had graunted before that the fulfilling of this condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not the diminution of the glory of

Chriſtes paſſion. And ſo likewiſe of any other condicion required in ſcripture of man, either in his incorporation into chriſt by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or returninge to chriſte by penaunce, with perſeueraunce in vertue, for the atcheuyng of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe.

ſo were it by Barnes falſe, that onely faith iuſtifieth, for this man was iuſtified without faith.

that if a ſynner to whome god had ſayde he ſhulde dye, lefte his wickednes and turned to him, he ſhalbe ſaued.

he wyl not drawe, then it is to late to praye to be drawen, or not nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for god wil drawe as he hath determined, and none otherwyſe. And this reaſon extendeth to all maner of exhortacions, eyther to be not effectuall, as to late after predeſtination, or not nedefull, as I haue already ſaid. Out of this combre I rydde my ſelf eaſely, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuche diſcuſſion, as I haue redde and learned of men exerciſed in ſcriptures, whiche is that when we ſpeake of God, with diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of tyme, of anye worke done by god out of time, we ſpeake impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlye. Of that god worketh in time, we maye conuenientlye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct the time. we may ſaye: God hath ſent his ſonne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to redeme man, for it was in tyme (as ſcripture ſaieth) when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of tyme was. But when we ſaye god hath predeſtinate and
<pb n="liiii" facs="tcp:3003:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
choſen vs before the begynnynge of the worlde, the ſpeache is not hable to expreſſe the matter, and ſemeth to ſignifie a tyme paſte where in deede there is none paſt. For there is no tyme paſte, where was no tyme, ſo as we muſte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thimperfitnes of our ſpeache, wherin the hollye gooſt ſpeaketh to imperfitte men. And therefore the pretertens rather declareth a perfection in thacte, then the paſſing ouer of the time in the acte. Like as (in hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and hath iuſtified in them that be not yet borne) we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not iuſtificacion &amp; glorifica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion as an acte paſt, becauſe it is written in the pretertenſe, for then both in iuſtifieng and glorifieng, we muſt ſay, all is done before the begynnynge of the worlde, for the verbes expreſſynge the actes of iuſtificacion, and gloryfycatyon,
<pb facs="tcp:3003:56"/>
be put in the pretertenſe, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is written in. And ſo it we ſhoulde deduce oure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes from the tyme, we muſte ſaye that god hath iuſtified and glorified them at ones, with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinacion, whiche were a playne abſurdite. And yet our imperfitte ſpeache ſo ſoundeth, as thoughe glorificacion were done with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinacion. And albeit the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſignifieth in ſcripture the tyme to comme, as appereth in many places, yet in this place, <hi>quos iuſtificauit glorificauit,</hi> the futurtence can not fully expreſſe that is ſignified, for it is done vs to vnderſtande, that God whoſe workes be hydden in ſecrete, and who worketh continually, hath from the begynnynge fauoured man, and accordyng to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath before all tyme elected and predeſtinate, that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:3003:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the begynnynge of the world, and in tyme hath called, doth cal, and ſhall call, hath iuſtified, doth iuſtifie, and ſhal iuſtify, hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, doth glorify, and ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, his electe and predeſtinate, in ſuche meaſure as his pleaſure hath appoynted. I do not here go about (good reader) blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to depraue the ſcripture,<note place="margin">The phraſe of ſcripture, conceyued by the holy goſt</note> and to fynde fault at that whiche can not be better ſpoken, beinge the penne as we truely and certenlye beleue, directed by the holy gooſt, but to note vnto the howe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye gooſt hath expreſſed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of god in our ſaluacion in ſuche a part of ſpeache, as mighte ſignifie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſpeache a thing mooſt aſſured, whiche is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertence, for to our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that is mooſt aſſured to be, that is paſt, and yet with god that ſhal be, is in like aſſurednes, as that is
<pb facs="tcp:3003:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alredy done. And therefore when we go aboute to deſcant in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tyme, whych was not by that ſcripture ſygnyfyed vnto vs, we then fall ſtreighte in errour. As when we rede wrytten of god the father, that he hath begotten his ſonne, the ſeconde perſon in trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if we ſhall in that verbe <hi>(ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit)</hi> hath begotten, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider tyme, as we do in an other ſcrypture <hi>(Abraham genuit Iſaac)</hi> Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath begotton Iſaac, we ſhoulde ſaye (whiche were folyſſhe) that god the father was before God the ſonne, as Abraham was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iſaac, but in one place, the verbe ſignifieth the acte without tyme, when we ſpeake of god, and in the other, the acte with tyme. So as when the ſcripture telleth vs: God hath choſen, god hath predeſtinate, god hath forſeen al, god hath knowen all, before the

And Gregory Nazianzene wyſely noteth and alſo deuoutly, that if god coulde be throughlye comprehended of man, either in his thought or vnderſtandyng, god were not ſuperior to man. For what ſo euer is comprehended, is
<pb facs="tcp:3003:59"/>
leſſe then that comprehendeth it, &amp; therefore we muſt confeſſe truly that god comprehendeth all, and is in no wyſe holly comprehended. So much as ſcripture telleth vs of god, and his workes, wroughte in tyme, or aboue all time, ſo much we knowe illuminate by faythe, but when we wyll, by our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, after the meaſure of oure owne vnderſtandynge, by thinges within the compaſſe of oure crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion (whiche in dede paſſe in tyme) eſteme goddes doynges before tyme, and call them paſt alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be before the beginning of the worlde: we deceyue our ſelfe as muche as if in conſyderatyon of place, we ſhoulde ſpeake of god as we ſpeake of men, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is here he is not there, whyche no man is ſo madde to ſaye, becauſe God is euery where.

Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they ſaye is infallible in all thinges that ſhalbe, and that is mooſt true, but the infallibilitie is no kynde of cauſe, of the thynge thereby ſo to be cauſed, to be, but onelye an aſſuraunce that the thynge as it is knowen of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:3003:77"/>

Here reaſon ſpoorneth and ſayth, god myght haue chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged it, when he ſawe it ſhoulde ſo be, and not haue made man inclineable to fal, when he ſawe he wolde fall before he made hym.

Bycauſe Win. hath no ſcripture to proue his concluſyon, I wyll helpe hym, but yet I commende Standiſh agenſt Doctor Barnes, for he layd on ſcriptures wryten &amp; vnwryten, englyſhed and vnenglyſhed as thicke as hayle, and vnderſtode not one word what he ſayd, euen the very doctours paynted of Paule to haue erred frome the true faith and loue, and are ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vayne lyes, whiche wolde be ſene Doctours of the lawe and yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
<pb facs="tcp:3003:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they not what they ſaye nor of what thynge they affirme. But to Wyn. concluſion, Thou knoweſte good reader, that in ſcripture there is menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a dead fayth and a fayned or falſe fayth. And alſo there is a rightwyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the law or our rightwiſenes and alſo a lyke iuſtification, one of faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god, and an other of workes before men. When Paule had myghtelye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onely fayth to haue iuſtified before God, the Iewe not beyng content with this concluſion obiected ſayeng. What then ſhall we ſaye of our father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham? Gote he no iuſtification by his workes? he was a good father and dyd many goodes dedes. It is trweth ſaith Paule, but yet hath he not to reioyce therof before god, but onely before men. Nowe let vs ſet vp my Lorde Gardiner in his Veluets and Satyn alofte vpon his mule trapped with veluet with gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſterups and bridle. &amp;c. with his ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle men bare head chayned with golde, before and after hym. Who wyll not ſaye but there rideth a pryncely prelate a gloriouſe Byſhop to orne and honor an hole realme? See what a clenly ſorte of tall men he hath aboute hym, what coſtely liueries geueth he, what a many of idle belies dayly fedeth he. Hath not Winch. lo, wherof to glorye before
<pb facs="tcp:3003:98"/>
men? is not this a ioylye iuſtification? Nowe foloweth his concluſion of him ſelfe ſayenge, ergo by the gyfte of god, that is by theſe worldely gyftes I may do well before worldlye men of fleſhely iudgement before I be iuſtified before God, yet iuſtified gloriouſly (in which I reioyce) before men. This is his Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſſhe iuſtification wherof the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies ſo highly reioyced, in ſo muche that Chriſt tolde them that he came not to call ſuche iuſte men, but ſynners to repentaunce, warnynge the people that excepte theyr rightwyſnes abounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Phariſais good dedes, they ſhulde neuer come to heuen. And Paule ſayth that men ignorant of the ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſnes or rightwiſe makynge of god, and ſekynge to ſet faſt (as nowe dothe Wyncheſter) their owne rigthwiſenes, they be neuer ſubiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rightwiſnes of god. Wyncheſter yet knoweth not the office of the lawe, to ſhewe vs our ſynnes, to worke wrath, to make ſynne the more to abound as Paul proueth it to the Romayns, ſo farre of muſt it be to iuſtify. Neither yet knoweth he thof<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice &amp; proper place of faith nor yet what thynge fayth is, but conceyueth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne fantaſticall opinion therof as doth euery ſpeculatyue phariſay and idle hypocrite. And a man ſhulde ſpeke
<pb facs="tcp:3003:99"/>
after the very order of nature and of the tyme, he muſte nedes ſette faith before workes, as is the tree before it blometh and the blomes before the fruyte. The ſead is caſt into the erth before it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fructifieth. The ſeade is the worde of god ſaith Chriſte. And nyghe vnto the is the worde of fayth euen in thyne herte and mouth. Fayth is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſe and worketh by loue. And the ende of the precept is loue out of a pure harte (by fayth hartes are made pure ſayeth Peter) and a good conſcience and of faith vnfayned. I thinke Winc. is not ſo ignoraunte in his Gramer as to englyſſhe this texte of Paule. Fides que operatur per dilectionem, as dydde Iohn fyſher the byſhoppe of Rocheſter in hys ſermon at Paules croſſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde prynted, thus englyſſhed, fayth which is wrought by charitie: ſo ſettynge the carte before the horſe and lyke an vngodlye gardener to peruerte and turne the rotes of his plantes and herbes vpwarde, of whyche I harde as it were an olde prophecye .xl. yeres agoo that ſuch an Antechriſt ſhuld come to peruerte the iuſtificacion of faythe and turne Chryſtes relygyon vpſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe. I am ſewre he wyll not ſette workes before fayth, no not in the yong baptyzed infantes, nor yet in Paule at
<pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:3003:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his conuerſion, nor in the thefe hanging by Chryſte crucified. It is truth that workes being the frutes of fayth ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge in theyr owne place procedynge oute of fayth iuſtyfyenge dymynyſſhe not the effecte of Chryſtes paſſyon. For we are made in Chryſte Ieſu to do the good workes whyche God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we ſhoulde walke in them. We are ſaued frelye by faythe ſayeth Paule, yea and that not of workes, for it is the gyfte of god, that we be ſaued by fayth, and not for oure workes leſte anye man ſhoulde reioyce in his owne dedes. But yf Wynch. put his workes in the place and office of fayth, as the condicion withoute the whyche no man is iuſtyfyed, ſo dymynyſſheth he, yea he is iniuriouſe and blaſphemous vnto the effecte of Chryſtes paſſyon, for by this doctryne his diminute imperfecte and wycked workes ſhulde deſerue vs forgeuenes of ſynnes as though Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes bloude and ſo plentuouſe a redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pcyon in Chryſte were not ſuffycyente. If by the lawe ſayeth Paule men be made ryghtwyſe, ſo is Chryſte deade in vayne. Loue muſt fulfyll the condy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon (ſayth he) ergo the workes of the lawe are his condicion. Roma. 13. Now let vs ſee what loue god aſketh of vs, for yf we haue not that loue, we ſhall

God commaundeth vs to loue him with our hole hartes, myndes, ſoules, and wyth all our ſtrengthe, and oure neyghbours, ye and oure ennemyes to, as our ſelues, ye and that euen as Chriſte loued vs, whiche dyed for vs beynge his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes.

Nowe tell me Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter yf anye one man hath this loue, and ſo fulfylled your condicion? or els dare your ſelfe affyrme to haue fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it? yf ye haue not, ergo by youre owne wordes ye ſhall neuer enioye the effect of Chriſtes paſſion (and yet ſpeke I not of the perfytte fayth and hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man, in God is bounde to haue) beware therfore Wyn. howe ye ſet your ſaluacyon vppon ſo harde a condicion, leſte ye come to ſhorte of the gates ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge with your .v. folyſh virgens.

Is not he a proud foole to whome when god geueth a free iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in chriſt, yet wyll he refuſe to take it but vpon a condicion, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it with ſuche workes as hym ſelf is neuer able to perfourme? what arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant foole wolde thus condicion hym ſelfe agenſte gods wyll? Peter conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe this importable condicion ſayde, by faith god purifieth theyr hertes, and wherefore then do ye nowe tempte god ſo much layenge ſuch a yoke vpon mens necks which nether our fathers nor we be able to bere? By the grace of our lord Ieſu chriſt we beleue vs to be ſaued as were our fathers. If we ſhuld ſaye that we haue no ſynne in vs, ſo are

And that the promyſe oute of fayth in Ieſu chriſte ſhoulde be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the beleuers. Only Chriſt fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the lawe. And yf Wyncheſter wolde mok out Paule, ſayenge that when he concluded ſo ofte man to be frely iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by fayth onelye without the workes of the lawe: that he mente by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the lawe but cyrcumcyſyon and the other ceremonies nowe abrogated, and not the lawe of the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Then let him heare Paule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pownynge hym ſelfe of what lawe he mente aunſwerynge to ſuche obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By the lawe ſayth he, cometh the knowledge of ſynne, and I hadde not knowen concupyſcence to haue ben ſynne hadde not the lawe ſayde: Thou ſhalt not haue any concupiſcens or luſt. And then when he wrote his pyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And Peter ſayd that this ſame lawe whyche Paule excludethe from iuſtificacion and Wynch. calleth

It is redde that therewas one man that by ſuffring doynge and fulfyllynge the lawe of the commaundementes came to heuen, euen chriſte onelye, In Math. we reade of a nother yonge man that wolde go to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by doynge ſome good workes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge Chryſte, Good Mayſter what dedes ſhall I do to haue lyfe eternall? whoſe mynde Chryſte ſeynge, dydde ſet hym but certayne of the eaſyeſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes to fulfyll them. And he ſayde, as for theſe I haue done them al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>redye, wel then ſayd chryſt, or rather ſo thought, If ye wyll nedes go to heauen by doyng: I ſhall ſet you to do ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des as I knowe well ye wyll neuer do, yea they be impoſſible for you to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen to ſell his ſubſtance and to geue it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore and ſo to folow hym now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng forth to Ieruſalem to ſuffer death.

What dydde this man I praye you? howe farre went he with Chriſt thinke you? went he not his waye heuyly from chriſt? And yet wyll Wyncheſter go to heauen by doynge and fulfyllynge his harde condicion, I dare ſaye he wolde ſkratche his head twiſe (as dydde this ryche man) ere he ſolde his byſſhoprike and hadde gyuen it to the poore. And therefore chriſte pronounced that it is impoſſible for ſuch riche men to come to heauen. God therfore truſted vs ſo litle with the fulfyllynge of the lawe and ſo by this condicion to come to heauen, that he toke it out of our handes &amp; layd it vppon his ſonne chriſtes backe to be fulfilled.

You ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte and ſaynt Paule ſayth fayth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and yet ye ſayde euen nowe, &amp; ſo ye ſay a lytle after, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> charitie is ioyned, with the fayth ye ſpeake of, and you your ſelf, take fayth and charitie for twoo ſiſters, but ye make fayth thelder ſiſter, and affirme, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in iuſtificacion, charitie that ye cal the yonger ſiſter, is not excluded. Theſe be your wordes, wherin ye ſaye, the ſame I ſay, as a playne ſymple man wold wene, ſuch as ye take vpon you, to teach in englyſhe. For I ſay both the ſyſters (as ye call them) be there, &amp; ye ſay they be there alſo. Where is the variaunce then, betwene you and me? Forſoth in two poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. One is that ye ſaye, faythe and charitie, be both in iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet ye ſay, Saint Paule
<pb facs="tcp:3003:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Chriſt, ſay, fayth onely, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye declare your ſelfe, how much ye regarde their ſayenges, and that what ſoeuer they ſay, ye dare (if it lyke you) ſaye the contrarye. Now for my part I ſay, fayth and charite be both in iuſtificacion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt and ſaynt Paule ſay the ſame. An other varyaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene you and me is, ye ſaye, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it both ſyſters, faythe and chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, be in iuſtyfycation, yet chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, the yonger ſyſter (as ye terme it) ſtandeth ſtyll ydle, and onelye waiteth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her elder ſiſter, faith, whiche faith ye ſay, is only in effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, effecte and office in iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, but not onely in company, for fayth (ye ſaye) is accompanyed wyth charitie in iuſtificacion, and yet fayth as the elder ſyſter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth al.

And ſurelye, al the diſputacyon, in this artycle of iuſtificacion, is deduced by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion thus farre, that for all the only &amp; onely, with ſo many onlyes which they haue added to faythe, to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpeach litigiouſe, there now is none fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de amonge lerned men, but that ſaye (as ye mayſter Ioye ſay) that charite is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded from faith in iuſtificacion, but that there is in the iuſtificacion of man, fayth and charitie. But the newe ſecte (whiche ye profeſſe) to mayntayne the aduerbe (onelye) ſaye the offyce of fayth is onely to iuſtifie, and yet charitie is preſent,
<pb facs="tcp:3003:116"/>
but is not effectuouſe therein. So as fayth and charitie beynge two giftes of God gyuen both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the one (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſaye) fayth, worketh iuſtification onelye, as ye ſaye, and that other, charitie for the tyme ſtandeth ydle, tyll iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be paſt. And to induce men, to ſe this euen aſwell as you do your ſelfe, ye vſe a ſimilitude of the ſonne and fyre, which manner of teaching Chriſt vſed muche by thynges corporall and viſible, to make ſome explication of thynges inuiſible and incorporall, and ſo to induce men to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of them, whiche for my part I much allowe, and onelye fynde this faulte in ſome of your ſorte, that albeit in you,<note place="margin">Similitudes be neceſſarye to plaine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge.</note> they allowe and approue ſimilitudes, for corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion of your doctrine, yet when your doctrine ſhuld be impugned, they can not abyde ſimilitudes,
<pb n="cxv" facs="tcp:3003:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but they ſay ſtreight as they here of them, fye on them: Blynde not me (ſayth he) by ſimilitudes but comme to the playne matter, and yet ſomtyme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is ſo darke, as it can not be perceiued without the ſpectacles of a ſimilitude, or parable, and anon the ſimilitude well conſidered, the matter that was darke, is ſene by and by. For a ſimilitude, is as it were a ſpeach of the wordes &amp; thinge togither for bothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing reſembled, and the wordes alſo ſpeaketh at ones. But nowe to your ſimilitude, whereby ye entende to make men perceyue, howe it might be, that two thinges conioyned together, may haue dyuerſe effectes, and ſo eche one of them, to worke his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte apart, without confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſo ye ſay, doth fayth and charitie. The ſonne and fyre ye ſaye, haue eche one of them heate &amp; bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:3003:117"/>
and the heate warmethe and the brightnes ſhyneth. So as by this ſimilitude, we maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that from god, whome ye ſignifie by the ſonne or fyre, is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to man before he be iuſtified, two vertues, fayth and charitie, whereof fayth ſhyneth, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie warmeth. And in dede the effect of fayth, is properly, to illuminate the vnderſtanding, and of charitie to warme and kyndle mans colde and earthly affection. Nowe if the iuſtification of man implied onely the expulſion of darkenes, frome mannes vnderſtanding, theffecte of fayth, wolde ſuffice, but ſeinge god in iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moueth mans hart, and kindleth loue in it, whye may not theſe two vertues, with their two effectes, by goddes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, concurre in mans iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? your ſimilitude letteth it not, but rather confirmeth it. As for
<pb facs="tcp:3003:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaynt Paul declareth plainly, that albeit he ſpeaketh ſometyme of faith without mencion of charite, yet he meaneth not faith as a bare foundacion, but fayth with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And as euery foundacyon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, is fyrſt in prioritie of tyme. So is euery foundacion intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, fyrſt in prioritie of nature.

And this is the plain teaching, and agreable with ſcriptures, whiche muſt be ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded, as one parte, may be conſonante to the other, withoute ſuche hackynge as ye make of it. God gaue Abraham fayth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to beleue hym, and charitie wherewith to loue him, and Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham as he beleued god ſo he loued him both together. And if I ſhuld returne to your ſimilitude, when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, that they ſhuld plant their vines, where the ſonne may ſhyne on them, do they affirme that the brightnes and lyght of the ſonne, giueth the comfort to the vynes? or rather the heat? The ſpeach is of the brightnes, as a parte may ſignifie, the hole, but in the heat is theffect. Ye dalye in the matter, to triumphe ouer me, &amp; take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte of a mediatour, betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Is not this properly handled, in ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a matter? But ye requyre ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of me whiles ye daly, &amp; talke your ſelfe, without ſcripture. As for ſcripture this I ſaye to you, that and ye note ſcripture, ye ſhal fynde in the true ſenſe of it, that as the promyſſe of god is knit to fayth, ſo it is knyt to loue, as lyfe is promiſed to men beleuynge, ſo it is promyſed to men louynge. And as often as ſaynt Paule nameth fayth, not ſpeakinge of loue, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and oftener, doth ſaynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his epiſtles ſpeake of charytye without mencion of fayth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth plainly, that he that loueth not, is in death, and he that loueth not, knoweth not god.

Wherefore we may not properly ſaye we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende iuſtification by faythe, whiche is the exhibition of mercy promyſed by god, to iuſtifie man, onleſſe, we wolde call the promiſe of god, and the exhibition of the thinge promyſed all one.

Paule argueth a nother wayes excludyng the condicion that men myghte be the ſuerer and cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayner of the promyſe. For yf the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe ſhulde ſtande of an vncertayne, yea impoſſible condicion: who ſhall be certayne and aſſured of the promyſe? Thus argueth Paule. By the workes
<pb n="cxliiii" facs="tcp:3003:145"/>
of the law came not the promyſe to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or to his ſeade, hym to be thayer of the worlde, but by the rightwiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng by fayth. For yf they that wyl be iuſtified by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes be therfore made thayers, ſo is faith and beleue in vayne and the promiſe voyde &amp; fruſtrate. For the law worketh but wrath, ergo it wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth no good workes to thattaynement of iuſtification. It worketh wrath for that it is impoſſible to be perfourmed &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyſhed of man which is fleſſhe, as Paule conſtantly affirmeth, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it wrappeth all the workers therof to be iuſtified thereby vnder the curſe. For as many as ſtande vppon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of the lawe to this ende euen for theyr iuſtificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are yoked vnder exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracion and tyed to the curſe Gala. iii. For where is no law there is no tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſyon. Wherfore (Paule nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth agaynſte Wincheſter ſayenge) out of faythe is the herytage geuen, lyke as oute of grace, that the promiſe myghte be the more ferme and ſewerer vnto all the ſeade, not to it that is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the lawe, but alſo to it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is oute of the faythe of Abraham. Paule in ſpirite dydde ſe before this Wincheſters condycion to fruſtrate the promyſe, and therfore he confuteth it here ſo clearely. And agayne vnto
<pb facs="tcp:3003:146"/>
the Galathens, If anye wolde obiecte ſayinge, ergo the lawe is agenſte the promyſes. God forbyd ſaith Paule, but if there had ben a lawe geuen whyche myghte haue geuen lyfe, then no doute iuſtification myghte haue commen by the lawe. But the ſcripture concluded all vnder ſynne that the promyſe, the promyſe (I ſaye) out of the faith of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu Chriſte ſhoulde be geuen and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to the beleuers. Thus ye ſe how with ſo many wordes Paule excludeth Wynch. impoſſible condicion, to make faſt the promiſe in Chriſt that our faith myght be the ſewrer ſtayed and cleaue to it. If onely vnbelefe dampneth, why ſhulde not onelye faith iuſtifie? it is a good argument of contrary. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Win. wyndeth in his condicion ſo harde for the attaynement of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificacion by workes. I wolde fayne ſe ſome one of his good workes ſo perfyt, pure without any carnall affecte annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, either of vayneglorye or of loue to hym ſelfe or for feare of payne not done nor for hope of reward, or any lucre, promocion or to receyue a better thinge for the doinge thereof, out of ſo pure an herte that it be not done of any affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to the perſon, put onely of fayth and zeale for the glorye of god &amp; profit of his neighbour, or onely to mortify
<pb facs="tcp:3003:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his owne affectes and to ſet naught by hym ſelfe, to abnegate and renounce his eſtimacion and glory, to be renewed in ſpirite and to folowe chriſte mekelye to death. Paul acknowlegeth hym ſelfe and complayneth in his moſt perfection not to be able to do that good which he wolde do, but to do that euyll whiche he wolde not do. He durſte not call in, this condicion to atteine his iuſtificaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, but conſtantlye affirmed as many as ſtande vpon the workes of the lawe to fulfyl them, thereby to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are yoked vnto the curſe of the law ſayenge. Curſed is euery man that aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in all thinges written in the booke of the lawe to perfourme them. I wonder therefore that Wyncheſter dare ſtand vpon his condicion to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylled to attayne any part of his iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacion therby. Dare he claime (thinke ye) any part of his iuſtificacion for bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Doctor Barnes and his felows for preaching agenſt theſe wykedly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med artycles? Tel vs Wynche. dyddeſt thou burne them ſo cruelly of loue and not of hatred or enuye? trwelye loue burneth no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for preachynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth charitie enuyeth not. &amp;c. Abi igitur poſt Chriſtum ſatana. Come bak deuyl after chriſte, thou arte ſclaunderous to his croſſe, for beinge maried to thyne own

wytte, thou ſauourſt not the heauenlye and godly iuſtification, but ſuche one as naturall reaſon perſwadeth amonge men, euen one good turne for a nother to be done, and ſo to deſerue thy iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But be it in caſe, that Wynche. thus condicioninge with god hath in his owne opinion done ſome good dede whereby he dare clayme his iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſhall not that ſame deede ſerue hym to the attaynement of that effecte. For were it neuer ſo good, yet dothe his falſe opynyon in his deede make it dampnable. But lette vs ſpeake of a good deede abſolutelye, excluded from all carnall affectes (yf any man maye do ſuch one) this deede is not our dede, but the dede of God workynge it in vs, for what deede ſoeuer procedeth out of oure corrupte nature is naughte.

Furthermore yf thexplayninge and openinge of ſcripture, with mo wordes in the ſame language with ſimilitudes alſo, to giue more light to the true ſenſe, ye meane to declare, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to gods worde, I am ſure ye wolde not haue trauailed ſo much in thexpoſicions of ſcriptures, as ye haue doone in youre ſundrye bokes, And ſpeciallye, where ye make a drinking of chriſtes holly ſupper, ne haue vſed the ſimilitude

ye haue done, of the ſonne and fier, for declaration of the ſecrete wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of fayth alone, yf ye had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that for addynge to goddes word. When ye rayle of me vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritablye and deuyſe for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that is not true, we can not cal that adding to gods word, that is all beſides it and contrarye to goddes word.

So as if ye

And for ought I here of you in the workes of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, I ſhall not contende with you muche but agre with you for all this bablynge, that turninge to god is the worke of penaunce, ſo it be a hole turne, whereof ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaketh, with a mannes hole harte in faſtinge, wepynge, and waylynge, and as the church hath declared our turnynge ſhuld be, and not halfe a turne, as ſome of your ſcole teache and amonges all, your turnyng Turnor, whom
<pb facs="tcp:3003:157"/>
god turne into the right waye. But afterwarde ye handle your turninge otherwyſe &amp; wyll ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande your turninge, as a ſynner ſhulde be iuſtified, before he doth turne, wherein you turne the matter ſo aboute, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, for by you a ſinner tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, as your ſpeache purpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but a man that was a ſynner now beleuing and iuſtified ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſynnes forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turneth, and ſo, he that is turned all ready in iuſtificacion, &amp; yet remaynyng tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turneth agayn in penaunce, and then the ſeconde turninge ſhulde be from god, yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> turninge in iuſtificacion were to god, as it muſte neads be, for in remyſſyon of ſynne and iuſtificacion god turneth man to him. And ſo the playne man, whom ye take vpon you to teache playnly, wolde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. For when ye ſay that
<pb facs="tcp:3003:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a ſinner before his turnyng by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce beleueth and is iuſtified, that is one turne, where he was before from god, now to be towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hym. And then if there be yet after a turnynge againe in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, that turnynge muſt nedes be from god. For a ſeconde turne muſte nedes be contrarye to the fyrſte, as a ſimple man aunſwered when one told him the world was turned. Then (ꝙ he) all is well, for I harde my graundfather ſaye in his tyme, the worlde was turned, And then the worlde was nought. And therfore by the ſeconde turne he concludeth, it ſhulde be good. For in two turnes one ſuccedinge a nother, yf the firſt be one waye, the ſeconde is a nother. And yet you wolde haue a ſynner fyrſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by fayth wherein he is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to god, and then turne by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.

interpretacion, by reaſon of the ordre of the matter, that is knytte togither. For when I ſaye (he that foloweth me is my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt) the ſpeache importeth that he was my ſeruaunt before he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me. But in an other matter knytte in the ſame faſſhyon of ſpeache when I ſaye (he that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunteth to ſerue me is my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt) this ſpeach ſignifieth not, that he was before my ſeruaunte, and then couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, but that by this couenaunt, he is made nowe my ſeruaunt, and was not before. In the other ſpeache, he was my ſeruaunte, or he folowed me, and in this laſte ſpeache, we muſt vnderſtande, that he dydde coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunte, or he were my ſeruaunte. And what reaſon of dyuerſitie in theſe two? Marye in the fyrſte ſpeache, I ioyne that is oute of all kinde of cauſes, to theffecte, as
<pb n="clxiiii" facs="tcp:3003:165"/>
to folowe me is no cauſe to be my ſeruaunte, but rather enſueth of ſeruyce. But in the ſeconde I ioyne a kynde of cauſe with the effecte, And then I maye not ſaye the effecte was before the cauſe, and therefore in aſmuche as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, is of the kind of cauſes, to make hym my ſeruaunte: I maye not by the lyke faſſhion of ſpeache deceaue my ſelfe, and ſay, bycauſe in the one ſpeache, it was not true, where I ſayde (he that folowethe me is my ſeruaunte) that he was my ſeruaunte, before he folowed me: I muſte therefore in this ſpeache (he that couenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to ſerue me, is my ſeruaunte) ſaye alſo, that he was my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte, before he couenaunted with me. Nowe bycauſe in the ſpeache of ſcrypture, whiche is. Eche man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleueth Ieſus to be chriſt, is borne of god, there is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

of the kinde of cauſes, that is to ſaye (to beleue) with the effecte, whyche is, to be borne of god, I may not ſaye we be borne of god, or we beleue, but that we beleue, or we be borne of god. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth that englyſhe ſpeache, before declared. He that couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to ſerue me is my ſeruaunte, But if the ſcripture were thus, He that ſhalbe ſaued, is borne of god, the vnderſtandynge muſte needes be, that we be borne of god or we be ſaued. For this is like the other ſpeache in englyſſhe, (he that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth me is my ſeruaunt) whiche implieth that he was my ſeruaunt or he folowed me, whiche diuerſe conſideration arriſeth vppon the diuerſitie of placynge theffecte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cauſe, or the cauſe before the effecte.

And if ye thinke therin otherwiſe then ye ſaye, (as for the mutual intelligence, in the fraternite, ye can not in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but knowe, howe publique thinges go) is this the charitable diuiſe in the brotherhed, to choſe out me for a raylynge ſtocke, and in ieſtinge at your pleaſure of me, brynge to the kynges maieſtees
