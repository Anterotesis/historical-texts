            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Behold then here the <hi>Propoſition</hi> which theſe men aſſert publickly in one of the greateſt Cities of the World; and it is worth obſerving, to note the <hi>Original</hi> and the <hi>date</hi> of it. For thoſe who now at preſent promote it ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, had long ſince ſcatter'd the ſeeds thereof in ſome of their Writings; and it was ſufficiently evident that all their deſign was to be bottom'd upon this Errour: they had likewiſe themſelves advanced the <hi>Concluſions</hi> in one place, and the <hi>Principles</hi> in another; but it was ſtill with certain windings and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities

of termes, which as yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd them with lurking-holes and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſubterfuge; but now they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nakedly and without diſguiſe to the <hi>Church</hi> what it is they pretend to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in her.

            <p>For you know, <hi>My Lords,</hi> that the very prime <hi>Fundamental</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is, That our Faith is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon the <hi>word of Men,</hi> but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which is <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf: and that it is <hi>That</hi> which renders it immoveable and altogether Divine; whereas it would elſe prove but Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, were it upheld by any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority leſs then that of God, and if we were not able to render our ſelves that Teſtimony which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Chriſtians of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> To have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word which God hath taught us by his Church; and that, not as the Word of <hi>Men,</hi> but as the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and as in truth it is. <hi>Non ut verbum hominum, ſed, ſicut eſt verè, verbum Dei.</hi>

               </note> Whatſoever is compriſed in the <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaies S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) is built upon ſolid and certain Truth, perſuaded by the divine <hi>Oracles,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Miracle,</hi> and conſecrated by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> by the <hi>bloud</hi> of our Redeemer, and by the glory of his

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93311:13"/>
and of all out Intellectuals comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the act of our <hi>Faith,</hi> is no other then that Adoration which we pay to the <hi>Prime Verity</hi> it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore, whoſoever he be that renders it to the word of a Man, (what-ever rank he may hold in the Church) whoever ſaies that he believes with a <hi>Faith divine,</hi> that which he would not believe but becauſe a Man has affirmed it, does conſtitute <hi>Man</hi> in the place of <hi>God,</hi> transferrs to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> that which is alone due to the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> and makes (as far as in him lies) a kind of <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is this, <hi>My Lords,</hi> which will doubtleſs cauſe you ſo much the more to deteſt this Impiety, That the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Doctrine have imagin'd they ſhall make it paſs under the ſhelter of that Reſpect which all Catholicks bear towards the <hi>Pope</hi>; and that none will preſume to oppoſe it, for fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him. But were it poſſible to offer a greater affront to the prime Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then to conceive they doe him honour by a <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93311:13"/>

If S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> perceiving certain perſons ready to render them the ſame honours which they gave to their <hi>falſe Gods,</hi> did rend their Garments, to teſtifie their extreme grief and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and caſt themſelves in amongſt the people to hinder them of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; we are bound to believe, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> were well advertiz'd of this fearfull and prodigious exceſs, he would not fail with his whole Authority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe prophane <hi>Adorators</hi>; and that, as a Crime capable of loſing him for ever before <hi>God,</hi> he would not permit himſelf to be ſo much as once touch'd with the leaſt complacency of ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable a Flattery: He would certainly conſider, even with trembling, the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which God did execute upon that laſt King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for having

onely indulg'd the tumultuary Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of a People, who (after they heard him ſpeak) cry'd out, The Voice of God, and not of Man, <hi>Dei voces, &amp; non hominis</hi>; ſince the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> did immediately ſmite him, becauſe he had not given the honour which was due to God. <hi>Confeſtim autem percuſsit eum Angelus Domini, eò quòd non dediſſet honorem Deo.</hi> In the mean while, how much leſs criminal were the Adulations of theſe People then that of the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites? That</hi> might poſſibly be taken for ſome ſudden tranſport of Joy, which is oftentimes not regulated by Reaſon; and ſometimes we find that even the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf gives to <hi>Judges</hi> and to <hi>Princes</hi> the appellation of <hi>God:</hi> but <hi>here</hi> they attribute to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and that deliberately, out of a formed deſign, and the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Dogme</hi> and of a Theological Aſſertion, not a ſenſeleſs Name, but one of the moſt reſplendent and glorious Titles of <hi>God,</hi> and the moſt incommunicable to the <hi>Creature</hi>; which is, That the Word of a <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be

            </p>
            <p>For we cannot ſay upon this occaſion what thoſe are wont to affirm who maintain the Infallibility of the <hi>Pope</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> That in believing what the <hi>Pope</hi> decides concerning them, they do not eſtabliſh their Faith upon the word of a Man, becauſe <hi>he</hi> propoſes onely what has been by God reveal'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi>; ſo as ſtill their Faith is founded upon the Word of <hi>God.</hi> We can ſay nothing like this upon the ſubject in hand, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to which the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> pretend that the <hi>Pope</hi> is as Infallible as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Deciſion</hi> an object of <hi>divine Faith</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall propoſe a matter of Fact of a <hi>Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Age,</hi> as (for example) to divine whether heretical Propoſitions have been taught by an Author of that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,</hi> we cannot pretend that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds a thing which is either reveal'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93311:15"/>
in <hi>Scripture</hi> or in <hi>Tradition.</hi> Well he may ſay that ſo he judges it; but he cannot affirm that God has reveal'd it: He may averre it of himſelf; but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, <hi>Dominus locutus eſt,</hi> that God has declar'd it.

what the deſign of this <hi>Poſition</hi> is, and how ſpecious a <hi>Title</hi> they have prefix'd before it, <hi>Aſſertiones Catholicae contra Saeculorum omnium praecipuas Haereſes:</hi> This being ſo, what may we elſe imagin, when we ſhall ſee by the ſequel, of that which they oppoſe to theſe <hi>Hereſies,</hi> but that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>Catholick Truths</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the <hi>Church</hi> againſt theſe <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and which we are oblig'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge under cenſure of being our ſelves <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> from the Communion of the <hi>Church?</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then (according to theſe <hi>Jeſuites</hi>) muſt we think of receiving the poor <hi>Greeks</hi> into the Communion of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> or re-unite theſe divided Members ſever'd by ſo deplorable a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but in obliging them to confeſs that <hi>J.

            <p>But admit we ſhould not exact that ſo ſtrictly of them, what an Obſtacle do we not lay in the way of their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what Scandal are we not guilty of? and what pretext do we not afford their <hi>Miniſters</hi> to decry the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> before their abus'd People, by rendering her odious and contemptible, and by confirming them in thoſe their ancient Calumnies and Reproches which they have ſo frequently objected to the <hi>Catholicks</hi> for equalling the <hi>Pope</hi> to <hi>Almighty God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis well known, that it is from <hi>their</hi> Principles they have inſpired <hi>Rebellion</hi> into ſo many People.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93311:27"/>
not at all concern any <hi>point of Faith,</hi> and whereof the knowledge does not in the leaſt conduce to Salvation?</p>
            <p>This is it (my <hi>Lords</hi>) which has chiefly oblig'd us to ſpeak upon this occaſion: And it was highly neceſſary that the <hi>Catholick Divines</hi> ſhould make haſt to decry this Impiety, leſt thoſe <hi>Uncircumcis'd</hi> ſhould take occaſion of inſulting over the <hi>Armies of the living God.</hi> We were obliged to prevent them, to the end they may ſee that we do no leſs abhor this exceſs in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> for the love of <hi>Truth,</hi> then <hi>they</hi> appear to deteſt <hi>her</hi> by the deſign which they pretend to juſtifie their faulty ſeparation.</p>
            <p>But if it be ſufficient to acquit <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> of their <hi>devoir,</hi> that they repreſent this publick Complaint; it is not enough for the honour of the <hi>Church,</hi> and for the entire reparation of this <hi>Scandal,</hi> that there have been onely <hi>Divines</hi> which have reprov'd it.

            </p>
            <p>Haply ſome there be may reply, that this <hi>Extravagance</hi> deſerves not half this aggravation; and doubtleſs they will make uſe of it for a pretext to induce
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93311:28"/>
you to connive at ſo foul an exceſs. But, my <hi>Lords,</hi> you ought to conſider, that how extravagant ſoever this Opinion may appear, it is promoted by <hi>Perſons</hi> who may give us juſt occaſion to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſtrange Conſequences of it. For 'tis ſufficiently evident, that it is not by <hi>chance,</hi> or through the blindneſs of any <hi>particular man,</hi> that it comes thus to appear in the World: It is long ſince that they have prepar'd and diſpos'd all things for its production and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though they never uſher'd it <hi>in</hi> with pomp, before they were well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd all things were favourable for its reception, and that there was not a Champion remaining who had the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or confidence to oppoſe it openly.</p>
            <p>Perhaps indeed their Pretence is not yet ſo far advanc'd as to draw a <hi>formal Approbation</hi> from the <hi>Biſhops:</hi> But that which they hope for is, (ſince I am obliged to ſpeak all) that their credit, and their power of being able to doe good or ill offices, will be a means to retain all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in ſilence, ſo as none of them ſhall dare to condemn them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93311:28"/>
for fear of drawing upon them the ſtrength and diſpleaſure of ſo puiſſant a Society; and, that the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> which they now reckon to be in their dependence, will never have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to Cenſure this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their averſion may be to it.</p>
            <p>Thus they hope, that during this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and whiles all the World is as it were ſnorting, <hi>dum dormirent homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> this <hi>Cockle</hi> which they have ſown in the field of the <hi>Church</hi> will take root, and in time get ſtrength: There they will leave it to ripen, and, as they uſe to ſay, <hi>relinquent tempori maturandum,</hi> and, when it ſhall be arriv'd to full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, produce the natural Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that muſt neceſſarily ſpring from it. At preſent, indeed, they do but ſay onely, One <hi>may</hi> believe <hi>Particular Facts</hi> with a <hi>divine Faith</hi>; but they will ſhortly pronounce that men are <hi>bound</hi> to believe them; which will be very eaſie for them to eſtabliſh, becauſe it is but a neceſſary Conſequence of their <hi>Principle,</hi> ſince it is certain, that one may not believe any thing with a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93311:29"/>
               <hi>divine Faith</hi> but what truly is of <hi>divine Faith,</hi> and that what-ever is ſo ought to be believed with a <hi>divine Faith</hi> when it is ſufficiently propoſed to us. It ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them for the preſent, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> do not <hi>condemn</hi> this <hi>Opinion</hi>; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little while they will make the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> Approbators; according to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their <hi>Maximes,</hi>

They diſcourſe of nothing ſave <hi>this</hi> in all their Aſſemblies: the <hi>Formularie</hi> is almoſt the onely <hi>Canon</hi> which men are now oblig'd to obey: and the onely great Crime which is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd among the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their employments is, to but doubt of this <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> A ſmall grain of <hi>anti-Janſeniſm</hi> purges all kinds of defects, as the leaſt degree of Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Point ſullies all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues: ſo as the moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way for one to make his fortune is, to appear ſomething zealous for the <hi>Formularie</hi>; be the man never ſo Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or Scandalous, this zeal ſupplies and covers all.

to hear them ſpeak as if all <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> depended on it, and the whole State were concern'd; ſo that there happen no Inundations, Tempeſts, Storms, Shipwrecks, Poiſon or Plague which they do not attribute to this Foppery. But what does moſt of all ſurpriſe me (as I ſaid) is, that men ſhould thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere to be alwaies talking of the ſame thing, and of ſo mean a ſubject. For my own part, I proteſt to you, I am ſo tir'd with the <hi>Five Propoſitions,</hi> and with all that Diſpute, that their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it would be inſufferable to me, did I not look on the whole affair with a particular view, according to which it affords me a very ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; and I ſhall impart it to you. There is nothing, in my opinion, more wonderfull in all the hiſtories of the Ages paſt, or in what has happen'd in our own times, and of which we have been the ſpectators, then to contemplate the images of the Vanity of mens Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and withall to conſider the infinite troubles and agitations which the moſt inconſiderable Trifles have produc'd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93311:32"/>
amongſt them. Is it not (for example) a thing worthy of aſtoniſhment, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all the Kingdomes of the World engage themſelves in a Quarrel betwixt <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Antonius,</hi> the whole force of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> and neighbour States re-united in their Armies, and theſe Armies together by the ears near <hi>Actium</hi>; when one ſhall conſider that one Female was the ſole cauſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of this bloudy War, which was to decide who ſhould be maſter of the Univerſe, and abſolutely aboliſh the whole frame of the <hi>Roman</hi> State? This ſignal event, and which drew ſuch a conſequent after it, had for its beginning but the face of a Woman; and but for this weak paſſion <hi>Antony</hi> had taken other meaſures, and in all probability nothing of what ſucceeded it had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd: though for my part I am glad it did, ſince by it I perceive what a piece of nothing Man is. <hi>Antonius,</hi> whiles he makes the whole World depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, does himſelf depend and dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſilly Woman. See here the cauſe of all this ſtupendious Change, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious

image of the Vanity of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs.</p>
               <p>You ſhall reade in ſome of the <hi>Indian</hi> Hiſtories, that one white <hi>Elephant</hi> was the cauſe of the death of five or ſix great <hi>Princes,</hi> and of the deſolation of ſeveral <hi>Kingdomes.</hi> There was, among others, a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Pegu</hi> who aſſembled an Army conſiſting of a million of men, in which there were three thouſand <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,</hi> five thouſand <hi>Elephants,</hi> and two hundred thouſand <hi>Horſes,</hi> to take this <hi>Beaſt</hi> from the King of <hi>Siam.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the whole Country of this poor <hi>King,</hi> ruin'd his chief City, which was twice as large as ours of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in fine forc'd him to kill himſelf after the loſs of his whole Empire; and all this but for <hi>one</hi> white <hi>Elephant.</hi> Yet had this Conquerour <hi>three</hi> already, he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only a <hi>fourth</hi> for his Coach, and to procure <hi>that,</hi> he brought a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to deſolation.</p>
               <p>We commonly look upon theſe Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories as on the Follies and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Barbarians</hi>; but, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould think otherwiſe of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93311:33"/>
them. I find nothing in them but what ſeems very worthy of Men, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly proportionable to the ſtretch of their fancy, and ſo much the leſs vain, as indeed they ſerve to diſcover to us the vanity and emptineſs of all thoſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes which the world, forſooth, would make paſs for ſo glorious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine, <hi>Sir,</hi> that theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are onely to be met withall in prophane Hiſtories, as if <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> were exempted from them. This were not rightly to underſtand in what eſtate God has decreed it ſhould yet remain in the world, which makes S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that the Creature is ſubject to Vanity; <hi>Vanitati creatura ſubjecta eſt.</hi> She is yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> mingled with good and bad, Chaff and Corn; and ſo mingled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Chaff is a great deal more viſible then the Wheat. Nor are thoſe who govern her alwaies true <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; they are oftentimes, ſaies S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> ſuffers to aſcend the thrones
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93311:34"/>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> to render them <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of his indignation. In fine, there is ever amongſt the honeſteſt men ſome mixture of weakneſs, which they draw from their natural corruption, amongſt thoſe ſolid benefits which they receive from <hi>God.</hi> We are not therefore to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if amidſt this multitude of <hi>Carnal</hi> men who fill the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and the remanent defects of the moſt <hi>Spiritual,</hi> we find inſtances of all humane diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Were there nothing but what were edifying and ſerious in the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhe would (as one might ſay) be too viſible and eaſie to be diſcerned; by which the Faith of thoſe who adhere and ſubmit themſelves to her ſhould not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exerciz'd: But <hi>God,</hi> having by a juſt judgement left her alwaies ſufficient marks whereby to make her known to all humble and rational ſpirits, is pleas'd to obſcure her to the proud, and ſuch as are carried away by the image of thoſe viſible diſorders to look on her as upon an humane Aſſembly which does no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe govern her ſelf then other Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93311:34"/>For this reaſon it is that <hi>God</hi> permits that great troubles ſhould be rais'd for things of no moment, as well in the <hi>Church</hi> as in temporal States. What was there (for example) more vain then the fancy which mov'd <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Writings of three Authors, for which he turn'd the whole <hi>Oriental Church</hi> topſy-turvy, and the Weſtern too, <hi>per ſuperfluas Quaeſtiones,</hi> as <hi>Pope Pelagius</hi> II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> expreſſes it? and to what did all tend, but to the tormenting of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the baniſhing of ſome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of others, the exciting of a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and all this to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? For however this <hi>Emperor</hi> had caus'd his Opinion to be approv'd by a General <hi>Council</hi> and divers <hi>Popes</hi>; yet did all which was at that time done come to nothing of it ſelf a little while after, ſince it both is and alwaies was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that men might believe what they pleas'd touching thoſe Authors Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. So true it is, that <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> are not to be determin'd but by Reaſon and Truth, and not by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:93311:35"/>But ſuch is the frequent concluſion of ſuch enterpriſes: They ſeem to ſucceed for a time, and ſoon after diſſipate and vaniſh of themſelves. But the miſery is, that men have commonly their ſpirits ſo narrow, they cannot ſtretch them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own Times. If they ſpie a Tempeſt coming againſt ſome particular <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> they preſently give all for loſt, and that ſuch as ſucceed after them will judge of it juſt as they do by the preſent face of the Storm which terrifies them. I cannot but ſtrangely wonder that Experience ſhould not yet diſabuſe them of this Illuſion, and teach them to diſtinguiſh ſolid and ſtable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which proceed from an inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of immutable Truths, from thoſe which ſpring onely from the blindneſs of a tranſitory Paſſion: ſince theſe ſort of Opinions are as variable as the Paſſions from whence they riſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at an end, but that which appear'd ſo important begins to ſeem horribly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and men are aſtoniſh'd that there ſhould ever have been any ſo ſimple as to have amus'd themſelves about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:93311:35"/>There's no queſtion but that when the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> were at a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves concerning the form of their <hi>Capuchon,</hi> when thoſe who would be call'd the <hi>Spiritual Brethren</hi> would have their Hood narrower, and the others which they nam'd the <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Communalty</hi> would have theirs of a larger ſize, they thought their diſpute wonderfull conſiderable: And in good earneſt the quarrel laſted almoſt a whole Age, with infinite heat and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſity on both ſides; being at laſt, with much adoe, determin'd by the <hi>Bulls</hi> of four <hi>Popes, Nicolas</hi> IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>Clement</hi> V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>John</hi> XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and <hi>Benedict</hi> XII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. But now it looks as if really it had been onely to make the World ſport, when men but mention this Diſpute; and I verily believe there is hardly a <hi>Cordelier</hi> at preſent that cares a ruſh for the ſize of his <hi>Capuchon.</hi> For ſo in truth a wiſe <hi>Frier</hi> would have ſaid when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt was at the higheſt, <hi>Let us but have patience a while, and we ſhall both be laught at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame might likewiſe have been

ſaid upon another <hi>Queſtion</hi> ſprung up about the ſame time, and which is of a nature ſo thin and aiery, that it almoſt vaniſhes with the touch.</p>
               <p>'Tis a certain truth, that what the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> eat or drink is as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd as that which is eaten or drank by thoſe who never made profeſſion of their <hi>Rule:</hi> This is undeniable. But there ſprung a <hi>Queſtion</hi> among them, Whether the <hi>Right</hi> to thoſe things which were ſo conſum'd by the Uſage, as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> appertain'd to them or not; or whether they had onely the ſimple <hi>Uſage</hi> of them without any <hi>Right.</hi> The greater part, perceiving this to be a certain degree of Perfection which coſt them nothing but their quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all <hi>right</hi> to thoſe things which they devour'd by the <hi>uſe,</hi> (ſince this renunciation did not at all hinder the <hi>uſage,</hi> for which they were onely intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) greedily embrac'd the opinion, That the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> had indeed but the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Uſage</hi> of things without any <hi>Title</hi> to them; That the <hi>Right</hi> appertain'd to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and that <hi>there</hi> was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93311:36"/>
the Poverty of which <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> gave them an Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicolas</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> made a <hi>Bull</hi> wholly advantageous to this pretenſion, and defin'd, That in effect they had but the ſimple <hi>Uſage,</hi> and that <hi>J. C.</hi> had given us the example of this perfect Poverty, which conſiſts in the general renunciation of all <hi>Right</hi> to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods.</p>
               <p>Thus continued matters for ſome time: The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> ate and drank as well as other men, though without <hi>right</hi> or <hi>title.</hi> But <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, who was of a fiercer humor, being rais'd to the <hi>Pontificate,</hi> found himſelf impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd with this unprofitable <hi>Right</hi> which the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> attributed to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> from whence he ſaw to come no profit, and therefore he took a fancy to end this <hi>Queſtion</hi> without any regard to the Deciſion of his predeceſſor <hi>Nicolas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cordeliers</hi> alarm'd at this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled in their general <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> held at <hi>Perouſe,</hi> ſolemnly proteſted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93311:37"/>
to adhere to the Definition of <hi>Pope Nicolas</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
               <p>But for all this, <hi>John</hi> took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe party, declaring by his Extravagant <hi>Ad conditorem,</hi> that he car'd not for this <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> and other things which they conſum'd by the <hi>uſage,</hi> ſince there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cru'd no profit by it to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the <hi>Cordelier Friers</hi> were never the poorer, and that their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was that none but themſelves ſhould derive any profit from it. <hi>Nec Fratrum ipſorum intentio fuerit quòd ad quemcumque<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alium quam ad Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres dictarum rerum perveniret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium.</hi> That it was a diſhonour that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſhould intereſs it ſelf for an <hi>Egg,</hi> or a piece of <hi>Cheeſe.</hi> That in things which they devour'd after that manner, the <hi>Uſage</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>uſage</hi> was not to be diſtinguiſh'd; and that all this aiery and ſpiritual refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was but a pure illuſion. In fine, he determin'd by the Extravagant, <hi>Cùm inter nonnullos,</hi> &amp;c. That it was a plain <hi>Hereſie</hi> to affirm that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93311:37"/>
nothing in this World, neither in particular nor in common, and that he ſhould have no title to the things which he uſed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Deciſions of <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> appear'd quite repugnant to thoſe of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and the difference did ſo perplex <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin,</hi> as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally profeſs'd they were not to be throughly reconcil'd.</p>
               <p>He acknowledg'd that <hi>Nicolas</hi> the IV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> did teach that one might ſeparate the <hi>Right</hi> from the <hi>Uſage</hi>; and that <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had declar'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>He confeſs'd alſo that <hi>Nicolas</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd that this is a holy Poverty; and on the other ſide, that <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> look'd upon it as Hypocriſie. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two points, unluckily takes the part of <hi>Nicolas</hi> againſt <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as in the third point that concerns the Poverty of <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Opinion is tax'd of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> by <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; that the two <hi>Popes</hi> ſhould not ſeem at variance in a point of <hi>Faith,</hi> he endeavours to piece
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93311:38"/>
them together by diſtinguiſhing of the times.</p>
               <p>He ſaies therefore that <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> did poſſeſs Temporal things at one time, and that he was abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd of them at another: That ſo it is true, that as to one ſeaſon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd us an example of perfect Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, by an abſolute renunciation of the poſſeſſion of all things, as ſaies <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi>; and that it is as true, he at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time poſſeſs'd temporal goods which he made uſe of, as <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> had decided it.</p>
               <p>But this way of according the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the two <hi>Popes</hi> does not appear ſo ſolid: For <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> does not pretend that <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> was maſter of the temporal things he us'd at <hi>one</hi> certain time <hi>onely,</hi> but that he was <hi>ſo</hi> alwaies; as appears by the general principle which he makes uſe of to prove it, which is, That the <hi>Uſage</hi> is unjuſt which is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Right:</hi> Whence it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inferr'd, That <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> having made uſe of temporal things, and never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us'd them injuſtly, he had alwaies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93311:38"/>
a <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But however the matter was, divers of the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> did not take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be juſtly condemn'd, and maugre the <hi>Pope,</hi> they obſtinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that their Bread belong'd to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; ſo as the <hi>Emperor Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being then at variance with the <hi>Pope</hi> about his Election to the <hi>Empire,</hi> they joyn'd themſelves to him, and ſtoutly ſuſtain'd his right againſt <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. The <hi>Emperor</hi> on his part upheld the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> reproching to the <hi>Pope</hi> as a foul Errour his Deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the Poverty of <hi>J<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſumme, the animoſity of both theſe <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> came at laſt to that height; that the <hi>Pope</hi> (according to the ſtyle of that Age) <hi>excommunicated</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> declar'd him <hi>Heretick,</hi> favourer of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> depos'd him from the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> and caus'd all the poor <hi>Cordeliers</hi> to be burnt that he could lay hands on. On the other ſide, the <hi>Emperor</hi> enters <hi>Italy</hi> with a puiſſant Army, ſeizes on <hi>Rome,</hi> declares <hi>Pope John</hi> (then at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon</hi>) unworthy of the <hi>Pontificate</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:93311:39"/>
creates a new <hi>Pope,</hi> or rather <hi>Anti-pope,</hi> namely a <hi>Cordelier</hi> call'd <hi>Peter Ramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus</hi> of <hi>Corbaria,</hi> who choſe the title of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and who for the firſt action of his <hi>Pontificate</hi> vacated the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> againſt the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> himſelf excommunicating and depoſing him.</p>
               <p>But as all this proceeding was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and violent, our pretended <hi>Pope</hi> could not maintain himſelf againſt <hi>John</hi> XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, but was in concluſion deliver'd up to him; yet did not this determine the difference, there were after this <hi>Appeals</hi> to the <hi>Council,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications</hi> againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and ſuch an infinity of Procedures of <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> againſt the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> who were by this time revolted all the world over, and eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> that it would here be too long to reherſe the particulars. And thus was the ſucceſs of this pleaſant <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whether the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> were owners of the <hi>bread</hi> which they <hi>ate:</hi> For ſo it pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to humble mens pride, by ſuffering them to bring the greateſt Trifles to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93311:39"/>
very height and greateſt of extremities; and by <hi>that</hi> to let them ſee that they were all but mere Vanity themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus it is we judge of things at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe <hi>we</hi> are now free'd from thoſe paſſions which did <hi>then</hi> diſturb them; but then it was that they paſs'd for very ſerious matters indeed, and it had not haply been ſafe to have laugh'd at them. There's no doubt but it will be juſt ſo with our preſent Diſputes, and that within theſe <hi>fifty years</hi> they will all be put among the <hi>long Hoods,</hi> and the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cheeſe</hi> of the <hi>Cordeliers.</hi> Verily, I have long ſince had theſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> in my thoughts, and have look'd upon them as equally expedient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to us the trifling folly of mens imaginations: The ſole difference which I can find is, that there are in the preſent controverſie very many things leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable then in the others which I have alledg'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For in earneſt there is ſome real difference between a <hi>large Hood</hi> and a <hi>narrow Hood</hi>; but 'tis not poſſible to find any between the <hi>Orthodox Faith</hi>

               <p n="3">3. It is manifeſt that in the diſpute 'twixt <hi>John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,</hi> they could fix no reproch of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> but upon certain Points contain'd in the <hi>Scripture</hi>; and therefore this <hi>Pope</hi> expreſsly diſtinguiſh'd the <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> concerning the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> to temporal things from that of the Poverty of <hi>J.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93311:41"/>
to acknowledge a pure and ſimple <hi>Fact,</hi> which every body knows cannot be eſtabliſh'd or proved by <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſumme, they diſputed in thoſe daies in good earneſt, <hi>Pope John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> making them very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he meant, and ſubtily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the others reaſons without at all diſſembling them, or making as if he did not comprehend them: But in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> difference all the addreſs is made to conſiſt in ſaying nothing that is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. They perpetually talk of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi>; but what is this <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius?</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Myſterie</hi> which is forbidden to be revealed. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Annat</hi> one day endeavour'd to doe it, but was like to have ſpoil'd all; for 'twas told him, that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd what he call'd the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius:</hi> ſo there was an end of the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> And ſince that time men have been very tender of making any ſuch offers, keeping themſelves within the inſeparability of <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> for that the world, which underſtands none of theſe <hi>terms,</hi> are not aware of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93311:41"/>
abſurdity: If they were, they would be aſtoniſh'd that men ſhould preſume to publiſh ſuch an extravagance, ſince, in one word, 'tis as much as to ſay, that 'tis the ſame thing to affirm <hi>Janſenius</hi> has not taught thoſe <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> as to <hi>maintain</hi> in <hi>effect</hi> thoſe <hi>Propoſitions:</hi> and that to ſay a friend of ours has not kill'd a man, is all one as really to have kill'd a man.</p>
               <p>Behold here the ſole foundation of the <hi>Formularie,</hi> which thoſe who are the Authors of it have rais'd upon this <hi>Principle,</hi> That one cannot ſeparate matter of <hi>Fact</hi> from matter of <hi>Right.</hi> But ſince no humane Reaſon is able to ſuffer ſuch a violence upon it long, they have been forc'd to ſeek for other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts to defend that which they had done. Moſt of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> declaring in particular, that it is a moſt abſurd and ſtupid thing to confound <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> with <hi>Right,</hi> they pretend that they do not require our belief of the <hi>Fact:</hi> ſo as it ſeemed that after <hi>this</hi> there remain'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and all were at an end; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not the <hi>Right,</hi> nor require they our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93311:42"/>
belief of the <hi>Fact:</hi> and yet, for all this, the <hi>Hereſie</hi> remains intire, becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Hereſie</hi> conſiſts in nothing. For at the ſame moment that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge you not to believe the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> provided you declare that you do not believe it, you are become an <hi>Heretick</hi> without remedy. There is therefore viſibly ſomething of more extraordinary in our diſputes then was in thoſe other Examples which I but now produced; but if the Vanity be equal, the Injuſtice is here incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the greater. And truly 'tis that which prevents a Reply I conceive ſome perſons of the World might make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, That they are verily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there is nothing more frivolous then all this Conteſtation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that all thoſe who have any thing to doe in it are equally ridiculous; it being as much a wonder there ſhould be people ſo obſtinate as to maintain that <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> are <hi>not</hi> to be found in a <hi>Book,</hi> as to ſee there are others ſo <hi>impudent</hi> to avow that they <hi>are</hi> there.</p>
               <p>But however this Judgement may
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93311:42"/>
conform to the humor of the men of the world, 'tis certainly moſt unjuſt in the <hi>reality</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi> For in differences which ſpring from mean and low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, the fault and the injuſtice is not alwaies of both parties; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes one may be perſecuted for a ridiculous matter, yet without being culpable or ridiculous. For Inſtance, <hi>Pope John</hi> the XXII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> having <hi>ſimply</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> to obey their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors</hi> as to the ſhape of their <hi>Hoods,</hi> they were doubtleſs to blame for their obſtinacy, though the thing in it ſelf were but a trifle: But if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to ſay and acknowledge that their <hi>Hoods</hi> were large when as indeed they were narrow, their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had been excuſable, and had they been perſecuted for ſo doing, they ought rather to have ſuffer'd patiently, then to have obey'd him. I affirm the ſame as to our Point in difference. If one ſhould ſay ſimply to ſuch as doubt whether the <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> are in the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> of <hi>Ypres</hi>'s Book, Speak no more to us of that, I ſhould blame them for their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93311:43"/>
diſobedience: But when they ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to <hi>acknowledge</hi> that thoſe <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> are in <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Book, and to condemn them <hi>too</hi> in his <hi>ſenſe,</hi> they might reaſonably reply, We do not know what that <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> means which you would have us to condemn, nor can we poſſibly meet with thoſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> in all his Book: If they ſhould perſecute them for this, the Perſecution would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prove but ignominious to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it. And the reaſon is plain, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis never a ſmall and mean thing to be ſincere, be the matter or ſubject never ſo ſmall in which one ought to appear ſincere. So as all the evil in theſe rencontres reflects on thoſe onely who would conſtrain men to render to their Opinion in ſuch frivolous <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſince 'tis in their power not to doe it; whiles 'tis not ſo with perſons of honour and integrity, to diſſemble what they believe, be the matter never ſo inconſiderable.</p>
               <p>But I think all knowing perſons will judge more equitably of the matter,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93311:43"/>
and that if Perſecution be deſtin'd for one party, the deriſion will fall to the ſhare of the other. This is the ſenſe which, for ought I perceive, all diſcreet men are of at preſent. And therefore I believe I ſhall find but too many of opinion with me, who will look on all this affair as upon a Picture of the baſeneſs of men. I could onely wiſh that they did enlarge their proſpect a little farther, and diſcover the malice of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who ſerves himſelf of this <hi>Chimaera</hi> for the raiſing of infinite real evils to the <hi>Church</hi>; and, on the other ſide, the ſecret diſpenſation of <hi>God,</hi> who permits ſo many funeſt and unlucky conſequences to ſpring from ſo frivolous an occaſion. For 'tis a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious thing but to conſider the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which this unfortunate conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has already produc'd, and what it is yet likely to bring forth. Hitherto they have made uſe of it only to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance all ſorts of licentiouſneſs, and to render uſeleſs all thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> who may be found able to oppoſe it. In the mean time all kind of <hi>Zeal</hi> for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93311:44"/>
purity of <hi>Manners</hi> is become ſuſpected; nor is it now poſſible to doe any thing that is ſolidly good, but one is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately accus'd of this <hi>Imaginary He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</hi> Thus is this <hi>Affair,</hi> ſo far as it has reſpect to <hi>men</hi> at leaſt, a perfect <hi>image</hi> of their Vanity; on the <hi>Devil</hi>'s part, a ſubtile addreſs and contrivance of his Malice; and as it concerns <hi>God Almighty,</hi> a terrible judgment of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> who is pleas'd to exerciſe his <hi>Church,</hi> by this impertinent Diſpute, with one of his moſt rigorous Chaſtiſements.</p>
               <p>I perceive that to ſatisfie you intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I muſt be forced to adde to theſe reflexions of mine on the preſent ſtate of our affairs, ſome conjectures what may in likelihood be the event of it hereafter. See then the <hi>Prophecie,</hi> which I think one may ſafely pronounce, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something I believe there is of <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> in the ſucceſs of this Conteſt, and ſomething of very <hi>uncertain.</hi> It is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> whether it will long continue, or be quickly at an end; there are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions for both: Matters are too
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93311:44"/>
far engag'd to conclude ſo ſuddenly; and they are again too mean to ſubſiſt long. But what appears moſt evident is, that in all appearance they will within a while change face. This generation will paſs, the Diſputers of either part muſt ſhortly go to their long home, <hi>in domum aeternitatis ſuae,</hi> and there will ſpring up another generation of men who will not be concern'd with our Paſſions; and it is certain <hi>then,</hi> that all this Controverſie will paſs but for a <hi>Comedy</hi> and a vain amuſement; that they will conceive a juſt indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Authors</hi> of all theſe Troubles, ſo frivolous in their cauſe, and ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in their event; and that they will commiſerate a world of gallant and ſober men, who in another <hi>Age</hi> would have been reverenc'd, and which the preſent has treated with ſo much rigour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity.</p>

               <p>THE whole Affair of <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> is in the very bottom of it but a mere Trifle, think of it what you pleaſe; but there is no jeaſting in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> (whoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you lately tranſmitted to me) has unworthy deſigns on foot, and he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends nothing leſs then to engage both the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> in the unjuſt Paſſions of his <hi>Society.</hi> 'Twere time the buſineſs were therefore well look'd after, and to prevent it if poſſible.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not now, whether the matter in controverſie be tractable, or ſo wild that there's no medling with it. The end of writing ſhould not be to divert the World and make it ſport, but to inform it of things which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns men to know. And therefore one ſhould leſs regard upon this occaſion the Niceneſs of thoſe perſons who reject all things that require any ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93311:45"/>
then the Utility of thoſe who have need that we untangle certain <hi>terms</hi> which impede them, and may poſſibly engage them into dangerous ſurpriſes. But ſince the Father <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> begins to ſignalize himſelf in this Affair, 'twere good one knew what he were, that ſo we be not miſtaken; for we ſhould deceive our ſelves to take him for an ordinary <hi>Jeſuite.</hi> I aſſure you the <hi>Society</hi> do not look upon him for ſuch, ſince they put it in his head, and have intruſted him with their moſt important affair, which is the <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Janſeniſm.</hi> But otherwiſe, he is a <hi>Diſciple</hi> and a particular friend of F. <hi>Annat</hi>'s: And there be ſome people ſay, that this Father invited him to <hi>Paris in ſpem futurae Succeſsionis,</hi> and with endeavour to reſign a place to him, which he looks upon as a benefit of his <hi>Society.</hi> I referre my ſelf to the matter it ſelf. But certain it is, that he has done quite the contrary to what he promis'd at <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> when they began to treat concerning an Agreement.</p>
               <p>The Agreement <hi>there</hi> was, <hi>That
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93311:46"/>
they ſhould not ſtand upon the ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the matter of Fact, nor the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularie, but onely a reſpectfull Silence,</hi> according to the proper terms of the Project which <hi>M. de Comenges</hi> ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> written with his own hand, and bearing this Title, <hi>The Project of the Accommodation concerted between the Biſhop of</hi> Comenges <hi>and Father</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier <hi>the Jeſuite.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Father</hi> has ſo dextrouſly manag'd his negotiation, that he has brought it to this paſs, that it ſhould not ſuffice to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Formularie.</hi> Perhaps he has taken another <hi>reſolution</hi> by the way, and another <hi>Conſcience</hi> too, it may be. For your <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Probabilitie</hi> (ſuch as is the Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> who has written a book of it) have this <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> They change their <hi>Conſcience</hi> as men do their <hi>Clothes,</hi> and as the Rules of this Doctrine permit them: ſo as they have one for <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> another for <hi>Paris,</hi> and another for <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not wonder at all, <hi>Sir,</hi> if this aſtoniſh you, for it is indeed moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: But you are to underſtand, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93311:46"/>
theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> are a Corporation within themſelves, who have their <hi>Laws,</hi> their <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Reaſonings</hi> quite different from thoſe of other people; ſo as the ſurpriſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mutual on both ſides. The <hi>World</hi> is aſtoniſh'd when they hear the <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes</hi> which they teach; and they as much wonder when they learn that the world does by no means approve of them. You were ſurpriz'd when I told you of the change of Conſcience which theſe <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> permit, and which they name <hi>Mutatio dictaminis</hi>; and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> were amaz'd alſo when Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Coton</hi> publickly declar'd, that as he maintain'd in <hi>France</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> was not <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>Pope</hi> in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> ſo he would affirm the <hi>contrary</hi> if he were at <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Caramuel</hi> is wonderfully troubled that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ſhould make any ſcruple at this double <hi>Conſcience</hi> of F. <hi>Coton</hi>'s, and therefore does handſomly and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintain it in his <hi>Fundamental Theologie,</hi> n. 194. That F. <hi>Coton</hi> is no-waies to be blam'd for having in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93311:47"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> embrac'd the opinion of the <hi>French</hi> concerning the Independence of <hi>Kings,</hi> and at the ſame time to have declar'd, that he ſhould change his <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent</hi> when he chang'd the <hi>Country,</hi> and that being at <hi>Rome</hi> he would be of the opinion that they were of at <hi>Rome.</hi> For this ſame <hi>chopping</hi> of <hi>probable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is ſo certainly indulged, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Caramuel,</hi> that he aſſures us 'tis as clear as the Sun at noon: <hi>Theſim iſtam</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>judico luce meridianâ clariorem,</hi> n. 285. <hi>Edit. Francoford.</hi> So as the poor <hi>Parliament,</hi> who took it ſeems offence at it, muſt needs be more blind then thoſe who at mid-day ſee no light.</p>
               <p>'Tis a prodigious thing, (ſaies one in the world) that the <hi>Jeſuite L' Amy</hi> ſhould dare teach that it is lawfull for a <hi>Religious man</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> any who ſhall but <hi>mean</hi> the <hi>publiſhing</hi> of the notorious <hi>Crimes</hi> of his <hi>Society,</hi> if there be no other means to hinder him: and that 'tis <hi>ſtrange,</hi> according to <hi>Caramuel,</hi> that any one in the world ſhould ſcruple at this pious doctrine of F. <hi>L' Amy</hi>; ſince
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93311:47"/>
it is not onely (ſaies he) <hi>probable,</hi> but the <hi>contrary improbable</hi> in the opinion of all the learned Caſuiſts. <hi>Doctrinam Amici ſolum probabilem, &amp; contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am improbabilem cenſemus omnes docti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was not an unprofitable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſeeing it ſerves to inform us what there is contain'd in the quality of your <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and which is one of the moſt conſpicuous of F. <hi>Ferrier</hi>'s; for this <hi>Father</hi> is a wonderfull <hi>Caſuiſt.</hi> And by this one may judge, that it is not altogether unlikely, but that as he came to <hi>Paris</hi> under pretence of pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the differences of the <hi>Divines,</hi> ſo he now promotes the ſame differences to the end he may ſtill <hi>continue</hi> there. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Probability</hi> and of ſhifting <hi>Conſcience</hi> may well be allow'd to goe ſo far, becauſe the <hi>prime Rule</hi> which it follows is <hi>Utility.</hi> Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly theſe <hi>Provincial Jeſuites</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it very <hi>profitable</hi> to come to <hi>Paris</hi> when they are <hi>not</hi> there, and to <hi>dwell</hi> there when they once <hi>are.</hi> What-ever it be, to tell you in one word who this Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> is; You muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93311:48"/>
he is a great <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> a great <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> and a great friend of F. <hi>Annat:</hi> he does all by correſponding with him, is his prime <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and the <hi>depoſitary</hi> of his moſt reſerved and ſecret thoughts; ſo that he is to be conſider'd as a perſon totally il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with all that is in F. <hi>Annat:</hi> and when you ſpeak of F. <hi>Annat,</hi> you have ſaid all; for who ſhould know any thing of this buſineſs, if he do not?</p>
               <p>He is the ſole Author of this <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularie</hi> that has made ſuch a noiſe. The late <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Tolouſe</hi> was onely his property, and therefore it behov'd him to know what he thought when he did it, and on what grounds he ſettled it. He is the principal inſtigator of all thoſe perſecutions which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to this pretended <hi>Hereſie.</hi> He therefore ought to know it better then any man, and is the moſt capable to teach others to know it alſo: And it is indeed what the Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> pretends to effect by his orders, and what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by the very <hi>Title</hi> that he has given to this flying ſheet, THE TRUE IDEA OF JANSENISM.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:93311:48"/>He is to let us ſee that it is not an <hi>Imaginary Hereſie,</hi> as they have ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently publiſh'd, but an <hi>Hereſie</hi> in good earneſt: and in effect the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which he gathers from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe whom he accuſes are very real ones; for he cauſes them to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> and overwhelm'd by the <hi>Royal power</hi>; and theſe are indeed conſequences to the purpoſe. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is whether the Principles thereof be alſo ſolid: for it were a very ſtrange thing, if they ſhould have no other ſupport for theſe ſevere Concluſions but viſible Falſities and palpable Equivocations. Doubtleſs men are never more concern'd to reaſon diſcreetly, then when they are upon poſitive reſolutions of baniſhing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>

               <p>If it ſhould then appear that the whole Writing of F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> is but a mere extravagancy of ſpirit without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, what may one conclude of the Raſhneſs of this <hi>Father</hi> and of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-<hi>Jeſuites?</hi> and what are we to think of an <hi>Hereſie</hi> which is founded
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93311:49"/>
onely upon theſe Imaginations?</p>
               <p>But to underſtand them rightly, we are to conſider the ſtate of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute when F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> did firſt enter upon it, and began to publiſh to the World his new lights.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> accus'd the <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> becauſe they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> in the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius:</hi> and theſe <hi>Divines</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that this reproch was a viſible, criminal and inexcuſable Calumny: nor did they content themſelves to have ſaid it, they prov'd it by a <hi>reaſon</hi> which is without contradiction.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Hereſie</hi> does conſiſt in a certain preciſe and determinate <hi>Dogme</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the verity of <hi>Faith</hi> reveal'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> and which may be known and expreſs'd indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from the name of the Author; ſince all the <hi>Verities</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evous</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf, though they are not often oppos'd till a long while after the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation. So that as theſe <hi>Verities</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> were Truths long e're they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93311:49"/>
were oppos'd; ſo the <hi>Errours</hi> which were repugnant to theſe <hi>Truths</hi> were doubtleſs <hi>Errours</hi> before any man had the boldneſs to maintain them.</p>
               <p>This we generally find in all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi> is an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>; but it does not conſiſt in the <hi>vain</hi> and indeterminate words of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Arius,</hi> but in this particular <hi>Poſition</hi> or Opinion, that the <hi>Son</hi> is not <hi>conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial</hi> with the <hi>Father.</hi> It is the very ſame in all the reſt: They <hi>all</hi> maintain a <hi>peculiar</hi> and diſtinct <hi>Dogme</hi> indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi>; and when we do not know the <hi>Opinion</hi> any more, we ſay that we know the <hi>Hereſie</hi> no more; and if a man had <hi>never</hi> known it, he might well ſay that it <hi>never</hi> was.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient, ſay the <hi>Divines,</hi> to repell that unjuſt Reproch which they fling upon us, of being ſectators of a new <hi>Hereſie:</hi> For we ſincerely proteſt, that we intirely acquieſce in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Univerſal Church</hi>; that we embrace, without the leaſt reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the <hi>Dogms</hi> which She propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to us as of <hi>Faith</hi>; that we ſubmit
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93311:50"/>
all our Underſtanding and Reaſon to her; and that our hearts do not at all accuſe us of holding any Doctrine which is repugnant to her Deciſions: ſo as we can ſay before <hi>God</hi> with confidence upon this ſubject, <hi>Iniquitatem ſi aſpexi in corde meo, non exaudiet Dominus.</hi> We do not conceal our ſenſe, but are ready to referre it to the <hi>Pope</hi> and to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and to accept them for our <hi>Judges:</hi> We have offer'd it ſeveral times, and have this conſolation, that thoſe who are the moſt prejudic'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, have nothing to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. In fine, we are ſo far from embracing any particular Doctrine on the <hi>Five Propoſitions,</hi> that though we do not acknowledge the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> for the <hi>Rules</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> yet it is moſt true that we hold no Opinion upon the matter of the <hi>Five Propoſitions,</hi> which they dare publickly accuſe of <hi>Hereſie</hi> before the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How clear and ingenuous, <hi>Sir,</hi> is this Declaration, how truly <hi>Catholick</hi> and exceedingly remote from all ſuſpicion of <hi>Hereſie?</hi> and that not onely for
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93311:50"/>
acquitting theſe perſons of Errours, but for ſhewing that they could not be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> if without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſent they ſhould haply fall into ſome <hi>Errour</hi>; ſince all the world knows that the crime of <hi>Hereſie</hi> does not conſiſt ſimply in the <hi>Errour,</hi> but in the <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>dwell</hi> in an <hi>Errour</hi> againſt the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now how is it poſſible that theſe people ſhould impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently maintain an <hi>Errour</hi> they are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ignorant of, againſt a judgement of the <hi>Church</hi> which they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of?</p>
               <p>But this does not ſatisfie the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and becauſe they do not find their reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning in it, they continue their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Hereſie:</hi> and this is it which has oblig'd the <hi>Divines</hi> to give them this defiance, and which is certainly very urging; Either ſet the <hi>Hereſie</hi> you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us diſtinctly and clearly down; or acknowledge your ſelves <hi>Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> for accuſing us of an <hi>Hereſie</hi> which you cannot tell what to make of.</p>
               <p>On this it is that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93311:51"/>
reveal'd the <hi>Myſterie</hi> of their <hi>Politicks,</hi> and the whole ſecret of the <hi>Hereſie.</hi> In ſtead of endeavouring to ſet down &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the <hi>Poſitions,</hi> a thing which upon trial did never ſucceed with them; they intrench themſelves, and have recourſe to the uncertain expreſſion of the <hi>Senſe</hi> and of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther advance: You hold (ſay they) the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> to be <hi>Catholick</hi>; the <hi>Pope</hi> declares it <hi>heretical</hi>; behold then your <hi>Hereſie.</hi> But as they had to doe with perſons ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well prepar'd to defend themſelves, ſo never was there an <hi>Equivocation</hi> unriddled as this has been. They told F. <hi>Annat</hi> in expreſs terms, that this was a <hi>Scholaſtical Sophiſm,</hi> unworthy an old <hi>Logician,</hi> as he was. <hi>Nunquámne intelliges, Dialectice ſenex, puerile ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentationis vitium?</hi> and they prov'd it well too: For ſome of them, it ſeems, condemn his <hi>Senſe</hi> and his <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>heretical,</hi> whiles others defend it for <hi>Catholick,</hi> without the leaſt difference between them concerning <hi>Faith</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the ſame preciſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93311:51"/>
                  <hi>Senſe</hi> which is thus condemn'd by ſome, and approv'd by others, though they both of them call it by the ſame name; and that is but what we daily meet with in the different explication of an <hi>Author.</hi> For there is ever in theſe encounters this oppoſition of <hi>words,</hi> that ſome affirm the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of an Author to be <hi>Catholick,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that 'tis <hi>heretical</hi>; though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them diſagree touching the true <hi>Faith.</hi> The <hi>Fifth Council</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Theodoret</hi> to be impious and <hi>heretical:</hi> Father <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and many other <hi>Jeſuites</hi> deny it; are they therefore againſt the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Council?</hi> By no means; ſince they defend <hi>Theodoret</hi> but by interpreting him after another way then did the <hi>Council,</hi> and by giving him a <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> ſenſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis the very ſame caſe in the preſent Diſpute. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſaies the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>heretical</hi>; other men ſay, We find no ſuch matter in <hi>Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> The <hi>words</hi> have indeed an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of contrariety, but without
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93311:52"/>
                  <hi>implying</hi> the leaſt contrariety of <hi>Faith</hi>; foraſmuch as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which theſe <hi>Divines</hi> maintain to be <hi>Catholick</hi> and of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> is not certainly the ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> condemns for <hi>heretical</hi> and as being that of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> And the proof which they bring is <hi>deciſive.</hi> We do not (ſay they) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on the matter of the <hi>Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> any thing ſave the Doctrine of <hi>Grace efficacious</hi> alone, as 'tis held by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and by the whole <hi>School</hi> of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> Now 'tis clear that the <hi>Pope</hi> does no-where condemn this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> as he makes all the <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and indeed as both the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> themſelves do accord. It is then certain that the <hi>Pope</hi> does not condemn that which we underſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>; as we likewiſe do not hold what the <hi>Pope</hi> condemns under theſe terms; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this <hi>Doctrine</hi> excepted, we have nothing at all to doe with the reſt, but reject it in <hi>general,</hi> as we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe in <hi>particular,</hi> when-ever the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall pleaſe to <hi>deſcribe</hi> it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93311:52"/>
in <hi>particular,</hi> or to ſhew us <hi>where</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>And thus you have the whole <hi>ſtate</hi> of this <hi>ten-years</hi> Diſpute; The <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> ſtand to their ſenſe of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and all men that will may perceive the Illuſion and <hi>Equivocation</hi> of the <hi>terms.</hi> But in fine, F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> is come up from the very fartheſt part of all <hi>Languedoc</hi> to the aid of his <hi>Confraternity,</hi> and has been choſen by F. <hi>Annat</hi> to publiſh this <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and to anſwer all thoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which made it plainly out that it is but a mere <hi>Chimaera:</hi> but eſpecially, he undertook to replie to the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Juſt Complaints,</hi> which expreſsly clears this <hi>Equivocation</hi> of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> Now therefore it is that we ſhall ſhortly come to know in what this <hi>wondrous Hereſie</hi> conſiſts, or elſe we muſt never hope to underſtand it whiles we live.</p>
               <p>What ſaies this Reverend <hi>Father</hi> to us then? <hi>That 'tis expedient to publiſh the true Idea of Janſeniſm:</hi> in effect 'tis very <hi>expedient,</hi> and there it was it ſhould indeed have been begun. For
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93311:53"/>
'tis a wondrous ſtrange thing, that men ſhould make ſuch a noiſe about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which no body yet underſtands. <hi>And alſo</hi> (ſaies F. <hi>Ferrier) becauſe theſe Divines complain in their Writings that we accuſe them of an Hereſie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to determine what it is, I find my ſelf oblig'd to ſay their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are very unjuſt. It has been told them a thouſand times over that their Hereſie conſiſts in their belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and maintaining that the Doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>on the Five Propoſitions is Catholick, although the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it for Heretical: which is</hi> (quoth he, pag. 3.) <hi>a true Queſtion of Right, that preſuppoſes matter of Fact,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> Janſenius <hi>eſtabliſhes ſome Doctrine in his</hi> Auguſtine: <hi>and in this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one cannot divide the Fact from the Right; that is to ſay, one cannot hold the Doctrine which is condemn'd for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, and at the ſame moment main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Doctrine of</hi> Janſenius <hi>upon theſe Propoſitions not to be the ſame which the Popes have condemn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all the illumination that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93311:53"/>
F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> affords us upon this point, and to which all his <hi>Colours</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. After this 'tis to no purpoſe to hope for any other, either from him, or from any elſe. He has done his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, was too far engag'd, and we are not to believe that any body will ever be able to out-doe him. But in earneſt, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'tis an Abuſe beyond all humane patience, to promote (as F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> does here) a thing ſo inviſible as is this <hi>Hereſie</hi> without <hi>Dogme</hi>; and to make as if he underſtood nothing of ſo many convincing reaſons, by which the falſity of this pretence has been made evident; to ſtand ſo obſtinately in an <hi>Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that has been ſo fully detected, and to repeat in cold bloud, ſeriouſly and gravely, Abſurdities which have been a hundred times overthrown, as if they were infallible <hi>Oracles.</hi> I profeſs to you, <hi>Sir,</hi> I know not what to think of all this; unleſs perhaps the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> may imagine, that being (as they are) pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull in the world, they may lawfully ſay and doe what they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as being no more ſubject (like
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93311:54"/>
other men) to the <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>common Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was there any need that F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> ſhould himſelf have diſcovered the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie</hi> of this <hi>Hereſie</hi> without <hi>Poſition,</hi> or, to ſay better, this <hi>Hereſie</hi> without <hi>Hereſie?</hi> Did not the Cordelier <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilé</hi> doe it before him, and fully as well? Every body derided it in this <hi>Frier,</hi> and ſo will they doe in this <hi>Jeſuite:</hi> ſo as if this be all that he has to doe at <hi>Paris,</hi> he may e'en goe back again to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince:</hi> His ſtaying at <hi>Paris</hi> will be no advantage to his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly blemiſh his Reputation.</p>
               <p>But, ſaies F. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> to underſtand whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi>; as it alſo is to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> be <hi>orthodox</hi> or not. But I maintain that whoever ſaies ſo, knows not what a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> or a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> ſignifies.</p>
               <p>We muſt doe all we can then to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate through theſe natural or volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Obſcurities of F. <hi>Ferrier</hi>; and after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93311:54"/>
this, if he render not up himſelf, I ſhall eſteem him for a <hi>deſperado.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are not to imagine that ſo ſoon as ever the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Heretical Doctrine</hi> come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> it is preſently a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Right</hi>; ſince if ſo, ſeveral Conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would likewiſe be reduc'd to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of <hi>Right,</hi> which are merely but of <hi>Fact,</hi> being expreſſed by theſe terms: And for inſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would affirm that there is a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> between the <hi>Fifth Council</hi> and Father <hi>Petavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Council</hi> condemns the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Theodoret</hi> as <hi>Heretical,</hi> and this <hi>Father</hi> maintains it to be <hi>Catholick</hi>; which in the language of F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> one would name a <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to know in very truth whether a <hi>Queſtion</hi> be of <hi>Right,</hi> or of <hi>Fact,</hi> or of <hi>both</hi> of them together, you are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider what both parties agree in, and what they conteſt: for 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the <hi>Queſtion</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does not fall upon that which is accorded, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on that which is diſputed. When therefore two perſons are agreed that a

certain <hi>Dogm</hi> or <hi>Poſition</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> and queſtion onely whether this <hi>Dogm</hi> be of ſuch an <hi>Author</hi> or not, the diſpute is onely concerning the matter of <hi>Fact.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and the <hi>Sixth Council</hi> do conſent that 'tis an <hi>Hereſie</hi> to ſay <hi>There is but one Will in J.

               </p>
               <p>When men agree on the <hi>contrary</hi> that an <hi>Author</hi> has taught a <hi>certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and the diſpute be whether this <hi>Doctrine</hi> be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>heretical,</hi> the Queſtion is of the <hi>Right,</hi> not the <hi>Fact</hi>; becauſe the <hi>Effect</hi> is agreed upon, and the <hi>Right</hi> is conteſted.

               <p>Whiles we dwell here, one ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to know whether theſe <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93311:56"/>
are of <hi>Fact</hi> or of <hi>Right:</hi> but we ſhall eaſily diſcover it by the ſame Rule.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> acknowledge with the <hi>Church</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of <hi>Grace efficacious of it ſelf</hi> for all good actions, was really S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s; but they reject this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as not true, at leaſt in regard to the <hi>inception</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> And the <hi>Church,</hi> on the contrary, maintains it againſt them, that it is both <hi>certain</hi> and very <hi>true,</hi> as well in reſpect of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as of all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Piety.</p>
               <p>So as ſince the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> was not conteſted, and that the diſpute was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> the whole <hi>Queſtion</hi> between the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> was purely concerning <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay with the <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>efficacious Grace per ſe</hi> is not true: but, as they are a great deal leſs ſincere then the <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> they adde, that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is not S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, which the <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> do not affirm. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93311:57"/>
agreed upon the <hi>Right</hi> with the <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> and differ onely upon the pure <hi>Fact:</hi> whereas they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accord with the <hi>Church</hi> about the <hi>Fact,</hi> nor the <hi>Right</hi>; though they conſent with her in this uncertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> is true; becauſe in particular they maintain that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Grace <hi>per ſe</hi> is falſe, and not S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, albeit the <hi>Church</hi> has ever acknowledged both the one and the other of theſe two Points.</p>
               <p>No wonder at all then, if in ſpeaking to perſons who were at variance, not about the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in general, but the <hi>particular Doctrine</hi> of efficacious Grace <hi>per ſe,</hi> it has been ſaid to them in a certain Writing, (which F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> has abus'd) <hi>That it was a Crime, an Attempt and an Hereſie to condemn the Doctrine of S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>of Hereſie, which the Church has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:</hi> foraſmuch as treating of the particular <hi>Dogm</hi> of <hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> they had reaſon to affirm that they could not brand it with Hereſie, without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93311:57"/>
in matter of <hi>Right</hi> and of <hi>Faith</hi>; whether one attacque it for not avowing it to be S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, as do the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi>; or acknowledg it for S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>'s, as did the <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> and as thoſe perſons would ſeem to doe to whom this Writing is directed.</p>
               <p>So that the difference which is 'twixt the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> upon the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> forms a direct Queſtion of <hi>Faith,</hi> together with a diſpute of <hi>Fact.</hi> And of the very ſame nature is that between the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> on the ſame <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi> For he attributing this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to S. <hi>Auguſtine, That God is the Author of Sin, and that he compells the Will to good and evil,</hi> the aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he makes of this general <hi>Propoſition,</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> is <hi>orthodox,</hi> does not excuſe him from a double <hi>Errour</hi> both of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Fact</hi>; ſince he takes that for a Truth which is an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and attributes to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a Blaſphemy which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely remote from his thoughts.</p>
               <p>But it may be that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93311:58"/>
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> might be purely of <hi>Fact</hi> from another ſuppoſition. For if a man led by a falſe perſuaſion, as was <hi>Calvin,</hi> that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> teaches <hi>God</hi> to be as well author of <hi>Sins</hi> as of <hi>Good actions,</hi> ſhould at the ſame time condemn the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> approves, and by a conſequent of this Opinion refuſe to acknowledg S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Doctrine to be <hi>orthodox</hi>; one could not juſtly accuſe him of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> in point of <hi>Faith,</hi> becauſe he ſhould condemn what the <hi>Church</hi> condemns; but of an extreme <hi>Temerity</hi> onely, to have father'd ſo impious an <hi>Opinion</hi> on S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But what would be ſtrange in this encounter is, That he who ſhould affirm in the ſenſe of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> were <hi>orthodox,</hi> would notwithſtanding be an <hi>Heretick,</hi> becauſe he did not doe it but as approving an <hi>Errour</hi> which he imputed to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>; whereas he that ſhould ſay, as this <hi>perſon</hi> does, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is not <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Catholick,</hi> becauſe he would ſay it without any <hi>Errour:</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93311:58"/>
ſo little regard there is to be had, to be able to judge whether a man be <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> or <hi>Heretick,</hi> and whether the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> concern matter of <hi>Right</hi> or of <hi>Fact,</hi> to theſe wild and indetermin'd <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> which approve or condemn anothers <hi>Doctrine</hi> without ſo much as ſhewing it.</p>
               <p>'Tis what S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has himſelf decided, and in reſpect to himſelf, by theſe words full of <hi>unction</hi> and charity: <hi>Whileſt men</hi> (ſaies he, L. 1. de Trinit. c. 3.) <hi>imagine that I have held ſome falſe Opinion in my Books, which in truth I never held, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn this Opinion; the law and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Charity advertiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me, but with an injunction full of ſweetneſs, to be rather willing to be reprov'd by him who condemns this Errour, in attributing it to me without reaſon, then to be prais'd by thoſe who would maintain this Errour, becauſe they believ'd I had taught it. For though the firſt did wrongfully, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute an Errour to me which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed; they had reaſon yet to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93311:59"/>
condemn it: But the others are under a double miſtake, ſince they praiſe me for an Opinion which the Truth condemns, and approve an Opinion which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that this perſon who ſhould thus impute an <hi>Errour</hi> to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would be oblig'd to ſay, that the <hi>Church</hi> has not compris'd it in approving of his <hi>Doctrine</hi>; which would be very raſh and ſcandalous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would ſay it <hi>without</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> all <hi>Reaſon:</hi> whereas there are ſome occaſions wherein one might doe the ſame thing without temerity or ſcandal, becauſe one does it not but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great reaſon: the only <hi>Rule</hi> for theſe kind of things being, That 'tis lawfull to doe them <hi>with Reaſon,</hi> but by no means <hi>without</hi> it. And therefore</p>
               <p>It is <hi>lawfull</hi> to accuſe of Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Sinueſſa,</hi> and it is <hi>not</hi> ſo in reference to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice:</hi> It is <hi>lawfull</hi> to ſay that <hi>Theodoret</hi> has been ill underſtood by the <hi>Sixth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> but it is <hi>not</hi> lawfull to ſay that <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was ſo by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Epheſus:</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93311:59"/>
It is <hi>lawfull</hi> to affirm that they did not underſtand the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Pope Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> in the VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Council,</hi> but it is <hi>not</hi> ſo of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Pope Leo</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which makes that <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe things are <hi>permitted,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> of them <hi>forbidden,</hi> is, that there is <hi>Reaſon</hi> to ſay it of <hi>ſome,</hi> but none at all to ſay it of the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that 'tis a very frail conſequence which F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> derives in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, That if it be <hi>lawfull</hi> to ſay the <hi>Pope</hi> did not well underſtand <hi>Janſenius</hi> in condemning <hi>him,</hi> one might as well ſay of the <hi>Church,</hi> that ſhe did not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in approving it; ſince it being not permitted to doe either of them without <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it were <hi>lawfull</hi> to doe both when <hi>Reaſon</hi> requir'd it. And the truth is, that one of them, which is, to affirm the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> was never throughly underſtood at <hi>Rome,</hi> is very <hi>lawfull,</hi> becauſe there is great <hi>Reaſon</hi> to believe it; and the other, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93311:60"/>
well comprehended, is very <hi>unlawfull,</hi> becauſe there is alſo no <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it; as will be demonſtrated in another Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>One cannot therefore know in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> whether it be <hi>lawfull</hi> or not to affirm that an <hi>Author</hi> has been <hi>ill underſtood</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> ſince it depends on the particular <hi>Reaſons</hi> which induce one to ſay it: Nor can one alſo know in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> whether thoſe who diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of an <hi>Author</hi> be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> or <hi>Heretical,</hi> are at variance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Right,</hi> or the <hi>Fact</hi>; ſince it may be upon <hi>either</hi> of them: but one may clearly underſtand it by examining in <hi>Particular</hi> what is agreed upon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, both by the one and the other.</p>
               <p>And hence it is they eaſily prove, that the preſent Conteſtation about the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is a pure <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Fact.</hi> For it would in truth prove a <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> if there were a certain preciſe <hi>Dogm</hi> maintain'd by ſome for <hi>Catholick,</hi> and condemn'd by others for <hi>heretical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing the contrary is true, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93311:60"/>
there is no preciſe and determin'd <hi>Dogm</hi> in the preſent Conteſtation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appears clearly from F. <hi>Ferrier</hi>'s not being able to <hi>ſpecifie</hi> any, 'tis viſible that the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi> is but concerning matter of <hi>Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> has not altogether fail'd of the promiſe which he makes in the Title of his <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> to preſent us with <hi>the true Idea of Janſeniſm.</hi> For this <hi>true Idea</hi> conſiſting in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Imaginary Hereſie,</hi> his Treatiſe is of excellent uſe for the forming of this <hi>Idea</hi>; ſince in <hi>Hereſie</hi> without <hi>Poſition,</hi> and without any <hi>Queſtion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Faith,</hi> (ſuch as is what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us) is the <hi>true Idea</hi> of an <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Hereſie.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, this is not his <hi>intention</hi> in it, but many times men doe things <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Nor was it doubtleſs his deſign, to ſhew us that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:</hi> how-ever one might invincibly prove it by an argument like that which he produces againſt the <hi>Divines</hi> whom he ſtrives to render <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He acknowledges no other matter of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93311:61"/>
                  <hi>Fact</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Deciſion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> on the <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> then this, <hi>Janſenius teaches ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on the Five Prepoſitions,</hi> which is certain: he will have all the reſt to be of <hi>Right</hi>; and thence concludes, That the <hi>Divines</hi> whom he accuſes, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this Fact, That <hi>Janſenius did teach ſome Dogm upon the Five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and yet refuſing to own that his <hi>ſenſe</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> deny a <hi>Right,</hi> and are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this argument be valid, behold the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> arrant <hi>Hereticks</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: For there is no more to be ſaid but the ſame, That it being certain the <hi>Sixth Council</hi> has condemn'd the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Honorius,</hi> this Deciſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends no other <hi>Fact</hi> then this, That <hi>Honorius teaches ſome Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Will of J. Chriſt,</hi> which is indubitable: and by conſequent the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> who do not deny this <hi>Fact,</hi> yet denying <hi>Honorius</hi>'s <hi>ſenſe</hi> to be <hi>hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> deny a <hi>Right,</hi> and are <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This obligation therefore the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:93311:61"/>
have to F. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> that he has made them rank <hi>Hereticks,</hi> if you will believe him. But it were yet a great charity to draw them out of this <hi>Hereſie</hi>; they have a world of others, where it is impoſſible to warrant them. The expedient is eaſie, it being onely to ſhew them after how extraordinary a manner their F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> is miſtaken. For it is very certain, the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> which he ſpecifies, That <hi>Janſenius</hi> has taught ſome <hi>Doctrine,</hi> is to be found in this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Heretical:</hi> But there yet occurrs another alſo very diſtinct and far ſeparate from <hi>Right,</hi> and which has been the whole ſubject of this Conteſtation; and this it is he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles.</p>
               <p>Perhaps F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> imagines, that when one ſubmits a Book to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to judge whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in it be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>heretical,</hi> 'tis ſufficient for him to know that the Book teaches ſome <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon a <hi>certain matter</hi>; and that thereupon addreſſing himſelf to <hi>God,</hi> he <hi>reveals</hi> to him, that this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93311:62"/>
of which he all this while knows nothing, is <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Heretical.</hi> If <hi>Eccleſiaſtical judgements</hi> were made after this ſort, there would in effect be no need to examine any other <hi>Fact</hi> then <hi>this</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the <hi>Author</hi> in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie do teach ſome <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſubject:</hi> and this <hi>Fact</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>evident,</hi> there would hardly be ever any <hi>Queſtions</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> becauſe men ſeldom diſpute, whether an <hi>Author</hi> have <hi>ſome Doctrine</hi> upon a ſubject no matter what.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this Imagination com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in it a very groſs <hi>Errour,</hi> ſince it ſuppoſes particular <hi>Revelations</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi> which ſhould be the foundations of theſe Deciſions, it is evident that <hi>Eccleſiaſtical judgements</hi> are not made in this manner. Neither the <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Biſhops</hi> can judge whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of a Book be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Heretical</hi> without comparing it with <hi>Tradition.</hi> Now 'tis impoſſible they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Tradition,</hi> without they diſtinctly know it. Men never compare a <hi>Doctrine</hi> with <hi>Tradition</hi> which they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93311:62"/>
know not but under the general <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of an <hi>Author.</hi> For 'tis neither <hi>Catholick</hi> nor <hi>Heretical,</hi> as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> nor as <hi>Doctrine</hi> of an <hi>Author.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>eſſentially</hi> true as being the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>eſſential Truth.</hi> But the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf is not falſe as being the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Devil</hi> is not falſe from his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and becauſe he ſometimes ſpeaks truth, as when he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God. A fortiori,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of a <hi>Catholick Author</hi> is not <hi>Heretical</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and becauſe it is his.</p>
               <p>Of neceſſity therefore ought both the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> to judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of a Book be <hi>Heretical</hi> or <hi>Catholick,</hi> paſs through the <hi>examen</hi> of this point of <hi>Fact, That it is the Doctrine of this Book</hi>; and to reduce it to ſome preciſe <hi>Poſition</hi> diſtinct and determinate, from whence firſt to eſtabliſh this Judgment of <hi>Fact,</hi> namely, that <hi>This Dogm</hi> and <hi>Poſition is of ſuch an Author</hi>; and after that this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93311:63"/>
Judgment of <hi>Right, This Dogm is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, or Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is of this diſtinct <hi>Dogm</hi> that they affirm theſe <hi>two</hi> things, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is of ſuch an <hi>Author,</hi> That it is <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi> But they affirm it by two very ſeparate and remote Judgments, and form'd upon moſt different Reaſons.</p>
               <p>They judge that this diſtinct <hi>Dogm</hi> is of an <hi>Author,</hi> by the very <hi>view</hi> of the <hi>Paſſages,</hi> and the connexion of his <hi>Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They judge it to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> by the compariſon which they make of it with the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould proceed indeed in condemning the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> It was not enough for them to know that <hi>Janſenius</hi> teaches ſome <hi>Doctrine</hi> on the <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi>; ſince 'tis ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to conclude from thence that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>heretical:</hi> but they ſhould neceſſarily have reduc'd the <hi>vain,</hi> uncertain Doctrine of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to a preciſe <hi>Dogm</hi> by a judgment
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93311:63"/>
purely of <hi>Fact,</hi> in judging that this <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> Doctrine is of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> to be able afterwards to pronounce the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Faith,</hi> which inſinuates the <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be <hi>heretical.</hi>

               <p>There are not in the whole World things more ſeparate and diſtinct then theſe <hi>Concluſions, This Dogm is Janſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's, This Doctrine is heretical.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> is <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Right.</hi> The one is <hi>true</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Church</hi> has been the <hi>Church,</hi> the other <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>true</hi> but ſince <hi>Janſenius</hi> has written, and was before <hi>that</hi> falſe. It may be <hi>true</hi> that this was ſuch an Author's <hi>Poſition,</hi> without his being an <hi>Heretick</hi>; and it may be as <hi>true</hi> that a <hi>Poſition</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> without being ſuch an <hi>Author</hi>'s; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not therefore <hi>heretical</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an <hi>Author</hi>'s, nor therefore ſuch an <hi>Author</hi>'s for being <hi>heretical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe two <hi>Judgments,</hi> more remote from each other then are the <hi>Heavens</hi> from the <hi>Earth,</hi> are both comprehended in this ſingle <hi>Propoſition,</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> which is the reſult; and thus it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93311:64"/>
a <hi>Right</hi> and a <hi>Fact</hi> really ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, though confounded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. It may be deny'd as to them both; and, were onely the <hi>Fact</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, they are not thoſe who fall into the <hi>Hereſie</hi> that doe it, but thoſe who accuſe them of <hi>Hereſie</hi> under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, as does the F. <hi>Ferrier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 'tis certain that of one part the <hi>Pope</hi> has form'd this <hi>Judgment,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This is <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi>; but this is onely a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and a <hi>Fact</hi> not <hi>revealed</hi> either in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> It is alſo evident this <hi>Fact</hi> is wholly ſeparate from <hi>Right,</hi> and that it is compris'd within the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which declares that the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>heretical.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> accuſes thoſe of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> who deny it, he falls himſelf into the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of eſtabliſhing a point of <hi>Faith</hi> upon a thing which is neither contained in the <hi>Scripture</hi> nor in <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He has therefore the choice after this, to ſay that this <hi>Fact</hi> has been either <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>not reveal'd.</hi> If
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93311:64"/>
he acknowledge it has <hi>not</hi> been reveal'd to him, he falls into this <hi>Hereſie</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Article of <hi>Faith</hi> of a matter of <hi>Fact</hi> which is no-where <hi>revealed.</hi> And if he pretend a <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, he falls into a double <hi>Errour; one</hi> for admitting particular <hi>Revelations</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi> which were to open a gate to all manner of Illuſion; and another for founding of <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> upon theſe particular <hi>Revelations,</hi> which is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the eſſence of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> which is onely eſtabliſhed upon <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Scripture</hi> and in <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is therefore guilty of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> whether he <hi>do</hi> admit of theſe <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> or whether he <hi>do not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, on the contrary, the <hi>Divines</hi> whom he accuſes, for that they pretend <hi>Janſenius</hi> has not been well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they attribute to him a <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he no-where maintains, are <hi>Catholicks,</hi> whether they <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>be not</hi> miſtaken in this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion.</p>
               <p>For it is no way neceſſary (to exempt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93311:65"/>
                  <hi>them</hi> from <hi>errour</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>) that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould fall into an <hi>errour</hi> of <hi>Fact.</hi> They are acquitted, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be miſtaken in the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> or whether he be <hi>not.</hi> If this be true, that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not well underſtand <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> they had reaſon then not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to be heretical. And if it be true that he <hi>did</hi> well underſtand it, all that one ought thence to conclude is <hi>this,</hi> That theſe <hi>Divines</hi> did ill underſtand it, and too favourably explain'd it, in attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it a <hi>Catholick ſenſe</hi> which it <hi>has not,</hi> and in overſeeing another <hi>heretical ſenſe</hi> which it <hi>truly had</hi>; all which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts but to a ſimple <hi>errour</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> which is neither a Crime nor Violence, but the moſt pardonable Miſtake in the world, and the moſt worthy of <hi>Man,</hi> according to that of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſince it all conſiſts in taking the words of a great <hi>Biſhop</hi> in a good ſenſe: <hi>Qui error</hi> (ſaies the Saint) <hi>non ſolùm humanus eſt, ſed etiam homine digniſsimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the cruel Concluſions of F. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,</hi> and the <hi>Phantaſm</hi> of his <hi>Hereſie</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:93311:65"/>
being founded upon theſe falſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> That the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is <hi>de jure</hi>; That a <hi>Fact</hi> is inſeparable from <hi>Right</hi>; That there is no other <hi>Fact</hi> in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Pope,</hi> then to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Janſenius</hi> has taught any <hi>Doctrine</hi> on the <hi>Five Propoſitions,</hi> are not onely falſe, but criminal. Let him make choice of other <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>diſpute</hi> ill upon as long as he pleaſes: This is a thing which cries for vengeance before <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> to demand of the <hi>King</hi> (as he does) <hi>Declarations</hi> ſo far remote from his Goodneſs and Juſtice upon Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo contrary to <hi>common Senſe.</hi> Let him diſtinctly <hi>ſpecifie,</hi> if he can, what this <hi>Hereſie</hi> is which he accuſes theſe <hi>Divines</hi> of, and expreſs it under other terms then the ambiguous and uncertain words of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> by which no man can know them. And if he cannot doe this, let him hold his peace, and repent of theſe Extravagances; or rather make them ſome publick reparation, as indeed he is obliged.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> is infinitely more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93311:66"/>
then what he emploies againſt theſe <hi>Divines, pag.</hi> 5. in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Janſeniſts</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they mock God and the Church, when they demand that one ſhould ſhew them this Senſe or Doctrine of</hi> Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius <hi>upon the Five Propoſitions. And why, I pray, do they mock thus? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſaies this Father) <hi>if they do know what the Senſe of</hi> Janſenius <hi>is upon the Five Propoſitions, they are ridiculous to enquire of a thing which they know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. If they do not know what the Senſe is, they are doubly to blame, to publiſh that they are convinc'd that the Senſe of</hi> Janſenius <hi>is Catholick, when as they do not know what it is; and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſubmit to the Church in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is otherwiſe unknown to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They replie in a word to F. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> That the <hi>Divines,</hi> who are bound to <hi>act</hi> according to <hi>knowledge,</hi> and who are not obliged to render the <hi>Biſhops</hi> more then a <hi>reaſonable obedience,</hi> have cauſe to enquire what the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> is which they would have them to <hi>condemn,</hi> whether they <hi>do know</hi> it,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93311:66"/>
or whether they <hi>know</hi> it <hi>not.</hi> If they be <hi>ignorant</hi> of it, they have reaſon to ask, to be <hi>inſtructed</hi> before they be urg'd to <hi>condemn</hi> it; becauſe ſuppoſing they do not underſtand it, they can neither true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averr that they do reject it, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe truely that they will not embrace it; for peradventure they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to doe it without knowing of it, and perhaps fall into it before they are aware.</p>
               <p>Now if we ſuppoſe that theſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> do know what the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> underſtand by this <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> they have ſo much the more reaſon to demand, becauſe <hi>they</hi> onely know it by <hi>particular</hi> waies and ſuch as are not <hi>authentical:</hi> ſo that if they ſhould themſelves determine what the <hi>Pope</hi> underſtands by the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> (as theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible of various ſenſes) the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> would not fail preſently to ſay, that this were not yet what the <hi>Pope</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and what they ought to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi>; in fine, that 'twere ſome other thing, without ſaying what; and ſo
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93311:67"/>
one ſhould never have an end. It were therefore much better they ſhould make their addreſſes to thoſe who have the power to <hi>determine</hi> this <hi>Senſe</hi>; that if they once did it, it might clearly appear by condemning this <hi>Dogm</hi> together with them in which they had compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi>; that one be not enwrapp'd in any Errour.</p>
               <p>But the plain <hi>truth</hi> is, Theſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> both do <hi>know,</hi> and do <hi>not know</hi> the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> They do very well <hi>know</hi> a <hi>Doctrine</hi> in <hi>Janſenius</hi> to be very <hi>holy,</hi> very <hi>Catholick</hi> and moſt <hi>Orthodox,</hi> which is that of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe,</hi> which infallibly cauſes the <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>act</hi> without <hi>impoſing</hi> of a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</hi> They acknowledge the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>free Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Elect,</hi> receiv'd by the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and maintain'd by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf as a <hi>point of Faith:</hi> and they do acknowledge no other Point upon the ſubject of the <hi>Five Propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſince it is evident by the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that this is not that which the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:93311:67"/>
mean by the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> which they condemn, but a certain <hi>Senſe</hi> which was never known to our <hi>Divines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Baius</hi> and <hi>Janſenius,</hi> according to thoſe Gentlemen the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; a certain <hi>Senſe</hi> contrary to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of all the <hi>Catholick Schools,</hi> as theſe very <hi>Biſhops</hi> do aſſure us; a certain <hi>Senſe</hi> different from <hi>efficacious Grace,</hi> repugnant to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and which has been conſtantly condemn'd by the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as F. <hi>Annat</hi> and M. <hi>Hallier</hi> have ſo deeply proteſted, before the <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Pope Innocent:</hi> It is this <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Senſe</hi> which theſe Divines do not underſtand, or at leaſt which they but very <hi>confuſedly</hi> know. They know all that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and the other adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of <hi>Janſenius</hi> have ſaid of it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Books:</hi> But they ſee that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations do not agree together, whiles <hi>ſome</hi> of them place it in <hi>one Point,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> in <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that they know of this <hi>Senſe</hi> is, that it is different from <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> and by conſequent that they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93311:68"/>
do not hold it, and that they reject it, becauſe they hold but this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and that whatſoever <hi>Doctrine</hi> is repugnant to it is <hi>falſe.</hi> So as in the neceſſity to which they are reduc'd for the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and to avoid the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch</hi> which they caſt on them touching this <hi>uncertain, unexplicable Senſe,</hi> they have reaſon to appeal to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who ought to <hi>know</hi> it, ſince they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> it, and to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who could not have <hi>condemn'd</hi> it without <hi>knowing</hi> it, to conjure them to <hi>explain</hi> it, that ſo they may be inabled to confound their <hi>Accuſers</hi> in ſhewing the world how free they are from any <hi>Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the onely reaſon which makes them require with ſo much earneſtneſs the Explication of this <hi>Senſe</hi>; for they have otherwiſe no ſuch haſt to know it. They hold the truth of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Efficacious Grace <hi>per ſe,</hi> and reject whatſoever <hi>Errour</hi> is repugnant to it: whether it be in attributing too <hi>little</hi> to <hi>Grace,</hi> as the <hi>Moliniſts</hi>; or in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its <hi>liberty,</hi> as this pretended <hi>Errour</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi>'s Senſe ſhould be. This
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93311:68"/>
ſuffices them; ſo as men moleſt them not with the indetermin'd <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and they will ſoon leave en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what it is. But if they continue their <hi>Perſecutions</hi> thus upon this <hi>point,</hi> they will be forc'd to continue the preſſing of them to <hi>explain</hi> this <hi>Senſe</hi>; nor can they refuſe to doe it without an evident ſign of <hi>Oppreſsion.</hi> For the <hi>Biſhops</hi> cannot in <hi>conſcience</hi> make them condemn it, without they know it; and if they do know it, 'tis a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery not to be underſtood that they ſhould refuſe to declare it.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is now time we took off our ſpirits from theſe ſubtile matters, and which ſmell of the <hi>School,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe another <hi>Illuſion</hi> of Father <hi>Ferrier</hi> not a whit leſs dangerous, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more intelligible. This <hi>Father</hi> does upon all occaſions repreſent the <hi>preſent Church</hi> as divided in <hi>two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> pompous and triumphant, as compos'd of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and of all both <hi>Eccleſiaſtical, Secular,</hi> and <hi>Regular,</hi> who condemn the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> as <hi>heretical,</hi> who believe that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93311:69"/>
matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is inſeparable from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Right,</hi> and that therefore it is not to be <hi>deny'd</hi> without being an <hi>Heretick.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> poor and abandon'd, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting but of a ſmall number of <hi>Divines,</hi> who refuſe to acknowledge that the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is heretical, who hold that there is a <hi>Fact</hi> ſeparate from <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>Deciſion</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> which condemns it, and that therefore one may by conſequence refuſe to <hi>believe</hi> it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being an <hi>Heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Idea</hi> which F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> gives us of the <hi>Church</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> But as there is nothing more <hi>prodigious</hi> then this <hi>Idea,</hi> ſo is there alſo nothing more <hi>falſe. God</hi> will never aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his <hi>Church</hi> to that degree, as to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo groſs and viſible an <hi>Errour</hi> to reign in it. And every man may by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be convinc'd of the falſeneſs of this <hi>phantaſtick</hi> Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>For unleſs a man <hi>wilfully</hi> ſhut his own eyes, one cannot deny but there are in the <hi>Church</hi> no leſs then <hi>four</hi> different <hi>Opinions</hi> upon the <hi>Formularie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is that of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:93311:69"/>
who affirm that matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from that of <hi>Right,</hi> and that <hi>quatenus</hi> ſo it cannot be <hi>deny'd</hi> without <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is that of a conſiderable number of <hi>Divines,</hi> who believe that though it be no <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>divine Faith</hi> to hold that the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> and that the <hi>Fact</hi> may very well be ſeparated from <hi>Right</hi>; yet that <hi>Chriſtian humility</hi> obliges us never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to prefer the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> to his proper <hi>Illumination,</hi> and ſo they ought to believe the Fact by <hi>humane Faith,</hi> and under that notion <hi>ſign</hi> the <hi>Formularie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> and the moſt embrac'd, conſiſts in affirming that a man is not oblig'd to <hi>believe</hi> the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> as decided, either by <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>humane Faith</hi>; but that one may for all that ſign the <hi>Formularie</hi> without violating his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Signature</hi> does never concern or fall upon the <hi>Facts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is the <hi>opinion</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other <hi>Divines,</hi> who are perſuaded of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93311:70"/>
                  <hi>one</hi> part, that it is moſt falſe the <hi>Fact</hi> ſhould be ſeparated from <hi>Right,</hi> or that it ſhould be a <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to hold the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Janſenius heretical,</hi> or that a man is obliged to <hi>believe</hi> it by <hi>humane Faith</hi>; but who believe on the <hi>other</hi> part, that the <hi>Fact</hi> being contain'd in this <hi>Formularie,</hi> thoſe who ſcruple it cannot <hi>ſign</hi> it without <hi>reſtriction,</hi> ſince the <hi>declarations</hi> which men make to the <hi>Church</hi> ought to be intirely <hi>ſincere,</hi> and free of all duplicity.</p>
               <p>It is viſible that in this difference of <hi>Divines</hi> each <hi>party</hi> condemns the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but after a ſort very different.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who make the <hi>firſt,</hi> ought by the neceſſary conſequence of their Opinion to condemn for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> not onely the <hi>laſt,</hi> who abſolutely <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>ſign</hi> that the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>heretical,</hi> but <hi>thoſe</hi> likewiſe who do <hi>not</hi> believe it of <hi>humane Faith,</hi> or that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> it <hi>not</hi> at all, albeit they <hi>ſign</hi> it. For <hi>Hereſie</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and not in the <hi>omiſsion</hi> of an <hi>exterior action</hi> of the hand. A <hi>perſon</hi> who ſhould not believe but with an <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

Faith</hi> that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> were in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or that ſhould <hi>ſign</hi> it in <hi>infidelity,</hi> would be never the leſs an <hi>Heretick</hi> then he who ſhould abſolutely <hi>refuſe</hi> to <hi>ſign</hi> it.</p>
               <p>So as all thoſe many <hi>Biſhops</hi> that have caus'd none to <hi>ſign,</hi> or that receive <hi>reſtrictions</hi> concerning the matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> or that declare they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the belief of the <hi>Fact,</hi> or that pretend not the <hi>Fact</hi> can be otherwiſe believ'd then by <hi>humane Faith,</hi> are as much <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and of F. <hi>Annat,</hi> as theſe <hi>Divines</hi> whom they particularly <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</hi> True it is, their <hi>Politicks</hi> oblige them to diſtinguiſh of <hi>two</hi> ſorts of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> in <hi>France, ſome</hi> of which they treat <hi>civilly,</hi> and others moſt <hi>outrageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> They place the <hi>Biſhops, Sorboniſts,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Oratory,</hi> the <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctines,</hi> &amp;c. in the <hi>firſt</hi> order, and whom they do not yet <hi>attacque</hi> but by <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> though by a very neceſſary one; whiles they range in the <hi>other</hi> thoſe whom they immediately deſign for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93311:71"/>
ruine, that ſo they may with the greater force ſurprize the other.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſufficiently evident, that all thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> who have <hi>ſign'd</hi> the <hi>Fact,</hi> either of <hi>humane Faith,</hi> or without believing it, ſhall be never the more acquitted for that, but be all <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> in their turn, when they have left off oppreſſing the <hi>others,</hi> ſeeing they muſt of neceſſity be ſo in the opinion of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the <hi>contrary,</hi> all theſe <hi>three</hi> laſt <hi>parties,</hi> who accord in this <hi>point,</hi> that this <hi>Fact</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is very ſeparable from <hi>Right,</hi> that it does not in the leaſt concern the <hi>Faith,</hi> and that one may ſafely <hi>deny</hi> it without <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> ought, from a neceſſary <hi>conſequence</hi> of this their mutual Opinion, condemn the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> both of <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain theſe four <hi>Parties</hi> reſide in the <hi>Church</hi>; and that if one would now conſider which of them were the moſt <hi>numerous,</hi> one might ſafely affirm that there are none more profligate and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and who have fewer ſincere
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93311:71"/>
approbators, then that of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> Nor is this an aiery <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> but a <hi>real Verity,</hi> to be diſcern'd by every one that has a mind to it, that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> ſtand almoſt ſingle in this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion,</hi> that matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from matter of <hi>Right,</hi> and that one cannot believe (without being an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>) the Doctrine of <hi>Janſenius</hi> not to be <hi>heretical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt <hi>devoted</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> ask for whom the World takes them, that they ſhould believe them capable of ſo monſtrous a Folly, as is that of affirming that a <hi>Fact</hi> ſhould be inſeparably joyn'd to <hi>Faith.</hi> They expreſs as much as one would wiſh in <hi>words,</hi> that they do not require the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Fact.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93311:72"/>
                  <hi>Jeſuites</hi> cannot find ſix <hi>Biſhops</hi> in all <hi>France,</hi> and ten <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>leaſt</hi> conſiderable <hi>perſons,</hi> who will <hi>ſign</hi> this <hi>Propoſition</hi> which F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> maintains, and which is the <hi>baſis</hi> of all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>The Fact of</hi> Janſenius <hi>is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Faith, and one cannot reject the Dogm which is condemned, without acknowledging it to be</hi> Janſenius<hi>'s.</hi> And in <hi>particular</hi> they affirm, that he could not make M. <hi>Grandin</hi> ſign, nor M. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> nor (amongſt the <hi>Doctors</hi>) M. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millart,</hi> nor <hi>Monſieur de Rouën</hi> amongſt the <hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain therefore that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> are in a manner alone in their <hi>erroneous</hi> opinions. And 'tis as true, that the <hi>Divines</hi> whom they <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> are almoſt <hi>wholly</hi> united to the <hi>Church</hi> in this difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>I confeſs they have yet ſome diſpute with the other <hi>Divines,</hi> becauſe againſt the <hi>one</hi> they maintain, that one owes not ſo much as <hi>humane Faith</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions <hi>de facto</hi> when there is any cauſe of doubt adminiſtred; and againſt the

               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>difference</hi> has relation to <hi>Manners</hi> onely, and not to <hi>Faith</hi>; and in this very <hi>difference</hi> they may make uſe of the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who <hi>ſign</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> as of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith,</hi> approve of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> touching the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of <hi>Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who <hi>ſign</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> without believing it, approve what they affirm, That <hi>the Church obliges none to believe the Fact by way of command</hi>; ſo as to the <hi>truth</hi> they have this <hi>conſolation,</hi> that in every of the <hi>Points</hi> whereof they are accus'd, they are united in Opinion with the greateſt part of the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoever ſhall take the pains dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to inform himſelf of the <hi>bottom</hi> of theſe <hi>particulars,</hi> will clearly find that what I ſay is moſt true: And if any man ask why the <hi>contrary</hi> appears to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93311:73"/>
the World, that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> domineer every-where, and the <hi>Divines</hi> are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not very difficult to give a reaſon for it: They are onely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Poſt</hi> F. <hi>Annat</hi> holds, and what <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>place</hi> in which he is affords him, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and at <hi>Paris,</hi> to doe what he pleaſes as to this matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They know nothing at <hi>Rome</hi> but from the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> which he ſends them: and he ſtands at the <hi>gate</hi> of all the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to exclude who-ever ſtands in his way in any thing. Every one has his particular buſineſs at <hi>Court</hi>; and thoſe who have no other, either for <hi>themſelues</hi> or their <hi>Communalty,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their repoſe in which they will not be moleſted. <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> is the onely affair of Father <hi>Annat</hi>; ſo as that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not be croſs'd in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar buſineſſes, they let F. <hi>Annat</hi> alone with his.</p>
               <p>Not that this <hi>Reverend Father</hi> with all his <hi>credit</hi> is yet arriv'd ſo far as to be able to procure the <hi>Biſhops</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> by any formal <hi>Deciſions</hi> to ſupport theſe particular Abſurdities of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93311:73"/>
That <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annex'd to <hi>Faith,</hi> and, That he who denies it is an <hi>Heretick:</hi> He is not ſo weak a man as to <hi>attempt</hi> that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. He ſatisfies himſelf that every one <hi>ſigns</hi> the <hi>Fact</hi> ſimply, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of his <hi>intention,</hi> to make <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Subſcriptions</hi> when time ſerves, and as may beſt conduce to his <hi>ends:</hi> nor for the moſt part does he find any <hi>difficulty</hi> in it; ſince their <hi>ſpirits</hi> furniſhing them with expedients to <hi>ſign,</hi> without believing the <hi>Fact</hi> either of <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>humane Faith,</hi> their Intereſts eaſily perſuade them to <hi>embrace</hi> them. They fanſie themſelves not oblig'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to oppoſe F. <hi>Annat</hi>; but that they may ſafely <hi>ſhelter</hi> themſelves from this rowling tempeſt: and therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him freely to <hi>oppreſs</hi> thoſe againſt whom he is particularly animated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they conceive it their own fault that they do not ſeek their <hi>ſafety,</hi> as they doe, by a <hi>Subſcription</hi> which (as they affirm) engages them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>By this means thoſe who refuſe to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93311:74"/>
                  <hi>ſign</hi> remain expos'd to the unjuſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the <hi>Jeſuites:</hi> Thoſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them in certain <hi>Points,</hi> and condemn them in others, blame them highly in thoſe <hi>particulars</hi> about which they conteſt with them; but they are very wary to defend them when they think they have reaſon on their ſide. <hi>How infinitely are theſe Gentlemen miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi> (ſaies honeſt M. <hi>Moret</hi> in all his Sermons) <hi>not to believe the Deciſion</hi> de facto <hi>with an humane Faith?</hi> But he is wary enough not to adde, that the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> are miſtaken, who require we ſhould treat thoſe as <hi>Hereticks</hi> who acknowledge no <hi>Fact,</hi> which we can onely aſſent to but by <hi>humane Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet is this manner of <hi>acting</hi> more tolerable then that of thoſe who ſay nothing at all in publick concerning their intention, but joyn ſimply with the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> by an exteriour <hi>ſignature,</hi> however different and remote in their <hi>ſenſe.</hi> If they did but ſay clearly what they reprove in thoſe who do not <hi>ſign,</hi> the diverſity of their <hi>opinions</hi> would render their authority leſs conſiderable:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93311:74"/>
but whiles they ſay <hi>nothing</hi> at all, ſuch as onely <hi>judge</hi> things by the <hi>out-ſide</hi> take them for <hi>approbators</hi> of the <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not therefore an <hi>univerſal Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,</hi> but an <hi>univerſal Baſeneſs,</hi> which makes theſe <hi>Divines</hi> to be oppreſs'd; or rather, 'tis the <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>general</hi> which renders their <hi>Oppreſsion particular.</hi> Let every man <hi>ſpeak</hi> as he <hi>thinks,</hi> and they ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified: Let every man alſo <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> them as he thinks, and they ſhall yet be <hi>more</hi> fully <hi>juſtified</hi>; ſeeing it will appear that in all the <hi>Points</hi> on which they are <hi>accus'd</hi> they are united with the greater number of the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But the terror and dread of F. <hi>Annat</hi> keeps all mens tongues bound to defend them, and lets them all looſe to condemn them; uniting in one <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal</hi> expreſſion <hi>perſons</hi> that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſtant in Opinion, that ſo F. <hi>Annat</hi> may ſeem to be <hi>follow'd</hi> of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> whenas in truth he is in effect <hi>condemn'd</hi> by the <hi>whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:93311:75"/>Were there indeed no other <hi>Life</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>preſent,</hi> nor any other <hi>Judge</hi> ſave <hi>Men,</hi> it muſt needs be confeſs'd that F. <hi>Annat</hi> were a marvelous able man, for knowing how to conceal with ſo much <hi>addreſs</hi> the weakneſs of his <hi>Party.</hi> How <hi>victorious</hi> in appearance is he, whenas in effect he is abandon'd by all the <hi>World?</hi> But this <hi>Father,</hi> whileſt he thinks to <hi>cheat</hi> others, <hi>cheats</hi> himſelf <hi>firſt</hi>; becauſe the buſineſs in agitation <hi>here</hi> is of things which depend upon the <hi>truth,</hi> and will be <hi>judged</hi> by the <hi>truth</hi> and not on <hi>appearance.</hi> It is not a <hi>deceitfull union</hi> in an <hi>equivocal expreſsion</hi> which renders one orthodox, but a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>veritable</hi> conformity of ones <hi>ſenſe</hi> with that of the <hi>univerſal Church</hi> in matters which concern the <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So as theſe <hi>Divines,</hi> maintaining no other <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon the <hi>Fact</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> but that of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> which is, that this <hi>Fact</hi> has no relation to <hi>Faith,</hi> continue <hi>Orthodox,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Cabal</hi> they contrive to oppreſs them.

                  <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who would make it a <hi>point</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> are not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> for all their power and credit, foraſmuch as in this they are really repugnant to the ſenſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> into which they do intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>Real Hereſie,</hi> under pretence, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, of deſtroying an <hi>Hereſie</hi> which is but <hi>Imaginary.</hi>

               <p>I Have already <hi>told</hi> you, and I <hi>repeat</hi> it again, that within <hi>one</hi> fifty years men will look upon this pretended <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> of <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> but as a rare <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>Vanity</hi> of mens <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and rank the whole <hi>Diſpute</hi> with that of the <hi>Cowls</hi> and the <hi>Cordeliers Bread.</hi> They will then ask with <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> what this Father <hi>Annat</hi> and F. <hi>Ferrier</hi> were, that ſpake ſuch impertinent things in the Age they liv'd in; and who thoſe ſilly perſons were that ſuffer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be led by their <hi>Dotages.</hi> But theſe, you'l ſay, are <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and 'tis no hard matter to make <hi>others</hi> like
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93311:77"/>
them, by taking 50 <hi>years</hi> time to prove the <hi>event</hi> of them. I could eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you, that they are true, having already prov'd, that the whole <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is but a <hi>Trifle,</hi> as I conceive I have ſufficiently done; and that as one cannot pronounce the <hi>ſame</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Diſputes,</hi> one cannot reaſonably make the like <hi>Predictions</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>But it being beyond my power to advance and haſten the <hi>future,</hi> to ſhew you the <hi>truth</hi> of my <hi>Prophecy,</hi> I chuſe to leave it off, or rather preſent you with a <hi>picture</hi> of what is <hi>paſt,</hi> which is certain and invariable, and that will afford us the moſt certain <hi>conjectures</hi> how one may foreſee what is like to fall out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like encounters.</p>
               <p>'Tis a <hi>Glaſs</hi> which very few perſons conſult, from I know not what weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs natural to mens <hi>ſpirits.</hi> For as <hi>men</hi> live but in the <hi>time</hi> that is <hi>preſent</hi>; ſo they are likewiſe concern'd but with <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>preſent.</hi> What-ever is <hi>remote</hi> from the <hi>inſtant</hi> which takes them up, vaniſhes and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of them; and if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93311:77"/>
there remain any <hi>traces</hi> in their memory, they are ſo weak and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, that they ſerve them but in little ſtead for the reforming of thoſe deceitfull <hi>impreſsions</hi> which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the <hi>preſent Objects.</hi> If a man ſeem to have the advantage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>moment</hi> which employs them, he loſes the remembrance of all the <hi>paſt,</hi> which might have made him know that this <hi>advantage</hi> is falſe and but imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Thus, becauſe the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> make a great buſtle, and every-where cry out on <hi>Hereſie,</hi> men are aſtoniſh'd at the <hi>bruit</hi>; and becauſe there are but few that <hi>oppoſe</hi> them, men eaſily imagine that they are in effect <hi>victorious.</hi>

               <p>In the interim, it is evident that this manner of boulſtring their <hi>Judgments</hi> but upon the <hi>preſent,</hi> ſubjects it to an infinity of Illuſions. The <hi>paſſages</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> diſcover not themſelves to us in every moment, but by ſome of their <hi>parts</hi> as they ſucceed one another; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as being thus conſequent, they do not ſubſiſt <hi>together:</hi> in the mean time 'tis by the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>whole Body,</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93311:78"/>
of <hi>all</hi> its <hi>Members,</hi> that we ought to form a Judgment.</p>
               <p>It would be ſometimes very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſee the <hi>Church</hi> victorious over <hi>Hereſies</hi> in all its brightneſs, did we conſider it but in a ſmall part of its permanency, during which ſhe may be ſo <hi>overcaſt</hi> with a miſt of <hi>Errours,</hi> that one can hardly tell who has the <hi>better</hi> of it, <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falſhood.</hi> Did not <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> ſeem a conqueror at <hi>Rimini,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> ſo <hi>obſcure</hi> that (as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaies) All the <hi>World</hi> was aſtoniſh'd how they ſhould become <hi>Arian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To diſcover then the advantage of the <hi>Church</hi> over <hi>Errour,</hi> our <hi>memories</hi> have need of a larger comprehenſion of <hi>time:</hi> And then it is we ſhall ſee, that after a ſwift and tranſitory <hi>blaze, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> do wither away of themſelves and come to nothing; whiles the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> ſubſiſts, and conſerves it ſelf in the <hi>boſome</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in the <hi>hearts</hi> of her <hi>legitimate</hi> Children.</p>
               <p>And thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> to judge rightly of the preſent <hi>Conteſtation</hi> between the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93311:78"/>
                  <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> we muſt not limit all our <hi>proſpect</hi> at the <hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> and of <hi>Right,</hi> to which 'tis for the <hi>preſent</hi> totally reduc'd: But we ſhould conſider the <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſteps of every of its <hi>parties,</hi> the various <hi>Points</hi> agitated between them, the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of their particular <hi>Diſputes,</hi> and by what progreſs they are arriv'd to the <hi>Point</hi> where they now ſtand, ſeeing 'tis by <hi>this</hi> onely we ſhall be able to diſcover who have <hi>loſt</hi> or <hi>gain'd, advanc'd</hi> or <hi>recoil'd,</hi> whom we may believe <hi>ſincere,</hi> and whom for <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> In fine, 'tis from hence one may form rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conjectures of the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the remaining <hi>Conteſtation.</hi>

               <p>This is the <hi>Deſign</hi> which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to <hi>my ſelf</hi> in this <hi>Letter,</hi> wherein I will preſent you with a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Image</hi> of all this tedious <hi>Warr</hi> of the <hi>Divines,</hi> which though it be not <hi>bloudy,</hi> is no leſs <hi>conſiderable</hi> then the <hi>temporal</hi> Warrs, and whoſe <hi>Succeſſes</hi> are altogether as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>important.</hi>

               <p>It was in the <hi>year</hi> 1626 that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, upon occaſion of a <hi>Book</hi> publiſhed

The <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> complain'd of it to the <hi>Faculty,</hi> who nam'd <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> to examine the <hi>Book.</hi> But this alarming the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> they quickly gave us to underſtand that it was not ſo eaſie an enterpriſe to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a <hi>Book</hi> of a <hi>Jeſuite:</hi> For they ſo wrought with the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> by their <hi>Cabal,</hi> that M. <hi>de S.

               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93311:79"/>Moreover, to traverſe the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> F. <hi>Garaſſe</hi> bethought himſelf of a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percherie</hi> as worthy of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> as any thing had been practis'd during all the proceſs of theſe Conteſtations. There was a bruit in <hi>Paris</hi> that the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the <hi>Refutation</hi> was to ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Fifty heretical Propoſitions</hi> or <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> in <hi>Garaſſe</hi>'s <hi>Summe</hi>; and it was true: but that part which contain'd the conviction of <hi>Garaſſe</hi>'s Errours was not yet come out of M. <hi>de S.

He choſe <hi>Fifty Propoſitions</hi> in his <hi>Book,</hi> the moſt eaſie to defend that he could find, and of which number there was not <hi>three</hi> of them of thoſe which M. <hi>de S.

In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this he form'd a <hi>Cenſure</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own fancy, and by this addreſs dazzl'd the world for a time, and diſturb'd the <hi>Examination</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> which was doing at the <hi>Sorbon</hi>; ſo as his <hi>Examinators</hi> were much confounded, and they began every-where to ſay that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93311:80"/>
they extremely wronged <hi>de Garaſſe,</hi> to accuſe the <hi>Summe</hi> of ſo many <hi>Errours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>de S.

               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs did the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie upon this encounter ſome kind of Prudence. For we muſt not refuſe to give them their juſt merits when they deſerve them, ſince the occaſions are ſo very rare. They did not perſiſt in the

juſtification of Father <hi>Garaſſe,</hi> but rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated him a good diſtance from <hi>Paris</hi> to one of their <hi>Houſes,</hi> where they heard no more talk of him, and by this means made an end of the buſineſs.

               </p>
               <p>But they would not doe it, and have ſince ſufficiently teſtified that they were not of the number of thoſe <hi>wiſe men</hi> who love their <hi>Reprovers,</hi> and that by warning them of their <hi>Faults</hi> give them occaſion to <hi>reform</hi> them. They nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in their breaſts a violent averſion againſt him who had done them this ſervice, and which was yet exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented by another <hi>obligation</hi> of the ſame nature which he rendred them ſome few years after, and which affords us the ſecond remarkable <hi>accident</hi> of this <hi>Warr.</hi>

againſt <hi>Epiſcopal Jurisdiction,</hi> and the neceſſity of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>; and the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> having ſent theſe Books to the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> there were <hi>thirty two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> cenſur'd by them the 15 of <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1631.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cenſure</hi> had been preceded ſome daies before by that which M. the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> publiſh'd againſt the ſame <hi>Books</hi> the 30 of <hi>January</hi> in the ſame <hi>year</hi>; and by that of all the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> which were then in <hi>Paris,</hi> who condemn'd them by a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Letter</hi> addreſſed to all the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>France</hi> the 15 of <hi>February</hi> 1631.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>ſtrokes</hi> were very ſenſible to the <hi>Nicety</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; and accordingly did they riſe up againſt theſe <hi>Cenſures</hi> after a terrible manner.

But this boldneſs of theirs was not at all to their advantage in the ſequel: For this produc'd againſt them that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi>

Book of <hi>Petrus Aurelius,</hi> which defended the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and refuted the Errours of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> with ſo much force, eloquence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, that the <hi>Church</hi> was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> confounded.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this <hi>Confuſion,</hi> in ſtead of humbling, did but the more exaſperate them: They undertook <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi>'s Book by all the waies they could poſſibly deviſe, by ſecret <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by publick <hi>Sermons,</hi> by huge <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,</hi> by ſmall <hi>Treatiſes</hi> and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,</hi> by Works in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi>; giving it commonly no other Title then that <hi>infamous Book of Petrus Aurelius.</hi> And as the publick voice had attributed this work to M. <hi>de S.

I ſhould not ſay it if the Piece had not been publick; the Scandal is not yet altogether taken away; they call'd it the Chaplet of</hi> S.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſhewing his own <hi>Chaplet</hi> and in ſaying they were exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; when he reproch'd them for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Images; there was no more to doe but to lead the people to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> where they might have beheld enough with their own eyes.

               <p>But the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> did not value the being convicted of Impoſture, becauſe they knew that thoſe Calumnies being publiſh'd by ſo many mouths, would not fail of leaving their Effects, ſome for ſome perſons, and others for others. Therefore they were diligent to <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate</hi> them, that ſo there might be ſome for every body.

               <p>There were certain <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who, not to fail in matter of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from all poſſibility of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> conceiv'd it a more compendious way to affirm, that they deſign'd the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Incarnation, Goſpel, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and, in ſumme, to form a new <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Deiſts:</hi> and in order to this they invented the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical <hi>Impoſture</hi> of the interview of <hi>Bourgfontaine,</hi> where they feign'd that M. <hi>Janſenius,</hi> M. <hi>Caſpean</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liſieux,</hi> M. <hi>du Bellay,</hi> M. <hi>de Saint Cyran,</hi> and M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> (whom they plainly meant by the firſt letters of their names, and many other circumſtances) met together to confer about the way how they might deſtroy the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi>; and that in order to this deſign M. <hi>Janſenius</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to write his Book of the <hi>Grace
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93311:86"/>
of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> the Treatiſe of <hi>Frequent Communion.</hi> The <hi>perſon</hi> who was made choice of to vend this horrible <hi>Calumny</hi> was one <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau</hi> by name, one of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates</hi> at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> who aſſur'd ſome <hi>friends</hi> of his, that he receiv'd it of a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> as the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> took the care to ſpread and maintain it. And although, by the dates, they have made appear that M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> was but <hi>nine</hi> years old when they ſuppoſe him to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the compoſing of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Frequent Communion</hi>; yet did not the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> fail to inſert this deteſtable <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture</hi> twice more in two ſeveral <hi>Books:</hi> the <hi>one</hi> in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of their Father <hi>Meynier</hi> intitled, <hi>Port-Royal of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with Geneva</hi>; the <hi>other</hi> in that of a certain <hi>Jeſuite</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Yea and one of theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> preaching in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> recited the whole ſtory to his <hi>Auditors</hi> out of <hi>de Fileau</hi>'s Book.</p>
               <p>Theſe were here yet but <hi>acceſſory Hereſies,</hi> and which onely tended to make what M. <hi>Arnauld</hi> had taught (of being oblig'd in certain <hi>caſes</hi> to refuſe

the giving <hi>Abſolution,</hi> till they had given proofs of a ſolid <hi>Converſion</hi>) to paſs the more eaſily for an <hi>Hereſie.</hi> And it was this <hi>Doctrine</hi> that they every-where aſſaulted with moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>One cannot</hi> (ſaies F. <hi>Briſacier) alter the nature of Satisfaction by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it before Abſolution, without loſing this illuſtrious title of Catholick. This is</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the very gate of Deſperation, 'tis the high-way of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration, 'tis the wide gap for men to die in final Impenitence, and without Sacraments; 'Tis the Cullender of Hell; 'tis the leven to corrupt all the Prieſts, and to make them abuſe the Diſcoveries which they receive in ſecret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe Accuſations were far more important then thoſe which they now form upon the Caſe of <hi>Janſenius.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> diſpers'd them with the ſame aſſurance; they treated their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after the ſame ſort with <hi>Hereſiarchs, Hereticks, Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi>; they gave them the names of <hi>Sects,</hi> as they do now at preſent.

                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:93311:87"/>Theſe bruits and Accuſations gave a thouſand traverſes to the poor <hi>Divines</hi> whom the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> did in this manner decry: for they are alwaies <hi>ſucceſsfull</hi> in <hi>that.</hi> The <hi>Divines</hi> have continu'd to be <hi>oppreſs'd,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have alwaies been very <hi>powerfull</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> Their <hi>Calumnies</hi> yet deſtroy'd themſelves, have been confounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of the whole <hi>Church,</hi> but ſtill without any puniſhment; they were ſtill hearkning to people ſo altogether unworthy of belief: nor was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet found one <hi>Jeſuite</hi> of thoſe which appear'd in the world who has had the <hi>Conſcience</hi> to teſtifie the leaſt <hi>regret</hi> for the <hi>Extravagances</hi> of his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>; a thing prodigious to conſider.

On the contrary, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded thoſe who help'd to <hi>vend</hi> and <hi>diſtribute</hi> their moſt execrable <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi> whither <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> their <hi>Society.</hi> They procur'd for <hi>le Sieur Fileau,</hi> for publiſhing the <hi>Fable</hi> of <hi>Bourgfontaine,</hi> a <hi>Brief</hi> of <hi>Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In fine, the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is ſo <hi>univerſally</hi> acknowledged, that they oblige thoſe who but dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to moſt ſolemn <hi>Retractations.</hi> I will ſhew you an <hi>Example,</hi> both new and curious, which I have taken word for word out of a <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Tolouſe,</hi> where the thing happened.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Religious</hi> perſon of the <hi>Order</hi> of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> of thoſe whom they call <hi>de la grand Obſervance,</hi> preaching this year in <hi>Tolouſe January</hi> the 27, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that <hi>Confeſſors</hi> were not to refuſe or <hi>defer</hi> the <hi>Abſolution</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> provided they aſſur'd them that they were very <hi>ſorry</hi> for having offended <hi>God,</hi> though they had never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>confeſs'd</hi> the very ſame <hi>ſins</hi> before; in the belief, ſaid he, that they ought to have, that the moment in which they ſhould refuſe it them might be that of their <hi>Converſion.</hi> The whole <hi>City,</hi> not

WHICH I HAVE
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93311:90"/>
SPOKEN WITHOUT PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JUDICE TO THE CHUR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES CANONS, and to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of this Dioceſe, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Confeſſors to defer Abſolution to Penitents; eſpecially in caſe of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and proximate Occaſion in a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>WHICH I AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KNOWLEDGE OUGHT TO BE INVIOLABLY OBSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED.</hi>

               <p>Thus has the Diſpute concerning <hi>Penance</hi> and the delay of <hi>Abſolution</hi> had the ſame ſucceſs with the reſt. The power of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them impunitie for their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and Errours.

               <p>The Fourth <hi>Conteſtation,</hi> which is that of the <hi>Morale</hi> of the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> is the moſt conſiderable of all the reſt for the greatneſs of the events. Every one knows what authority the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93311:91"/>
acquir'd in the <hi>Church</hi>; and that albeit the honeſt men did alwaies govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by <hi>Rules</hi> which were totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their <hi>Maximes</hi>; yet they were, I know not how, got into poſſeſſion of <hi>magiſterially</hi> deciding the <hi>Morals</hi> of the Church, and to make the <hi>Opinions</hi> paſs for indiſputable which they pleas'd to agree upon, and thoſe for <hi>probable</hi> and ſafe in <hi>Conſcience</hi> which they thought good to doubt of or to controvert.</p>
               <p>It was above <hi>fifty years</hi> that this <hi>reign</hi> of theirs continu'd in the <hi>Schools:</hi> and though this their licence was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come odious to many knowing perſons; yet the ſmall reſiſtences which had been made againſt them from time to time, were too feeble to remedy ſo great an evil as had been fomented by all the power of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> It was not till the <hi>year</hi> 1656 that any body under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to attacque them in good earneſt. He who made the firſt onſet thought the beſt way to accompliſh his deſign would be, to repreſent them as they are in their native <hi>colours,</hi> and render them <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> to all the world. And whereas they

               <p>There was never any <hi>deſign</hi> that to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> appear'd more raſh, who, looking upon themſelves as elevated to a degree ſo eminent in the <hi>Church,</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked down as from their ſublime <hi>Throne</hi> on this <hi>Incognito,</hi> that durſt preſume to attacque the whole <hi>Body</hi> of their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Society,</hi> (which is the <hi>name</hi> they give themſelves) and to accuſe them for having corrupted all the <hi>Chriſtian Morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were they ever heard to cry out ſo hideouſly through all <hi>France</hi>; The Author of the <hi>Provincials</hi> was an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi> I, and more then an <hi>Heretick</hi>; He borrow'd all his reproches againſt them from <hi>Hereticks</hi>; He aſſaulted amongſt

               </p>

at the unbridled licentiouſneſs of theſe <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> compos'd a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Work againſt them not many years ſince, in which he chiefly oppoſes their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Probability</hi> as an Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devil, <hi>Commentum Diaboli.</hi> A <hi>Dominican Inquiſitor</hi> of <hi>Pavia,</hi> nam'd <hi>Mercorus,</hi> publiſh'd ſoon after a Book againſt the ſame <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and divers other Looſeneſſes of the <hi>Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts.</hi> And in fine, after theſe laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations touching the <hi>Moral,</hi> a famous <hi>Prelat</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd <hi>Proſper Fagnani,</hi> a perſon that the <hi>Pope</hi> honour'd with a particular friendſhip, has inſerted in a great <hi>Volume</hi> which he has compos'd upon the <hi>Decretals,</hi> a large <hi>Treatiſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Probability</hi> of the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> where he repreſents this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as the fountain of all ſorts of Corruptions and Diſorders, and treats it with <hi>Merenda</hi> as a <hi>Diabolical</hi> Invention, <hi>Commentum Diaboli.</hi> In this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> he mentions with an <hi>Elogy</hi> the purſuits which the <hi>Curats</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and of <hi>Rouën</hi> have made againſt the <hi>Caſuiſts:</hi> He inſerts the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> which they propos'd to the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:93311:94"/>
of ſeveral dangerous <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of theſe <hi>Authors,</hi> and the <hi>Cenſures</hi> which have been given them in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> and had he been but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what has been ſince done in <hi>France,</hi> there is no doubt but he would likewiſe have mention'd the <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the <hi>French Biſhops,</hi> as he does thoſe of certain <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was all done by <hi>conſent</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Book it ſelf is dedicated to him; ſo as one may well judge it was not very welcome to the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> Yet durſt they never attacque him openly. But they made uſe of two Artifices to have ruin'd this <hi>Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Firſt was, To bring <hi>Merenda</hi>'s Book to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and endeavour to have it cenſur'd upon ſome pretext, which in that Country they never fail of, when they deſire to <hi>blaſt</hi> a <hi>Book.</hi> And accordingly they ſoon ſucceeded, and we have ſeen the Book of <hi>Merenda</hi> in the liſt of ſuch as the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> has condemn'd.</p>
               <p>The Second was, To inſtigate <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:93311:94"/>
now a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> to write againſt <hi>Fagnani.</hi> He undertook it, and after his manner acquitted himſelf, that is to ſay, with his ordinary <hi>Impudence.</hi> For he maintains in his <hi>Book</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Probability</hi> as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> oppos'd to the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeniſts:</hi> He will have all the <hi>Curates</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> and of <hi>Rouën,</hi> together with all thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> who cenſur'd the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> to be arrant <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> and of whoſe authority there is no regard to be had. This put him well with the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who were marvellouſly ſatisfied with theſe goodly beginnings; but they were not ſo with the <hi>conſequence.</hi> For the <hi>Pope</hi> being clearly advertis'd by <hi>Fagnani</hi> of theſe Intrigues, caus'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda</hi>'s Book to be fetch'd out of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and condemn'd that of <hi>Caramuel,</hi> which continues ſo cenſur'd without remedy.</p>
               <p>And thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> finiſh'd the Warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> by which it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears that they are ſtuff'd with an infinity of pernicious and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Maximes</hi>; that above all the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93311:95"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Probability</hi> (which is the <hi>Source</hi>) is an Invention of the <hi>Devil</hi>; and that therefore F. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> who has defended it, and as many <hi>Jeſuites</hi> as have maintain'd it, are <hi>Co-operators</hi> and <hi>Predicators</hi> of that Serpent, <hi>Praedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Serpentis,</hi> as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaies; and that, on the contrary, thoſe who have oppos'd the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> have done the <hi>Church</hi> one of the moſt conſiderable ſervices that <hi>Divines</hi> are capable of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring her. Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> continues ſtill victorious, as that of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> quite wither'd and come to nothing in the conteſt: But ſo is it not as to their <hi>Perſons.</hi> The greatneſs of the <hi>Service</hi> which theſe <hi>Divines</hi> have render'd to the <hi>Church</hi> has diminiſh'd nothing of the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> which they have for ſo long time ſuffer'd; nay, on the contrary, it does but <hi>augment</hi> them, in provoking the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to purſue them with the greater violence. Nor have the ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Cenſures</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> abated ought of their temporal <hi>power:</hi> 'Tis known they ſtill perſevere in the very ſame <hi>Maximes</hi> that have
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93311:95"/>
been condemn'd, nor do they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conceal them, yet in the mean time they are permitted the <hi>adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Men would never ſuffer that the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> who had been known for <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſoners,</hi> ſhould continue to exerciſe their <hi>faculty</hi>; whiles yet they permit theſe <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> convinc'd to have govern'd them with their enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd <hi>Maximes,</hi> to preſcribe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Medicine, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any mark or caution to the <hi>Church</hi> that they have ſincerely <hi>renounc'd</hi> them.</p>
               <p>But it is an Effect of the depth of <hi>God</hi>'s Judgements, who imparts his <hi>Graces</hi> on his <hi>Church</hi> according to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and boundaries them within the ſight of mens <hi>Sins.</hi> A great one it is which he has beſtowed on her, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Moral</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by ſo many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and by thereby giving all men an opportunity, who ſincerely purſue their own <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to renounce their <hi>Conduct.</hi> But he has not altogether accompliſh'd this favour; but ſuffers the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93311:96"/>
enjoy the ſame <hi>Authority,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves in the ſame <hi>Credit</hi> which they formerly had, to the end they may ſerve him as <hi>miniſters</hi> of his <hi>Wrath,</hi> that thoſe who deſerve to be <hi>miſled</hi> may be <hi>miſled,</hi> and by their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions</hi> to prove thoſe who are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be prov'd. This is their <hi>emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and office in the <hi>Church,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that of the <hi>King</hi> to whom <hi>God</hi> directs theſe words in the <hi>Scripture, Vae Aſſur, virga furoris mei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I beſeech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> do not imagine that it is the difference of <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> upon the quarrel of <hi>Janſeniſm</hi> which imports me to embrace theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The moſt <hi>Religious</hi> perſons of the <hi>Church,</hi> and who have never been ſo much as ſuſpected of any kindneſs for that which they call <hi>Janſeniſm,</hi> have, I aſſure you, no other <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> And amongſt others the late M. the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cahors,</hi> being upon his <hi>Death-bed,</hi> expreſsly ordered M. the <hi>Abbot Ferrier,</hi> great <hi>Vicar</hi> to my Lord <hi>Biſhop d' Alby,</hi> to ſay from him to M. <hi>de Alet,</hi> M. <hi>de Pamiers,</hi> and M. <hi>de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menge,</hi>

That he had done all he could to reduce the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> from their <hi>Errours,</hi> but that he knew them for people <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible</hi> and without <hi>remedy</hi>; that he held them for the greateſt <hi>Enemies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>; and did earneſtly deſire that theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> would never have any thing to doe with them. This <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> perform'd his <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> and ſaid the ſame things to ſome perſons of great Quality, from whom we have receiv'd that which we here mention.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> that you expect what I ſhould ſay of the Conteſtation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Janſeniſm,</hi> which is the moſt tedious and refractory of all the reſt; and that you haply think I could not ſay as much of that, that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Divines</hi> has had its <hi>Triumphs</hi> alſo; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> produce whole <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes</hi> of <hi>Decrees, Briefs, Conſtitutions, Arreſts,</hi> and <hi>Declarations</hi> which they have obtain'd againſt them; and that the <hi>Letters</hi> of theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> make a great part of thoſe which have furniſh'd the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> any time theſe <hi>ten years.</hi> But all this ſhall not hinder
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93311:97"/>
me yet from aſſuring you before-hand, that the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of this <hi>Warr</hi> will not be at all inferiour to that of the <hi>others</hi>; and that you will there likewiſe ſee theſe <hi>Divines</hi> oppreſs'd, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and the <hi>Truth</hi> triumphing over their <hi>Errours.</hi> You are onely to follow me, as I do that of the various <hi>faces</hi> of this <hi>Diſpute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It began firſt in <hi>Flanders</hi> at the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> of <hi>Louvain,</hi> it being there that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> publiſh'd thoſe famous <hi>Theſes</hi> againſt <hi>Janſenius,</hi> where they accus'd him of an infinity of <hi>Errours.</hi> But the <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Louvain</hi> repell'd them with ſo much <hi>vigour,</hi> that whiles they inſiſted on their <hi>Books,</hi> the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> had no cauſe to boaſt of their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>A little after the Diſpute came into <hi>France,</hi> upon occaſion of the <hi>Sermons</hi> of M. <hi>Habert</hi> a <hi>Pariſian Divine,</hi> who in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> did publickly accuſe this <hi>Prelat</hi>'s Book of no leſs then <hi>Fourty Hereſies.</hi> But the firſt <hi>Apologie</hi> for <hi>Janſenius</hi> having taught him a little to <hi>moderate</hi> his <hi>Zeal,</hi> he reduc'd theſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93311:97"/>
                  <hi>Hereſies</hi> to the number of <hi>Twelve,</hi> of which he continu'd to accuſe him in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> which he writ againſt this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which appear'd a little after, made him yet to cut off <hi>Seven</hi> more: For <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Cornet</hi> (how-ever enemy againſt this <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Book) durſt propoſe but <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi> to the <hi>Faculty,</hi> and that without <hi>naming</hi> them, though with a deſign of one day cauſing his Book to be <hi>re-cenſur'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>abatement</hi> is very conſiderable, ſince we have already <hi>Thirty five Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> retrench'd of the number, and that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had but to juſtifie themſelves of <hi>Five</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, and thoſe are the <hi>Five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Propoſitions.</hi> And this was <hi>eaſie</hi> for them to doe: For they proteſted that they maintain'd upon the <hi>Five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> but what was the <hi>Catholick</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe,</hi> which might there be included; and that (ſeeing they were <hi>captious</hi>) it was reaſonable they ſhould <hi>except</hi> the <hi>ſenſe</hi>

of <hi>Efficacious Grace</hi> before they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them. It was on this deſign they went to <hi>Rome,</hi> not abſolutely to defend theſe <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the <hi>Pope</hi> that he would <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> concerning their divers <hi>ſenſe</hi>; and to except that of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe.</hi> This was the ſcope of the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> which they preſented to the <hi>Pope</hi> upon this <hi>Subject,</hi> in which they pray'd his <hi>Holineſs</hi> to cauſe them to <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and examine the various ſenſe of the equivocal and maliciouſly-forg'd Propoſitions</hi> which had been preſented to him; <hi>ut diſtingui, &amp; ſigillatim ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminari faciat varios ſenſus Propoſitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num equivocarum, &amp; ad fraudem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarum.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Dominicans</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were touch'd with the ſame apprehenſions, leſt they ſhould invelop the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe</hi> within the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the <hi>Five Propoſitions</hi>; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that</hi> ſought for <hi>Audience</hi> ſeventeen times, without being able to obtain it, &amp; preſented ſeveral Writings to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as they are ſince printed in the <hi>Journal</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:93311:98"/>
of M. <hi>de S.

               </p>
               <p>Had <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> granted what theſe <hi>Doctors</hi> deſired, by excepting formally the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe,</hi> it could not have been denied but they had had all the advantage, ſince that was all they demanded. But <hi>God</hi> was not pleas'd to permit that they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a thing which would have put an end to a world of <hi>Troubles.</hi> The <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> was publiſh'd without diſtinction. But that the <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould not ſuffer, <hi>God</hi> ſupplied this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as well by divers particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the ſame <hi>Pope Innocent,</hi> who upon all occaſions teſtified, that he would by no means either touch the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93311:99"/>
ſenſe of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe,</hi> or the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>; as by the general <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> where the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> was receiv'd but in this <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and with <hi>exception</hi> of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe,</hi> as being no way violated by this <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Doctors</hi> made no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to ſubmit to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of <hi>Innocent</hi>; becauſe they obtain'd by this <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> the ſame thing which they had deſir'd ſhould have been inſerted in the <hi>Bull</hi> it ſelf, which is, the <hi>exception</hi> of <hi>Efficacious Grace.</hi> And this <hi>ſenſe</hi> being excluded by the conſent of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> themſelves, and by that unanimous accord which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the language of the <hi>Church,</hi> it was very evident they had no more any thing which was good in them, and that one might abſolutely condemn them, as moſt ſincerely they did, and as they have done ever ſince.</p>
               <p>By this means thoſe pretended <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> whereof they accus'd the <hi>Divines</hi> were wholly deſtroy'd, from <hi>Fourty</hi> they were come to <hi>Twelve,</hi> from
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93311:99"/>
                  <hi>Twelve</hi> to <hi>Five,</hi> and from <hi>Five</hi> to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> The <hi>Jeſuites</hi> had but one <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie</hi> advantage, and theſe <hi>Divines</hi> had this <hi>real</hi> advantage, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Efficacious Grace per ſe</hi> was more and more acknowledg'd for <hi>orthodox</hi> by the whole <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remain'd now but one <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> upon the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact, viz.</hi> whether theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> were, or were not in <hi>Janſenius</hi>; but as that was not of <hi>conſequence,</hi> no body could ever have thought that ſuch a <hi>Trifle</hi> ſhould have diſturb'd the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Yet it did ſo notwithſtanding, by means of that <hi>blind</hi> paſſion which poſſeſs'd the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to find out <hi>Hereſie</hi> in their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</hi> For ſeeing all other means fail them, they conſulted how to erect an <hi>Hereſie</hi> of a <hi>new</hi> kinde, which had no other foundation but this <hi>queſtion</hi> of <hi>Fact.</hi> And upon this deſign it was that they promoted theſe extravagant <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi> That the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> was inſeparable from the <hi>Right</hi> in the affair of <hi>Janſenius</hi>; and, That whoever ſhould deny that theſe condemn'd <hi>Propoſitions</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:93311:100"/>
were in this <hi>Prelate</hi>'s Book, and ſhould refuſe to condemn them as <hi>ſo</hi> in his <hi>Senſe,</hi> were <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They inclos'd this new Hereſie in this <hi>myſterious</hi> word, of the <hi>Senſe of Janſenius,</hi> which is, according to them, I know not what of <hi>Unexplicable,</hi> and 'tis impoſſible to expreſs it but by theſe words. This is as it were the <hi>Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the <hi>Secret</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is onely in the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> breaſts. 'Tis a certain <hi>conceal'd</hi> Poiſon which onely theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> know, though, for its being <hi>Catholick,</hi> it be neceſſary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, for all the World to <hi>reject</hi> it without <hi>knowing</hi> it. For though they ſometimes explicate this <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> as they think good; yet is not this <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> thus explain'd by them that which makes the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> but a certain other <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> which they do <hi>not</hi> explain at all. And to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> this to you, it is afterwards that you have rejected all the <hi>Dogms</hi> in which they comprehend this <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> that they yet require you
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93311:100"/>
to <hi>condemn</hi> the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> as ſomething <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>ſeparated</hi> from all thoſe particular <hi>Dogms.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, F. <hi>Annat</hi> in his new Book en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> within theſe two Principles; <hi>That this Prelate condemns all</hi> Sufficient Grace; <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to believe that one cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Efficacious Grace.</hi> Who would not ſay to this <hi>Reverend Father,</hi> Well, <hi>Father,</hi> ſeeing <hi>this</hi> is, according to <hi>you,</hi> the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> I reject theſe two <hi>Principles</hi>; I receive <hi>Sufficient Grace</hi> after the ſame manner as does the <hi>School</hi> of S. <hi>Thomas</hi>; I acknowledge one may reſiſt <hi>Efficacious Grace,</hi> though in <hi>effect</hi> one does never reſiſt it, and that this power to reſiſt does in the mean time ſubſiſt with this <hi>Grace?</hi> See there your <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> condemned. But you muſt yet condemn the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>there will be Yea and Nay between you and the Church,</hi> and you will for all that remain an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</hi>

               <p>Therefore F. <hi>Ferrier,</hi> who after his manner explains the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

three or four times in his <hi>Relation,</hi> when he would deſcribe in his <hi>Idea</hi> in what the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conſiſt, is very cautious not to make it conſiſt in any of thoſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <hi>Dogms</hi> which he had attributed to <hi>Janſenius</hi>; but pretends that it is <hi>ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> comprehended in this general <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> The Senſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi> is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi> So as, according to the new <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of theſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> beſides all particular <hi>Dogms,</hi> be they what they will, yet the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius</hi> muſt in general be <hi>condemn'd,</hi> and it is this general and unexplicable <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> in which (according to the <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>) conſiſts the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Janſenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd that ſince <hi>men</hi> did ever <hi>reaſon</hi> together, there was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> the like <hi>Extravagancy.</hi> But the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> is yet infinitely <hi>more</hi> ſtrange.

                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:93311:101"/>
which was never yet <hi>heard of</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> unleſs it were amongſt the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> who are <hi>blam'd</hi> for it by thoſe who have defended the <hi>Church</hi> againſt them. For 'tis requiſite we ſhould know, that ſince the <hi>Church</hi> was a <hi>Church,</hi> one has never <hi>oblig'd</hi> either <hi>Religious</hi> men, or <hi>School-maſters,</hi> or <hi>Clerks,</hi> or ſo much as ſimple <hi>Prieſts</hi> to <hi>ſign.</hi> They were the <hi>German Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> of the Confeſſion of <hi>Auſburg</hi> who for <hi>one</hi> time onely caus'd their <hi>Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to be ſign'd by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals</hi> of the <hi>Colleges,</hi> and the <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Schools:</hi> And they are <hi>reprov'd</hi> for it by <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> as of an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable <hi>Vanity</hi> and a <hi>Novelty</hi> unheard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that ſo <hi>ſtrange</hi> a thing as this <hi>practice,</hi> to which there was never any <hi>recourſe</hi> in the moſt damnable <hi>Hereſies,</hi> ſhould be introduc'd in <hi>France,</hi> that is to ſay, in a <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>free'ſt</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>enemy</hi> to theſe <hi>Servitudes,</hi> and upon occaſion of ſuch <hi>Trifles</hi>; this is what is moſt <hi>ſtupendious</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:93311:102"/>
indeed, but in that manner which we admire the extraordinary effects of the <hi>Fantaſticalneſs</hi> of men. It is certain yet that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> could not have better publiſh'd to the world the <hi>exceſs</hi> of that <hi>credit</hi> which they have in the <hi>Church,</hi> then by this means. 'Tis nothing to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh <hi>reaſonable</hi> things; no man can tell whether it be <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> which has made them to be receiv'd: but to make their <hi>power</hi> appear indeed, one ſhould chuſe ſuch things as <hi>theſe,</hi> which are moſt exceſſively <hi>irrational.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can ſay no more to exalt the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; and we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that having ſucceeded in <hi>this</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they are able to doe <hi>what-ever</hi> is not <hi>impoſsible.</hi> But in this, as <hi>ill luck</hi> would have it, the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> which they would <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> eſtabliſh, is one of thoſe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible</hi> things; ſince to perſuade the <hi>world</hi> of it, they muſt of courſe change the <hi>common Senſe</hi> of <hi>men:</hi> ſo as, in <hi>ſpight</hi> of them, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi> muſt of <hi>neceſsity</hi> vanquiſh in this <hi>laſt</hi> point, which is as it were
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93311:102"/>
the <hi>ultimate Redoubt</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not onely ſay that it muſt needs be ſo for the <hi>future,</hi> and that all the pretenſions of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the queſtion <hi>de facto</hi> of <hi>Janſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſhould paſs for <hi>ridiculous</hi>; but I ſay, 'tis already ſo, becauſe they do paſs for <hi>ſuch</hi> already amongſt all perſons who have any <hi>cogniſance</hi> of thoſe matters, and that there are very <hi>few</hi> of them but are <hi>diſabus'd.</hi> This I have <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated</hi> by other proofs in my precedent <hi>Letters</hi>; and therefore I ſatisfie my ſelf for this time with a <hi>concluding</hi> one.</p>
               <p>There are divers <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>France</hi> who have boldly declar'd in the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that matter of <hi>Fact</hi> and matter of <hi>Right</hi> are <hi>different</hi> things in the affair of <hi>Janſenius</hi>; that all <hi>Hereſie</hi> conſiſts in a preciſe <hi>Dogm</hi>; and that one cannot with the leaſt <hi>ſhadow</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> treat thoſe as <hi>Hereticks</hi> whom they do not reproch with any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Hereſie, becauſe they do ſimply <hi>queſtion</hi> whether any ſuch <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are in a <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> M. <hi>de Alet,</hi> M. <hi>de Vence,</hi> M. <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> and M. <hi>d' Angers</hi>

clearly promote all theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>indubitable</hi>; and you may find them all comprehended in M. <hi>de Comenge</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>King,</hi> which is alone ſufficient to ruine all the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures</hi> of Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> and all the <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> In the mean time theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> with all their <hi>credit</hi> cannot find <hi>Five</hi> other <hi>Biſhops</hi> in <hi>France</hi> that dare <hi>formally</hi> to promote the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> contrary to thoſe which are maintain'd by theſe <hi>Prelates.</hi> They may find ſome that may ſpeak of the <hi>conceal'd</hi> venome of the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Janſeniſm,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>words</hi> which ſignifie <hi>nothing,</hi> and which they willingly <hi>yield</hi> to the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> party.

               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay at leaſt, that the

                  <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Cauſe has all the <hi>advantage</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Briefs</hi> are all in their favour. But let me tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> 'Tis <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>Calumnies</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have render'd the <hi>Divines</hi> odious there, becauſe they are oppoſite to the unjuſt pretences of the <hi>Roman Court</hi> againſt the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi>; and <hi>therefore</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are not <hi>diſpleas'd</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> at the <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> which they ſuffer. But ſince they have <hi>common Senſe</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> as well as at <hi>other</hi> places, all that theſe <hi>Divines</hi> maintain <hi>here</hi> is receiv'd <hi>there,</hi> and as well believ'd as in other <hi>places,</hi> &amp; indeed more generally then in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf; becauſe <hi>Paſsion</hi> has not ſo much diſturb'd their <hi>Reaſon</hi> and their <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I do not love to report things without <hi>proof</hi>; and therefore I ſhall alledge <hi>one</hi> which is very <hi>deciſive</hi> upon this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That even the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> has newly &amp; authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically <hi>approv'd</hi> all that thoſe whom they call <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> have taught in <hi>France</hi> upon the Queſtion <hi>de facto</hi> &amp; <hi>de jure,</hi> which is ſo <hi>ridiculouſly</hi> oppos'd by the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:93311:104"/>I conceive you will not require of me to ſhew you that the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> has given this <hi>Judgment</hi> in favour of them under the expreſs <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi> and <hi>Janſeniſts.</hi> You know well enough what <hi>Reaſons</hi> they have to hinder them from rendring them this <hi>exact</hi> Juſtice.

               <p>What do theſe <hi>Divines</hi> pretend? <hi>There is</hi> (ſay they) <hi>a very wide difference between defending of condemn'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſuch as are repugnant to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, which they attribute to</hi> Janſenius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Ypres, <hi>and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that</hi> Janſenius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Ypres <hi>has not taught thoſe condemn'd Opinions. The Firſt would be prejudicial to the Church, and to their ſelves; but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is not in any kinde ſo. For, as all</hi> Divines <hi>acknowledg, there is a great deal of difference between ſaying that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils &amp; the Church can erre</hi> in jure, <hi>in condemning an Opinion which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93311:104"/>
does not deſerve to be condemn'd; and affirming that it can erre</hi> de facto, <hi>in judging that ſuch or ſuch a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been taught by a certain parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon. The Errour of General</hi> Councils <hi>or the</hi> Church <hi>in matter of</hi> Fact <hi>can cauſe no prejudice to the</hi> Church; <hi>but the Errour of a Council in matter of</hi> Right <hi>would be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudicial to the</hi> Church. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we not pretend to defend the Errours of the Five Propoſitions attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to</hi> Janſenius; <hi>but that which we pretend is, that there is no harm in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that</hi> Janſenius <hi>is innocent, and at leaſt to acquit him from this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Aſperſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee what theſe perſons ſay, 'tis a <hi>ſummary</hi> of all their pretenſions. Now hear my <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and obſerve if you can where the <hi>difference</hi> conſiſts which <hi>diſtinguiſhes</hi> it from the <hi>affair</hi> of <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius.</hi> In the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the fulleſt of all the <hi>Councils</hi> ſince, there were no leſs then 1280 <hi>Prelates</hi> at it, they examin'd the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Abbot Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achim,</hi> ſo famous for his <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and

among the <hi>reſt</hi> a ſmall <hi>Treatiſe</hi> which he compos'd on the Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Sentences.</hi> The <hi>Council</hi> finding in this <hi>Writing</hi> a corrupt <hi>Propoſition,</hi> condemn'd him for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and the <hi>Condemnation</hi> is inſerted in the <hi>Canon Law.</hi> There was at the ſame time another <hi>Abbot,</hi> call'd <hi>Gregory de Laude, Doctor</hi> in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> who having undertaken to write his <hi>Life</hi> and interpret his <hi>Prophecies,</hi> thought himſelf oblig'd to juſtifie the <hi>Hereſie</hi> which was imputed to him by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi> This was an otherwiſe bold undertaking then that of juſtifying <hi>Janſenius</hi> of the <hi>Errours</hi> which were charg'd upon him. He did it yet without fear in the 67 <hi>Chap. pag.</hi> 281. of his <hi>Book</hi> printed at <hi>Naples</hi> in folio, 1660. where he thus diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>That none may be ſcandaliz'd at what we are about to affirm, they are to know, that there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween defending an Opinion condemn'd, and repugnant to the Catholick Faith, which is attributed to</hi> Joachim <hi>Abbot</hi> de Flore, <hi>and the maintaining that</hi> Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93311:105"/>
Abbot of <hi>Flore</hi> has not taught thoſe condemn'd Opinions. The Firſt would be prejudicial to the Church and to my ſelf; but the Second not at all. For, as that moſt Learned perſon <hi>Dominicus Gravina</hi> (according to his cuſtome) ſaies, There is a great difference between ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that General Councils can erre in matter of <hi>Right,</hi> by condemning an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which merits not that Cenſure; and affirming they may erre in matter of Fact, <hi>by judging ſuch or ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was taught by an Author. The Errours of Councils in matters of</hi> Fact <hi>can doe no prejudice to the Church; but the Errour of a Council in matter of</hi> Right <hi>may be highly injurious to the Church. And therefore we do not in the leaſt pretend to defend the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour attributed to</hi> Joachim <hi>by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Lateran; <hi>but that which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is, to defend the innocence of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> Joachim, <hi>and to diſcharge him from this ſtain and ignominy.

            <p>AFTER I have kiſſed your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Feet, and made a moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ſubjection, &amp;c. I F. <hi>Valerian, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe,</hi> Prieſt, of the Order of the Friers <hi>Minors,</hi> call'd <hi>Capuchins,</hi> (being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd under pain of Excommunication and other Penalties expreſs'd in the <hi>Bulls</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> your Predeceſſors) declare to your Holineſs, that I have by a long ſeries of years exactly obſerv'd,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93311:110"/>
that the <hi>Clerks Regular</hi> named <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> whilſt they thirſt after riches, dominion and glory above all mortal men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, publickly commit and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate many things which are prohibited, and omit many things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under the penalty of mortal Sin, not ſhewing the leaſt token of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without which they become ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> whiles they ſuppoſe thoſe enormous commiſſions not to be prohibited; or, if conſcious of their Crimes, they continue to wallow in them, preſumed guilty of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> But I explain my deduction by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titius</hi> a Pariſh-Prieſt in a <hi>City</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a publick <hi>Notarie</hi> and four <hi>Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to frame a ſuppoſititious <hi>Teſtament,</hi> by which fraud the right Heir is depriv'd of an Inheritance of a <hi>hundred thouſand Crowns,</hi> which <hi>Titius</hi> ſeizes for himſelf, by perverting juſtice before the <hi>Judge,</hi> whom, notwithſtanding, (together with the <hi>Notarie</hi> and <hi>Witneſſes</hi>) he, in the Sacrament of Penance, abſolves from the Crime, as not at all oblig'd to make
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93311:110"/>
Reſtitution, defending himſelf againſt the parties oppreſſed, and others that are highly ſcandaliz'd hereat, with all manner of other pious Works, (thoſe onely excepted which hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of riches, glory and dominion) ſuch as Praier, Faſting, Alms, and whatever elſe have merit and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation from the Auſterity of Life.</p>
            <p>This Fact involves, 1. the Crime of Subornation and falſifying in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Notarie</hi>; 2. <hi>Perjurie</hi> in the four Witneſſes; 3. the <hi>Theft</hi> of 100000 Crowns; 4. the <hi>perverting</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> before a <hi>Judge</hi>; 5. the notorious Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of <hi>Impenitence,</hi> and <hi>Impunitie</hi> for ſo many and ſo grievous Crimes; and laſtly, the extreme abuſe of the holy Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Six Errours, under the guilt of <hi>mortal Sin,</hi> prohibited all men both by the <hi>Divine, natural</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> Laws, whoſoever does obſtinately and contumaciouſly deny, whether in theſe or others of like quality, is an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.</hi> To this Doctrine I firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, and having atteſted the verity of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93311:111"/>
the <hi>Fact,</hi> declare to your Holineſs the foreſaid <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or (to ſay better) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to explain not a few of theſe and the like Enormities, together with the Circumſtances of Place, Time, Perſons, and other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars belonging to them, I ſhall firſt aſſert to your Holineſs the innocency of this my Declaration; not from any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ariſing from this ſuppreſſion of Hereſie, (which of it ſelf is ſufficiently manifeſt) but by the very Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my perſon. Namely, thus:</p>
            <p>Since the year 1653 I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignified to the holy Congregation <hi>De propaganda Fide,</hi> and other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the <hi>Apoſtolical See,</hi> this my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the Hereſie of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; nor hath any of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to diſapprove my Zeal, which therefore I have reaſon to think pious, and not at all unacceptable to them.</p>
            <p>Above twenty years ſince I ſignified to the ſame <hi>holy Congregation</hi> Fourteen <hi>Commiſsions</hi> and <hi>Omiſsions,</hi> wherein the <hi>General</hi> and two <hi>Provincials</hi> of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:93311:111"/>
and divers others, together with their <hi>Aſsiſtants</hi> and <hi>Councel,</hi> remain'd contumaciouſly involv'd for many years; which I condemn'd as including both <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinals underſtanding by me, that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> had ſpred a report as if I had been reprov'd for this Addreſs to the <hi>Congregation,</hi> did of their own accord and by their <hi>Letters Patent</hi> (corroborated with their <hi>Seal,</hi> and the ſubſcription of the moſt eminent <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Borgia</hi>) commend and approve that my <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> exhorting me to conſtancy in rendring my ſervices to the holy <hi>See Apoſtolick.</hi> I appeal then to the <hi>Archives</hi> of the ſame <hi>holy Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> animated to make this <hi>Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by a Perſon whom I am ready to produce, as becomes the deſign in hand.</p>
            <p>To Father <hi>Wadding</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi>) who endeavour'd my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the <hi>Society,</hi> I promis'd my moſt humble ſervices, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he could prove that the aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Fourteen Crimes</hi> were not prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93311:112"/>
under penalty of <hi>mortal Sin.</hi> But he immediately breaking off the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, departs in a rage, and was never ſeen by me ſince. With like ſucceſs, ſome years after, F. <hi>Nicolas Lenſiſius, Exprovincial</hi> of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> (together with <hi>Baron Pramorus Dean</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of <hi>Comacum</hi>) in the preſence of divers Noble Perſons, us'd much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion to induce me to a better intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Society. But he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the patience to hear me reade what I had written concerning thoſe <hi>Fourteen Actions,</hi> ſuddainly departed, nor ſo much as ever reply'd to the Letters which I had ſent him on this <hi>Argument,</hi> nor did I afterwards ſee him any more.</p>
            <p>Being by theſe and many of the like nature incited to denounce to the H. <hi>Apoſtolick See</hi> this growing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raging <hi>Hereſie</hi> of that <hi>Society</hi>; I did humbly (by an Epiſtle dated from our <hi>Monaſterie</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>) admoniſh <hi>Mutius Vitelleſcus,</hi> then General of the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> concerning that Affair; a Copie whereof I exhibited to <hi>Pope Urban</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of happy memory, and to ſome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93311:112"/>
of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> who are yet living, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning an <hi>Exemplar</hi> of the ſame to the <hi>Emperour Ferdinand</hi> the <hi>Second</hi>; that my judicial Declaration being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of, might appear the more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, when I found that Evangelical correction did nothing avail.</p>
            <p>But neither receiv'd I any anſwer from <hi>Mutius,</hi> nor obſerved any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the <hi>Society.</hi> Thus may I have ſufficiently aſſerted the ſincerity of my <hi>Declaration,</hi> as inſtituted according to the rule of the <hi>Holy Goſpel,</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> for the Conſervation of <hi>Faith</hi> and purity of <hi>Manners.</hi> But it alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns my particular ſafety, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate you will protect againſt the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> who deſire nothing more then my ruine, yea, that I were even buried alive, with as much indignity to thoſe whoſe <hi>Aſylum</hi> I invoke, as this my perſonal welfare concerns the integrity of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi>

            <p>WHAT a <hi>Tragedy</hi> the <hi>Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Libell</hi> of our Father <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerianus,</hi> lately publiſh'd againſt the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> has rais'd amongſt us, I will briefly relate.</p>
            <p>Upon the Eve of the <hi>Purification</hi> of the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> there appear'd in this our <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Vienna</hi> the Auditor of the <hi>Apoſtolick Nuncio</hi> in a Coach, and with him the <hi>Secretaries</hi> of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> attended with arm'd Souldiers. The <hi>Auditor</hi> having call'd before him the F. <hi>Valerian,</hi> the <hi>Guardian</hi> of the Place being alſo preſent, denounces an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> againſt him in the name of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Nuncio:</hi> But the <hi>Secretary</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him in the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s name, to come without delay immediately into the Coach, unleſs he would be violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeiſed by the Souldiers. He willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93311:113"/>
obeys, and is led to the <hi>Imperial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital,</hi> where he is caſt into the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and infamous Priſon, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the cuſtody of the Souldiers, thence to be ſhortly brought forth, and (as he ſaies) by the command of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> ſent Captive to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, behold the whole City of <hi>Vienna</hi> in an uproar; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of both Sexes and of all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſtoniſh'd, and wondring at this leud manner of proceeding, deteſts it as ſcandalous, precipitate, and highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to <hi>Religion.</hi> As well <hi>Secular</hi> perſons as <hi>Regulars</hi> of almoſt all <hi>Orders,</hi> and even the <hi>Grandees</hi> themſelves, run flocking to the <hi>Monaſterie,</hi> compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the <hi>Father</hi>'s condition; ſome of them of their own accord repair to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the <hi>Empreſs,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolical Nuncio</hi>; and others of the <hi>Nobility</hi> whom it concern'd defend the caſe of <hi>Valerianus</hi> and of our <hi>Order,</hi> ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that means may be found out to obviate the Scandal.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93311:114"/>
live; He ſuffers thus for the truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let the FF. of the Society periſh; the authors and promoters of all theſe Confuſions.</hi> Thus they purſue them with imprecations, caſting dirt and ſtones at as many of them as come in their way.</p>
            <p>I being at this time employ'd in viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the neighboring <hi>Convents,</hi> no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hear of this, but I haſten to <hi>Vienna,</hi> find the <hi>Apoſtolick Nuncio</hi> exceedingly perplex'd, and paſſing the nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep; declare to him the danger of ſo great a Tumult; preſſing him to ſeek out ſome Expedient to appeaſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future Scandals. He reply'd, That he did truly compaſſionate us and the F. <hi>Valerian,</hi> but durſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Pontifical <hi>Mandats</hi>; reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting me, that I would think of ſome means how to avert theſe imminent evils: and in fine concludes, he would conform himſelf (Caution being given) to the diſpoſal of <hi>Caeſar</hi>; affirming that he was ignorant of the manner of his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>From hence I goe to other of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> and at length to the <hi>Emperor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93311:114"/>
who hearing me very graciouſly, I declare, that I came not to plead for the F. <hi>Valerian,</hi> or defend his Actions, but to implore Juſtice; that by his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi>'s Mediation the ſaid <hi>Father</hi> might be conven'd before a competent <hi>Judge,</hi> his <hi>Proceſs</hi> heard, and being found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might be puniſh'd according to his demerits, as he himſelf alſo deſir'd: at leaſt I earneſtly beſeech him, that theſe Scandals might be repreſs'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proviſion made for the honour of our <hi>Religion,</hi> being my ſelf no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concern'd in the affair. To this I adde, how much all men are aſtoniſh'd with admiration, that a <hi>Capuchin</hi> of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years in the <hi>Order,</hi> for <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of higheſt reputation, formerly <hi>Provincial</hi> of this Country, looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as one likely to be made <hi>General</hi> of the whole <hi>Order,</hi> and in time advanc'd to the dignity of <hi>Cardinal</hi>; that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd ſo well of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> by whoſe negotiation and dexterity the Marriage between the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Daughter of the Emperour <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the II<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſucceeded happily; that

ſignifie to the <hi>Apoſtolical Nuncio,</hi> that you would not goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> though you might indeed be poſſibly dragg'd thither, upon his Holineſs's command?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> I do not believe the <hi>Pope</hi> (were he conſcious of the fact) would decree me a <hi>ſecular</hi> Priſon, to be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Souldiers ſo far as <hi>Rome,</hi> for theſe very Circumſtances of my perſon; namely, that I am, Firſt, actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in denouncing the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of other <hi>Popes</hi> his predeceſſors, commanding theſe <hi>Denunciations</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalty of <hi>Excommunication:</hi> The chief Arguments of which <hi>Declaration</hi> I could not (as I ſaid) expound in five or ſix <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which would hardly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the very firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Crimes perpetrated by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> as directed (ſay they) <hi>ad majorem Dei Gloriam,</hi> were neither diſcover'd, nor indeed obſerv'd by me at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in the hereditary States of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from whence they pretend to carry me away.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The acerbity both of a

               <hi>Priſon,</hi> and of a <hi>Journey</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſupported without my infinite confuſion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, My old Age, crazineſs, and affliction of mind, (which thoſe who thus treat me ought to ſuppoſe) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my many private inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, are things which I could no waies endure without imminent peril of death.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, My deſtruction proceeding from Violences of this nature, would make me appear infamous in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion who think well of my <hi>Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, So great an indignity to my perſon would even grieve and afflict the very <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and my own Allies in bloud and affinity, and would in fine perturb no ſmall part of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> to which I am known by many ſignal and honourable titles.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There lies upon me the domeſtick care of my four <hi>Nephews,</hi> (who are all of them (one excepted) under age; the Eldeſt being conſtituted <hi>Guardian</hi> of his Brothers, but ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>The Impriſonment therefore and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Journey to <hi>Rome</hi> is (conſider'd with theſe and other the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) what, in the opinion of wiſe men, an innocent and generous perſon would abhor more then corporal Death.</p>

            <head>THE SENSE OF The FRENCH Church Concerning the Pope's <hi>Infallibility</hi> &amp; <hi>Power,</hi> Lately declared by Authority.</head>
            <p>SInce the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> got ſo much Authority in the Catholick part of the World, as to be able by his Miniſters and Negotiations to attempt to govern private Churches out of his own Metropolitan Dioceſe, there has been wag'd a great War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Divines about the Quality of his Authority. And, as Man's Soul by her Powers and Operations is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, of Underſtanding and Will, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and Practice: ſo the Divines Queſtions, the Gates by which ſuch Tenets get entrance into the Church, are alſo two-leav'd; the one opens to the Power the Pope has to command
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93311:126"/>
aſſent to his Reſolutions of Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Points, the other to what Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is due to his Commands. The party whoſe intereſt it is by application to the higheſt See to dilate their own privileges and exemptions from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Government of the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, and received by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Tradition to our daies, have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with all their might to poſſeſs the World, that both for aſſent to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Truths, and for regulating of Diſcipline, Chriſt had given all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſor; ſo that the whole Hierarchy in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in him alone. The reſt, as far as not infected by them, maintained conſtantly the contrary; and that, though the Pope was chief of Biſhops, yet the Congregation of Biſhops was the Court from whence final reſolutions were to be expected. The former Tenet had of late gotten a great ſtrength through the moſt parts of Chriſtendom; but the Divine Providence, when it found it fitting, raiſed the <hi>French</hi> Church,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93311:127"/>

But it is ordinary with them to teach errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines. And I believe 'tis from the impunity of that Crime that the boldneſs has been taken to defend the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93311:127"/>
like Errours in <hi>Sorbon,</hi> againſt her Statutes, the Doctrine of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the Maximes of State and of this Court. How? That the Pope with five or ſix ignorant Divines with mercenary ſouls ſhould be Infallible to make Articles of Faith of whatſoever Paſsion, Intereſt, or Ambition ſhall ſuggeſt to him? Our Anceſtors have ſeen the fatal conſequences and effects of this pernicious Doctrine. Wherefore, leſt this poiſon ſhould ſpread it ſelf farther, and this pernicious Doctrine take root if it be left unpuniſhed, I conclude the Theſis ſhall be ſtruck out and blotted, the Defendent and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident conſtrained to maintain the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary, and the Syndic never to approve ſuch like Theſes, under pain of being extraordinarily proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.

               <p>The Errour of the Firſt Propoſition lies in the word <hi>ſupra, above</hi>; for the <hi>French</hi> Church holds the Pope to have the higheſt Authority in the Church, that is, over particular men, but not over the <hi>whole Church:</hi> for ſo it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that it was the Faith of <hi>France,</hi> received from the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:93311:132"/>
that a General Council is above the Pope, as alſo hath been practiſed by divers General Councils.</p>
               <p>The Errour of the Second Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That the Privileges of Ancient Churches (ſuch as the <hi>French</hi> Church is) come from the Indulgence of the Pope, and not from the Succeſſion to the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical Founders of them and their firſt Inſtitution. The form of which Churches is to be the Rule to all Chriſtian Churches by whomſoever they are founded: nor is it lawfull to bring in new forms without violating Divine Right delivered in the conſtant Tradition of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Errour of the Third Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth in this, That it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Practice of the Church, begun by the Apoſtles, and continued to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; is againſt manifeſt Experience, and, in effect, takes away all efficacity of extinguiſhing Hereſies and Schiſms, reducing it to the weak principle of the Pope's Infallibility and extraordinary Power: of which

enough is above delivered in proportion to theſe ſhort Notes, to ſhew how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous the mentioned Errours are, and how neceſſary to be condemned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by all good Chriſtians, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious both to Church and State.</p>
