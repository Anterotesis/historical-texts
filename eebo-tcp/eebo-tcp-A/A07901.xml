            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When we were come to <hi>Amiens,</hi> we were giuen to vnderstande, that there was an olde Englishe Préest in the Towne, whose name was Maister <hi>Woodward:</hi> of whome we perswaded our selues for Countrey sake, to finde some courtesie, in hope whereof, we enquired for his lodging, and at last found him. After such salutations as passe betwéene Countreymen at their méeting, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell him, howe we had left our Countrey, for the

earnest desire we had to sée forraine Dominions,<note place="margin">The Preest of whome I haue made mention in my <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of Campion.</hi>
               </note> howe we had béene spoyled by the way, of all that we had, and that we hoped for some fréendship at his handes, which if God vouchsafed vs safe returne, should not be cast out of remembraunce.</p>
            <p>Alas my freendes (quoth he) I am your Countreyman I will not denie, but not such a one as you take me for. I am a poore Préest, and héere I liue for my conscience sake, whereas, were thinges according as they should be, it were better for me to be at home in mine owne Countrey. And yet trust me, I pittie to sée any of my Countreymen lacke, though I am not able any way to reléeue them: there be daylie that commeth this way, to whome, according to my hability, I am liberall, but they be such, as you are not, they come not for pleasure but for profite, they come not to sée euerie idle toye, and to learne a little language, but to learne how to saue bothe their owne and their fréendes soules, and such I would you were, then I could say that to you, which (as you be) I may not.</p>
            <p>Trust me Sir (quoth I) I hope we haue learned to saue our soules already, or else you might estéeme vs in a verie bad case.

            <p>With these wordes, he began to wexe somewhat me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie; which I perceiuing, and remembring that our necessitie, stoode not in case to pleade pointes of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather sought to please him in hope of some lybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, then to contend with him (we béeing vnable) and so fall into farder daunger.

I knowe my good Brother, thou hast long thus liued in my holy order, and hast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed me in euerie thing: therfore I will, that thou be no longer a mortall man, but a Saint. And from this time foreward, thou shalt leaue thy Cloister, &amp; go to the Uaute vnder the Church of Saint <hi>Pancratia</hi>: where thou shalt be woorshipped of euerie one that commeth into the sayde Uaute, and to them thou shalt giue the

bones and Reliques of holie and blessed Saintes, which they in their Churches shal adore with great reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: what thou wilt haue, shall be done, and what thou wilt not, shall not be done.</p>
            <p>After these woordes, Saint <hi>Fraunces</hi> vanished from him, &amp; he went home to the Monastery, to tell his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what had happened: soone after, with burning Tapers, and great showes of holines they brought him to the Uaute of Saint <hi>Pancratia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke this.</note> wherin béeing entred, they found a seate ready prepared for him, which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as bright as the Sun, so that it dimmed the light of all their Tapers: it was like vnto the Clowdes, verie thick beset with twinkling Starres, and ouer the head of it, it was couered with a goodly Rainbowe. Nothing could be séen wheron this seate depended, it neither tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the top of the Uaute ouer head, nor any part of the wall on eyther side, therefore it was suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Angels, whome though they could not discerne, yet they heard them make verie mellodious hermony, to welcom this Saint to his new seat. Then the Frier béeing bashfull, to sée such a glorious seate prouided for him,<note place="margin">O horrible and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable blasphemie.</note> withdrew him selfe, as though he were vnwoorthy to sit therein: but then out of one of the Clowds stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched a hand (which they sayde to be Christes) wherein they sawe the fresh bléeding wound, béeing pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row with the nayle on the Crosse, and this hand pulled the Frier to the Seat, &amp; placed him very roially therin.

            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:13308:27"/>A long time this Saint remained in that Uaute, and many other that came to him, whome he daylie made Saintes: so that, as well on the behalfe of this Saint, as diuers other as good as he, this Uaute is worshipped as though it were a second heauen.</p>
            <p>When he had ended this braue notorious Fable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered foorth with farre more reuerend iesture, then I can set downe, or you imagine: he sayde. If a man should tell this to the Heretiques of our Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, they would strayte way condemne it as a lye &amp; vntrueth: so mightilie dooth the deuill preuayle with them, to deface the daylie miracles showne in the Catholique Church.

            <p>O my déere Countreimen, thinke how God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer these men, that repose credite in such abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vntruethes: whereby he is robbed of his glory, &amp; the worship which we ought of duetie to giue to him, is bestowed on a rable of rascall Reliques, a dunghil of most irksom &amp; noysom smell, &amp; they themselues become spectacles to the world, following the whore of <hi>Roome,</hi> as her puddle of accursed filthinesse. Their impietie hath pierced the heauens, and offended the Almightie, to sée that his Creatures shall thus disdaine their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and therefore, while they are glorying and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in the middest of their wickednesse, he hath thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen them downe, accoumpted them as bastards, &amp; not chyldren, that they might be an example to vs, howe to liue in his feare, and howe to behaue our selues lyke Christians, not to giue his honour to stockes &amp; stones, not to lust after dreames and fantasies of the deuilles inuencion: but whyle we haue the light, to walke as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the chyldren of light, to kéepe our selues true and faithfull Subiectes, to her, by whome we enioy the

            <p>I will set downe one discourse more, of an other lyke myracle, done in an other of their Uautes: and then I will trouble you no longer with such friuelous &amp; foolish stuffe, which I will declare euen in the same manner, as a Préest of theirs, as yet not taken, yet he is héere in <hi>England,</hi> tolde me, when he, I, and two of the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers more,<note place="margin">An other straunge hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, of a Romishe miracle, doon in the Uaut of Saint <hi>Priscilla,</hi> without <hi>Roome.</hi>
               </note> went into the sayde Uaute.</p>
            <p>Without <hi>Roome,</hi> about the distaunce of halfe a myle from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cittie, there is a huge great Uaute, which they call S. <hi>Priscillaes</hi> Grote: and within this Uaute, there is a great many of seuerall places, turning one this way, an other that way, as in one stréete, there may be diuers stréetes and lanes, turning euerie way. So that when they goe into this Uaute, they tye the ende of a lyne at the going in, and so goe on by the lyne, else they might chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to loose them selues, and so misse of their euer comming out againe: or else if they haue not a lyne, they take Chalke with them, and make fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures at euerie turning, that at their comming againe, (béeing guided by Torch lyght, for Candles will goe out with the dampe in the Uaute) they may make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt tyll they get foorth, but this is not so ready a way as by the lyne.</p>
            <p>One day I was desirous to sée this Uaute, for my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe <hi>Thomas Nowell,</hi> in the company of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and the Schollers, had béene therein, and I lying sicke in my Bed, bothe he and they made such a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thereof to me, what a Heauenlie place it was, what a number of Saintes and Martirs had béene bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there, and what precious Reliques was daylie found there: that I verie much desired to sée the thing, whereto they gaue such an admirable prayse. For in soothe, my fellow was euen all one with them, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13308:28"/>
was required of euerie one, &amp; he as lewde in spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches against his Countrey as the best: so that I was estéemed I can not tell howe, they would not misdoubt me for my Parents sake, &amp; yet they would giue me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shrewd nips. As when they demaunded any thing of me, as concerning our gratious Princesse, or any of her honourable Councell, I should aunswer: Her Maiestie, God blesse her, or, the right Honourable, such a Noble man, of whom they asked me: wherat they would check me verie much, for vsing any reuerence in naming her Maiesty, or any of the Lords of her honorable Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell.</p>
            <p>And this I may say boldlie, for that it is true, as God is my witnes,<note place="margin">I speake not this good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eyther in pride or brauerie.</note> that in all the time I was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them: I neither offered moitie of misordred or vndece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t spéech, either of her Maiestie, or any Noble man in the Court, no, nor so much as thought yll of any of them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the woordes they vsed, sufficient (had not God ordred all my dooinges) to haue mooued a more stayed man then my selfe to an error. I appeale to God, who knoweth I set downe nothing but trueth, &amp; to him that is my chéefest enimie, if he can iustlie report otherwise by me: for I thanke God, albeit I were so far from my Countrey, he gaue me the grace to consider, I was a Subiect, &amp; I was bound by duety to regard and honour my Prince so long as I liued. And because my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries obiect against me, that I went to Masse, &amp; helped the Préest my selfe to say Masse: so that (say they) who is wurst, I am as euill as he.

These rash heads béeing in <hi>England,</hi> would doo many goodlie matters at <hi>Roome,</hi> they would tell the Pope of his lasciuious &amp; vnchristian life, the Cardinals of their Sodomiticall sinnes, the Friers of their secret iugling

with the Nunnes, &amp; the Préestes of their painted Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, their wafer God, and their counterfeit blood in the Challice: all this they would doo, nowe they are in <hi>England,</hi> But I doubt if they were at <hi>Roome</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the mercilesse tiranny executed on the members of Christe.

You maye note a speciall example, in these our Countreymen lately executed, that neither their cause was estéemed of God, nor perfectlie perswaded in them selues: yet they would die in a brauerie, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted Martyres at <hi>Roome,</hi> and in the middest of their brauerie, all the world might note their false and faynt hearts.</p>

            <p>As I haue sayde, through the great report they made of this Uaute, one of the Préests, two of the Schollers and I, tooke with vs a line, &amp; two or three great lights, and so we went to this aforesayde Uaute: we going a long in farder and farder, there we sawe certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one aboue an other, thrée and thrée on either side, during a great way in length: and these places they sayde, to be some of them the graues of persecuted Saintes and Martires, where they hid them selues in the time of the cruell Emperours of <hi>Roome,</hi> and there they died.</p>
            <p>Procéeding on forwarde, we came to an olde thing like an Aultar, wheron, in olde and auncient painting, (which was then almost cleane worne out) was Christ vpon the Crosse, and our Lady and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> by him: there the Préest sayde, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> and many other Saintes, had sayde Masse to the Christians that hid them selues there. And besides this (quoth he) there chaunced not many yéeres since, a poore man of the Cittie to come into this Uaufe, and when he was come so farre as this Aultar, the light he caried in his hand, suddenlie went out, so that he was forced to syt downe, and stay héere.</p>

And there she questioned with him, &amp; he with her, about many holy and Religious matters: then she departing, lefte him there accompanied with Angelles, so that he remained there ten dayes, at the ende whereof, he came foorth, and went and tolde the Pope what he had séene, for which, when he died, he was canonized a Saint, and in this order arise many of our Romish Saints.</p>

            <p>Upon this, the resort of people thither,<note place="margin">Note the meruailous ignoraunce of these people.</note> was truelie incredible: Gentlemen would come thither, and there hang vp their veluet Cloakes, as an offering to our Lady: Gentlewomen, would come thither bare foote and bare legged, &amp; there hang vp their veluet Gownes, their silke Gownes, with other costlie apparell, and goe home againe in their Peticoates. As for the money, Iuelles, and other treasure daylie offered there, it was most meruailous to sée: for therewith they haue builded a verie fayre Church where this house stoode. When they sawe they were growen so ritch, they made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt of the olde Picture, wherwith all the aforesayd miracles were done: but they erected a costly Aultar, and theron made a sumptuous new Picture of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which the people doo daylie honour with meruailous resort. This is faithfully affirmed by one <hi>Iohn Young</hi> an Englishe man, who not long since came home from <hi>Roome,</hi> &amp; while he was there, he well noted the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of our English men, in landing &amp; extolling this place, and the miracles there wrought: so that they as certainlie beléeue in those miracles, as any Christian dooth in God.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Iohn Young,</hi> once questioned with one of the English Préestes, why God dyd not as well suffer such miracles to be done by his Son Iesus Christ, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our Lady: wherto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Préest aunswered. Because

            <p>So the Cardinall not minded to heare them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at that time, they departed home to the Colledge, greatly offended with them selues that they had spedde no better. And now, I must out of the Colledge, there was no other remedy: but yet thorowe entreaty of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> I had leaue for a fortnight to lye in a verye swéete Chamber, filled with old rusty Iron, and all the trash of the house was put into that Chamber, béeing a vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t place, &amp; seruing for no other purpose, because it was next to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon house of office, which ayred the Chamber with so swéete a perfume: that but for names sake of a Chamber, and feare of catching some disease, I had rather haue lyen in the stréete amongst the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.

            <p>So Doctor <hi>Morris,</hi> séeing I vsed my selfe, both care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of him,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Morris</hi> his prouision for my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and with little regarde to theyr Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in such an order as they coulde haue small aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of me: chambred me there, where I thinke the Deuill was still left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for euery night there was such a coyle among the old Iron, such ratling and throwing downe the Boordes, that with the swéete smell came
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13308:36"/>
out of the counting house to my Beddes heade: I lay almost feared out of my wits, and almost choked with that pleasaunt perfume, so that when I was layd in my Bed, I durst not stirre till it was fayre broad day, that I might perceiue euerye corner of my Chamber, whither the Deuill were there or no.</p>
            <p>Euery morning the Priests &amp; the Schollers woulde come to visite me, giuing me money to send for my din<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner and supper into the Towne: because Doctor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> myne olde fréende, watched them so néere, that I could not haue so muche as a draughte of Wine in the house.

            <p>Wherefore one night, two of the Priestes came to hallow my Chamber,<note place="margin">The preests come with holy water to hallowe my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> and broughte their holy water, and their holy Candles, and sprinckled about in euery corner: giuing me also a pot of holy water, to hang by my Beds side, that when I heard the sturre agayne, I should with the sprinckling Brush, throw it about the Chamber. And they gaue me a payre of Beads, wheron I should say sixe <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and sixe <hi>Aue Mariaes,</hi> then they would warraunt me, the noyse would be gon strayght way.</p>
            <p>Night came, and supping so well as I coulde, with two <hi>Quatrines</hi> woorth of Léekes, one <hi>Quatrine</hi> bestow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ricoct,</hi>

then the night before, the olde Iron was flung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chamber, the Boordes that leaned against the Wall fell downe, and such a terrible coyle there was, that I thoughte the house woulde haue fallen on my head.</p>

But this was the summe of his newes, that the Popes holinesse had sent for them in all the haste, and they must delay no time, but come to him with all spéede possible.</p>
            <p>Then we went with him to the Popes Pallace, where comming into the Popes Chamber, and hauing euerie one kissed his foote: we stayde to attende what was his pleasure. But before he spake any woorde, with a dissembling and hippocriticall countenaunce, he fell into teares, which trickled downe his white beard: and began in Latin with these, or the very like woords. O you English men, to whome my looue is such, as I can no way vtter, considering that for me you haue left your Prince, which was your duetie, and come so farre to me, which is more then I can deserue: yet as I am your refuge, when persecution dealeth straightly with you in your Countrey, by reason of the hereticall Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there vsed, so will I be your Bulwarke to defend you, your guide to protect you, your Father to nourish you, and your fréend with my hart blood to doo you any profite.</p>

These teares that he shed, these woordes that he spake, made diuers of them say within them selues, as one of them for example, presentlie to me sayde.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The words of one of the Schollers.</note>Oh singuler Saint, whose life, looue, and liberalitie, may be a spectacle to the whole world.

            <p>What is the cause that you will depart from me, that haue so well prouided for you: to thrust your selues on the rocke of your owne destruction?

            <p>Then he commaunded one of the chéefe Gentlemen of his Chamber, to goe with vs, and to certifie the Popes minde to Doctor <hi>Morris,</hi> and so giuing vs his

            <p>On the morrowe,<note place="margin">The Popes lyberallite.</note> the Pope sent fowre hundred Crownes, to newe reparation the house, to buie the Students all néedefull thinges that they wanted, and the house must no longer be called a Colledge, but a Seminarie.</p>
            <p>Then Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> because Doctor <hi>Morris</hi> should not loose all his dignitie, caused the house to be parted, and so made bothe a Seminarie for the Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, and an Hospitall for the entertainement of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe Pilgrimes when they came, whereof Doctor <hi>Morris</hi> continued <hi>Custos,</hi> by the Popes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Upon this, he was condempned to be burned: which sentence he sayde, he was right willing to suffer, and the rather, because the summe of his offence, pertayned to the glorie of God.</p>

            <p>THis is faithfullie auouched by the aforesayde <hi>Iohn Young,</hi> who was at that time, and a good while after in <hi>Roome,</hi> in seruice with Maister Doctor <hi>Moorton:</hi> who séeing the Martirdome of this man, when he came home to his house, in the presence of Maister <hi>Smithson,</hi> Maister <hi>Creed,</hi> and the sayd <hi>Iohn Young</hi> his seruaunt, spake as followeth. Surely, this fellow was meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous obstinate, he nothing regarded the good councell was vsed to him, nor neuer shrunke all the way, when the Torches were thrust at his naked body. Beside, at the place of Execution, he did not faint or crie one iote in the fire, albeit they tormented him verie cruelly, and burned him by degrées, as his legges first, to put him to the greater pain, yet all this he did but smile at. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, but that the woord of God can be but true, else we might iudge this fellowe to be of God: for who could haue suffered so much paine as he did? but truely I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue the deuill was in him.</p>
            <p>Beholde (good Reader) how they doubt among them selues, and because they will not speake against their Maister the Pope, they inferre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty power of God, vpon the deuill: but he no doubt one day will scatter the chaffe, &amp; gather his chosen Corne into his Garner. That we may be of this good Corne, let vs defie the Pope, his hellish abhominations, continue in our duetie to God, faithfull obedience to her Maiestie, and vnity among vs all as Brethren: and then no doubt but we shall enter the land of the liuing, to our eternall comfort and consolation.</p>
