         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE VVorthineſſe of a certaine boke, lately
ſet furth in the name of M. IeVVel, doth in
England perchaunſe, make it to be pretious
Vnto many, but Vnto Vs that are in theſe
partes of beyond the Seas, the Raritie only thereof,
gaue a Price and Value Vnto it. Inſo much that
receiuing one of them for my ſelfe, two monthes
(at the leaſt) after they had bene abrode in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
I could not keepe the whole altogeather to
my ſelfe, but was faine to diuide it in the middle.
And yet there was no loſſe therein, becauſe a frind
was gratified with that halfe whiche I mighte
ſpare, and the other remaining with me woulde
keepe me ſo long occupied, Vntill both of Vs might

               </gap>hainge partes one with the other, and I (if I
thoughte good) continue my reading forwarde
as I had begon without any Interruption or ſtay
at all, But I ſavv ſuch geare and ſuch ſtore therof,
in the one halfe only, that I had litle mind to goe
through the other. And now that diuiding of
the Fooke into tvvo partes vvhich the Rarietie
thereof occaſioned me to make not altogeather ſo
vvillingly, but that I could haue vvished it better,
that ſame novv fell out ſo happely and agreably to

my purpoſe, that although I might conſider and
ſee, vvhat stuffing vvere in the vvhole, yet, of free
choiſe and for good cauſes, I vvould meddle vvith
no more then the halfe. And truly, to chooſe

In the ſeeking of vvhich, least any man should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his vvit ſo much, that by long diſcourſing he
should make it the leſſer and vveaker, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
vvith himſelfe, vpon Secrete <hi>Conferences,
Policies, Concluſions and Orders</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Catholikes, for the anſvvering of their
Aduerſaries: I vvill therefore shortly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
tell them my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt in foure Articles only, vvhich occupy vvel
nere halfe the Reply, I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo much mater vvorth
the briefe noting, that it vvould fully ſerue to the
making of a iuſt boke. Concerning then the
qualitie of thoſe thinges, it vvas ſo corrupt and
infectuous, that it required ſome preſent and ſpedy
preſeruatiue against it. I prouided alſo that
the reader should not be vvearied through any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
proceſſe or diſcourſe. Furthermore, if M, Ievvel

D, Harding come vpon him againe, or if any other
of the right Iannizers in deede vvhich haue fled
from the Catholike faith, vvould make me an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver:
I thought good ſo to meaſure out my Booke
vnto them, that they should not put the faulte in
the greatneſſe therof, vvhen they do not in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time ſay their minde vnto me for it. Byſide
this, the chiefe poyntes vvhich I did minde to
ſpeake of are ſuch, that if I vvould haue peruſed
the vvhole Reply, yet I should haue brought but
more Examples only to the prouing of thoſe my
Obiections against M. Ievvel, vvhich already are
declared by inough and ſufficient. And to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
I ſay only <hi>BEWARE OF M. IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL,</hi>
that is, I shevv good cauſes to the Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Reader, vvherfore he should try him thriſe,
before he trust him once: Other are comming,
vvhich shall bring him to more ieobardy, &amp; strike
directly at that crafty head of his, as if they should
ſay, <hi>NOW M. IEWEL BEWARE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other cauſes therefore contrary to theſe, vvho
ſo euer shall name, he shall not expound my intent
and meaning, but open his ovvne euil minde and
ſuſpitions. And I trust, as theſe ſeemed probable
inough vnto me, vvherefore I might and shoulde
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather certaine thinges (vvhat I vvould my ſelfe)
out of M. Ievvels boke, and diſpoſe them as I haue


<pb facs="tcp:22621:4"/>
done, ſo may any Reaſonable man be content vvith
this, vvhich for his vvarning ſake I haue noted and
neuer think that M. Ievvel is not touched becauſe
euery Article of his is not by me diſcuſſed: Or
that, for all this vvhich yet is ſaid, he muſt not be
miſtruſted, becauſe euery line and ſentence of his
boke is not Anſvvered.</p>
            <p>For euery man, as he is vvel diſpoſed, ſo may
he doe: and vvhat ſo euer vvay, cloſe or Open, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
or Solitary, Short or Long, Direct for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard,
or about, Eaſy or Intricate, vvhat ſo euer
vvay be taken, if vve come to one end, and meete
togeather in the diſcouering of Craft or Hereſye,
the cauſe of the Catholikes is the ſtronger, the
hartes of the <hi>Proteſtantes</hi> may be the fainter.</p>
            <p>Some one (perchaunſe) hath a patient minde
to folovve M. Ievvel, Sentence by Sentence: An
other vvill not be bound to goe after him vppon
euery trifeling Occaſion, but leauing bymatters
and impertinent, gathereth out his Senſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth
it: Some againe chooſeth one Speciall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
out, and ſpedely Anſvvereth it, An other
is not content vvith ſo ſevv as one or tvvo, and
therefore is longer a doing. There is that thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it inough to Iustifye the vntruthes that D.
Harding is charged vvithall. That ſeemeth not


<pb facs="tcp:22621:4"/>
inough to an other, but he noteth M. Ievvel for his
plaine lies, and them out of meaſure. VVhat shall
I ſay more of other? My ſelfe haue folovved an
order much different from any the forſaid, and no
doubt, but an other may come after all that is hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
reckened, and finde more matter againſte
M. Ievvel vvith a peculiar diſpoſition thereof.</p>
            <p>Let the vvay therefore, vvhich any man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
be neuer condemned, but the end to vvhich
he bringeth proceſſes, let that be conſidered.</p>
            <p>M. Ievvel (I ſpeake it vvithout flattery) hath
a Rare gift in vvryting, he muſt not be proude of
it. He ventereth ſo boldlye, he fighteth ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly,
and is armed ſo ſinglely, that if tvventye
Catholikes should at one time encountre vvith
him, no one shoulde neede to ſtrike in the
ſame place that an other dothe, nor faile ſo to
ſtrike him that his credite and cauſe shoulde be
vvounded. Yet, to them that ſtand a farre of
from the ſight of the mater, he is harneſſed ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he handeleth his vveapon ſo cunninglye, he
chaungeth from one hand to an other ſo readely,
yea shrinketh and geaueth backe ſo Artificiallye,
that he may vvell ſeeme to haue done a greate
Acte, and to make it doubtfull at the least, vvho
hath the victorie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And ſo concerning theſe tvvo poyntes, becauſe
of the first, I may lavvfully take my vantage: And
though in moſt places I leaue him vntouched, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet, (except he be vnſenſible) I doe inough to
make him feele it. Then becauſe of the ſecond, I
geue thee (Indifferent Reader) lavvfull vvarning,
that of all men that euer hitherto haue vvryten,
he is the moſt Bragging, Deceitfull and Impudent.</p>
            <p>Hovv true this is, it shall appeere by my profes:
And the profes hovv ready they are, it is euident in
this preſent Treatiſe, and shall further appeere by
an other vvhich is furth cumming. Concerning
this vvhich is Printed:</p>
            <p>In the firſt boke therof, I haue brought into a
short Table or Sum, (as it vvere) the State of the
Queſtion conteined in euery of the foure first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles:
The Art of M. Ievvel, in ſauing himſelf from
Subſcription in euery one: And the Iſſue of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſy,
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhich a more direct Anſvver is to be
required, and more Iuſt reply to be inferred. And in
peruſing of this part, it vvill be quickly ſeene, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ſlaunder M. Ievvel, in charging him vvith
Shifting, Falſifing, Corrupting, and Deſperate
handeling of ſuch matters as come againſt him,
Or no.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond boke, I come to more particular

Doctours and vvryters Authorities, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his falſeheade and Hereſy, &amp;c. shalbe ſo
plainly exemplified, that (I truſt) it vvill be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a true and profitable Concluſion: BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVARE
OF M. IEVVEL.</p>
            <p>But novv, after all theſe paines taken, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
gladly, ſometimes patientlye, but alvvayes
faithfully and that to this end, that Truthe might


<pb facs="tcp:22621:6"/>
be knovven, And falsehead detected, And that the
nevve Doctrine of the late Goſpell might, either
beſt of all be forſaken, or els be better examined:
Are there none or very fevve, that vvill take the
paines to reade our Bookes? Or if there be,
that vvould gladly reade them, or vvith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencye
iudge of them, is it not lavvfull to
bring ſome in for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? VVhat haue the Catholikes
done of late, ſo vnnaturally, or vnreaſonablye,
that from hencefurth they muſt vvryte no more
againſt the Chalenger? Or feare, that if they
doe vvryte, the Vates shall be ſearched vvhich
bring in the Bookes, and the Bookes not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that bring in the Argumentes? Is it for our
perſon ſake or our cauſe ſake that vve are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded?
Is the place from vvhence vve vvryte, or
the matter vvhyche vve vvryte, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned of you.</p>
            <p>It is obiected vnto vs, that we are yonge
Dyuines. The Obiection vvere good if vve fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved
the deuiſes of our ovvne heades, and not the
lerned Commentaries of moſt Auncient Fathers.
But novv the perſon is young, the Concluſion is old.
And againe, the youngeſt dyuine emong vs that
haue vvryten, might fiue yeres ſenſe, haue proceded
(vvithout Grace aſking) and haue gone for a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
(if it had ſo liked him) in any of this Ages
hereſies for any exception that vvoulde haue bene


<pb facs="tcp:22621:6"/>
made, againſt his Age or lerning. Not only as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
are made in the Country abrode, vvhere he
that can Read beſt, Or ſay vvithout Eoke moſt Or
Rovvle in Termes moſt faſt, Or Rayle (in deede)
moſt loud, is Created a Doctour for his labour: but
as Doctors allſo are made at theſe daies in Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
by Diſputing, Anſvvering and Grace taking.</p>
            <p>But vve <hi>are not the wiſeſt of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</hi>
VVe may borovv then of our ovvn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and neuer be in your daunger for lending vs
any. And yet that alone vvhich vve haue, is not ſo
ſimple but vve are able vvel to perceiue, vvher the

            <p>But we are the diſconted of Louane.
If Louane it ſelfe be contented vvith vs, the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of ſuch an Vniuerſitie, should be no reproche
vnto vs. As again, vvho ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blame any Catholike in
all the vvorld, for miſliking the ꝓcedings of hereſy?</p>
            <p>It vvil be ſaid we are fugitiues. VVe are
not of that kinde, of the vvhich it is vvrytten,
Fugit nemine perſequente,<note place="margin">Prou. 28</note> he fleeth
when no man purſueth him. Again, vve
are not fled ſo far yet, as Geneua is. Nor fled in hart
or behauiour from the Catholike Faith of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,
Or from one hereſy vnto an other.</p>
            <p>And further it vvil be obiected, <hi>we liue in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
In dede vve liue not vnder an hedor vvarde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,


<pb facs="tcp:22621:7"/>
depriued of our Collegies, vvithout any our fault
againſt the Statutes: neither are there here ſuch
Offices, Charges, Romes, or Places Vacant, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of vvhich the perſons vvhich in England ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the like very vvorshipfully and vertuouſlye,
might declare hovv they be able to rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues,
and alſo to kepe other in Order: yet vve liue vnder
the Rule of the holy Commaundementes of God,
and the approued Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Catholike Church,
And the lavvdable Customes or policies of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where vve remaine.</p>
            <p>And further yet, vve shall be ſaide to wryte
for corrupte and priuate gaine.</p>
            <p>But vve are not (vve trust) ſo il frynded that
vve neede it, or ſo il diſpoſed that vve minde it.
Againe, they vvhich haue forſaken great and ſure
liuinges in England, of one, tvvo, or three hundred
pound yerely, they thought not (I beleue) to ſet vp
a shoppe beyond ſea, and by making of nevv bokes,
and ſelling them for x. pence, or xij. pence a peece to
reare vp both <hi>Priuate</hi> and <hi>Corrupt gaine</hi> vnto
themſelues.</p>
            <p>To be short, we ſhalbe accompted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
vvhether for ſauing our head, vvhen
a blovv is comming at it? Or, for leauing our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
vtterly? Or chainging of the leſſe for


<pb facs="tcp:22621:7"/>
the Greater? Or for Louing and Fearing of God
more then Man? Some are ſo kind to their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that rather then abide the lack of it, they care
not hovv farre they goe from God. And there haue
ben in times paſt ſome ſo faithfull to their Princes,
that (vvhether in Sport or Erneſt) they haue ſaid
it, <hi>he is not worthy of the fauoure of his
Prince, that would ſticke to go to Hell for
his Prince.</hi> But he beleued, perchaunſe there
vvas no Hell at all. And ſo night venter boldlye,
vvhere (by his iudgment) there vvas no daunger.
Othervviſe if he had ſo much light of Eaithe, as to
confeſſe an Hel, and yet ſo great blindneſſe of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as to loue any Creature ſo much, that he
vvould caſt avvay his ovvne ſoule for euer the ꝓppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vvas vnnaturall, and his ſaying is Intolerable.</p>
            <p>As for vs, God be mercifull, and geaue vs the
Grace to loue him beſt, nay to loue him vvithout
compariſon. And after him to loue them beſt,
vvhich come nigheſt vnto him, either by Image
of Vertue, or Similitude of Povver and Office, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one yet in his degree and place.</p>
            <p>But all theſe Obiections (I ſuppoſe) are Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and may be made either of Idle heades for
their fantaſy, or by Aduerſaries, for ſome Anger,
Or of Gentlemen merchantes for their pleaſure, or
of men right vvorshipfull, vpon ſad reporte made


<pb facs="tcp:22621:8"/>
vnto them. But yet, vvhat is any of theſe vnto the
queſtion: <hi>whether in the ſix hundred yeares
after Chriſt, there wer any Sole Receauing
or Receiuing vnder both kinds:</hi> And ſo furth
in any other of the Challengers Articles? nothing
at all vndoubtedly. For be they true, be they falſe,
(becauſe vve vvil not ſpend much time about it,)
they concerne priuate mennes Conditions, and not
the Catholike Religion. And they are (as it vvere)
a ſpotted Cote vpon a Reaſonable mannes backe,
but they proue not, that he hath no Reaſon at all
vvhich vveareth the Cote. VVherfore it becometh
not vs, ſo baſely to thinke of their iudgements that
conſider of our Bokes, that becauſe of the Authors
ſmall fauor, the boke it ſelfe should be out of fauor,
or becauſe the perſon is Condemned, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
the Boke is anſvvered.</p>
            <p>Some cauſe therfore vndoubtedly there is, in the
Bokes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for vvhich they are miſliked? But
vvhat is that? Is it for the <hi>Vntruthes</hi> ſake vvhich
are conteined in them? Is it for the <hi>Wreaſting
and Racking of the Scriptures?</hi> Is it for <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleging,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iewel in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader.</note>
               <hi>miſconſtrueing, corrupting, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the holy Fathers &amp;c.</hi> Theſe thinges in
deede are directly obiected, to D. Harding, by M.
Ievvel but (I trovv) the Serche is not therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
that no Anſvver should come in againſt


<pb facs="tcp:22621:8"/>
them. Yet except this only be the cauſe, vvherfore
els is the bringing in of them ſo daungerous?</p>
            <p>Is there any thing in them, againſt the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Fidelitie due to a Soueraigne? Is there
any one blaſt in them againſt the Gouernment of
vvomen? Do they moue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons to take vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
againſt the Nobilitie? Or doe they inſtruct the
Nobilitie hovv to let the Commons of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
In one vvord to ſpeake it, doe vve meddle vvith
the proper maters of VVeaſtminſter Ilaule, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leament
houſe or Cyuile Policie, and not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of Articles proponed in Scholes, meete for
Conuocations, and Generall to all Christendome?
Take (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) any one, vvhat ſo euer you vvil,
of the Articles proponed by M. Ievvel. He denyeth:
vve affirme. He contrarieth vs: vve againe reſiſt
him. Before any man encountred vvith hym, he
Raigned in peace and vvas Magnified. It vvas
thought, no man vvas euer hable to matche him,
and therefore for very deſpair of any ſuccour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſubmitted them ſelues vnto him. But novve,
ſenſe there haue ben found, vvhich haue met vvith
him, it is perceaued that he had no certaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorye.
And if it ſeemed ſo before, yet novve the
battle beginning a freshe, there is sturred vp a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
attention in euery mannes minde, to marke
hovv truely it is fought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:9"/>
And in marking diligently, he is novve and then
found to be iustly noted of Hypocriſy, Foly, Hereſy,
and other faultes, Novv they vvhich read not the
Bokes can not marke ſo muche: Yet they alſo, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that haue reader and conſidered, may lerne.
It cummeth then at length to the knovvledge of
many. And, the very nature of Truthe or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men ſo geuing it, many are confirmed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are vvarned, many are troubled, euery one is
moued. Some ſee it manifeſtly, <hi>M. Iewel is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,</hi>
other looke not ſo narovvly but ſay, <hi>I will
better thinke of theſe matters,</hi> Other be lothe
to chainge their opinion and are grieued to heare
of ought ſayed againſt him: So that ſomevvhat is
vvrought, I think in euery man one vvay or other
about theſe matters.</p>
            <p>This by likelihode then, is the Sedition, vvhich
our Bokes are ſaid to moue: They confirme ſome in
the Truthe, that they be not lightly remoued from
it: They direct other vnto the Truthe, that they
pretend not lacke of Inſtruction: they confounde
and confute other by the Truthe, that they may
take leſſe pride in their Chiualry: and they ſturre
vp a General attention, to marke on vvhoſe ſide
the Truthe shall ſtand, and vvho shall moſt Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
behaue himſelfe in the mater.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:9"/>
Are the Authors then of this maner of Sedition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to be punished? Or the bokes, by vvhich Lies, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes,
and Hereſies be detected, are they to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned?
If Proteſtantes may be ſuffered, to vvryte
as largely as they vvill, shall they be permitted allſo
to vvryte as falſely as they vvill? Or if no Priuilege,
be it neuer ſo Speciall, doth licenſe them to print any
Slaunders or Lies yet if aftervvardes they be found
out, and marked in theyr Bokes, may no man freely
tell them of it, but he shall incurre the daunger of
the Lavv, and further diſpleaſure? Surely this caſe
is very hard, to call firſt, into Queſtion, thoſe Truthes
of vvhiche the Catholike Church vvoulde haue no
doubt feared: And then, to graunt the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſuch
fauour, that he might allvvaies denye and ſtill driue
the Catholike to proue, And further (as longe as the
Catholike made a ſtay of yelding ſo much to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary)
to dravv that to an Argument of a vveake
cauſe and a faint hart, and to incline to the nevve
Goſpellers ſide: And novv laſt of all, (vvhen the
Catholikes anſvver them, and ſo anſvver, that they
make the other, euery day more and more to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their craft and hereſy) novv, (I ſay) to forbid
the Catholikes to Anſvver for themſelues, Or to
ſpeake any more againſt ſuch faultes as they finde,
this ſurely is a caſe very ſtrainge and hard: So hard
vndoubtedly, that vvhat to anſvver vnto it vve can


<pb facs="tcp:22621:10"/>
not tell.</p>
            <p>For if our Aduerſaries vvill haue the matter tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Lerning, our Diuinitie (the end shall declare
it) is much truer than theirs: but if they vvill novve
defend themſelues by force of Authoritye, One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Argument made by a nevve and freshe
Sercher, shall more diſſvvade, then a vvhole shiplode
of our Bokes can moue, vvhen the reading of them it
taken avvay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But is it not poſsible, to finde fauoure in his ſight,
vvhich hath the Ordering of theſe matters commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him? Yeas verely poſsible inoughe, if the
Suer for it be</hi> notus Pontifici, <hi>and fauored of the
Superintendents? Louanians then muſt holde their
peace, but the Apology of England (I trovv) may be
heard. VVhy: vvhat ſayeth it? Mary,</hi> for men to
be careleſſe what is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by them and their
owne mater &amp;c. is the part doubtleſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and Rechleſſe perſons,<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of England.</note> and of them
which wickedly winke at the Iniuries done
vnto the name of God. Againe. Al Lawes
and Natures owne voyce, doe commaund vs
to defend our owne Cauſe and Innocencye.
Againe. The Auncient Chriſtians. &amp;c. put
vp Supplications, and made meanes to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
and Princes, that they might defend
themſelues and their felowes in open Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:10"/>
Loe, hovv vvell the makers of that Apology could
ſpeake for themſelues, and hovv vvell it ſerueth our
purpoſe at this preſent? Yet the Oddes is exceding
great. For the Catholikes hauing continued time
out of minde, in a conſent and certaintye of theyr
Faith, might vvell take order, that no man at all
should be ſuffered to ſpeake againſte thoſe thinges
vvhich vvere ſo generally receiued and alovved: but
theſe men vvhich bring a nevv and vpſtart Religion
into the vvorld, neither commending it by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any their Predeceſſours, nor concluding it by
Reaſon, nor Confirming it by Miracle, hovv shoulde
they forbid a man to conſider and vevv their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and require him firſt to build vpon them, before
he ſee the ſure ground of them?</p>
            <p>If therefore vnto them it be an vnlavvfull and
vnnaturall matter, that it should be denied to any
man to defend his ovvne cauſe, it ſeemeth that vve
may vvel be ſuffered to make our Anſvvers vnto our
Aduerſaries: And it ſeemeth allſo, that thoſe maye
Read our Anſvvers, vvhoſe loſſe and perill it vvil be,
to be kept, by any meanes, avvay from the hearing
of the cauſe examined.</p>
            <p>But perchaunſe they vvil not be knovven vvhich
made the Apologye: and cumming out vvithout a
Priuilege, vvho can tell vvhether it be of anye Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?
Eſpecially D.Harding hauing anſvvered

            <p>VVhat ſay vve then to M. Ievvel himſelfe? might

that they shoulde neuer be examined or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvered.</p>
            <p>To you therefore M. Ievvel I ſpeake it, as in this

VVhy ſuffer ye not the Trueth to haue her ful courſe?

            <p>But (to returne againe vnto the Indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
let our ſayinges, if they come properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

his old Charitye, and vvishe novve, that vve might
be conſtrained to holde our handes and tongues,
vvhich vvished before, that vve should be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to vvryte and Speake: Let all theſe Iniuries be

And be glad to haue thinges for thee in a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe,
if the vvinde should happely turne, to ſende
them in to thee? Novv if this be an vnnaturall or
Seditious minde, haue me excuſed I pray thee, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
thought it ſo, nor feared, it vvould ſo be taken.
And I can not promiſe ſuch Obedience, or vvarrant

againſt God and his Church should openlye
blaſpheme and deceaue, I vvould not ſpeake againſt

Yet, if, as many other myſteries, vnheard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be reueled in theſe daies, ſo it should likevviſe
novv be brought vnto light, that allthough a Theefe
vvere eſpied to doe his feate in any houſe, no man for

vvhen that is perceaued and confeſſed that in no

Ievvel, then shal vve pray God, as he hath vvrought
by our ſpeaking, ſo that he vvill continue and vvork
by our ſilence. And as the ſilence of the Catholikes
vvhen they vvere excedingly prouoked to ſpeake, did
more harme perchaunſe then al the other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

Gods Grace, more ſenſibly make others to conſider
vvhat Faith they haue forſaken, and vvhat opinions
they folovv, then if our Bokes should freely come in
and be Readen. Amen. Fare vvel, Reader, and be

            <head>THE FIRST ARTICLE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>queſtion of the fyrſte
article, is:</hi> Whether anye
priuate Maſſe were in the
whole world, for the ſpace
of ſixe hundred yeres after
Chriſte.</p>
            <p>What call we <hi>priuate Maſſe? A priuate
Maſſe?</hi> (ſay the Catholikes) is that, which is
not ſolemne. And other byſide this, of that
name, they haue none.</p>
            <p>But what meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heretikes by it? Mary,
<hi>whereas the prieſt receiueth the Sacramente
him ſelf alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ie. pa. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that we call</hi> (ſayth M. Iewel)
<hi>priuate Maſſe, yea allthoughe the whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
be preſent.</hi> Ergo, this terme ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
is not in the proper bokes &amp; ſcholes
of Catholikes, but is alltogether of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
of Proteſtantes.</p>
            <p>To what ende is the mouinge of this
queſtion aboute priuate Maſſe? Or what
hath any Diuine to doe with it? <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is,</hi> that if it can be proued, <hi>M. Iewell
is content to yeld and ſubſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if it can not be proued? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoothe
then is M. Iewel, I trowe, a true
man of his worde. Is this all? And hath
this great fighting, and writinge on bothe


<pb facs="tcp:22621:14"/>
ſydes no further end, but to the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or diſpraiſe of one man, and hym not ſo
wonderfull? No truly, it is not for the ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or ſtudiouſe ſo to doe, ſuche ſpecially as
haue, or take charge of religion, but rather
to direct all theyr oppoſitions and anſwers
vnto that end, by whiche ſomewhat may be
concluded, either duly, to the honor of God,
or profitably, to the defenſe of the Church.</p>
            <p>Haue both ſydes then, done ſo for theyr
part? That now is to be conſidered. Firſt
concerninge the <hi>Catholike,</hi> he goeth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſome purpoſe, and bringeth the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto that ſtate, in whiche the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
is ſo anſwered, that the Churche alſo
is defended. The <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge
ſeemed alſo to meane playnlye,
but nowe, he hath brought the queſtion
vnto ſuche pointes, as by whiche neither
his aduerſarie is any thinge hurted, nor
the Churche, whiche he impugnethe, any
thinge touched.</p>
            <p>By whiche it appeareth, the one to haue
labored to ſome end, the other to haue cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>As in example: <hi>D Harding</hi> conceyueth
the matter thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:22621:14"/>
If priuate Maſſe, in reſpect only of
that it is priuate,<note place="margin">Maior.</note> after your meaning,
be reproueable:<note place="margin">Hard. 39</note> it is for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
that is to ſay, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prieſt
receiueth the Sacrament alone,</p>
            <p>But the ſingle Communion is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">Minor.</note>
yea good and godly:</p>
            <p>Ergo the priuate Maſſe,<note place="margin">Conclu.</note> in this
reſpecte, that it is priuate, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable.</p>
            <p>It followeth then, that Chriſtes inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
is not broken,<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoneth to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> when the Prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
alone: And conſequently, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Churche is not to be condemned,
for allowing that manner of receiuyng.</p>
            <p>Thus hath <hi>D. Harding,</hi> and euery other
Catholike, learned to referre his reaſoning
to ſome purpoſe, that others may be edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by it.</p>
            <p>But nowe on the other ſide, what ſay
you, <hi>M. Iewel,</hi> to the matter? what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte

whether any ſuche were, ſix hundred yeres

and therfore you muſte expounde
your meaning vnto vs.</p>
            <p>1. I demaund (<hi>ſay you</hi>) of the open Church<note place="margin">Ie. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2. I demaund of Prieſtes. 3. I demaunde

of the holy ſupper that ought to ſtand. 5. I

            <p>Fiue greate demaundes, and ſomewhat
<hi>terrible vnto the vnſkilful, as a viſarde vnto a

But marke,<note place="margin">M. Iew els greate a doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng.</note> good Reader, how litle he ſhal

haue <hi>SAIDE MASSE ORDINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RILY,
in OPEN CHVRCH,</hi> and to
haue receiued alone. What inferre you
herevpon? Or how doth this further your
procedings, or diſproue the preſent doings
of the Catholike Church? This ſure is an
idle queſtion, which maketh ſo much a doe
about that, which the contrary ſyde maye
graunt without any preiudice to the cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For concerning the firſt: Chriſtes inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be fulfilled in priuate houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:22621:15"/>
The ſecond: women, boyes, and lay me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
are chriſten ſoules, aud proue, that Chriſtes
iuſtitution is not broken, if they be allowed
to receiue alone.</p>
            <p>As for the third: I anſwer, that your que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
was not of Maſſe, but of <hi>priuate Maſſe.</hi>
And if you wil make the queſtion of Maſſe,
tell vs of it, and you ſhallbe prouided for.</p>
            <p>To the fifth: that which may be but ouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
done well, nedeth not many repetitions of
the ſame, to proue that it is lawfull.</p>
            <p>Only now therfore, the fourth demaund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
doth remaine to be diſcuſſed, which is of the
right vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſupper. To which our
auſwer is, that he vſeth it rightlye, which
receiueth it with faithe, hope, and charitye.
But as for receiuing alone, or with compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,
the Catholike Church acknowledgeth
her ſelfe to be therin at liberty, to vſe either
the one, or the other manner. Vpon this
queſtion (whiche in deede is the proper of
your firſte article) if you dare openlye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with vs, then are you come to the
ſame ſtate of controuerſy, to whiche all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
haue brought it. Neither can you
complain that <hi>he ſwarueth from that he hath

ſole receiuing, but ſtande vpon your

circumſtancies and demanndes nothinge
ſubſtantiall, then doe I anſwer, as I did
before, that I can not proue priuate Maſſe
after ſuche ſolemne maner as you require:
that (I meane) it was <hi>ORDINARY,</hi>
and in <hi>OPEN CHVRCHES:</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my ſelfe with this, that although by
euident example, I find not, it was ſo, yet
by moste necessary principles I can proue
that it might haue bene ſo. And further
reioyſing in this, that although I do yelde
in your demaundes vnto you (the fourthe
only excepted, which only is worth the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and in which you be ſufficientlye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered)
yet <hi>you may not loke, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Iſraell with their Lutes and Timbrels
will receiue you in triumphe,</hi> becauſe with
all your strokes hitherto, you haue hurted

            <p>Your queſtions therfore, M. Iewel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The ſtate of the queſtion, as Catholikes


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22621:16"/>
haue conceiued it, is comprehended in this
one foreſaid argument:</p>
            <p>If priuate Maſſe,<note place="margin">Maior.</note> in reſpect only of
that it is priuate, be reprouable, it is
for the ſingle Communion,</p>
            <p>But ſingle Communion is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueable:<note place="margin">Minor.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Ergo priuate Maſſe, in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte

            <p>This argument is good,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:</note> and holdeth of
that common rule: <hi>A deſtructione conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentis,
ad deſtructionem antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis.</hi> That
is, to make it plaine, when we make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall
or double propoſicion, the deniall
of the former parte, dothe well folowe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the deniall of the later. As in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If M. Iewel be a lawfull Bishop,</hi>
(this is the former parte) <hi>he was duelye
conſecrated,</hi> (this is the later part. And
bothe theſe ioyned together do make one
<hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:17"/>
Take away now the later part, and ye ſhall
conclude the taking away of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former, as:</p>
            <p>But M. Iewel was not duely conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated:</p>
            <p>Ergo he is not a lawfull biſhop.</p>
            <p>The argument therfore, whiche <hi>D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
hath proponed, is of a verye good and
right making. But what thinketh <hi>M. Iewel</hi>
of it? He frameth it after his owne likinge,<note place="margin">Here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>el to work his ſeate in alteri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thinges to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note>
and that, which the author himſelfe would
haue to be <hi>Hypothetical,</hi> he maketh it allto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<hi>Cathegorical,</hi> in this ſorte:</p>
            <p>The priuate Maſſe is ſingle communion.
Single communion is lawfull: Ergo priuate
Maſſe is lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then dothe he not anſwer neither this
argument, but by another which ſhallbe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
&amp; of his owne making, he would haue
this to be iudged. As,</hi> The miniſtration of
priuate Maſſe is a ſingle communion, Single
communion is lawfull for a woman: Ergo,
the miniſtration of priuate Maſſe is lawfull
for a woman.</p>
            <p>No no M. Iewel, you can not goe inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
We ſe well inough how you caſt in the

receauinge, but of receuinge in both kinds,
of the ſeruice in the latiue tonge, of the reall
preſence of Chriſte in the Sacrament, of the

Becauſe all theſe are included within the

            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:22621:18"/>
But we could not ſuſpecte that ye

that ye loke for a ſeuerall anſwer vnto
eche of them, and that, within the queſtion
of <hi>priuate Maſſe,</hi> ye intended not to paſſe the
boundes and ſenſe of this worde <hi>Priuate,</hi>
For of Conſecration (we may be ſure I
truſt) you moued no queſtion, whether it be
proper to the Prieſt, or whether the people
may alſo doe it. Yet the Maſſe doth extend
it ſelfe vnto conſecration. If therefore,
neither we are ſo ſuſpitious as to feare it,
neither you ſo foliſh as to ſay it, that in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Here, becauſe <hi>M. Iewel</hi> is contente to be
tried, by the examples of the ſixe hundred

of perſwaſion is moſt ſenſible, I wil bring
two or three of them, for our purpoſe.</p>

            <p>What anſwereth M. Iewel vnto this?
Or howe concludeth he (as it were) in D.

            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> (forſooth ſaieth he) <hi>there was Maſſe,</hi>

ſauing for M. Iewels pleaſure, that neaded
not, becauſe D. Harding ſpeaketh directly
not, of ſaying Maſſe, but only of receauing
the ſingle Communion.</p>
            <p>Another example:<note place="margin">Har. fo. 34.</note> Serapion lyeng

            <p>I pray you M. Iewel, is not this ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine

            </p>
            <p>Thus doth M. Iewel handle <hi>D. Harding</hi>
through the whole firſt article, either like
an hypocrite diſſembling it, that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
by <hi>priuate Maſſe</hi> or ſingle Communion,
not the ſaying and celebratinge of Maſſe,

ſoeuer it be, which receaueth the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
alone: either like a dull or diſtracted
perſon not perceauing it, that all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
Examples, and Authorities are, to
that only end, referred. But he hath not
ſo litle wit, as not to perceaue whereabout
<hi>D. Harding</hi> went. For, in the anſwer to the

what ſenſe he taketh the queſtion of priuate
Maſſe:<note place="margin">Iewel 56</note> he confeſſeth that D. Harding <hi>hath
taken paines to proue Sole receauinge, and
ſingle Communion that was neuer denyed.</hi>
And againe. Now he demaundeth whether
I reproue the Maſſe, or the priuate Maſſe.
What meaneth this, that priuate Maſſe and

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:22621:21"/>
See then, he confeſſeth that D. Hardinge
doth vnderſtand by Priuate Maſſe, ſole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing.
And therfore he miſliketh it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge,
<hi>what Meaneth this &amp;c.</hi> And then he
laboreth to proue that it muſt not be his

ſhe weth not any Priuate Maſſe, that is (by

maſſe, ORDINARILI, in OPEN CHVRCH
and receaued alone:</hi> D. Harding proueth
Priuate Maſſe, that is to ſay, ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
or Sole receauing.</p>
            <p>Of M. Iewels mening, no purpoſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is graunted, for example that
we are not able to proue againſt him (with


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22621:23"/>
all thoſe Circumſtances) what is his cauſe
the better for it? Of D. Hardinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
this commoditie groweth, that ſole
receauing is allowable by the crample and
Teſtimonies of the Primatiue Church.</p>
            <p>Ergo it ſtandeth well with Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
Frome hencefoorth therefore,
let no Heretike crake of Chriſts inſtitution,
as though that could not admit Sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing.
So ſhall the Church haue ſome
peace, and the Catholikes be quieted in this
ſure truth, that Sole Receauing is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chriſtes inſtitution.</p>
            <p>This ground now and verity ſtanding,
let M. Iewel (if he dare) come viſiblie
furth, and ſhew an open face and intent,
without all dubling. And then ſhall it be
playnly perceaued, whether he muſt yelde
and ſubſcribe or no. Here for example are
ſix queſtions.</p>
            <p>Whether a ſicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing no penance to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
fulfill, may receaue alone at his departing.</p>
            <p>Whether a ſicke man whiche is not yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
reconciled, but tarieth in his penance, may
receaue alone at the point of his death.</p>
            <p>Whether a ſicke man being not in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of death may receaue alone.</p>
            <p>Whether a man in good health and good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>


               <pb facs="tcp:22621:24"/>
lyfe may receaue alone.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Whether a Prieſt not celebrating, may
receaue alone.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Whether a Prieſt at Maſſe, may receaue
alone.</p>
            <p>Betwixt theſe ſixe, eche of them towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
an other, there is ſome difference, and
therefore they make two ſeueral queſtions.</p>
            <p>The truth which is confeſsed on
both ſides, is:</p>
            <p>That Chriſtes inſtitution doth ſtand with
Sole Receauing in generall.</p>
            <p>For he which is put from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and lyeth at the pointe of death
maye receaue alone, euen by Maſter Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
confeſſion: which yet is impoſſible
to be true, if Sole Receauing were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
againſte Chriſtes Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in what other ſpeciall kinde
of Sole Receauing his Inſtitution is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
therein muſte, of right, be the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therein let M. Iewel ioyne,
(if he thinke hym ſelfe able) with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>
            <p>As, whether a ſicke man beinge not put
from the Communion for ſome faulte of


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22621:24"/>
his, maye at the pointe of death receaue
alone or no, and ſo furth, in any of the ſix
foreſayed queſtions.</p>
            <p>Now when it ſhall be put furth in
one ſpeciall caſe, if he ſhall then fetche his
vagaries about, and run ouer his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

wais, <hi>Out of holy Fathers, Out of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges

and Out of the very Maſſe boke it ſelfe. &amp;c</hi>
Let it be vnderſtanded, that if he ſpeake

            <p>Therfore if you (M. Iew.) can ſhew by

            <p>Neither doth Doctor Hardinge reaſon

            <p>There is no old boke to be found of

            <p>This is but a tricke of your Logike M.
Iewel, to alter the ſenſe of your aduerſary,
and forme his arguments after your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
But this rather is his reaſon. If
the Seruice had bene in Engliſhe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the multitude of bookes and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
ſome memory would be left of it: But
none is found, <hi>Ergo</hi> by good conſequence
there was neuer any ſuch Seruice. And
you, to ſhift your handes of this argument,
doe make as though his only Demaunde


<pb facs="tcp:22621:52"/>

his concluſion ſhould be, if ye ſhewed not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

            <p>But that you may not eſcape ſo, I will

When you were borne, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that, the Seruice in England was in

cauſe and meaning? For, Common Praiers

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly the publike Seruice of the

alſo thoſe ſelf ſame praiers, which are made

it is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for publike Seruice. As, when the
Apoſtles, in the cumpany of a hundred and
twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty perſons together,<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> praied, that God
would ſhew, whether of the two, Ioſeph or

of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtery &amp; Apoſtleſhip, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
the Traitour had falſely departed: was

proue (I beleue) that it was a parte of their
Ordinary &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Seruice.</p>
            <p>Byſide this alſo, when the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s met
together in the Primitiue Church, among
other gifts, which were ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the holyghoſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gift of Prayer was one.
That is, ſome one of the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany (and he not

vttered in the audience of the reſt, that
forme or matter of Praier, which the other
ſhould lerne and folow, being yet to ſeking
how to doe by them ſelues. And this was
in true ſpeach a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer, yet was it
not their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Seruice. For in publike
Seruice, the Eccleſiaſtical miniſters doe
goe before &amp; pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it, but this was ſuch


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22621:57"/>
as lay men ſometymes did vtter. Alſo in Pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blike
Seruice the order is appointed and

Prayer was not knowen, before it was
geauen: and they were not euery day ſure
of the geuing, the Holyghoſt alwaies diſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing
it by more or leſſe, according to his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
inſpiration.</p>
            <p>Seing therefore, that theſe kindes of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

becauſe of the order &amp; continuance of them,
according to the Catholike Churchs law &amp;
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution: why doth M. Iewel finde fault
with diſtinctions, or that which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

will he haue it to be like in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde kinde?
And becauſe the people vnderſtode w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
praied Priuately, or ſome other, what they
vttered by the Holyghoſts gift, ſpiritually,
how can he conclude therefore, that the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<pb facs="tcp:22621:58"/>
Aduerſary and his Reader in the third?</p>
            <p>For whiles he woulde haue it beleued,
that Common Praier is no other thing to
ſay, then Common Seruice of the Church:
what ſo euer either Scriptures and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Fathers doe proue,<note place="margin">Craft in double vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a word.</note> concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Praier, that it was in the Primitiue

he draweth to Common Seruice of the
Churche. And againſte all forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and diſtinction, and reaſon, he will
triumphe therevpon, and crake, that it
was euery where in a Tongue knowen to

            <p>For whiche cauſe this diſtinction is the
better to be marked, leaſt M. Iew. through

            <p>Now therefore concerning the other

            <p>

               </note> and a manifeſt contradiction.</p>
            <p>Whye ſo? may not both there propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions

            <p>When your felfe doe preache, M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
ſome, I beleue, vnderſtande you not,
and ſome vnderſtand you: (for many ſtand
a far of &amp; ſome nerer vnto you) &amp; ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
not all fyne Engliſh, yet ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it well inough.</p>
            <p>I will ſay, further. Your ſelf I thinke,
ſometymes vnderſtand your ſelf, and ſome
tymes ye doe not. Yet here is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of contradiction. For they nede not to
be contrarye ſayinges one to the other, in
whiche ſometymes ye knowe where ye
be, ſome tymes ye ſpeake, you can not tell
what.</p>
            <p>As, in the Declaming againſt the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge

Yet, this is no Contradiction, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhoulde that be the faulte, whiche I
woulde therevppon, obiecte vnto you:


<pb facs="tcp:22621:59"/>
but this rather that ye goe about to deſtroy
the Religion it ſelf, becauſe of the euill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

            <p>How proue you then, a Contradiction
to be implied herein, and a Contradiction
of M. Hardings, where he ſaieth: <hi>Some vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode

when the Latine Seruice was of late vſed,

thereof, he goeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> higheſt cauſe, that is
God him ſelfe, ſaying:</p>
            <p>For in reſpect of God there is neither Iew
nor Gentile, nor Greeke, nor Barbarous.</p>
            <p>If you aleage this as out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it appeareth that ye doe by the
quotation in the margine and by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincte

muſt I tel you, that the Apoſtle nameth in
deede Iewe and Greeke: but Gentile or
Barbarous he nameth not, neither ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
he of theyr diuerſitie in tounges, but,
in religion and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But if you allude
onlye to that place, and by accommodation
make a further meaning of it: let it be wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
then, in the curſiue letter of your owne
wordes, ſo much as is not expreſſely in the
Scripture. Yet your ſaying is true, though
your doing be ſuſpitious, and it maketh to
this purpoſe: that one ſhoulde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
an other: But, that one might
not call an other after the proper name
of the Countrye where hee was borne,
thinke you that it is forbydden? Or is it
againſte the bleſſede and vniforme will
and mynde of God, to call one Tounge
Greeke, an other Latine: Or one pure and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yne, an other ragged and Barbarous?

In reſpect of God, there is neyther Iew

who ſoeuer calleth ſome Iewes and

In reſpect of God there is neyther Greeke

            </p>
            <p>Againe, In reſpecte of God, all is one:

Truly, if D. Hardinge woulde
haue made this diſtinction of his owne

            <p>I note therefore this much, that you may

whiche will not ſuffer a Lerned man, to

            <p>Theſe thinges thus preſuppoſed, that
Common Prayers and Common Seruice
of the Church are not al one, and that ſome
there were within the ſixe hundred after


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22621:63"/>
Chriſt, which vnderſtoode not the Publike
Seruice, and, that all Tounges are Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
and Vulgare, byſide Greeke and
Latine: D. Harding begynneth to make
argumentes for profe of his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Whereof it may begathered,<note place="margin">Iew. 159 How gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</note> that hitherto
he hath proued nothing.</p>
            <p>Much better it might be gathered, that
hitherto he hath made a plaine way to the
matter, by putting aſyde ſuche doubtes, as
might come in betwene through occaſion
of wordes miſtaken and miſunderſtanden.
What needeth therefore this brauerie? Or
what meaneth this haſtines? Or why tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth
he, not only before the victorye,
but alſo before battaile? Wil not M. Iewel
ſuffer a man to make a preface vnto his
treatiſe, And ſpeake ſome generall thinges
pertcining to the queſtion, before he make
his principall argument againſt it? but he
muſt ſhew furth his winninges (I can not
tell what) and ſay: hereof it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he hath hitherto proued nothing?
There is neither Wit, nor Grauitie, not
Commoditie, in it, ſo to hall and put vnto
him, out of no occaſion, that which may
ſounde to diſgracing of the Aduerſary, and
magnifyinge of his owne cauſe. But to the


<pb facs="tcp:22621:64"/>
pointe of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>The chiefe Argument that D. Harding
maketh, is of one ſorte, as if he ſhould ſay:
The inferiour Countries and Churches,
folowed the ſame tounge in publike Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
which theyr Mother or Principall
Church had: But thoſe inferiour Churches
had ſundry and ſeueral Languages: ergo
the vulgar people of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that general and vniforme tounge,
of the Principall Church. This Argument
he proſecuteth in order: firſte by Example
of the Greeke Church, then of the Latine:
and, before he bringeth the Examples, he
doth in both places ſignify, what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to proue, and by what meanes or
Propoſitions he will proue it. And firſte
therefore theſe are to be conſidered, either
becauſe they ſerue to the openinge of the
ſtate of this queſtion: either becauſe it
will be perceyued by them, what truſte is
to be geuen to M. Iewel: which ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
(as I may ſay) doth put to and take
away from D. Hardings words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to know
his falſehoode and Craftines, it ſhould be a
good leſſon, to ſuch as loue their ſaluation.</p>
            <p>D. Harding, before he ſheweth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
what he can ſay of the Seruice in the

            <p>Here firſt you lye, For in D. Hardinges
ſentence, theſe wordes, <hi>WHOLY</hi> and
<hi>THOROVGHLY,</hi> are not founde at
al: and the, <hi>WHICH AL,</hi> that you ſeeme
to take as ſpoken of the whole Greeke
Churche, is not thereto referred of D.
Harding, but to the people only of thoſe
ſome Countries, which he mentioned the
lyne before. And therfor as much difference
as there is, betwene a General and a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
propoſion, <hi>Or the people of al Greece,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Al the people of ſome Coutries of Greece:</hi>
ſo greate and euident oddes there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
true meaning and M. Iewels dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Nowe to the other propoſition as
M. Iewel reherſeth it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other propoſition is,</hi> That ſome
whole Countries in the Grekee Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode

            </p>
            <p>Before, you were blamed for addinge,
here now are you to be noted for taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
But what is that? No ſmal thinge
ſurely, nor ſuch as may be ſpared: but thoſe
very wordes, which declare the truth and
reaſonableneſſe of the propoſition. For it
is to abſolute and vnlikely to ſay, <hi>Some


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22621:65"/>
whole Countries of the Greeke Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode
not the Greeke tounge,</hi> but that,
<hi>for the more parte,</hi> (which wordes M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
ſuppreſſed), they vnderſtode not the
Greeke tongue, that will be true in theyr
iudgement, which can conſider, how many
Simple, Rude, and Ignorant there are, in
euery Country, which know no other then
their vulgar tongue: And of the better ſort,
how many there are, which ſo know an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tounge beſide their owne, that they
are not much the wiſer for it. You may ſee
then how daungerous and ſore a felow M.
Iewel is.</p>
            <p>Now concerning other two propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
(which M. Iewel hath with like Arte ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of D. Hardinges words, about
the Latine tounge, as he hath done about
the Greeke) to make his craft more ſenſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
let D. Hardings own words be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>After that theeſe Countreys,<note place="margin">Harding Fol. 59.</note>
(<hi>ſaith D. Harding ſpeking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weſt church</hi>
had bene inſtructed in the Faithe, as

their Seruice accordingly. No doubte
ſuch, as was vſed in the Churches, from
whence their firſt Apoſtles and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
were ſent. And becauſe, the

theſe weaſt partes from Rome, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ſome from S. Peter, ſome from S.

            <p>Hereof may be gathered two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>The ſeconde, the firſte planters of

from Rome.</p>
            <p>But, how doth M. Iewel conceiue theſe
matters?</p>
            <p>His proufe (ſayeth he) for the Latine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
hangeth vpon two poyntes. The fyrſte
is, that all the Faithe of the weaſt parte of the

            <p>Firſt, you be deceiued in your numbring,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

becauſe we (the Welſhmen you meane) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the other part, that <hi>AL FAITH

of Ioſeph, becauſe Iacob himſelf was
begoten of Iſaac: and that Rome could not
be mother of the Weaſt Churches, becauſe
ſhe her ſelf had her Parents out of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:
Or, as though D. Harding had ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon the queſtion of <hi>AL FAITH,</hi> and
that, <hi>ONLY from Rome,</hi> which at, all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

looſely you haue behaued your ſelf in your

            <p>The ſeconde is,<note place="margin">Iew. 167</note> that the Planters of the
ſame faith miniſtred the Common Seruyce
EVERY WHERE IN THE LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE
TOVNGE.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt of D. Hardinges Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
though M. Iewell make it the


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22621:67"/>

But generally he ſayed it, that ſuche <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
was in theſe weſt partes: as was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Churches from whence their
firſt Apoſtles and preachers were ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this might ſtand, whether they came
from Hieruſalem, Greece or Rome. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſpecified nothing, vntill his ſeconde
Propoſition: where, out of this Principle,
he gathereth, that becauſe the faith came in
to the Weaſt from Rome, and they had the

            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:22621:69"/>
Concerning D. Hardinges knowlege,
I beleue he putteth nothing in print, that
he thinketh to be a fallacie. But why, is it
a deceytfull Argument? Becauſe it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>in Scholes, ex meris particularibus.</hi> Yet
the Scholes,<note place="margin">M. Iew. Logike more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that of the Scholes.</note> I trow, ſpeak not of D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges

all Argumentes, which conſiſte of

and therefore your rule (M. Iewell)
hath exceptions.</p>
            <p>But you find fault with it an other way
ſaying: <hi>Or, a non diſtributo ad diſtributum,</hi>
as though it were to be ſuſpected, that D.
Harding (in ſayeing, <hi>Aſia the Leſſe had the
Seruice in the Greeke tounge</hi>) had meant
to except ſome countries thereof: and that
therfore it ſhould be nede to bid him to put

            </p>
            <p>Surely it ſeemeth good inough. And
though ſome Proteſtant of other countreis,
(thinking perchaunce that in the reformed

Yet would I not chainge my minde, but

            <p>The argument being now amended in

And yet notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Iew. 160</note> is not M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>Loe,<note place="margin">What a ſtomake?</note> he confeſſeth the Propoſition to be

            <p>The Minor is thus declared by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Actes

that is, after the proper and peculiar tonge

            <p>Mary without peraduenture, it will be an

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:77"/>
For, to let it paſſe that S. Luke expreſſely
ſayeth, <hi>Euery one hearde them ſpeake
Lingua ſua, in his owne Tounge,</hi>
and to graunt vnto you, that all the toungs
mentioned in the Actes, were not diuers,
but that ſome were diſtincted from other,
only by certaine differencies: Yet thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
were ſo great, that the Vulgare
people of one Tounge, vnderſtode not them
of an other: For (I truſt) you meane not
ſuch differencies, as are made by reaſon of
Swiftneſſe, Slowneſſe, Smothneſſe or
Hardneſſe, and ſo furthe of Tounges: but
ſuch only as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in the variety of Letters,
Wordes and Dialect. In which reſpect,
though the Tounge of Saxonie, Flanders,
England and Scotland be one: yet becauſe
of a peculiar Property and Dialect whiche
is in them, the Vulgar Saxons are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Strangers to Engliſhe men, but allſo to
the Flemminges their neighbors: and the
Vulgare Scotteſman not only vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not the Flemming, but of the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland
ſo nigh vnto him, he knoweth not
the wordes and meaning.</p>
            <p>There be about three ſkore ſeueral Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that vſe the Tounge named Illyrica,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:22621:77"/>
but though the kind of the Tounge be one,<note place="margin">Geſne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.</note>
and the difference conſiſte in Dialecte and
proprietie only: yet they vnderſtand not
one the other, as in example: Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>Moſcouites, Polonians, Sclauons, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,
&amp; caet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo, if you wil conclude vpon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the kinde of tounge was one, of ſome
of them which are reherſed in the Actes of
the Apoſtles, that therfore, they vnderſtode
one the other: What miracle call you this
to make men aſtonied at? And that Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians
and Bythinians, hearing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
ſpeaking vnto them in theyr owne
Tounge, vnderſtoode them both at once?
Or howe could S. Luke ſo forget himſelfe,
that to commend and ſet furth the greate
worke and gifte of God ſhewed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Apoſtles, he would make a great
mater of it, and ſay, that: <hi>the inhabitants
of Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tus, Cappadocia, Phrygia, Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,
&amp; Aſia wer amaſed &amp; aſtonied
aſking: how do we euery one of vs here

if in deede theſe had one naturall tounge,
&amp; vnderſtode one an other, ſauinge for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein


<pb facs="tcp:22621:78"/>
odd differences. Cartainly if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
were ſmal, the miracle muſt needs be ſmal,
which S. Luke telleth for greate.</p>
            <p>If an Engliſh man, knowing no other
tounge byſide his owne, and a Welſhman,
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like knowledge in his naturall tounge
only, ſhoulde come together to Diuinitye
Schole in Oxforde, and both of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kinges Reader, this were much
to be wondred at: but if there come to Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
Croſſe, out of eche Sheer in England,
ſeueral perſons, and vnderſtand the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
Engliſh, doe they loke one vpon an

ſprite in him, and ſay: howe doe we heare,
euery one of vs, this fellowe, whiche is
borne an Engliſh man, to ſpeake our Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tounge? Yet no doubt there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of ſpeache, betwen Engliſh men of
diuers Sheers. But it is not ſo great, as to
make a miracle when they, Engliſhe men
borne, vnderſtand the ſelf ſame tounge in
an Engliſh Preacher.</p>
            <p>Now, that in the Actes of the Apoſtles
was a wonderfull Strainge and Diuine
matter, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace and ſtrength of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
herein, that they (whom for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpoſe

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:22621:78"/>

&amp; could not yet vnderſtand eche the other,
ſpeaking together. Wherefore you may as

a certaine differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, therein.
Becauſe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> difference helpeth you ſo litle,
that we proue thereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tounge of Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,
Pontus, and Aſia, to haue bene ſo

            <p>But let vs conſider M. Iewels anſwer,
to the other Authority of the Actes of the
Apoſtles, that we may al vnder one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute
his oft repeted Iffinge and ſhiftinge. To
that of the Lycaonians thus he ſayeth:</p>
            <p>The people of Lycaonia ſpake vnto Paule
and Barnabas Lycaonicè: Ergo,<note place="margin">Iew. 164</note> ſaieth M.
Harding, they ſpake no Greeke.</p>
            <p>This is one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon trik, of your Logike,
to peruerte and alter the intent of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary.<note place="margin">A commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tricke of M. Iew.</note>
D. Hardings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil be this:
<hi>Ergo they vnderſtod not the learned Greeke
tounge:</hi> for to this purpoſe he allegeth all
his Authorities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22621:79"/>
Therefore, whether they ſpake Greeke or
no, that is not the mater: but whether they
ſpake or vnderſtoode ſuche Greeke, as the
Scriptures and Church Seruice were then
conteyned in, Or ſuch as we reade now in
the workes and Liturgies of S. Baſile,
Gregorie Nazianzene, or Chryſoſtome.
Conſidertherfore (M. Iewel) how proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ye procede and argue.</p>
            <p>But what if S. Luke had ſaied, they ſpake
Ionicê,<note place="margin">Iew. 164</note> Aeolicè, or Doricê, which tounges
were adioyning faſt vpon Lycaonia. would
he therfore conclude they ſpake no Greeke?</p>
            <p>Here loe is <hi>a what if,</hi> to further the cauſe.
But what ſeke you by it.<note place="margin">M. Iew. much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in his auni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g</note> M. Iewel? Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,

had writen <hi>Ionicê,</hi> what then? <hi>would
he therfore</hi> (ſay you of M. Harding) <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude
they ſpake no Greeke?</hi> No forſoth: for he
ſought not after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And <hi>Alas</hi> therfore
(to take more iuſt pity of you then you can
doe of others) here hath M. Iewell loſte
a good Argument.</p>
            <p>Againe, he knoweth, that the Greeke
tounge is diuided by the learned therein, in
to fyue Dialectes: of which <hi>Ionica, Aeolica,</hi>
and <hi>Dorica,</hi> are three, and therefore he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Greeke that ſpeaketh in them, but we


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22621:79"/>
haue no ſuch warrant for the Lycaonicall
Tounge.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he might conclude, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> al though
they ſpake Greeke, yet not that which is
Attica or the pure and Common Greeke
tounge: in which two the Scriptures, and
old Fathers writings, are ſet furth.</p>
            <p>But what talke you of that, whiche S.
Luke might haue ſayed, and do not anſwer
to that, which he hath writen? Theſe toun-(ges
ſay you, meaning <hi>Ionica, Aeolica Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica)
were adioyning faſt vpon Lycaonia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Idle reaſon or talke of M. Iew.</note> I
finde no fault with your Coſmographie,
but I ſee not, what end ye bringe it to. For
Spaine is adioyning faſte vppon France,

            <p>Verely <hi>(ſay you)</hi> if a man by way of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

For the pure Greeke, which holy Fathers

euery day, wandring further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>To ſpeake now of the Latin Church, and

Good Lord what a felow is he, that hath ſo

            <p>Yet in very deede, thoſe his Sentences

Which how vayne and vnſenſible it is, let

if it had ben plainly Anſwered vnto him, at

but that no ſuch Name was then vſed: and

cometh not to the Thinge it ſelfe, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtaunce
of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea rather, he might
be aſhamed, To Looke ſo bygge, And
Speake ſo lowdly, And Prouoke ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
And Stur about ſo buſily, And geaue
great hope of victorie, And when all that he
aſketh, is Graunted, to be able to make no
other vantage, but only this: <hi>Ergo mie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
is True.</hi> Yea forſoth A worthie Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
To proue that, And ſtand vpon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>,

Allegations and Authorities, out of
Councels, Fathers, Hiſtories, Law Ciuil

that it cummeeh very quickly into ones

euil fauored cauſe ſo well be ſet furth, nor
Auncient witneſſes be ſo thickly brought
out to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And this I take to be one knacke of his
cunning, that he prouided to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
in ſuch a forme, as might dehort ſome

               <p>And if he will not haue me to call it, a
knacke of his Cunning, then ſurely will
it be proued to be, a Lacke of diſcretion: ſo
that he ſhall not eſcape iuſt reproche, either
for his craftines, if he perceyued it, either
for his dulneſſe, if he did not conſider it.
For the biggneſſe of a boke is not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable,
if accordinge to the nature of the
matter, the handeling of it be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But, whoſoeuer increaſeth his worke
aboue meſure, by taking in that which is
not agreable: either he is to wiſe for the
Simple, by making them conceiue muche
of that whiche is litle: Or he is not wiſe
enough in the iudgement of the Learned,
by puffinge that vp to a greate quantitie,
which would, by reaſon, be leſſe in Sight

               <p>The other conſiſteth of ſuche Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as we can not, or maye not vſe,
and whiche you alſo ſhould, at no tyme,

whiche are proponed, you had no occaſion

                     <p>There was alwaies a Communion in
the Primitiue Church: Ergo there
was no Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>For as the world goeth now, this word
A Communion, doth ſignifie, either the act
of ſome receiuing togeather, either that pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per

in England at the Miniſtration of the
Lordes Supper.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt of theſe, two ſenſes, true it is
that A Communion was I can not ſaie,
alwaies, but no inconuenience wil folow if
it be graunted that it was alwaies in the

Common and Ordinarie, the heape of the


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:22621:110"/>
Authorities by M. Iewel reherſed, doe
make for it.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond: It was neuer knowen

                     <p>Concerning the ſecond: the Argument is

               <p>The Church of Chriſt is one:</p>

In reſembling alſo the doctrine of the B.

S. Baſile (Amphilochius writeth) was
thought of Chriſte to celebrate Maſſe, in
whiche he diuided the Sacramente into
three partes, and Receauing one by hym
ſelfe alone, the other two he Reſerued. And
ſo by this Teſtimonie, Priuate Maſſe is
ſufficiently proued. Or, if it proue nothing
to hym whiche refuſeth the Authoritie of
Amphilochius by whome it is writen, yet
to him which would take it for a true hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
no doubt but it ſerueth for Priuate
Maſſe. M. Iewell then ſuppoſing it to
be true, let vs ſee how he tranaileth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
it. His wordes are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if all this</hi> (that Amphilochius repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of S. Baſils Saicing of Maſſe) <hi>were
good record, and mater of trueth: yet &amp; caet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What intend you by this <hi>Yet?</hi> Would ye

Would ye not be ruled by it? Would ye not

but if a Miracle be wrought about it,
it is not only to be compted as True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the thing it ſelf &amp; witneſſe of Man,
but alſo to be alowed as Good, becauſe of
the teſtimonie of God geauen to it by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.
It foloweth in M. Iewel:</p>
               <p>But a Viſion.</p>
               <p>As who ſhould ſay, that an Hiſtorie were
the worſe, becauſe it conſiſeth of a Viſion
from God, and not of the externall ſight
and Record of man. What wiſe man would
euer ſay: Let it be true, that Iacob ſaw An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
goeing and cumming vp and doune
vpon the ladder betwene Heauen &amp; earth,
<hi>yet were it but a Viſion.</hi> Is this your ſight
in Diuinitie, to diminiſſh a Truth by the


<pb facs="tcp:22621:160"/>
manner of Repreſenting it. It may be
proued that to ſee thinges in a Viſion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the mind is eleuated from bodyly ſenſes,
is perfiter in degree of dignitie, then to ſee
them with corporall eyes, where more
meanes and more groſſe are occupied. <hi>Yet</hi>
(ſayeth M. Iewel, contemptuouſly) <hi>it were
but a Viſion.</hi> It foloweth in hym:</p>
               <p>And perhaps a Dreame.</p>
               <p>Wiſely ſayed, I promiſe you, and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
to your former wordes. For how can
theſe two Propoſitions ſtande together?
<hi>If it were a matter of truth, yet perhaps but a
Dreame.</hi> Doe not theſe, the one playnly
hynder the other? Or can ye graunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one,
and feare the other? Nay, if it were of good
Recorde and mater of trueth, then vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
<hi>it was no Dreame.</hi> But you, of a great
confidence and courage doe permit vs the
firſt, And yet of a miſerable forgetfulneſſe
or fearfulneſſe, are not reſolued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond.
In ſayeing: <hi>If all were good Record:</hi> you
permit vs to take it, and your ſelfe, by
puttinge the caſe, doe graunte it: In ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
<hi>Yet were it perhaps but a Dreame,</hi>
you take awaye from vs that whiche you

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22621:160"/>
if it were mater of truth, it was no dreame:
and if perhaps it were A Dreame, you
ſhould not then haue bene ſo abſolute or
bountifull, as to let vs receaue it for a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Trueth. It foloweth:</p>
               <p>But one mans fact.</p>
               <p>You aſked but for any one ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when you challenged vs. The fault
therfore can not be in that it is <hi>One,</hi> but if
you dare anſwer that S. Baſils fact alowed
by Chriſt himſelfe, is not ſufficient, then
ſay you ſomewhat. It foloweth.</p>
               <p>But once done.</p>
               <p>Once done is truly done, and ſo much is
inough againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which deny y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it was at
any time done. Againe, Once done in the
preſence of Chriſte, and by hys apointe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is for euer done, to confirme the faith
of the Catholikes. I foloweth:</p>
               <p>Not in the day tyme, but at midnight.</p>
               <p>What thinke you then M. Iewell, that
there is no Trueth, when the Sunne is
downe? Or that euil Sprites only doe
occupie the worlde at midnight? Or
that God is A God of the daye, and not
of the Nyghte? Is not this A wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
cauſe to ſet loſſe by S. Baſiles Maſſe,
for that, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other were aſleepe, he waked


<pb facs="tcp:22621:161"/>
And that Chriſte made him not tarie till
brode daye, but ſtraite wayes to riſe and
Say Maſſe at midnight? What fault you
find with midnight I can not tel: but your
Literall ſenſe in this place beinge ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſhe,
either you haue ſome pure and fine
Myſticall ſenſe, Or els you take ſo litle reſt
in the night, that in the day time your wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
be not your owne. It foloweth:</p>
               <p>And that without cumpanie, and without
Witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning the companie, Chriſt and
his Angels were preſent: concerning the
Witneſſes, take awaye <hi>Eubulus</hi> which ſaw
it, yet as many were preſent, as were at the
Annuntiation of our Ladie, Or the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Chriſt our Sauiour. at whiche
though no man was preſent, yet by the

of our faith. Againe, what neede witneſſes,
your ſelfe permitting the Recorde of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochius

How hangeth this together M. Iewell?

               <p>It is no reaſon in deede. Yet if they
ſpeake not contrarie one to the other, then


<pb facs="tcp:22621:168"/>
is it no Reaſon, that you ſhould in ſuch

               <p>Now, maie we thinke, that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

               <p>O M. Iewel, doe you ſee, that this wil

that three ſcore and ten Canons of the

               <p>
                  <hi>The ſum of M. Iewels Anſwer is this:</hi>
The loafe which Paulinus ſent vnto S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine

               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Iew. 78. Miſſa.</note>

For, as I haue already proued by ſundry Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thorities,

               <p>But what then? If it be oftentymes ſo

it, M. Iewels anſwer is this:</p>
               <p>Miſſa is often tymes taken for any kynd

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:22621:172"/>
and place.</hi> But to note, what M. Iewel
concludeth, of <hi>Benedicere ſancta:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe wordes doe no more ſignifie <hi>(faieth
he)</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecration of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Iew. 78.</note> as M.
Harding hath tranſlated it, then theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
Extollite manus veſtras in ſancta, doe
ſignifie the lifting vp of handes to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>And why ſo?</hi> Chryſoſtome in his Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
vſeth the ſame manner of ſpeach, to a
far other purpoſe. <hi>What is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>? He allegeth
the wordes, and then inferreth:</hi> It maie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that Chryſoſtome by theſe wordes,
meant a ſolemne praier to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole.</p>
               <p>But how applie you now theſe thinges
to yonr purpoſe? becauſe, S. Chryſoſ. mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth
by <hi>Benedicere Sancta, a praier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
his liturgie,</hi> doth Leontius vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
iuſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame by thoſe wordes? In what
Logik fynde you that Conſequence? Or, by
what maner of likelihoode, make you it
probable? Mark it better (M. Iew.) &amp; you
ſhal perceaue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which you would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude
not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to be vnlikely, but alſo impoſſible.
For, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benediction of which S. Chryſoſt.
ſpeaketh, was you ſaie a <hi>ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Praier to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude</hi>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:22621:173"/>
Therefore vndoubtedly the

<hi>Benedicere Sancta,</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to ſo diſtinct Tymes and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>
                  <hi>The Anſwer which M. Iewel maketh
is this:</hi> Benedicere Sancta, ſignifieth in S.
Chryſoſtome a ſolemne Praier made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the whole: Ergo, benedicere Sancta,
that is, to bleſſe the holy thinges, doth not
ſignifie in Leontius Hiſtorie, Conſecration.</p>
               <p>Let vs come to an other Example.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The 4. Example.</hi> Matth. 16. Petra.</note>
Our ſauiour ſaied vnto S. Peter, <hi>Thow

wil I builde my Churche: Ergo,</hi> S. Peter
was moſt faſt ſett aboue all other in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
and he was a moſt ſure and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

ſingular Prerogatiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaieth M. Iewel) <hi>Chriſt is the

But how foloweth this, that


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:22621:173"/>
becauſe Chriſt is the Rock, therfore S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

might conclude,<note place="margin">By ſuche argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts al religion hathe bene confuted.</note> God is our King and our

               <p>
                  <hi>The briefe Argument of M. Iewels is
this.</hi> The Rocke which Chriſt ſpake of to S.

An other Example.<note place="margin">The. v Example. <hi>Ambr. 2. Cor. 12.</hi>
                  </note> S Androw folowed

                  <note place="margin">Iew. 245</note> 
                  <hi>M. Iewel Auſwereth:</hi> It is eaſye to

               <p>Thincketh he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Primacy that
<hi>Eſau</hi> loſt for a diſh of pottage, was to wear
a better cote then his felowes, Or to ſyt

fiue times more meat for his part, then an

to the honour of the firſt borne: that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
which S. Ambroſe attributeth to S.
Peter, may haue the very ſelf ſame ſenſe in
it? Or, becauſe Eutyches had a Primacie
in his Abbey, may it therfore be lawfull for
vs to imagine, that all the Apoſtles liued
in one Cloiſter togeather, and that S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:22621:174"/>
Beſide this, if Primatus doth ſignify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Preferment, it ſerueth alſo to ſignify the
Supremacy. And ſo, as you wiſhe that it
ſhould be taken in your ſenſe, ſo ſhould you
iuſtly haue prouided for it, leaſt it were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in an other ſenſe. And this truly had
bene your part, (M. Iewel) to proue that

to drine the Catholikes to the prouing ſide,

the Vniuerſall power and Gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the

               <p>As who ſhould ſay, that the queſtion had

then one: Or that D. Harding

               </p>

deuiſes to confound A trueth, D. Harding
obiecteth you, the teſtimony of S. Ambroſe
where it is plaine, that S. Peter had a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.
To this now make a direct anſwer,
not by telling a long Tale &amp; True inough
of the Significations of <hi>Primatus,</hi> but in
Applying them to the Purpoſe, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
vs, in what one ſenſe it is to be
taken in S. Ambroſe. And if you dare ſay,
that he meant ſuche a Primacy, as Eſau

Heretike Eutiches had in his Abbey, then
ſhall we prouide an Anſwer for you. But
whereas the very wordes themſelues doe
geue it, that it coulde not be ſo Simple a
mater, (for S. Androw, as euery other of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Apoſtles, had Authority geuen him in the
whole worlde, and yet the Primacie was
beſtowed vpon S. Peter only, of whiche it
foloweth, that emong the chiefeſt he was

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:22621:175"/>
of S. Ambroſe, to declare that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus</hi>

               <p>Againe whereas you can not denye it,

aboue other, how wel ſhould you haue don
to Specify wherein it conſiſted? But you
thinke it inough perchaunce, to ſhewe that
you are not altogether vnlearned, and that
you haue in your daies, Heard, Reade, and
Seene many thinges. Which in deede were
inough to doe, if Chriſtians might ſeke for
their owne Praiſe only, and not the ſetting
forth of the Trueth, but the caſe being other

deſtroy an other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Anſwer that M. Iewel maketh is
this:</hi> Primatus doth ſignifie anye Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

that, that Principalitie of Apoſtleship,</hi> (which
vndoubtedlye was in the See of Rome)
<hi>is to be preferred before any Bishoprike that

                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. de Bapt. cont Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. lib. 2.</note> which place prouing ſo euidently, that
the See of Rome paſſeth in Dignitie what
ſoeuer Biſhopricke in the worlde, yet M.

why, and he can ſay no more but that,</p>
               <p>Socrates is called Prince of Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Iew. 249</note>
And Plato Prince of Oratours, And Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius
Prince of the world, And Elias head of

not for a Prince or Gouernour, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for A man that for his qualities is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemed
aboue the reſt. And in this ſenſe S.
Auguſtine calleth the See of Rome, as it was
in his time, principatum ſedis Apoſtolicae.</p>
               <p>Well Sir, that, <hi>Princeps is often vſed for
A man had in eſtimation for his vertue, rome,
or any ſingular qualitie,</hi> euery Grammarian
can witneſſe. But that it is alwais ſo vſed,
who telleth you? And excepte you proue
that it hath no other Signification biſyde,


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:22621:176"/>
how can you inferre, that becauſe Socrates
is called Prince of the Phyloſophers in
reſpect of his knowledge, ſo the See of
Rome ſhoulde be called <hi>Princeps</hi> or chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe
in reſpect of ſome qualitie only, (you tell
not what) and not of Supreme Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For Supreme Gouernment it ſelf,
is it not a certain qualitie? And Pompeius
whome your ſelfe name as <hi>Prince of the
world,</hi> though he were ſo in deede: in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
either of Vertue or Office, yet was he
not Supreme Gouernour. How hangeth
this Tale then togeather, that <hi>Princeps</hi> is
not taken for a Chiefe Gouernour,<note place="margin">Like Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mans Lip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes.</note> becauſe
it is often vſed to ſignifie an Eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
others in vertue. &amp;c? Or who woulde
euer ſo confounde a Trueth by a Trueth,
but he that loueth not the Trueth?</p>
               <p>I woulde aſke you allſo (M. Iewel)
what qualitie that ſhould be in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
See of Rome, for which it ſhoulde be
preferred aboue other Biſhoprickes of all
the worlde? It is not (you ſay) for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſake. Wherefore then?
Is it for Eſtimation of vertue, Gloquence,
Philoſophy or any ſuch like? Name the
quality if you can but you can not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22621:177"/>
Only you ſtay vpon the Negatiue, that
it had not the Principalitie becauſe of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Gouernment: And to that you adde
that <hi>Princeps</hi> is taken, in the places which
you allege, <hi>only for a man that for his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
is to be eſteemed.</hi> As wel you might
proue, (M. Iewel) that Socrates was
not Prince of Philoſophers, becauſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi>
is taken oftentimes for A Chiefe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
in A country, which Socrates ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was.</p>
               <p>See then (indifferent Reader) whether
this be an honeſt and plaine maner in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering,
to refell one Trueth by an other,
Or ſo to deny one Senſe of A word, that he
can not tell, what other Senſe of the ſame
worde, to folow? Surely where M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
ſenſes in this matter ſhould be, I can
not tel. For like as when we ſay, <hi>Socrates
is the Prince of Philoſophers,</hi> we are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded
to make the Compariſon betwene
him and other Philoſophers, and not to
meddle with Oratours, Captaines, Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Or any of a diuers ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So, when S. Auguſtin witneſſeth, that
<hi>the Principalitye of the Apoſtleship</hi> (which
is in the Sea of Rome,) <hi>is to be preferred
before all other what ſo euer Bishoprikes,</hi>


                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:22621:177"/>
what wiſe man doubteth, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
here is to be made, betweene the
degrees of Power and Charge that are leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
or greater in that kinde of Office? Now
by a Biſſhopricke, what is imported? Is
not a Spirituall Function and Charge
ouer Soules vnderſtanded thereby? And
in this Charge are not Archbyſſhoppes
aboue Biſſhopes, and Patriarches aboue
Archebiſſhopes? But in what thing aboue?
In Iuriſdiction vndoubtedly, &amp; Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
larger then their Inferiour haue.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if the See of Rome, doe paſſe
in Principalitie, all other Biſſhoprikes (as
S. Auguſtine witneſſeth) And if the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riortie
or Inferiortie in Biſſhoprikes muſt
be conſidered according to the greatneſſe or
ſmalneſſe of the Iuriſdiction whiche is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to them (as the Definition of the

or Gouernment ouer al Chriſtendome,
which hath ſuch a Principalitie geauen it,
that all other Biſſhoprikes are not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

               <p>Not comparable, I meane, in thoſe
thinges, that perteine to Authoritie and
Gouernment, ſuche as is annexed to the


<pb facs="tcp:22621:178"/>
Condition, Subſtance, or Nature of
Biſſhoprikes. For in Vertue, Policie, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
Fauor of Emperours, Abundance
of Riches and lyuinges, and many other
lyke thinges which are Perſonal or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
the Biſſhoppes of Conſtantinople
may far excell the Pope. Yea, in ſuch Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoply

               <p>Conſider then I praie you (M. Iewel)

bringe a lyke Forme of Speache vſed in

               <p>Beware therefore (Chriſten Reader)
of M. Iewell, And eſpecially in thoſe
places: whiche as they make moſte for the
Catholyke Faith, ſo hath he no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
for ſauinge hym ſelfe from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribinge
vnto them, but this very Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
one and Feeble, to ſeeke where lyke
Phraſes may be founde of an other Senſe
yet and meanynge, thereby to bringe in
to doubt (or as he ſuppoſeth) to putre
out of doubte, that the Senſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholykes
Obiection can not contynue.
Whiche, in fewe wordes, is no other, then
to ſhewe hymſelfe A Grammarian only,


<pb facs="tcp:22621:181"/>
And to deſtroie one trueth by an other, as
though. One phraſe might not haue two
good Senſes, eche one agreeing with the
place in which they are apointed to ſerue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſum of M. Iewels Argument is
this:</hi> The like forme or phraſe of ſpeache is
to be found in an other ſenſe: Ergo, to put the
mater out of doubt, this Preſent place <hi>(of
which the queſtion is)</hi> hath not a different
or ſundrie ſenſe frome that other.</p>
               <p>The Summe of my meaning, is this:
that no man be deceaued through this kind
of M. Iewels Anſwering, wherein, he ſo
telleth one Trueth, that he diſſwadeth an
other. This practiſe of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
hath already done harme inough. let them
beginne rather to amend, theyr former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites,
then to adde fresshe vnto them.</p>
               <p>They haue anſwered: <hi>God muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in Spirite:</hi> Which is moſt true, and
haue thereby taken awaie an other trueth,
that, <hi>God is alſo to be worſhipped with
our body and bodily thinges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They haue anſwered:</hi> The true Faſt is to
abſtaine frome Synne. <hi>Whiche is vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teely
True: but by that faire ſhew of pure
holynes, they haue Deſtroied an other


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:22621:181"/>
Trueth that,</hi> Togeather with the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from ſynne, we muſt alſo take
paynes in our body, and abſtaine now
and then, from meate and drinke.</p>
               <p>Thei haue Anſwered: <hi>We muſt receiue
the body of Chriſt by faithe,</hi> which in ſome
ſenſe is moſt true. But thei haue there
withal taught the people, not to beleue
the Real preſence of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which preſence yet is as true, as the
other is certaine.</p>
               <p>In other caſes moe, they haue done
the lyke. It is to much that thei haue
already done: let them not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in this trade of Anſwering, nor of
dealing in maters of Religion. Specially
when thei bring the mater, to Phraſes of
Speache, and Signification of wordes,
and by one Senſe take awaie an other,
whereas bothe in their ſeueral places doe
agree with Truthe: this kynd of hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or Tumblyng rather of thinges, the

when he ſeeth many wordes made on

               <p>For, like as you M. Iew. haue now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed

<hi>Byr Lady, this geare is not ſo cleare and

to no other end, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
In ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man ſhal not be able
