            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Piece (being ſent me out of
<hi>France,</hi> as a double rarity, both in
reſpect of the ſubject and the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Author) I had no ſooner
read, then (taken with its ingenuity) I was
moved to cloathe it in an Engliſh habit, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of envy, that other Nations ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have out-knowne us in any Art, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ingenious, as is this of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper badges of Gentlemen, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
and perſons of Honour, may juſtly
<pb facs="tcp:108365:14"/>
challenge their countenance and favour,
whereunto tis ſacred.</p>
            <p>My Author affirmes himſelfe to be the firſt
hath written of this ſubject in his Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue;
and I might ſay the like here, were it
not that I find a ſmall parcell of it in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
Remaines, under the title of <hi>Impreſes,</hi>
which are in effect the ſame with <hi>Deviſes.</hi>
Thence, you may gather, that the Kings of
England, with the Nobility and Gentry, have
for ſome hundreds of yeeres (though <hi>Deviſes</hi>
are yet of far greater Antiquity) both eſteemed
and made uſe of them: onely in former times
they arrived not (as now) to that height of
perfection; for they ſometimes did (as the
unskilfull ſtill doe) make uſe of <hi>Mottoes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
figures, and figures without <hi>Mottoes.</hi> We
read that <hi>Hen.</hi> the 3. (as liking well of Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration)
commanded to be written (by way
of <hi>Deviſe</hi>) in his Chamber at Woodſtock,
<q>Qui non dat quod amat, non accipit ille quod optat.</q>
               <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. bore for his <hi>Deviſe</hi> the rayes of the
Sunne ſtreaming from a cloud without any
<hi>Motto. Edmond</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Duke of York, bore
<pb facs="tcp:108365:14"/>
a Faulcon in a Fetter-lock, implying, that he
was locked up from all hope and poſsibility
of the Kingdome. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 5. carryed a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Creſſet,</hi> ſometimes a Beacon, and for <hi>Motto</hi>
(but not appropriate thereunto) UNE SANS
PLUS, <hi>one and no more. Edw</hi> the 4. bore the Sun,
after the Battell of <hi>Mortimers</hi>-Croſſe, where
three Sunnes were ſeene immediately conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in one. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 7. in reſpect of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
by his marriage, uſed the White Roſe united
with the Red, ſometimes placed in the Sunne.
But in the raigne of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. <hi>Deviſes</hi> grew
more familiar, and ſomewhat more perfect,
by adding <hi>Mottoes</hi> unto them, in imitation of
the Italians and French (amongſt whom there
is hardly a private Gentleman, but hath his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Deviſe</hi>) For <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
betweene him and King <hi>Francis</hi> the
firſt, whereat <hi>Charles</hi> the fift was alſo preſent,
uſed for his <hi>Deviſe</hi> an Engliſh Archer in a
greene Coat drawing his Arrow to the head,
with this <hi>Motto,</hi> CUI ADHaeREO, PRaeEST;
when as at that time thoſe mighty Princes
banding one againſt another, wrought him for
their owne particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108365:15"/>
To the honour of Queene <hi>Iane,</hi> (who dyed
willingly to ſave her child King <hi>Edward</hi>) a
Phenix Was repreſented in his Funerall fire
with this Motto, NASCATUR UT ALTER.
Queene <hi>Mary</hi> bore winged Time, drawing
Truth out of a pit, with VERITAS TEMPORIS
FILIA. Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> upon ſeverall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
uſed many Heroicall <hi>Deviſes,</hi> ſometimes
a Sive without a Motto, (as <hi>Camden</hi> relates) and
at other times theſe words without figure, VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEO,
TACEO, and SEMPER EADEM. King
<hi>Iames</hi> uſed a Thiſtle and a Roſe united, and a
Crown over them, with this <hi>Motto,</hi> HENRICUS
ROSAS, REGNA JACOBUS. Pr. <hi>Henry</hi> (beſides
that <hi>Deviſe</hi> which is appropriate to the Princes
of Wales) made uſe of this Motto, without fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
FAS EST ALIORUM QUaeRERE REGNA.
And His Majeſtie that now is, that other of
CHRISTO AUSPICE REGNO. Our Prince
beares (as all the Princes of Wales have done
ſince the black Prince) for his <hi>Deviſe</hi> (which
we commonly, though corruptly call the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Armes) a Coronet beautified with three
Oſtrich feathers, and for Motto,<note n="*" place="margin">A learned Brittan is of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that it ſhould be Eich dyn, i.e. your man, in the Brittiſh tongue.</note> ICH DIEN,
i.e. <hi>I ſerve,</hi> in the Saxon tongue, alluding to
<pb facs="tcp:108365:15"/>
that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The heire while he is a childe,
differeth nothing from a ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late Earle of Eſſex, when he was caſt
downe with ſorrow, and yet to be employed
in Armes, bore a ſable Shield without any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
but inſcribed, PAR NULLA FIGURA
DOLORI. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> (to trouble you with
no more) denoting that he perſiſted alwayes
one, depainted out the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, ſurrounded
with its ſhoares, which neither ebbeth nor
floweth, and for Motto, SINE REFLUXU.</p>
            <p>Some may object, that in regard Tiltings,
Tournaments, and Maſques, (where <hi>Deviſes</hi>
were much in requeſt) are for the preſent laid
aſide, therefore <hi>Deviſes</hi> are of leſſe uſe.</p>
            <p>Whereto I anſwer, that as thoſe Juſting or
jeſting Wars are diſuſed, ſo have vve now an
earneſt, though much to be lamented Warre,
vvhich renders them more uſefull then ever, I
meane for <hi>Cornets</hi> and <hi>Enſignes;</hi> And of
theſe, let me alſo give you ſome examples out
of the preſent times. On the Kings party, one
beares for his Cornet-Deviſe Saint <hi>Michael</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Dragon for the figure, and for <hi>Motto,</hi>
QUIS UT DEUS? Another is ſo bold as to
<pb facs="tcp:108365:16"/>
beare the picture of a King Crowned and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
vvith his Sword drawne, and this <hi>Motto,</hi>
MELIUS EST MORI IN BELLO, QUAM VI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERE

               <hi>Ermyne,</hi>
vvith this <hi>Motto,</hi> MALLEM MORI QUAM Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DARI.
A fift repreſents five hands ſnatching at
a Crown, defended by an armed hand and
ſword from a Cloud, with this <hi>Motto,</hi> RED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITE
CaeSARI. A ſixt figures a Landskip of a
pleaſant Country, vvith houſes, corne, &amp;c.
invaded by beggerly people, and for <hi>Motto,</hi>
BARBARUS HAS SEGETES? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the Parliaments party vve find one bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in his Cornet, the Sun breaking through a
Cloud, with EXURGAT ET DISSIPABUNTUR.
Another repreſents a Deaths-head, and a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell-Crown,
vvith MORS VEL VICTORIA.
A third figures an armed man, preſenting a
ſword to a Biſhops breaſt, with VISNE EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCOPARE?
the Biſhop anſwering, NOLO,

A fift repreſents the Sunne, diſsipating a clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

A ſixt, figures an armed man, hewing off the
corners of an Univerſity Cap with his ſword,
and this <hi>Motto,</hi> MUTO QUADRATA ROTUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIS,
&amp;C.</p>
            <p>Now though theſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> for the moſt part
argue wit in the Compoſers, yet many of them
are either imperfect or defective, which may
be attributed to the want of the preſcribed
rules of this Art, which this Treatiſe doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

of <hi>Hieroglyphicks, Emblemes, Reverſes</hi> of <hi>Medalls,</hi>
and all other inventions of vvit, vvhich any

here how many ſeveral waies <hi>Deviſes</hi> are uſeful
(eſpecially for Seals, being drawn from ſome

hold it not fit to foreſtall the Reader in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.
I am onely to beg pardon for my leſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Uſcelli</hi> (an Italian Author) ſaith,
that it belongeth onely to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
wits and beſt refined Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to undertake the making of
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> and that it is a quality
which hath been ſought and deſired by many, but very
few have been able to put it in execution. <hi>Paulus
Jovius</hi> (one of the choiceſt wits of his time, and the
firſt that enriched us with this Art) confeſſeth ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that of himſelfe he could never make any one
whereof he could be entirely ſatisfyed. <hi>Johannes
Andreas Palazzi</hi> inferrs from thence, that if it be
a difficult matter to frame a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> compleated with
all its properties, That à <hi>Fortiori</hi> it is a hard thing to
preſcribe precepts, and ſcore out the Way to attaine to
that perfection. As for my ſelfe I confeſſe freely, that
being moved unto and inſtructed by my late Vncle <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Eſtienne</hi> in making <hi>Deviſes,</hi> eight and twenty
yeares agoe, I made a greater quantity then and found
it a leſſe labor, then now, that I know the excellency and
<pb facs="tcp:108365:18"/>
ſubtility of the Art; wherein verily I have taken ſo great
delight, that the exerciſe of Arms, could never divert
me from ſo noble an employment, which hath alwaies
been to me a well-pleaſing recreation amidſt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of war. And as I endeavoured (as neer as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to attaine to the perfection of this Art, I applied
my ſelfe (with equall care) to read the <hi>Greek, Latine,
Italian,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Authors, who have treated of
<hi>Hieroglyphicks, Symboles, Emblemes, Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes,
Armories, Cimiers, Blazons, Reverſes</hi>
of <hi>Medalls, Deviſes,</hi> and ſuch like inventions of Wit,
which have ſome relation to each other, I diſtinguiſhed
them the one from the other, for my own particular uſe;
and collected thence all that ſeemed moſt notable unto
me. At length being ſollicited by my friends (who had
a great opinion of my ability for theſe Eſſaies,) I have
adventured to publiſh this little Tractate, devoid of all
graces and embelliſhments, contenting my ſelfe onely to
diſcover to others the light which I could receive from
famous Authors; To the end that thoſe who have leſſe
experience herein then my ſelfe, may reap ſome profit
thence. And that I may excite ſome better <hi>Genius</hi>
(wherewith this age is much more em iched then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent)
to improve my deſign and ſupply my defects;
From ſuch I hope happily to gaine ſome favour (though
otherwiſe my labours ſucceed not, according to my aime)
<pb facs="tcp:108365:18"/>
ſince I am the firſt that hath treated of this ſubject in
our mother tongue. In a word, there's no beginning, but
is difficult, nor is there any Peſant (though never ſo
ſimple) that merits not ſome kind of recompence; in
having been a guide and ſhewed the way to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Captaines, who following it, have atcheived their
noble deſignes.</p>
            <p>I am then reſolved to entreat of <hi>Hieroglyphicks,
Symboles,</hi> and <hi>reverſes of Medalls,</hi> of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
(and of thoſe but ſummarily, becauſe many have
already beaten the ſame <hi>Tract</hi>) ſince moſt Writers
draw the origin of them from our <hi>Deviſes;</hi> Nor will
I loſe the opportunity to ſay ſomething of <hi>Aenigma's,
Emblemes, Gryphes,</hi> and <hi>Parables,</hi> As alſo of
<hi>Armes, Cimiers, Blazons, Cyphers,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
which the un-knowing confound with <hi>Deviſes,</hi>
according to the neceſſity of the diſcourſe, which ſhall
oblige us to unfold their differences. We ſhall obſerve
the definition and Etimologie of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> their origin
and antiquity, their utility and finall end. We ſhall (to
render them perfect) recite the rules of their bodies,
which ſome call figures, and of their <hi>Mottoes</hi> which are
term'd Soules and words, with the relation they have
each to other, the places from whence they ought to be
drawne, and generally all that is to be obſerved in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to perfection; yet Without undertaking to
<pb facs="tcp:108365:19"/>
eſtabliſh ſuch inviolable Rules, either by my owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
opinion, or in the name of the Italians, but that
I will ſubmit my Iudgment to the more learned in this
<hi>Art.</hi> Nor will it be held reaſonable that we altogether
ſubject our ſelves to the <hi>Italian</hi> Laws in this occurrence
of ſo ſmall concernment, ſince in all things elſe they are

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no doubt, but that after the Hebrewes, the
Egyptians were the firſt that did moſt preciſely
addict themſelves to all manner of Sciences; nor
did they profeſſe any one, which they eſteemed
more commendable, then that of <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi>
which held the firſt rank among their ſecret Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplines,
whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> had without doubt a perfect <hi>Idea,</hi> as the
holy Scriptures teſtifie: From whence we gather, that he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
perfect in all the learning of the Egyptians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108365:21"/>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew confirmes this more cleerly in the life of <hi>Moſes</hi>
which he hath written; where it is obſerved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had
learned from the Doctors of Egypt, <hi>Arithmetic, Geometry,</hi> and
<hi>Muſique,</hi> as well practick as Theorick, together with this hidden
Phyloſophie, expreſſed by Characters, which they term <hi>Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,</hi>
that is to ſay, ſome marks and figures of living creatures,
which they adored as Gods: Whence we prove the Antiquity of
this Science, which had <hi>Moſes</hi> for her moſt renowned Diſciple.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (whoſe Maſter in this Science was <hi>Aenopheus</hi>
of <hi>Heliopolis</hi>) transferred it into Greece, where he enrich'd it with
many Symboles that beare his name.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe it is not probable, that the Egyptians were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the firſt Authors of this Learning, ſince<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes mention of this Author.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> (in the
Hiſtorie of the Jewes which he compiled) ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi>
lived ſome certaine time in the City of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> with the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Prieſts, to whom he taught <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> which he gloried to
have received by Tradition from <hi>Enoch.</hi> And truly, the Principles
of other Sciences could not be infuſed by <hi>Abraham</hi> into the minds
of Poſterity, without theſe kinds of Symboles and <hi>Aenigma's,</hi>
which ſerve as a Rind or Bark to conſerve all the myſteries of our
Anceſtors wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God framing this world with ſuch varieties of living
creatures, ſet before the eyes of our firſt Parents ſome draughts and
reſemblances, whence men might perceive, as through the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of a Cloud, the inſupportable rayes of his Divine Majeſty.
Therefore <hi>Epict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tus</hi> to good purpoſe hath noted, that men have
within their ſoules <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome Symboles and marks of
his Divinity, which God imprints in us, by the Species of all thoſe
objects which he ſets before our eyes. 'Twas for the ſame reaſon
that ſo many objects which preſented themſelves to the view of
<hi>Adam, Enoch, Moſes,</hi> and the other Patriarchs, were as ſo many
Characters illuminated by the Divine ſplendour, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Eternall Wiſdome did conſigne his name into the heart of
man. And I am the rather of this opinion, becauſe I ſee, that all
thoſe, who (moved by the ſame ſpirit) have treated of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our Religion, have ſhrowded them under the veiles of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Symboles; we ſee nothing more frequent in the one
and the other Teſtament. And truly the Hebrewes did ſo eſteeme
this way of ſpeaking and writing by Characters, that all their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108365:21"/>
diſcourſes which were ſubtile and ingenious, and had in them
much grace and acuteneſſe, they called MASCHAL, which word
is properly und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rſtood of Parables and Similitudes.</p>
               <p>But that which begot credulity that the Egyptians were the
firſt inventors of this Science, was the great eſteeme they had of
it, and the multitude of Figures which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngraven by them in
all Monuments of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew ſaith, That the Science of the Egyptians is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold;
The one vulgar, plaine and expoſed to all the world, to wit,
<hi>Geometry, Aſtrologie, Arithmeticke,</hi> and <hi>Muſiqne:</hi> The other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe
and ſacred, called <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> which by the meanes of
ſome <hi>Symboles</hi> and <hi>Enigma's,</hi> did containe the grave and ſerious
myſteries as well of the faculty of Theologie as of Phiſiologie and
Policy: And this was onely common amongſt the moſt learned
Prieſts. Therefore <hi>Origen</hi> calleth this Science of Symboles,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>holy letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the Egyptians were wont to ſay, that there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
divine power that preſided in the ſcience of Hieroglyphicks
and illuminated the underſtandings of thoſe who ſtudyed it, by
expelling thoſe ſhades of darkneſſe occurring in the Meanders and
ambiguities of ſo great diverſity of things, to conduct them to:
perfect and true knowledge of their Characters.</p>
               <p>The places whereon they inciſed theſe Figures, to conſerve their
memory, were their laborious Obeliſques, the well-wrought
Frontiſpieces of their Temples, and the huge bulk of their Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides,
whereof <hi>Lucan</hi> makes mention in theſe Verſes:

               <p>
                  <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> makes ample mention of the Figures
engraven upon thoſe Pyramides, and ſaith, that they did not make
uſe of Letters, as we doe, but that one onely Letter did ſometimes
ſignifie a word, and one ſole word a ſentence, and did alſo expreſſe
their minds by certain Characters; As by the Bee making Honey,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108365:22"/>
they meant a King that ought to obſerve moderation and clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
amid the rigour of his Lawes: and ſo of other Examples,
which I omit, to avoid prolixity.</p>
               <p>Nor did the Egyptians onely make uſe of theſe Hieroglyphicks,
for that Science did extend to other Nations, even to the Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionalls,
as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> witneſſes. We have the example of
<hi>Idanthura,</hi> King of the Scythians, in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who
threatning Warre againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> inſtead of Letter, ſent him a
Mouſe, a Frog, a Bird, a Dart, and a Plough, giving him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that he would conſtraine him to deliver up his Empire to
him: By the Mouſe meaning the Houſes; by the Frog, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
by the Bird, the Ayre; by the Dart, the Armes; and by the
Plough, the Soyle.</p>
               <p>Others expound it thus: That if they did not like Birds, or
hide themſelves like Mice in the ground, or like Frogs in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that they ſhould not avoid the power of his Armes, denoted
by the Dart.</p>
               <p>The Symbole, Aenigma, Embleme, Fable and Parable depend
upon, and have affinity with this Science, yet they differ in ſome
reſpects.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Symboles.</head>
               <p>THis word <hi>Symbole</hi> hath a large extent, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its
ſignifications: for being derived <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
this word <hi>Symbolum</hi> muſt of neceſſity have many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations,
which the Grammarians as well Greeks as Latines
have noted: For ſometimes it ſignifieth that which any one
brings for his part by way of contribution to a Feaſt, other whiles
it is taken for the Feaſt it ſelfe: ſometimes for a Seale for Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and ſometimes it ſignifieth the order, watch-word, or field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,
given to Captaines and Souldiers, and divers other things,
which draw their origin from thence. Beſides, it importeth a
kind of preſage or token of ſome future event; ſuch as deſire to
know more of it may conſult <hi>Moſcopulus.</hi> But that which is for
our purpoſe above all this, it alſo ſignifies the Armes of a Towne,
or the Medal of a Prince. And as the Greeks made uſe of Symboles
for their Cities and Lawes, ſo alſo for intricate ſentences and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108365:22"/>
matters. Therefore <hi>Ruffinus Aquilienſis</hi> ſaith, that for this
reaſon, the Apoſtles published their Symbole, by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
thir beleefe concerning Religion. Even ſo the Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans
in a myſticall and abſtruſe ſenſe, did by Symboles briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that which they would have to be obſerved. In a
word, the property of Symboles is to be concealed and enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped in Labyrinths of obſcure ſentences, which hath been ſo
much obſerved by <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that thereby we know thoſe which
are his.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> doth note one thing in Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles
worthy obſervation, That a great ſenſe ought to be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
under the gravity and brevity of Symboles, whereof he gives
an example, when we ſay, that the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cigales</hi> are a kind of thick, broad-headed and mouthleſſe flyes, which ordinarily ſit on trees, and ſing (after their ſcreaking fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion) both day and night; living onely of the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which they draw into them by certaine tongue-like prickles, placed on their breaſts</note> 
                  <hi>Cigales ſing upon the ground,</hi>
as much as to ſay, the trees are felled. Therefore brevity mixt with
a certaine gravity, comprehending many things under one and the
ſame ſignification, is the property of a Symbole.</p>
               <p>There are ſome Symboles which are of the nature of Proverbs,
and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelfe made uſe of them, as when he ſaith, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omni
ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> giving to underſtand, That all wits
are not capable of Learning.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be noted, that they are of three kinds, Morall, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and Theologicall. And that which is propoſed to us in theſe
Symboles, by meanes of the Corporeall ſenſes, doth penetrate our
underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Cauſſinus</hi> (from whom I have borrowed the moſt
of that which I have ſpoken concerning Hieroglyphicks)ſaith in a
Book he compiled thereof, That Symboles (in the ſignification
we treat of) are no other, then the ſignes of ſome intricate thing:
or (as <hi>Budaeus</hi> would have it) they are but ſimilitudes and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of things naturall.</p>
               <p>Hereunto I will adde, That the Ancients themſelves made uſe
of Symboles inſtead of Epitaphs, upon the tombes of the dead,

               <p>
                  <hi>AENigma</hi> is a Greek word, which ſignifieth an obſcure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
ſpeech or ſentence, ſo that in holy Scripture it is often
taken for a myſticall and abſtruſe matter, and Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
with other famous Authors, have attributed the name of
<hi>Symbole</hi> to <hi>Aenigma's. Gellius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Aenigma's</hi> are alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Gryphes,</hi> from the name of a certain Net, foraſmuch as at Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
(where <hi>Aenigma's</hi> are much in requeſt) the underſtandings
of the Feaſters are caught (as it were in nets) by obſcure queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Amongſt the Greeks they alſo took their denomination
from Cups and Goblets, for that they are uſed amongſt ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
But let us leave this Diſcourſe to Grammarians, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the difference between <hi>Gryphe</hi> and <hi>Enigma,</hi> to come to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aenigma</hi> (according to <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi>) is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
ſentence, expreſſed by an occult ſimilitude of things, or it is
a ſpeech hard to be underſtood in reſpect of the obſcurity of the
Allegory: And for this reaſon <hi>Fabius</hi> hath written, that the <hi>Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
was called a very obſcure Allegory <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which ſignifies to ſpeak obſcurely and ambiguouſly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gryphe</hi> (according to <hi>Clearchus</hi>) is a ſportive queſtion,
which exacts an information of the matter, contained in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
propoſed, be it for honour or reprehenſion, <hi>Cicero</hi> doth not
approve the uſe of it in orations, becauſe obſcurity therein is a
great defect: But it may very well be uſed at merryments and in
Princes Courts, for as much as ſuch queſtions doe what mens
wits, and hold them in ſuſpence, to the great contentment of the
hearers. Now or <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> ſome are obſcure in words only, ſome
in their ſenſe and meaning, and others both in the one and other.
Theſe are commonly derived from Similitude, Diſſimilitude,
Contrariety, Accidents, Hiſtory, Equivocall termes, and other
figures of Rhetorick, according to the variety of Langueges.

               <p>THough an Embleme hath ſome affinity with the <hi>Aenigma,</hi>
it differs notwithſtanding in this, that drawing (as it were)
the Curtaine from before the <hi>Aenigma,</hi> it declares the matter
more plainly: For the Embleme is properly a ſweet and morall
Symbole, which conſiſts of picture and words, by which ſome
weighty ſentence is declared. See an Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Emblemes are reduced unto three principall kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> of
Manners, of Nature, of Hiſtory or Fable. The chiefe aime of the
Embleme is, to inſtruct us, by ſubjecting the figure to our view,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108365:24"/>
and the ſenſe to our underſtanding: therefore they muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
covert, ſubtile, pleaſant and ſignificative. So that, if the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of it be too common, it ought to have a myſticall ſenſe; if
they be ſomething obſcure, they muſt more clearly informe us by
the words, provided they be analogick and correſpondent. Thus
much for the <hi>Aenigma</hi> may ſuffice, ſince <hi>Alciat,</hi> and many other

               <head type="sub">Of the Etimologie and Definition of Deviſes.</head>
               <p>IN this point, Scarcity reſtraines me on the one ſide, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
diſtracts me on the other. I find not any man that ſhews
me the Etimologie of this word, <hi>Deviſe:</hi> And in its definition the
Italians have ſo many different opinions, that it is a hard matter
to diſcover which of them is the beſt.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have written of <hi>Deviſes</hi> in Latine, as <hi>Tipotius,</hi> (who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108365:24"/>
hath made an ample collection of them) calls it <hi>Hierographie;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(ſaith he) it is a more ſacred ſignification of the thing, or of
the perſon, which is not onely expreſſed, but alſo impreſſed with
Characters and Letters. He calls it ſacred, not onely becauſe the
invention in it ſelfe is ſacred, if you attribute it to the Egyptians;
or for that almoſt every thing was by the Pagans eſteemed holy,
and to be honoured with Divine Worſhip; But alſo, becauſe that
after the manner of myſteries, it conceales more then it diſcovers.</p>
               <p>He obſerves, that the Characters were painted, carved, or engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Letters written, either to forme ſillables, words, or
ſentences; Therefore that Author divides <hi>Hierography</hi> into Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick
and Symbole: whereof the firſt is taken for the picture,
as the other for the inſcription.</p>
               <p>The Italians call a <hi>Deviſe</hi> an <hi>Impreſe,</hi> deriving it from the verbe
<hi>Impre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dere,</hi> which ſignifies, to undertake; becauſe the ancient
Knights did beare upon their Sheilds a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> diſcovering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of their enterprize, which is called in Italian <hi>Impreſe,</hi> and
that doth alſo ſignifie a gallant and heroicke action. <hi>Palazzi</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
this word <hi>Deviſe</hi> (which he ſo cals in Italian) with that of
<hi>Liurée,</hi> but wee take it not according to that ſignification: For
<hi>Liurées</hi> are Badges, Liveries, or Cognizances, and a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe with us, but the Impreſe of the Italians, and in that ſence
<hi>Gabriel Simeoni</hi> takes it. Therefore I am of opinion, that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,</hi>
having the ſame end and ſcope, ought alſo to have the ſame
originall; And it is very probable, that this French word is taken
from <hi>Architecture:</hi> For when a Maſter Maſon, or Architect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
a building, he layes the Plat-forme and Deviſe of it, to
make the agreement; inſomuch, as from this word <hi>Deviſe</hi> (which
is the diſcourſe made upon the Structure of the whole edifice)
comes the term of <hi>deviſing a work,</hi> or <hi>deviſing a building;</hi> that is to
ſay, to lay the plot or deſign of it, and from thence, without doubt,
cometh this word <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which is, as an Image of our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or affections. Beſides, we have a more particular definition of
it, in this French word <hi>Deviſer;</hi> whereof <hi>Du Belley</hi> makes uſe,
when he ſaith <hi>Deviſer quelqu'vn,</hi> in ſtead of deſcribing or diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
peoples manners: And truly, a man cannot better depaint the
humour or paſſion of any perſon, then by making his <hi>Deviſe.</hi> It is
by it (as <hi>Palazzi</hi> ſaith) that we repreſent and diſcover humane
paſſions, hopes, feares, doubts, diſdaine, anger, pleaſure, joy, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108365:25"/>
care, hatred, friendſhip, love, deſires, and all other motions
of the ſoule. This I take to be the true Etimologie of the word,
which relates more to the purpoſe, and hath a more proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
then the <hi>Impreſe</hi> of the Italians, ſince they doe not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
generous deſignes by their <hi>Impreſes</hi> (as <hi>Bargagly</hi> ſaith) but
alſo all kinds of fancies, and other affections, which nevertheleſſe
the verb <hi>Imprendere</hi> doth not include in the Italian ſignification.</p>
               <p>As for the definition of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> (according to the Tract which
<hi>Ammirato</hi> hath compiled on this ſubject, and entituled, <hi>Il'Rota</hi>)
the true <hi>Deviſe</hi> is that which beareth the picture of ſome living

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
ſubject, with ſome words, ſentence, or proverb, which ſerve as
it were for its ſoule. Moreover, this Author adds, that a Deviſe is
no other thing, then an expreſſion of our mind, or a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>claration of
our thoughts, veyled nevertheleſſe under a knotty conceit of words
and figures: ſo that being too obſcure, and therefore unintelligible,
it rather merits the name of an <hi>Aenigma,</hi> then that of a <hi>Deviſe:</hi> He
ſaith further, that as ſome define Poetry to be a Philoſophy of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers:
that is to ſay, a delightful meditation of the learned: ſo
we may call a Deviſe the Philoſophie of Cavaliers.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Bargagli</hi> (who is one of the laſt Authors that hath ſeriouſly
handled this Art) checks this definition of <hi>Ammirato,</hi> and proves
it inſufficient, and not particular enough for a <hi>Deviſe;</hi> for that the
Embleme and Reverſe of Medals may be comprized in it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he defines it thus particularly; ſaying, <hi>That a Deviſe is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſsing
or connexion of figures and words, ſo ſtrictly united together,
that being conſidered apart, they cannot explicate themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
the one without the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to give you a definition, which may be eſſentiall, and more
appoſite for the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> it is needful to know the ſubſtance, true
forme and propriety of it: Let us therefore ſearch out theſe three
parts of the Deviſe in other Authors.</p>
               <p>The ſecret Academicks of <hi>Breſſe</hi> hold that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is a
myſticall medl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y of picture and words, repreſenting in a narrow
roome to all thoſe, whoſe fancies are not altogether blunted with
want of knowledge, ſome ſecret meaning, in favour of one or
more perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contile</hi> is of opinion, that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is a thing compounded of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and words, which diſcover ſome gallant and heroick deſign:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108365:25"/>
And (to explain himſelf) ſaith, that the term of <hi>Compoſition</hi> holds
the place of a <hi>Genus</hi> &amp; <hi>Predicament</hi> in this deſinition; That that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
or relation which diſcovers the Authors intention is to
be found in the figure, That the words repreſent a ſhort diſcourſe
in ſome ſort obſcure, the ſence whereof relates to the particular
quality of the figure, whereto it ſerves in liew of a ſoule: And that
the heroick deſign holds the rank of <hi>Difference,</hi> being here, as the
form that ſpecifies the true propriety of the <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargagli</hi> doth not altogether opprove of this definition, having
obſerved, that an eſſentiall part of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is therein wanting,
which is the <hi>Compariſon,</hi> and upon the word <hi>Similitude</hi> (he ſaith)
that Author doth not ſufficiently explicate himſelf; beſides that,
<hi>Deviſes</hi> are not alwayes framed for noble and magnanimous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
but indifferently to repreſent any paſſion of the mind.</p>
               <p>And according to <hi>Palazzi,</hi> a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is a means to expreſſe ſome
one of our more particular conceptions, by the Pourtraict of ſome
thing, which of it ſelfe hath ſome relation to our fancy, and by the
uſe of ſome words, which are proper to the ſubject. This Author
unfolds alſo the parts of this <hi>Definition,</hi> putting for the <hi>Genus,</hi> that
a <hi>Deviſe is a meanes to expreſſe ſome Conceptions,</hi> and for the <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
he addes, that <hi>the conceit of our fancie is expreſſed by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
and that this <hi>Figure is neceſſarily accompanied with a conciſe
Motto.</hi> By the terme <hi>of our fancie,</hi> he ſhewes that 'tis in this, that a
<hi>Deviſe</hi> differs from an <hi>Embleme,</hi> which is put for a general precept,
and not for any one particular perſon. <hi>By the figure of one thing and
not of divers,</hi> for that one only thing ſufficeth to make a perfect
<hi>Deviſe,</hi> though we may make uſe of two or three; ſo that this
number, ought never to be exceeded: nevertheleſſe, we may ſay
that by thoſe two or three, one onely thing is repreſented. He addes
thereto, this terme (<hi>of it ſelfe</hi>) to the end, that all helpe of colours
(which we uſe in Blazons) may be excluded. He addes further,
that <hi>it hath ſome relation;</hi> that it to ſay, it is not to be uſed without
reaſon; to the end, that Cyphers in particular be rejected, whereof
the figures ſerve to no other end then to repreſent the names of
the perſons for whom they are made. And laſtly he ſaith, that <hi>the
Figure muſt be accompanied with a Motto,</hi> to ſhew the difference
between a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and other repreſentations, where words are not
requiſite, as in <hi>Deviſes,</hi> where the Motto is an eſſentiall part, giving
the forme, and as it were the ſoule to the body. The <hi>Commentator</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:108365:26"/>
upon <hi>Paulus Iovius ſaith, That a Deviſe is a proper Badge of any
one, taken to ſerve as an ornament or declaration of ſome thing, which
he hath done, is to do, or is ſtill in doing</hi> But this (according to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagli</hi>
is proper to the Reverſe of <hi>Medals,</hi> where matters of Fact are
repreſented. But amongſt all the definitions. that of <hi>Bargagly</hi> is the
moſt exact, where he ſaith, That a <hi>Deviſe is no other thing, but a
particular and rare conceipt of wit, which is made by means of a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
or compariſon, having for that purpoſe the figure of ſomething
either naturall (ſo it be not humane) or artificiall, accompanied of
neceſſity with acute ſubtile, and conciſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part of this definition is taken for the <hi>Genus:</hi> For as
much as we may expreſſe thoſe conceptions by other meanes, by
geſtures or actions, words, characters, and letters. Therefore he
immediatly ſaith, that <hi>'tis by way of Compariſon,</hi> and therein is the
principall, and eſſentiall difference of the <hi>definition;</hi> ſince he doth
not allow that to be called a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which hath no ſimilitude or
compariſon, <hi>with the figure of ſome naturall or artificiall thing.</hi>
Theſe termes give us better to underſtand the difference of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition,</hi>
in explaining the way of the compariſon, which is drawn
from the nature or propriety of the thing figured; from whence,
(as from their proper place) ſimilitudes may be drawn, fit for our
purpoſe. Nevertheleſſe, he doth not allow us to make uſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
figure therein: But addes further, <hi>that the figure muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a conciſe and ſubtile Motto;</hi> to the end, we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
a perfect <hi>Deviſe,</hi> from that which hath no words (and
which for that reaſon merits not that name;) as alſo to diſtinguiſh
it from Emblemes. Reverſes of Medalls, and ſuch like inventions.</p>
               <p>This laſt definition ſeemeth to me the moſt exact and rigorous
of all: For to ſay the truth, to ſet forth or defend a perfect Deviſe,
it ought to have all thoſe conditions, according to the generall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the moſt learned Authors, And <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> (though hee
hath not alwayes been ſo exact an ob'ſerver of that Law, which in
Deviſes prohibits the uſe of any figure of humane body) is ſurely as
well excuſable therein, as thoſe Authors. who to good purpoſe, and
gracefully have made uſe of the Images of ſome falſe Divinities:
And as for the compariſon, I am cleer of opinion, that in it conſiſts
the greateſt ſlight and ſubtilty of this Art; Not but that very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<hi>Deviſes</hi> may be compoſed by other means: but they cannot
be perfect in all points, unleſſe they be formed upon ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:108365:26"/>
As for the Connexion of the words with the body of the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or geſture; there is one which we call <hi>Deviſe,</hi> by meanes whereof
the moſt pregnant wits diſcover to their like, all the motions of
their ſoule; their hopes, feares, doubts, diſdaines, affrights, anger,
pleaſure and joyes, anguiſhes and ſorrowes, hatred and love, deſires
and other heart-poſſeſſing paſſions. And by how much this way of
expreſſion is leſſe uſuall with the common people, by ſo much is it
the more excellent: For it is cleane another thing to expreſſe our
conceptions by a ſoule and a body, or (if you will) by figures and
words, then to manifeſt them by way of Diſcourſe. <hi>Bargagli</hi> ſaith
with good reaſon. That a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is nothing elſe, but a rare and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way of expreſſing ones ſelf; the moſt compendious, moſt
noble, moſt pleaſing, and moſt efficacious of all other that humane
wit can invent. It is indeed moſt compendious, ſince by two or
three words it ſurpaſſeth that which is contained in the greateſt
Volumes. And as a ſmall beame of the Sun is able to illuminate and

So a <hi>Deviſe</hi> enlightens our whole underſtanding, &amp; by diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the darkneſſe of Errour, fills it with a true Piety, and ſolid
Vertue. It is in theſe Deviſes as in a Mirrour, where without large
Tomes of Philoſophy and Hiſtory, we may in a ſhort tract of time,

the rules both of Morall and Civill life; tending alſo much to the

               <p>It is the moſt noble way, ſince the perſons, for whom <hi>Deviſes</hi>

is Divine, or Auguſt, as well on earth, as in the minds of men.
There are alſo ſome Princes, that have addicted themſelves to the
invention of <hi>Deviſes;</hi> of which there is no ſmall number amongſt
the Italians. And with the French, we find the great King <hi>Francis,</hi>
who (beſides the glorious Title of Conquerour) deſerved that of
Learnings Reſtaurator; and to whom the Family of the <hi>Eſtiennes</hi>
hath ſuch particular obligations: I meane <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who
daigned himſelf to become the Author of his own Deviſe, where
he cauſed a <hi>Salamander</hi> to be put into a fire with this Italian Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
NUTRISCO ET EXTINGO, <hi>i. e. I am nouriſhed by it, and
periſh by it,</hi> As <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> doth aſſure us.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the invention is pleaſing and efficacious, ſince to the
contentment of the ſight, it addes a raviſhing of the mind, and that
to the ſatisfaction both of the one and the other; it brings alſo
ſome profit and utility, which is the perfection of a work: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſurpaſſeth not onely all other Arts, but alſo Painting, ſince
this onely repreſenteth the body and exquiſite features of the face,
when as a Deviſe expoſeth the rare conceipts, and gallant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of its Author, far more perſpicuouſly and with more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then Phyſiognomy can, by the proportions and lineaments of
the face. It alſo much excelleth Poetry, in that it joyneth profit
with pleaſure; for as much as the moſt part of Poeticall inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
tend onely to adminiſter delight, when as none merit the Title
of true and perfect <hi>Deviſes,</hi> unleſſe they beget content with their
gentilleſſe, and yeeld profit by their Doctrine. For they not onely
expreſſe our beſt fancies, but alſo render them in a more delightfull
and vigorous manner, then that which is uſed either in ſpeaking or
writing. By the conceipts of the Deviſe, you declare the humour or

obligation ſigned with his hand, and ſealed with his ſeale, which
ſhould conſtraine him never to depart from the exerciſe of Vertue,
or as if it were a continuall renewing of the Proteſtation he hath
made, as well by the Figure, as by the Motto of his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The efficacie of a Deviſe ſpreads it ſelfe yet further externally,
ſerving as an example to others; inſomuch, as by its quaint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
and ſimilitudes, the Beholders are excited and enſlamed
to the ſearch of Vertue, and to propoſe to themſelves ſome ſuch
gallant deſignes. It is not onely uſefull to thoſe that are neere us,
but alſo to thoſe that are further off; yea to thoſe that ſhall come
after us, by leaving them a perpetuall remembrance of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of wit, &amp; comendable qualities of him that did compoſe or
bear it: Beſides, it is a means, much more proper then either proſe
or verſe, to make his friends or confidents underſtand his ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:

Subjects: for the length of Poems, and prolixity of great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
in bookes, often foyle the Readers, when as the whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a Deviſe is no ſooner looked upon, but conceived by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Reader. Moreover, a Deviſe preſents it ſelfe to the
eyes of all the world, in being placed upon Frontice-pieces of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
in Galleries, upon Armes, and a thouſand other places, whence
it becomes a delightfull object to the ſight, even whether we will
or no, and by that meanes we are in a manner obliged to learne the
Conception of him that bears the Deviſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, this Art is one of the moſt difficult, that any wit that
is acute, and rich in invention can practiſe (according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi>) and doth onely appeare facile to thoſe that
never did exerciſe it; or though they have made ſome Eſſayes of it,
I do aſſure my ſelfe, their <hi>Deviſes</hi> were not legitimate, nor their
Rules obſerved: For <hi>Deviſes</hi> are not like thoſe Veſſels of
Earth, which are made as ſoon as the Potter hath caſt them in
the Mould. Reade <hi>Hannibal Caro</hi> upon this ſubject, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108365:28"/>
writes his opinion to the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Vrbain</hi> in theſe very terms.
<hi>Deviſes are not things which are met with in books, or which are
made according to the ſudden fancie of an Author; they often require
long meditation, and it ſeldome happens that they are created by a</hi>
Caprichio, <hi>or an extravagant ſally of wit; 'tis true, ſuch are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
better then thoſe, that have made us pumpe a longer time;
but it belongs onely to the expert Profeſſors of that Art, to be thus
happy in the production of Deviſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My deſign in propoſing all theſe difficulties hath not beene to
withdraw good wits from theſe neat Eſſayes; but onely to ſhew
that this Art hath this common property with the beſt and moſt
excellent things of this world, that it is difficult, and not acquired
but by a long ſtudy.</p>

who hath ſhed his precious blood for his young ones: we may alſo
ſee him repreſented there by the Sun, the Rock and the Lilly.</p>
               <p>If the ſourſe of Deviſes have not ſo noble and ancient an Origin
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108365:28"/>
it muſt bee at leaſt derived from the Hieroglyphicks of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
who by the formes and figures of divers Animals, ſeverall
Inſtruments, Flowers, Hearbes, Trees, and ſuch like things accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
and compoſed together in ſtead of letters did deliver their
minds and conceptions. As when they would ſignifie a vigilant
man, they would figure the head of a Lyon; becauſe (according
to the Naturaliſts) that Beaſt ſleepes with his eyes open: When
they would expreſſe an acknowledgment of ſome good turn, they
painted a Stork, and ſo of others; whereof many examples are to
be ſeen in <hi>Orus Apollo</hi> (curiouſly tranſlated and commented on by
<hi>Cauſinus) Pierius, Porphirius,</hi> in the Fourth Book of Abſtinence
from Meat, and elſe-where. And that which Poets faign of <hi>Proteus</hi>
to have transformed himſelf ſometimes into a Lyon; ſometimes
into a Bull; ſometimes into a Serpent, fire, water, and into a
thouſand other ſhapes, proceeded without doubt from this, that
he was learned in the Science of the Hieroglyphicks: This King
(the moſt ancient of the Egyptians) did beare upon his head ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the head of a Lyon; ſometimes of an Oxe, or of ſome other
living Creature, to ſignifie the conception of his mind, and the
deſignes which he had in hand.</p>
               <p>Againſt this opinion of <hi>Andreas Palazzi, Bargagli</hi> affirmes,
that <hi>Deviſes</hi> have no more reſemblance with the Hieroglyphicks
of the Egyptians, then with thoſe of the holy Scriptures, which
expreſſe unto us the myſteries of Religion, and of all things ſacred;
nor doth he allow, their Origin to be derivded from Reverſes of
Medals; foraſmuch as they did onely ſerve to repreſent ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
thing, happening at that time, and had no deſigne to
manifeſt any affections, or humane paſſions; whereas the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</hi>
ſerveth to diſcover to our friends or equalls the conceipts
of our mindes, which wee would not have knowne to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>As for my ſelfe, I am of opinion, that as all Arts and Sciences
were not perfected in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir Infancy, but were completed by little
and little: ſo theſe Hieroglyphicks and Symboles were a Species
of that, which we call <hi>Deviſe:</hi> For it is certain, that under theſe
veiles lye hid ſome rare meaning, and that thoſe who firſt framed
<hi>Deviſes</hi> had no other Idea then onely that.</p>
               <p>But (ſetting aſide the Hieroglyphicks) doe we not ſee a great
reſemblance of Deviſes, even from the time of the Theban Warre

(which was 1300. yeares before the Incarnation of our Saviour)

theſe words written in Letters of Gold, JE BRUSLERAY LA
CITE, I will burn the City. The ſame Author (ſpeaking of <hi>Eteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>)
ſaith, That he bore upon his Buckler or Shield the picture of
an armed man, placing a Ladder againſt a wall, with theſe words,
MARS MESME NE ME POURRA REPOUSSER DE
LA MURAILLE, <hi>i. e. Mars himſelf ſhall not repulſe me from
the wall.</hi> We ſee in <hi>Pindarus,</hi> that in the ſame Warre, <hi>Amphiaraus</hi>
bote a Dragon on his Shield. <hi>Stacius</hi> likewiſe writeth, that <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Polynices</hi> bore, the one an Hydra, the other a Spynx. The
Ancients for the moſt part made uſe of theſe kind of <hi>Deviſes</hi> in
their Shields, and <hi>Cimiers,</hi> or habiliments for the head, which is
plainly ſeen in <hi>Virgil, Aeneid.</hi> 8. when he numbers the people that

with words, and a ſit compariſon, propoſing a gallant deſigne, and
a particular conceipt of wit. That alſo which <hi>Caeſar</hi> fixed on the
Gates of his Palace, cannot be altogether rejected by <hi>Bargagli,</hi>
though he approve it not: 'Twas an Oken Crown, which the
Romanes called <hi>Civique,</hi> to ſignifie, that his affection towards the
people was ſo tender, that he made more account of the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

That was at leaſt intelligible in thoſe times, when all the world

               <p>I confeſſe Medals are ſomwhat more different, in that their ſcope

<hi>Deviſes,</hi> let us obſerve with <hi>Paulus Jovius,</hi> that the ancient Knights

are to be found in all ages, as we may read in <hi>Palazzi's</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of <hi>Deviſes;</hi> Nevertheleſſe, I muſt not omit the ancient <hi>Deviſe</hi>
of a Prince ſprung from the race of the French Kings, which is of
<hi>Charles,</hi> brother to <hi>Lotharius</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> the firſt Duke of
<hi>Lorraine,</hi> that enjoyed that Dukedome ind pendent, and in reſpect
of that freedome and immunity, took for <hi>Deviſe</hi> an arme armed;

made uſe of them to adorne their Eſcotcheons, and to enrich their
Enſignes, Banners, Guidons, and Cornets, whereby their Troopes

               </p>
               <p>1. Firſt, a juſt proportion or relation of the Soule to the
Body.</p>
               <p>2. That it be not ſo obſcure, as to need a Sybill to interprete it;
nor yet ſo plain, as the common people may comprehend it.</p>
               <p>3. That above all things, it have a ſweet appearance, which
ſhall ſucceed, by inſerting therein either Stars, Sun, Moon, Fire,
Water, green Trees, mechanicall Inſtruments, diverſified, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
Beaſts and Birds: Howbeit, I am of opinion, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
figures are not receiveable in the bodies of <hi>Deviſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That it muſt not have any humane figure.</p>
               <p>5. And that the Motto (which is the ſoule of the <hi>Deviſe</hi>) be in
a ſtrange language, or other then that which is uſed in the Country,
where the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is made, to the end, that the intention of it bee a
little removed from common capacities.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Deviſe</hi> requires five Conditions more; whereof the firſt
is,</p>
               <p>1. That the Motto be conciſe or briefe, but not doubtfull; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that the ſoule ſhall be the more perfect, when it exceeds not
the number of two or three words, unleſſe it be of an Hemiſticke

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:108365:31"/>
2. It muſt be obſerved, that the body and ſoule (being very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat)

               <p>
                  <hi>RVſcelli</hi> (contrary to the opinion of <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi>) ſaith, that
the Motto of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought not to be called the Soule,
though the figure repreſent the body, As in all other ſubjects
where there is a body, it doth not follow that there is alwayes a
ſoule, as in Muſick we may ſay, the Notes repreſent the body, and
the words are correſpondent to the Soule: But if the <hi>Deviſe</hi> muſt
have a Soule, it would rather be the intention or ſignification then
the words.</p>
               <p>He diſtinguiſheth <hi>Deviſes</hi> into two kinds, the one with, and the
other without words.</p>
               <p>Figures were heretofore more commonly joyned to <hi>Deviſes</hi>
then Mottoes; becauſe the figures were known to every one, but
the Mottoes were not ſo generally underſtood.</p>
               <p>As for the opinion of thoſe, who affirme, that the Motto ought
not to be called Soule, <hi>Ruſcelli</hi> confirms it; for that, ſaith he, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it were to admit of Bodies without Soules, there being <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi>
which have no Motto's, and are nevertheleſſe approved of.
Notwithſtanding, he concludes, that it would be a very difficult
thing to aboliſh the uſe of theſe two termes, or that ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſpeaking of Body and Soule upon the ſubject of <hi>Deviſes;</hi>
though in truth the Motto be leſſe then the ſoule of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> then
is the intention or deſigne of an Author.</p>
               <p>According to the judgment of this Author, a <hi>Deviſe</hi> (to be true
and perfect) ought to have all the conditions following. It muſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108365:31"/>
be invented and compoſed with conveniencie, quaintneſſe, ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to the glory of its Author. Beſides, he addes, that the Figure
and the Motto are its neceſſary parts, the one to allure the eye, the
other to invade the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is alſo <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> his opinion in
his Fourth Conſideration? But beſides theſe Conditions, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall
parts, it muſt have ſome qualities, which are proper unto
it, cleerneſſe and brevity, and above all, this laſt is of neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
as well in the Body as in the Soule: For the parts of the
Body, or the ſubſtantiall Figures of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> muſt not be more
then two, nor muſt the words exceed the number of three, unleſſe
it be to make uſe of an half verſe, or at the moſt to accompliſh the
whole one: However ſome Authors are not ſo ſcrupulous, as not
to admit of a verſe and a half for their Motto, but ſurely thoſe are
not commended, nor do they ſucceed well: foraſmuch, as the
great number of words doth confound the Motto with the Figure
in ſuch ſort that thoſe Deviſes which are expoſed and born ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
at Tournaments or Maſques, would not be diſtinctly known
in this form by the Spectators. Wee may ſay the like of thoſe that
are uſed upon Standards, Enſignes, Cornets, and Coynes, in reſpect
of the little roome wherein they are comprized. Therefore when
the Motto is ſhort, the figure doth diſcover it ſelf more eaſily, and
the words are better retained in the memory; But if at firſt ſight,
they be not underſtood, the knowledge of them is found out by
meditation: And by reflecting the eyes of the mind upon the Idea,
which we there retaine, we come at laſt to penetrate the meaning
of the Author.</p>
               <p>For the preciſe number of one, two, or three figures, it muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of different kinds or Species, &amp; not of individuals: &amp; for a
perfect example, Ile propoſe to you the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of Card: <hi>De Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi>
where he hath many little Stars and a Comet, which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
take but for two figures, becauſe thoſe Stars without
number repreſent but one onely Species; As alſo in that of the
Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the two Swans which fight againſt an Engle, are
taken but for the nature of the Swan. It may happen notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that in the ſelf-ſame <hi>Deviſe,</hi> there be four Figures of ſeverall
Species, ſo well diſpoſed and with ſuch relation each to other,
that they may ſeeme eſſentiall to the ſubject, and by conſequence
equally neceſſary to the body of the Deviſe; And ſo we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
a Diamond upon an Anvile, with two hammers, beating
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108365:32"/>
upon it in the mid'ſt of the fire, for ſo much as then the number
of all thoſe inſtruments is determined by the unity of the action,
which is equally common unto them, and which only intends the
breaking of the Diamond.</p>
               <p>We are ſometimes obliged (as well for ornament as for better
expreſſion) to adde to the Figure Landſhip, Sky, Earth, other
Element, or ſuch like thing, yet without being ſaid to exceed their
preciſe number, As you may ſee in the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> where there are two
Columnes, the one of a Cloud, the other of Fire, with this Motto,
ESTE DUCES, <hi>Be ye the Conductors,</hi> having over all a Heaven
whoſe Sun reſted on the Column of the Cloud, and the Moon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that of Fire, to demonſtrate more plainly, that two Columnes
ſerved as a conduct to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the one in the day time,
the other in the night. This licence is permitted to Authors, which
abuſe it not, but uſe it with diſcretion; without which, there is
neither rule, nor Maxime ſo certain, that can ſucceed happily.</p>
               <p>Againſt the particular opinion, of <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> in his Fifth
Conſideration, excellent <hi>Deviſes</hi> may be met with, that reſult from
the conjunction of one Figure with one ſole word; ſo that they ſort
well together, and doe not ſignifie one and the ſame thing; As
in that known <hi>Deviſe</hi> of <hi>Feſtina lentè:</hi> For that were, to take two
ſervants, to the end, that one might ſerve the other, and not that
both ſhould ſerve the Maſter: For the Author of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> makes
choice of two ſubjects for his deſign: to wit, the figures and
words, that they may ſerve to convey to the eyes, eares, and thence
to the mind, the fancy or conception of him that compoſed or
beares the <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe figures that require a diverſifying with colours, are not to
be uſed, nor things that are hard to be diſtinguiſhed; in which rank,
we place certain hearbes which reſemble one another, as Parſley
and Hemlock, and ſome Birds, as the Linnet and the Sparrow.</p>
               <p>Thoſe figures of <hi>Deviſes</hi> are excellent, which are taken from the
Armes of ſome Family: to which, ſomething is either added, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed
or changed, according to the ſubj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſcelli</hi> condemns <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi> of ignorance in matter of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes</hi>
(though he be otherwiſe a learned Hiſtorian) and principally
for that he altogether rejecteth from <hi>Deviſes,</hi> the figure of humane
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108365:32"/>
body, though elſewhere he practiceth the contrary, by approving
ſome of that ſort inſerted in his owne Treatiſe, and (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
that of <hi>Lewis Sforce,</hi> where there is a Blackamore, who
with a Piſtoll kills a Lady; That which he himſelfe made for a
Lord, his particular friend, where there is an Emperour upon a
Triumphant Chariot with this Motto, SERVUS CURRU POR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TATUR
EODEM, <hi>the Slave is carryed by the ſame Chariot;</hi>
and the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> with many others, by
which we may well perceive, that that Law, which the Legiſlator
himſelfe makes no ſcruple to violate, is inconſiderable. Then is it
in vaine to pretend to exclude humane figures by authority, ſince
the Hieroglyphicks of the Egyptians, the Medalls, as well of the
Romans as Grecians, and finally all the Memorials of Antiquity,
are full of them; There is much leſſe reaſon to debarre the uſe of
them in <hi>Deviſes:</hi> For hwy ſhall it be lawfull to make uſe of the
Figures of Plants, living creatures, and mechanicall inſtruments,
or other things wrought by the hand of man, and ſhall yet be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to uſe the figure of the man himſelfe, which is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the moſt excellent of all? It is true, it would not be ſeemly
to inſert in a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> the figure of a man onely clad after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
faſhion, becauſe that would be too common, but it would be
more fit to repreſent him diſguiſed, as they doe in Maſques and
Mommeries. This Author approves of the figure of women in
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> whether they be repreſented naked or clothed, as alſo that
of <hi>Nymphs, Satyres, Termes,</hi> or ſuch like <hi>Divinities,</hi> which are
not uſuall in our ſight, and whereof the repreſentation may hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely

               <p>
                  <hi>Deviſes</hi> and <hi>Emblemes</hi> have this common reſemblance with
each other, that they may be indifferently uſed with or without
words; And their difference is taken from this, that the words of
the <hi>Embleme</hi> may demonſtrate things univerſall, and hold the
rank of morall precepts, which may as wel ſerve for all the word,
as for the proper author of the <hi>Emblem.</hi> This generall applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Motto, is a great error in a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which ought to be
particular, and the words thereof proper and ſutable to the perſon
onely, in whoſe favour the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is made. Nevertheleſſe, this
Condition hinders not, but that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> which hath been by me

already uſed, may alſo ſerve another day to expreſſe the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,

not conclude by this, that the <hi>Deviſes</hi> of Fathers ought to ſerve
his Children, unleſſe they beare the ſame Armes, have the ſame

               <p>The ſame Author pretends, that it is neither vice nor theft to

                  <hi>MOttoes</hi> require the ſame qualities, as the Figures, that is to

to the circumſtances of time and ſubject, whereupon the
<hi>Deviſe</hi> is made, as if it be onely to be ſeen at one time, at a Juſting
or Maske, then it muſt be plaine and intelligible, but if the <hi>Deviſe</hi>
be for a longer continuance, then we muſt adde ſome ornament,
grace or majeſty, to render it leſſe common.</p>
               <p>The amorous and morall ones ought not to be ſo obſcure (as
<hi>Jovius</hi> would have it) ſince they ought to be underſtood by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108365:33"/>

unleſſe the author deſire, that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> be not apprehended
by any perſon, but his Miſtreſſe, and ſo of others.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion with <hi>P. Jovius,</hi> that the Mottoes of <hi>Deviſes</hi>
which are for continuance, ought to ſpeak in a ſtrange language,
and the amorous ones and ſuch as are for Tournaments, Maskes
and Comedies, in a vulgar, or at leaſt a knowne tongue, ſince they
are but for a ſhort time, and are expoſed to the view of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.</p>
               <p>The plurality of words doth no leſſe incumber the apprehenſion
of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> then the great number of figures. It is a hard thing to

with delight.</p>
               <p>As for the connexion of the figure with the Motto, we muſt take
heed that the words doe not explicate the figure, but rather that
the figure lead the reader to the underſtanding of the words, and
that the Motto, diſunited from the figure, may not have any ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
As in the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of the Duke of Ferrara, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſo all

               <p>We muſt alſo take heed, not to make any mention of the figure
in the words, as if in the body of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> there be the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

               <p>The beſt Motto's are thoſe which have no verbe expreſſed, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

               <p>In <hi>Deviſes</hi> which we make for our ſelves, the author is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
either by the figure alone, or by the Motto alone, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more out of the figure and Motto both, that is to ſay, out of the
whole <hi>Deviſe.</hi> He is repreſented by the figure, when he feigneth
the figure to ſpeake for him, by ſaying that which he would ſay,
if he were in it its place; if there be two figures, the Author is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
by one alone, or by both, which is done more rarely.</p>
               <p>An Author expreſſeth himſelf q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aintly by the Motto, when he
feignes it to ſpeak, not to the figure, but to himſelf or to the people,
as in this, where there is the garden of <hi>Heſperides,</hi> the golden
apples, and the dragon dead before the doore, with theſe words,
YO MEJOR LAS GUARDARE, <hi>Ile guard them better:</hi> For
here he ſpeakes not to the figure, but of the figure to himſelf, by
the Motto; ſomtimes he declares himſelfe by ſpeaking to the
figure of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> as in that of the 2 Columnes alleadged before,
ESTE DUCES.</p>
               <p>When the Author himſelf is neither comprehended in the
Motto nor in the figure, we may then ſuppoſe, that he is excluded
the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and that he heares another ſpeaking to him, or giving
him adviſe: As in the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> where there is an arrow, which
being directly in the middle of the white, cleaves the pin with
this Motto, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſhoot thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be others, by which we can neither conceive whence
not to whom the Author ſpeaketh, whether within or without
the <hi>Deviſe;</hi> But it ſeemes that the whole <hi>Deviſe</hi> is indifferently
addreſſed either to the people, or to the Author, or to his Miſtreſſe,
or ſome other, as the Temple of <hi>Juno Lacinia,</hi> whoſe Motto is
JUNONI LACINIae.</p>
               <p>But the moſt perfect <hi>Deviſes</hi> are thoſe, whoſe bodies and ſoules
are taken as well for others, as for the Author. As the Chariot
of <hi>Phaeton</hi> with this Motto, MEDIO TUTISSIMUS IEIS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt goe ſecurely in the middle,</hi> that is to ſay, neither too high
not too low: For it ſeemes, the Author ſpeaks to himſelfe, with
a minde enclining to mediocrity, and by way of adviſe addreſſeth
himſelfe to others. Thus we ſee that this <hi>Deviſe</hi> is very excellent
in all her properties, having a very recreative figure, a gentile Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
an intention, whereof the morality is very profitable, and an

Author, it requires the fewer words, provided the reſt be eaſie to

and better accepted, which are taken out of ſome famous Author,
as <hi>Virgil, Horace, Catullus, Ovid, Lucan,</hi> or others. And tis in
that kind of borrowing, wherein the <hi>Deviſors</hi> dexterity and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
beſt appeares, when he diverts the ſenſe of an ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and applyes it properly to his owne intention.</p>
               <p>For the connexion of the Motto with the Figure, he conſents
with <hi>Ruſcelli,</hi> that we muſt take heed that the ſoule of the <hi>Deviſe</hi>
doe not ſerve ſimply to decipher the body, nor to explicate the
Picture onely, as if upon the Repreſentation of the City of <hi>Venice,</hi>
we ſhould write this word VENETIA. It is beſt then to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Motto of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> as the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition of a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,
and the Figure, as the <hi>Minor,</hi> from the conjunction of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108365:35"/>
which, will reſult the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> which is nothing elſe, but the
meaning of the Author: So that the Motto ought not to be the
Interpreter of the Body, nor that, the Interpreter of the Soule:
onely tis requiſite, that from the conjunction of the ſoule with the
body, the Reader may draw the myſticall ſenſe, and diſcover the
intention of the Author, as by Hieroglyphicks involved in the
two eſſentiall parts of a <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doth not deſire we ſhould be ſo ſuperſtitious obſervers
of the Rules, as to loſe the true and naturall ſubſtance of the
thing.</p>
               <p>He agrees in opinion with all the other Authors, that as the
ſoul of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought to be conceived with choice, ſtately and
ſignificant termes; ſo the body ought to have ſome ſweet appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and to conſiſt of a figure, neither too common or abject, nor
yet too far fetcht or monſtrous; Therefore we are not to admit of
any prodigious things nor unknowne beaſts, leſt wee make an
<hi>Anigma</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Deviſe:</hi> the <hi>Anigma</hi> being for the univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of people, and not in particular for itſelf.</p>
               <p>For the admiration, which a <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought to beget in the mind
of the Reader, doth not depend upon extraordinary figures; but
rather upon the connexion of the ſoule with the body, which
ought to be ſeperately intelligible, in ſo much as the reſult or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the two things may produce a third, mixt with the one
and the other.</p>
               <p>As for the cleernes, which <hi>Reſcelli</hi> requires in a <hi>Deviſe.</hi> This
Author ſaith, that, as the Comedy ought to pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe both the eyes
and eares of the common people, as well as of the learned: So the
<hi>Deviſe</hi> ought not to be ſo much removed from the knowledge
of the vulgar, but that it may give content to all; Yet muſt we
take heed that we uſe not things too vile and abj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct, as a Kettle, a
Frying-pan, a dripping-pan a Chaſing-diſh, pair of bellows, and
ſuch like inſtruments.</p>
               <p>The conjunction and copulation of the Body with the Soule is
very handſome, when it is made by compariſon, either of its like,
greater, leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, or contrary. And this Compariſon is not onely
made with this Particle (SIC) or ſuch like, but alſo by leaving it
out, and to be underſtood with far more grace. Wherefore
<hi>Bargagli</hi> hath reaſon to baniſh all particles of ſpeech, which
ſerve to the reduction of a compariſon.</p>

But above all, he commends the encounter of words, alike in
termination of ſound, and unlike in ſignification, as in this Motto,

oppoſite to the nature of any ſubject, as ſweet to bitter, but alſo
every thing that is different, though it be not contrary, as in the
precedent example.</p>
               <p>Some may be invented, by alluding to the proper names of
perſons, for whom they are made, but certainly ſuch are hard to
be met with, in ſo much, that for the moſt part, a <hi>Rebus</hi> or ſome
idle fancie is made inſtead of a good <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which the Author
thought to have falne upon: you may ſee many ſuch examples
in <hi>Paulus Jovius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we put ſome figure in the body of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which of it
ſelfe is not ſufficiently ſignificative, we may adde the name, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Frontiſpiece of the Temple of <hi>Juno Lacinia,</hi> we may put
this Motto, JUNONI LACINIae, upon that of mount <hi>Sion</hi> this
other, MONS SION: ſo likewiſe upon the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi>
and others. But if theſe Mottoes (which are not of the body of
the <hi>Deviſe</hi>) doe not pleaſe, we may diſtinguiſh the Temples
(which are the hardeſt figures to know) by the image of that god
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> goddeſſe to whom they are dedicated: And if we feare to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
or perplex the body of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> with the portraicts of
<hi>Deities,</hi> we may decipher them, by the characters which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
or by ſuch creatures as were anciently ſacrificed unto
them. Thus we know the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> by the <hi>keyes,</hi> that of
<hi>Jupiter</hi> by an <hi>Eagle,</hi> and that of <hi>Saturne</hi> by a <hi>Sythe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the onely meanes, that I approve for the diſtinction
of Temples; As for the inſcription of the proper name, this uſage
was not allowable, but in thoſe times when painting was yet ſo
groſſe, that the figures of Animals needed the name of the kind to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108365:36"/>
be knowne by, as is yet to be ſeene upon ſome old Tapeſtries and
Pictures.</p>
               <p>When we uſe a Motto without a Figure, we ought not to call
it the ſoule of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> but rather a facetious conceipt, a witty
ſaying, a Proverb, a Sentence; as thoſe pretty conceipts, dictions
or ſentences, which <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> the ſeven Wiſe men of Greece,
and many other Morall Philoſophers have delivered. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may we make a Picture without a Motto, as a <hi>Venus</hi> with
ſhackles at her feet, a <hi>Jupiter</hi> with three eyes, a <hi>Janus</hi> with two
faces, and ſuch like <hi>Caprichio's,</hi> however ſignifying ſomething;
in which caſe we doe not ſay we have made a body without a ſoul,
but rather a picture, a phanſie, or ſuch like thing.</p>
               <p>Of neceſſity the <hi>Deviſe</hi> muſt have one part cleere, and the other
obſcure, ſo that it be without contradiction: For as in Poetry,
eſpecially Comicall,<note place="margin">The French Comedies are all in Verſe.</note> which is intended for all ſorts of people, the
greater part of the Auditors doe eaſily judge it to be Verſe, and
not Proſe; They know very well the ſound and cadence of
Rythmes, and the ſenſe of ſome parts of the Poeme, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them moſt: But as for the conceited imaginations of the
Poet, the high-towring conceptions of his fancy, the deſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ption
of paſſions, the force of reaſoning, the choice of termes, and the
ſubtility of elocution: theſe are not diſcovered, but onely to the
eyes and eares of the more learned O ators, and Poets acquainted
with that kind of Dramatick Poeme. In like manner the Author
of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is not obliged to frame it ſo, that it be underſtood by
every one equally; it ſhall ſuffice that the more ſimple doe know
the body of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and that they cleerly diſcerne it to be the
figure of a Fiſh, Bird, Horſe, Tree, Temple, Bridge, or ſuch like
thing, either naturall or artificiall, for that onely is capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
their ſight; whilſt the learned feaſt their underſtandings
with the conſideration of the propriety of the creatures repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and of the uſage of the things artificiall, until they have found
out the true ſubject of the compariſon, and diſcovered the Authors
deſigne, whoſe invention and ſubtility they will doubtleſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
               <p>The body of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> is borrowed either from Nature or Art,
or from Events: From Nature you may take tame or wild beaſts,
birds and Fiſhes: from Art you may borrow the inſtruments of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108365:36"/>
all kinds of Arts, Veſſells, Obeliſques, Triumphant Arcks, Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
Mechanicall tooles, and all that depends on the hand of
man. The bodies which are taken from Art are not (in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
opinion) ſo beautifull, nor always and in every part ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
as thoſe which are borrowed from Nature, who (to ſay
truth) is Mother and Miſtreſſe of all things, beſides her juriſdiction
comprehends all ſorts of ſubjects, and yeelds us a larger feild of
inventions. As for events, they are divided into fabulous and
hiſtoricall: from the fable we derive all the fictions of Poets, the
<hi>Pegaſus, Argus, Tantalus,</hi> the Rivers of <hi>Hell, Bellerophon,</hi> the
garden of <hi>Heſperides,</hi> and other imaginations of fabulous anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
And from Hiſtory we borrow the figures which depend
upon the ordinance of inſtitution of man, as the <hi>Temple of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Faith,</hi> the
head of a ſlave with his hat on, King <hi>Hierous</hi> dog, who threw
himſelfe into the fire after the death of his Maſter, and ſuch like
figures. <hi>Ludovico Dominichi</hi> conſents in opinion with <hi>Paulus
Jovius</hi> in every thing.</p>
               <p>See her the precepts which I have learnt from theſe worthy
Seamen; diſdaine not to fear alſo the Arguments of our Pilot, and
by the way examine the reaſons of ſome other Authors, as of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazzi,
Fraſtaglato Intronato, Alexandro Farra, Aruigîo,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the end that you may the more freely reſolve to follow

of <hi>Deviſes.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The opinion of <hi>Bargagli.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought to be almoſt like Poeſie, or rather as a thing
nobly vulgar, in ſuch ſort that it may be underſtood without
difficulty and with delight, not only by the learned, but alſo by all
thoſe, who (beſides a good comon underſtanding) have moreover
the knowledge as well of things naturall as artificiall, and of the
languages which we uſe in the Motto; It importeth not much if
Idiots or groſſe <hi>Ignoramuſſes</hi> doe not at all conceive them, ſince
ſuch dainties are not intended for vulgar appetites.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> ought not to be taken out of thoſe Arts or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108365:37"/>
liberall Science, whereof the entire knowledge is reſerved to the
Profeſſors or Artizans themſelves, unleſſe we be obliged for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence,
to frame a <hi>Deviſe</hi> in the behalf of one that hath a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
knowledge of the Art of Science, from whence the <hi>Deviſe</hi>
ſhould be taken.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the learned <hi>Bargagli</hi> is of opinion, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
or ſimilitude is ſo neceſſary to a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> that the mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
joy or take delight therein, if the Similitudes be wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſcelli</hi> in his 6. Article alſo admits the Compariſon as a
part, wherein conſiſts the ſubtilty of a perfect <hi>Deviſe,</hi> for que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe
no ſeemly ones can be invented without comprehending
any Compariſon; But I intend here to propound the rules and
modell of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> compleated in all points.</p>
               <p>And to that end we firſt baniſh the humane figure from this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
compariſon, for as much as we cannot make a proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of a man, with a man, but it muſt be taken from things
different either in the <hi>Genus</hi> or the <hi>ſpecies.</hi> I know it well, that
many have made uſe of the figures of <hi>Pagan Gods,</hi> when they have
taken the ſubject of their <hi>Deviſes</hi> out of the Fable, and truely
thoſe figures doe reaſonable wel to adorne the body of a <hi>Deviſe;</hi>
yet tis better not to uſe them at all, according to the reaſons of
<hi>Rargagli.</hi> He ſaith then that a man of Judgment, will never
ground the conceipt of a true and ſolid thing upon that which is
purely feigned and imaginary; ſeeing that we pretend with ſo
much ardour, to eſtabliſh the conceptions of our braine, and to
make them paſſe for approved in all mens opinions.</p>
               <p>He adds further, that is muſt be known and expreſſed as wel by
figures as by words, and the figures ought to be taken for a proof
of the conception, which is formed upon the relation or ſimilitude
of a certaine and true quality, which they have in themſelves; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that the object of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is to treat onely of things unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to clear and prove them; And becauſe the moſt noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
of humane wit are of that nature, we ought to exclude
all fictions, and never to make uſe of them in <hi>Deviſes. Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celli,
Contile, André Palazzi,</hi> and <hi>Alexandro Farra,</hi> admit
of no humane figure, unleſſe it be fabulous, monſtrous or hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
becauſe otherwiſe they beleeve, that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> would reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Medall.</p>
               <p>Some other Doctors do not think fit that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> be deprived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108365:37"/>
of ſo noble and excellent a thing, as the figure of a man, in favour
whereof they urge many ſeeming reaſons, which I omit the more
willingly, becauſe I doe not intent to perſwade others to that
which I approve not my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fraſtaglato Intronato</hi> permits in in caſe of neceſſity, whereto
we may anſwer, that things done by neceſſity, ſeldome or never
ſucceed well, beſides it happens rarely, that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> receives any
conſtraint, having a field of ſo great extent, as all thoſe things
which Art and Nature doe afford.</p>
               <p>Tis true, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves, that we may take compariſons from
the humane body, but he doth not affirme them to be equally good
with thoſe which are borrowed elſewhere. The very Poets take
no Compariſons from the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> ſo long as fancy affords
them others of a different. So the Author that frameth a <hi>Deviſe,</hi>
ought to ground it upon the moſt noble and ſure <hi>Baſis</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
that can be taken from a different <hi>Species.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Author which compiled a diſcourſe at Rome upon the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</hi>
of the Academicks, called <hi>Renovati,</hi> is yet more rigorous, in
not admitting of any part of humane body, nor hands, nor armes,
nor heart, but ſurely that is too great a ſcruple: For what grace can
a hammer ſtriking upon an Anvile have, unleſſe a hand be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it? And how can we repreſent the winds (which ſerve for
bodies of very excellent <hi>Deviſes</hi>) if we be not permitted to adde a
head to them? it were indeed to incur a great inconvenience, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a certain <hi>Pedant</hi> vaunting a skil in that Myſtery, as being profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of the 2 beſt languages in the world, and reputed to have ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
a memory, that it conſumed all his judgement, as the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph
doth witneſſe, which is already prepared for him before his
death. This univerſall Doctor then, cauſing a <hi>Deviſe</hi> to be drawn
by an excellent Limmer (who underſtood as little the art of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them, as theend wherto they tended) diſcovered unto him his
intent to have the body of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> drawn, wherof the Motto was,
Quo FLANTE CORUSCANT, &amp; the figure was burning coals
upon a Chafing-diſh: And becauſe it wanted the blowing of
wind, (for the expreſſion of which he was much troubled) the
Painter propoſed the adding of a little face, as it is uſuall in ſuch
caſes. <hi>Apagè, Apagè,</hi> ſaid this great <hi>deviſor,</hi> I will have no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
face; the Artificer in a merry and joviall humour, anſwered
him ſmilingly, Sir, I know no way more fit to repreſent your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108365:38"/>
intention, unleſſe you apply unto it, the other part of the body
that hath no face, and yet makes wind; At laſt he concluded to
ſet a paire of bellowes unto it. Is not that (I pray) a figure of a
goodly apparence and proportionate to a gallant and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
deſigne? nor is it for that theſe figures have no relation one
with another, nor are derived from the ſame art of Kitchinry,
(well knowne to the Vniverſities.) I give you this example, to
let you ſee, that that man is oft-times deluded that uſeth too much
ſubtility; And this paſſage is the more credible, in regard I had it
from the ſelf ſame Artificer, who telling me of it, did then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
that the Doctor had not to that day paid him for his labour,
according to his promiſe. I had not mentioned this conceit, if
the ſubject we handle had not engaged me to it. I could rehearſe
a prank, no leſſe unjuſt, then the other ridiculous, but that I have
already inſinuated it under the title of <hi>Ruſcelli's</hi> opinions, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the condition that ought to be obſerved in appropriating to
ones ſelf the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of another Author: It is there where I have
made mention of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which my late Uncle <hi>Robert Eſtien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
did invent in honour of the Duke of <hi>Roſny,</hi> ſince Duke of <hi>Suilly,</hi>
grand Maſter of the Artillery, by whom hee had the honour to be
beloved, it was then received with ſo generall applauſe, that it
was judged worthy to be eternized in Gold and braſſe, and to ſay
truth, it was ſtamped upon all the Ordnance that were caſt at that
time in the Arcenall, embroydred upon the Officers Caſſocks, and
upon the ornaments of the ſhops of Artillery: It is not poſſible
therefore that this new <hi>Deviſor</hi> ſhould be ignorant as well of the
name of the firſt Maſter, as of the comon uſe of this <hi>Deviſe,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
by diſſembling it, he did appropriate to himſelf the invention
of it, and was ſo bold, as to give it as an originall, wholly and
without alteration, to another Lord that had the ſame command
among the great Officers, of that Crowne, and who in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
held the place of its rightfull poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Motto's are abſolutely neceſſary in a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> though ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have held the contrary, for according to their opinion the
<hi>Deviſe</hi> being a kind of Metaphor (which is in a maner nothing elſe
but a Compariſon) it needs but one ſubject changed into another;
But theſe Authors are deceived in this point, ſince the figure of an
Animal, plant, or ſuch like ſubject, is of it ſelf indifferent to the
ſignification of the particular qualities that the thing repreſented
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108365:38"/>
may have; In ſo much that it ought to be determined by the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to ſome one of its qualities, that is to ſay, to that, which the
Author intends to attribute to the perſon, of whom hee makes the
<hi>Deviſe.</hi> From thence it commeth that the greateſt confuſion or
difficulty in underſtanding ſome <hi>Deviſes</hi> ariſeth from the bodies
being altogether naked an deſtitute of words, which ſhould
diſtinguiſh their different proprieties, whence the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

made uſe of for the expreſſion of triviall or vulgar fancies, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
being onely to declare virtuous thoughts or heroicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
with grace and ſubtility; And it is to the end that this kind
of conceptions may be held worthy to ſpring and grow in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſouls by the power and efficacie which <hi>Deviſes</hi> have to raviſh
and excite the moſt noble ſpirits, which way ſoever they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them; and with ſo much the more eaſe, by how much
they ſhall diſcover the rarity and gentilleſſe of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> in the
conception.</p>
               <p>The efficient cauſe, is the wit or underſtanding, diſpoſed to know
the relations, ſimilitudes and conformities which meet in the
things figured; there being nothing in this world, but hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108365:39"/>
reſemblance or relation, with other, though the ſubjects
be more or leſſe unlike.</p>
               <p>It is not needfull to produce any other reaſon for the formall
cauſe of a <hi>Deviſe:</hi> becauſe we doe not ſay that the Motto is the
forme, nor have we call'd it the Soule, as <hi>Paulus Jovius</hi> and others
have done; Seeing that as the proper and ſubſtantiall forme of a
living Creature is the Soul, and not the breath, or tone of the voice,
which he uttereth in token of his inward meaning, and to expreſſe
his affections or paſſions: So is it very certaine that the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
or compariſon is the forme of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
its life and ſoule. And the Motto is but as the breath, or
tone of the voice, which declares the nature and propriety of
the thing, whence the compariſon is taken. Therefore we may
ſay that the motto (added to theſe foure cauſes) is the Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
cauſe, which is made uſe of, to diſcover (by vertue of the
words) the proper quality of the figure, and by diſcovering it to
diſtinguiſh the other qualities, that have their being in it; In ſo
much as the Motto (conſidered alone by it ſelfe) by no means
makes a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> as the Commentatour upon <hi>Jovius</hi> would have
it, who holds that a <hi>Deviſe</hi> may be framed of a Motto without a
body, and of a body without a Motto.</p>
               <p>The end of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> (according to <hi>Ammirato, Contile, Aruigio,</hi>
among the Academicks of <hi>Breſce, Johan, André Palazzi,</hi> the <hi>Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam</hi>
Doctor and <hi>Academico Renovato</hi>) is nothing elſe but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
covertly by meanes of figures and words a conception of
humane wit. And ſome of theſe Authors ſay that it ought to be
expreſſed in ſuch ſort that it be intelligible to the learned, and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from the illiterate.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe, I am reſolved to make a ſmall digreſſion; for
it ſeemes to me, that all <hi>Deviſes</hi> (as to the facility and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of them) ought not to be handled in that manner. <hi>Paulus
Jovius</hi> and ſome others doe diſtinguiſh them into Amorous and
Heroick, and will, that under theſe two kinds, divers <hi>Species</hi> be
contained. And truly there is no doubt, but that there are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſorts of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> as we have paſſions and inclinations. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is needfull to diſtinguiſh them, and to obſerve what we
have already ſaid, That onely ſome <hi>Deviſes</hi> ought to be knowne
and intelligible to every one, and that others ought to be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
or leſſe common, according to the circumſtances of time,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108365:39"/>
place, and perſons for whom they are made, as if they be for
Tournaments, Maſques, or ſuch like, I am of <hi>Ruſcelli's</hi> opinion,
that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought then to be cleere and intelligible to all, and
that the Motto may be in a vulgar tongue, provided the words be
well choſen, emphatick, or ſignificative and briefe. The like may
be ſaid of Amorous <hi>Deviſes,</hi> unleſſe the Author would have his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
onely diſcovered to his Miſtreſſe or particular friends, in
which caſe the <hi>Deviſe</hi> may be made obſcure, and he that bears it
may reſerve the expoſition to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The morall <hi>Deviſes,</hi> which are not made for any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but onely for inſtruction, ought to be ſo contrived, that every
one may receive ſome profit by them: Not that I approve the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes
of theſe to be in a vulgar language, but I could wiſh them to
be taken out of ſome good well-knowne Author, and the leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
that can be met with; for if they be put in a vulgar tongue,
for the foreſaid reaſon of <hi>Ruſcelli, (viz.</hi>) to the end that every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered
perſon may underſtand them; that would deprive us of
another benefit, which a moral <hi>Deviſe</hi> ſhould bring with it, which
is, to be underſtood by the generality of men, and in that caſe,
ſtrangers (though learned) will not comprehend it. Therefore it
is better ſome of the unlearned ſhould be deprived of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of your <hi>Deviſe,</hi> (by which alſo they would not be much
edified) then that all the learned men of forraigne parts ſhould be
debarred from the knowledge of it. I know well that an Author
may compoſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> of Love, Morality, or ſuch like ſubjects,
wherewith to adorne the chimney-peeces, Cloſets, or Galleries
of his houſe, with intention to have them underſtood by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patriots;
but this reaſon hinders not, the Mottoes being in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
language, becauſe ſtrangers (that ſhall viſit you out of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
to ſee rarities) will take as much pleaſure in contemplating
the acuteneſſe of your wit, as in beholding the magnificence of
your buildings, and your countrymen will receive the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and no leſſe profit, when they ſhall be entertained by
you with the expoſition of the words.</p>
               <p>We may ſay as much of thoſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> which are made for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
Enſignes, Standards and Guidons, in regard we doe not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
beare armes at home, bat rather make them known in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
parts, where we ought to be very free in making our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
appeare, and to denounce ſome kind of terrour by the gallant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108365:40"/>
deſigns of our <hi>Deviſes.</hi> And for that which concerns the <hi>Deviſes</hi>
of Kings and all ſoveraigne Princes, it is of abſolute neceſſity,
that the Motto's (if intended for ſeemly &amp; profitable) be either in
Latine or Greek, to the end that the enterprizes or heroicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
of thoſe Princes (whoſe virtues are very exemplar to all
people) may be underſtood by the generality, by making uſe of
thoſe ancient languages, which cannot receive any ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the vulgar ones doe, which (whilſt the Academicks ſtrive
to reforme) the comon people doe dayly corrupt, by the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſtrange Idiomes. And wee may with ſo much the leſſe
difficulty, uſe theſe two Miſtreſſe tongues, by how much it is
moſt certaine, that the body of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> taken either from nature
or art, hath the ſame proprieties and uſe in all Countries. I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of opinion that we ought not to make uſe of my other language
in ſuch <hi>Deviſes</hi> as are made in theſe daies for the Coins or Stamps
of Princes and Communities, ſince they ſerve inſtead of reverſes
of ancient Medalls, and are ſtamped in laſting mettall, to ſerve as
tradition and hiſtoricall memory to poſterity.</p>
               <p>A perfect <hi>Deviſe</hi> (as we have already ſhewed) takes its eſſence
from the Compariſon or Metaphor: theſe two figures of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
are onely employed in diſcourſe, to give ſome light to thoſe
things, which of themſelves have none: and if they have any, to
render it more perſpicuous and delightfull. Beſides, they ſerve to
make themſelves intelligible, not onely to the learned, but to all
indifferently, and even to thoſe, whoſe underſtandings are not ſo
cleere-ſighted as otherſ, to conceive the nature and eſſence of
things, and tis by this meanes, that thoſe clouds are diſſipated</p>
               <p>As for the efficient cauſe of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> I may ſay, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the attaining of like ſubjects, and the conformity or relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is found amongſt divers things, may eaſily be effected,
by a Wit that hath great lights, as well of nature, as of ſtudy or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
of Arts and Sciences, or that is but meanly exerciſed in
the propriety of many works and effects of nature.</p>
               <p>Now the reſemblances which meet in things, are either intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
occult, naturall and eſſentiall, or otherwiſe extrinſecall, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
artificiall, knowne and accidentall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargagli</hi> (conſidering the compariſon, as an eſſentiall part of a
<hi>Deviſe</hi>) doth not call thoſe that are deprived of it by the name of
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> but conceits rather, or figurate ſentences, in which rank
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108365:40"/>
he placeth that of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. of the two Pillars, with this
Motto, PLUS ULTRA, and that of pens, with theſe words,
HIS AD AETHERA, as much as to ſay, that <hi>by the meanes of
great Learning, we acquire an everlaſting fame,</hi> becauſe he doth
not perceive any compariſon in theſe: But this is to be ſomewhat
too rigorous, and by ſubjecting our ſelves wholly to that rule, we
loſe many excellent conceptions of wit, which might by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes be effected. For this reaſon I grant that <hi>Deviſes</hi> made
by Compariſon or Metaphor are the richeſt and moſt excellent.
And accordingly we ſhall treat of them at large, yet without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
or condemning the others, when they are acute, gentile
and magnanimous, and when they doe not treſpaſſe againſt the
other generall Rules, approved by all Authors.</p>
               <p>As for the Hieroglyphicks of the Egyptians, (which may be
made uſe of in perfect <hi>Deviſes</hi>) we muſt have a care not to uſe them
as ſimply as the Egyptians did, foraſmuch as from those ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of things, which are not proper or naturall, wee cannot
draw any true ſimilitude or compariſon; beſides, they diſcover not
any intention or enterpriſe that they had, but onely ſomething al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, as by the figure of a Hat, they would ſhew, that they
had enfranchiſed a ſlave, or ſome other perſon, for a reward: Even
ſo by giving of an Oaken Crowne to a Soldier, they ſignified that
he had ſaved the life of a Citizen. Moreover, the greateſt part of
theſe Hieroglyphicks are grounded upon the ancient Cuſtomes
and Ceremonies of their Religion, which is now (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked)
altogether aboliſhed by the light of faith, or is at leaſt known
at this time, but to ſome few perſons, whereas a <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought to
be underſtood by many. I admit that ſubjects taken from Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,
and conſidered according to their nature, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the inſtitution of men, are proper for <hi>Deviſes.</hi> As if you
conſider a hat, as it is an inſtrument invented to keep off the ſunne
and raine, you conſider it purely according to its nature; but if you
take it for a figure of liberty, you ſuppoſe then that either God or
man have already impoſed this ſignification upon it. Hence it
commeth, that to artive (with our Author) to the perfection of
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> and to expreſſe the conceptions of our mind, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo proper, ſo gentile, ſo powerfull, nor ſo ſpirituall, as thoſe
ſimilitudes and relations, which we diſcover, walking in the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
fields of the wonderfull ſecrets of nature, and qualities of
things, as alſo of the proper effects of our intentions, to find therein
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108365:41"/>
the correſpondencie of qualities naturall, and uſage of things ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall,
with your own thoughts; and herein conſiſteth as well all
the grace of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> as the skill of him that makes it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Reverſes of Medalls, and the difference between them &amp; Deviſes.</head>
               <p>IN the Reverſes of Medalls, we may make uſe of Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,
Fables, Hiſtories, and Cuſtomes of the Ancients, becauſe
Medalls are only made to eternize, by the means of the metals of
Gold, Silver, braſſe and copper, the memory of the heroick Arts
of Emperors, Kings, Commonwealths, States, and ſuch illuſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and praiſe-worthy perſons, as well by their own vertue, as by
the eminencie of their quality; Therefore I am of opinion, that
ſome of thoſe things may be permitted in the <hi>Deviſes</hi> of Coines or
ſtampes, which have a great affinity with Medals, and wherein
we ought not to be ſo ſcrupulous, as in other <hi>Deviſes,</hi> nor ſo
much ſubject our ſelves to the rules of the Italians, who have not
written of the <hi>Deviſes</hi> of Stampes or Counters, the uſe whereof is
elſewhere leſſe knowne then in France: And tis perhaps for that
reaſon that my deceaſed Uncle <hi>Robert Eſtienne</hi>(who in his time
was much eſteemed for the invention of <hi>Deviſes</hi>) was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſo ſtrict an obſerver of their rules. And yet for the Reverſe
of Medalls, in rejecting the Fable and ſome other inventions of
the Ancients, we may make uſe of the things themſelves, and
there is no doubt, but they would ſucceed far better.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Deviſe</hi> differs from a Medall or Reverſe, in this, that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</hi>
is a declaration of the thoughts by way of Compariſon, taken
from the propriety of naturall or artificiall things; whereas a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
is generally, but a memoriall of things which are done and
paſt, evidenced by figures, which ſimply repreſent the fact, though
there be ſome, which diſcover the quality of the wit; Beſides, the
<hi>Deviſe</hi> is to demonſtrate a rare and particular intent, not yet
effected; But the Reverſe is to preſerve the memory of ſome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
act at heived by him, whoſe picture is on the other ſide:
So that the <hi>Deviſe</hi> regards onely the future, and the Reverſe the
time paſt. And againe, a perfect <hi>Deviſe</hi> ought not to admit any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
or humane figure, be it fictitious or fabulous, but in Reverſes
both the one and the other may be received according to ancient
cuſtome. Whereof ſee Examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:108365:41"/>
Nor doe I think that theſe rules be altogether neceſſary in the
<hi>Deviſes</hi> of Coines, in reſpect of the reſemblance they have with
Medalls, for we ſee many wherein the illuſtrious Acts of Kings are
graven, and many others wherin the figures of falſe gods are made
uſe of to good purpoſe; as the <hi>Deviſe</hi> which my deceaſed Uncle
made, after the late King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great of <hi>France,</hi> had reduced
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to reaſon: The Duke (who thought he had
laid hold of a good opportunity to quarrell with the ſaid King du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> thereby to poſſeſſe himſelfe of the
Marquiſate of <hi>Saluſſes</hi>) cauſed Coynes or money to be ſtamped,
where there was a <hi>Centaure</hi> trampling a Crowne Royall under
his feet, with this word, OPPORTUNE, but ſoone after, that
invincible Monarch made him repent himſelfe of his enterprize,
and derided his fooliſh preſumption, when he poured his Forces
into his Country, and in an inſtant (forcing all his Townes) made
himſelfe Maſter of the whole Province, and conſtrained the Duke
to have recourſe to his mercy. After that glorious victory, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballance
the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of the Duke, my Uncle invented this for
the ſtamps of the King about the yeare 1601. whereon we might
ſee a <hi>Hercules</hi> ſubduing a <hi>Centaure,</hi> with this word, OPPOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUNIUS:
And truly this kind of encountring of <hi>Deviſes</hi> is
handſome, and I beleeve <hi>Bargagli</hi> himſelfe would approve it, for
the differences that follow, they, may eaſily be admitted in the
<hi>Deviſe</hi> of <hi>Coynes,</hi> to wit, that Hieroglyphicks have no place in
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> but in Medalls: that in theſe the figures ought not to be
named, as they are in others. And that in <hi>Deviſes</hi> the words are
abſolutely neceſſary, but not in Medalls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargagli</hi> doth not admit of any figures of Temples, Triumphant
Arcks, or Amphitheaters, though they are effects of Art. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
I am of opinion with <hi>Scipione Ammirato,</hi> that they are
very gracefull in <hi>Deviſes,</hi> when they are rightly applyed, and
ſo that the Temples be eaſily knowne of themſelves, without need
of beating their names inſcribed.</p>
               <p>Contrary to the opinion of <hi>Ammirato</hi> and <hi>Contile, Bargagli</hi>
would neither have <hi>Deviſes</hi> drawn from Hiſtory, Events, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And <hi>Fraſtaglato</hi> concurs with <hi>Contile,</hi> ſo that the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be made by compariſon or ſimilitude, and that the Hiſtory,
Event or Fable be generally knowne. See <hi>Bargagli's</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:108365:42"/>
As for me (ſaith he) I can neither approve of the Fable, Events,
nor Hiſtory; I cannot beleeve that another mans fancie can be
perfectly expreſſed by the proofe of a particular action, which
perhaps hath never happened above once; Therefore I hold, that
he muſt draw it from things univerſall of their owne nature, and
from Arts, which are daily renewed, and which continue, even
till they become immortall. Rhetoricians hold, that that proofe
which is made by examples, is a very weak argument, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from particular things; whereas the Induction (which is
but a collection, or heap of many like particulars) becomes as an
univerſall nature, whereof the power is greater, and the grace
more conſpicuous. In matter alſo of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> Hiſtoricall events
hold the place of an Example, but naturall qualities, and the uſage
of things artificiall, ſhall hold the place of Induction.</p>
               <p>Tis true, this kind of perfect <hi>Deviſes</hi> is the moſt difficult to
practice on, and therefore not a work for every common wit, nor
for thoſe, who (to avoid trouble) make uſe indifferently of all
that comes into their fancie. And for concluſion of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
I am of opinion (with our Author) that we may draw ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
excellent conceptions, as well from Fables as from Hiſtorie;
but thoſe that ſhall be taken from Nature and Art, ſhall come
neereſt to perfection.</p>

               <head type="sub">Obſervations for Deviſes, taken from nature and Art.</head>
               <p>HAving already concluded, that the moſt proper and fruitfull
veyne of the world, from whence <hi>Deviſes</hi> may be drawne, is
from Nature and Art; we muſt obſerve, that there are two dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
rocks, which (if not avoided) may eaſily ſhip-wrack our
little veſſell.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt then, in expreſſing our thoughts by ſignes taken from
Nature or Art, we muſt take heed not to intermixe in the ſame
body of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> Naturall works with Artificiall, ſince they have
no conformity at all each with other, nor that we put in the ſame
body, divers Naturall things accumulated one upon another, nor
divers Artificiall, which have no relation to each other. As for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108365:42"/>
example, a Dolphin embracing an Anchor, with theſe words,
FESTINA LENTE: This is a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which treſpaſſeth againſt
that firſt Maxime, biſides other viſible defects that it hath, the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
requiring no figure, it being intelligible enough of it ſelfe, and
making a compleat ſentence, it needed no figure to expreſſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
the ſenſe of the Author. Beſides, thoſe words are too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and have been ſo familiar in the mouth of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar,</hi>
that at this day they deſerve not to be made uſe of in <hi>Deviſes.</hi> But
the greateſt fault that <hi>Bargagli</hi> ſinds therein, is the conjunction of
a Dolphin with an anchor, which have no relation to each other,
for as much as the Anchor (having no other uſe then to ſtay Ships)
cannot have any other reſemblance with the Dolphin, or any other
fiſh, except with the <hi>Remora,</hi> which (they ſay) is able to ſtop a
Ship. And yet tis not long ſince a recent Author made uſe of it
in a <hi>Deviſe</hi> almoſt of a like deſigne; whether it ſucceed well, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my ſelfe to thoſe, who having ſeen it, are able to judge of the
Copy, by the Originall, and of the effects of an ill patterne.</p>
               <p>For example, of the unhandſomeneſſe of crowding many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things together, I will onely inſtance the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe
which hath wings, with this Motto of that moſt excellent
Poet, <hi>Hanniball Caro,</hi> AMOR ADDIDIT, <hi>Love, hath added
them.</hi> Is not this to compoſe a <hi>Chymera,</hi> and forge to ones ſelfe a
fantaſticall monſter, by joyning in one body the nature of a bird
to that of a beaſt? Whence you may gather what abſurdity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the conjunction of naturall with naturall things, nor need
you doubt but that the repugnancy of many artificiall things are
no leſſe inſufferable.</p>
               <p>2. You muſt have a care, that (in placing the figures of naturall
ſubjects) you doe not deſtroy their eſſentiall properties, or that
(for expreſſing your conceptions) you doe not matte their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
quality, by abuſing the uſe of them, and that you drag them
not as it were by the haire, wreſting or conſtraining them to come
to your deſigne, after the manner of that Author of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> where
there is a Batt that looks ſteadily upon the Sunne, contrary to her
nature, with this Motto, AD INS<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>EROR, i.e. <hi>I force
my ſelfe, to an unaccuſtomed thing.</hi> Doe you not ſee in this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the compariſon is taken from a falſe quality, which this
Author attributes to the Batt, who can by no meanes endure the
rayes of the ſunne? Tis true, this kind of falſe ſuppoſition is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108365:43"/>
to Poets, (who have more elbow-roome, and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
is to feigne and metamorphize at pleaſure) but not to the
Authors of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> who are obliged to be ſtrict obſervers of the
truth.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt alſo obſerve, that it is lawfull to uſe the propriety
of a naturall ſubject, be it animal, plant, fruit, or other thing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the generall approbation or received opinion of ancient
Authors, though the Modernes have lately diſcovered it to be falſe,
becauſe the compariſon which is grounded upon a quality, reputed
true by the generality, though indeed it be falſe, ſhall be more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
received, and better underſtood, then if it were grounded
upon a true property, which nevertheleſſe were held falſe, and
which were altogether unknowne to the greater part of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Thus the holy Fathers did uſe the compariſon of the Phenix
to prove the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. We may alſo appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to this ſenſe, the quality of the Beare, who (according to the
generall opinion) brings forth her young ones like a lump of fleſh,
without forme or diſtinction of members, untill with long licking,
ſhe renders them perfect and poliſhed; though <hi>Johannes Bodinus</hi>
hath lately proved the contrary in his Hiſtoricall Treatiſe. But for
all that, it is not lawfull to make uſe of it, according to the known
truth, without citing the Author.</p>
               <p>All that we have now ſaid touching figures, borrowed from
Nature, ought alſo to be underſtood of thoſe which are taken from
Art; And we muſt take heed never to alter the proper uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
nor of ſuch like things; As he that for a <hi>Deviſe</hi> cauſed
a yoke to be repreſented with this word SUAVE. For although
Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, that his yoke was ſweet, JUGUM MEUM
SUAVE, it doth not follow that the yoke ſignifies Empire or
command, unleſſe it be in a Parabolicall ſenſe, as that which our
Saviour then uſed, and whereof the uſage is much different from a
<hi>Deviſe,</hi> for that this Compariſon is taken, contrary to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of that inſtrument, for no beaſt that hath born the yoke did
ever finde it ſweet, but rather ſowre, troubleſome and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>As for the manner of drawing Compariſons from Arts, to the
end to make an impreſſion or tryall of ſome conception of our
wit, we ought to take the ſimilitude from ſubjects, by drawing it,
not from the accidents or defects which are in them, but rather
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108365:43"/>
from the eſſentiall quality, which puts them alwaies in uſe, of by
which they receive moſt commendation: we muſt alſo have a care,
if there be ſundry figures of Art, that they relate to each other, and
tend to the ſame end.</p>
               <p>We muſt not onely avoid the uſing of a figure againſt its owne
nature, as the Bat looking ſteadily upon the Sunne, but alſo the
attributing unto the figure any quality, but what is proper unto it,
though by chance it may ſometimes ſo happen, and ſeem probable.
Nevertheleſſe we may draw compariſons from qualities, which
are accidentall to naturall ſubjects, ſo that they diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by a like naturall, ordinary and known way, as the talking
or prating of a Parrot, who ſtrives to ſpeak in imitation of man,
which properly is but an accident, whereof nevertheleſſe we may
make uſe in <hi>Deviſes,</hi> as of a knowne and true thing. The like is
to be practiced in making uſe of inſtruments, in ſuch ſort as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to have regard to their proper uſe: And tis againſt this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
that <hi>Contile</hi> hath erred, who inſerted a Ship arrived in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
between Rocks with this Motto, LABOR ET VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTE,
conſidering the Ship, not having power to come to the
haven of herſelf, needed ſome other meanes to conduct her thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>For the cleerneſſe of the Compariſon, as the Mataphors ought
no to be taken from things too much removed, or which are leſſe
preceptible, then the ſubject which we would have to be made
knowne by them: So the Compariſons ought to be drawne from
things that are cleere and intelligible, becauſe the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is onely
invented to diſcover &amp; explicate the intention of the Author, or of
him for whom it is made, in the beſt moſt efficacious manner
that may be.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is to be noted, that thoſe things ſomtimes uſed,
which have no correſpondence with the conceptions of the mind,
as if we had a deſigne to expreſſe the care and affection that a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Captain ſhould have for the ſafety and conſervation of his
Prince a Turtle dove would be figured, becauſe maturall love obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that bird never to part from her company. A gentleman that
would teſtify that he could not live, without being conjoyned to
a Lady whom he ſued in the way of marriage, made uſe in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe</hi>
of a Snake, with this Motto, AUT JUNGI AUT MORI,
<hi>Eeither to be joyned or die,</hi> becauſe the nature of that Serpent is to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108365:44"/>
have every part, ſo true a friend to each other, that being cut or
divided into ſeverall pieces, they eaſily joyne and re-unite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo that her skin may but touch the skin that is cut: in
which you perceive well, there is no Coherence, ſince tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the gentleman was never conjoyned to the Lady becauſe he
ſought her by the way of honour, whereas the Snake cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had been joyned and united before ſhe was cut.</p>
               <p>If we pretend to render a <hi>Deviſe</hi> perfect in all parts, decencie
and civility muſt be obſerved, as well in the figures as in the
words; For as the eares of the vertuous are offended at obſcene
words, ſo are their eyes at an immodeſt figure. Many Italians are
guilty of this crime, whereof I liſt not to bring examples, left by
condemning incivilities and indecencies in <hi>Deviſes,</hi> I become of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
to your eyes or eares. It ſhall ſuffice to take notice, that
that Author did incur a reproach, who cauſed a Cat to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
hiding her ordure, with this word, TEGENDUM, <hi>it muſt
be hid.</hi> However my meaning is not that it is neceſſary to reject
or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>niſh the inſtruments of any ſervile trades, nor venemous or ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beaſts from <hi>Deviſes,</hi> ſo that the action repreſented, or quality
employed, be decent in the picture, and in the compariſon, which
the Author intends by it. But if the <hi>Deviſe</hi> be to expreſſe it ſelfe in
favour of ſome renowned perſon, there muſt not be any abject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
inſerted, ſuch as Dripping-pans, Frying-pans, Chafing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes,
and Bellowes, which would render the compariſon odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And (tell me) would it not be a very ridiculous invention
to repreſent the dignity of a Grand Maſter of the Artillery by a
Chaſing-diſh, becauſe the principall and eſſentiall effects of that
charge depends on the fire; and that the command of the Prince
is like the bellowes that kindles that fire, and puts it in action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the enemies of the State? By the ſuppoſition of this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
you may judge how much it importeth, the intention or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of an Author to be demonſtrated by bodies or figures, which
be proper and agreeable to the perſon.</p>
               <p>The Armes of Families may very well be converted into <hi>Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and the Authors who undertake theſe kind of Blazons, may
give themſelves ſome licence, in reſpect of the great difficulty
there is in lighting upon ſome quaint conceipt of wit, eſpecially
in thoſe, where nothing can be added or diminiſhed; but in this
point we muſt obſerve, that whenſoever a Coat hath many pieces
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108365:44"/>
alike, as three Flower-de-luces, three Roſes, three Creſſants, Stars
without number, and the like; the Motto may be attributed to one
onely, as to a Flower-de-luce, a Roſe, a Creſſant, a Star, becauſe in
this caſe the plurall number is not conſidered, but in ſubſtance,
and in the repreſentation of the ſame naturall quality.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Deviſe</hi> may alſo be handſomely framed from two different
Coats of Armes, as of the Husband and his Wife, of two friends,
of two Kings, of two States united and confederate. Will you
have an example of it, taken out of our Author <hi>Bargagli?</hi> A Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
bearing <hi>Vnde</hi> in his armes, and his Wife Roſes, gave occaſion
to joyne them together in one Blazon, with theſe words, IRRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATae
VIVATIORES, i.e. <hi>they are more lively when they are
watered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we put Mottoes ſimply upon Armes, which ſpeake or
addreſſe themſelves to God, to a Prince, or to the world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having any relation to the figure, that cannot by any meanes be
called a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> onely a <hi>Cimier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the way, let us obſerve with <hi>Bargagli,</hi> that his ingenuity
muſt not be condemned, who from the ſame matter (whereof o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have made uſe) ſeeketh new qualities, which he expreſſeth
in another manner, and applyes to new deſignes.</p>
               <p>As for the bodies of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> tis good to be advertiſed, that
there are many things in nature, which neither draught, ſculpture,
nor painting it ſelfe can repreſent, and therefore are of no uſe for
<hi>Deviſes,</hi> though we might draw from thence many pretty fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
As from dull, and from the gravell which flyes carry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their wings, to the end they may not be carryed away by the
wind.</p>
               <p>We muſt ſo order it, that things as well naturall as artificiall,
be repreſented in ſuch exact manner, as that they may reſemble the
naturall, as neere as may be, and it is for that reaſon, that <hi>Bargagli</hi>
approves of the immediate uſe of living things, and reall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without painting, in the combats of Tournaments and at
Maſques, which are but of one dayes continuance.</p>
               <p>The Allegory ought to have no place in the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> ſince this
is a metaphor continued or amplified, and that hath neither the
force, nor luſtre of a metaphor.</p>
               <p>Though the quantity or plurality of figures (which is neceſſary
in the compoſition of a <hi>Dtviſe</hi>) be no part of its eſſence, but onely
<pb n="05" facs="tcp:108365:45"/>
an accident, it is nevertheleſſe expedient to know, that for the
perfection of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> more then three figures muſt not be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
unleſſe all of them relate to one and the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and be of
the ſame nature and quality; ſuch is that <hi>Deviſe</hi> where we ſee an
Elephant and a flock of ſheep, with this Motto, INFESTUS
INFESTIS, i. e. <hi>offenſive to the offending:</hi> For as much as all
the individuals which make up the flock are onely inſerted to
ſhew the proper nature of the whole Species, and to expreſſe the
naturall ſimplicity of that creature. See here my particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt that of <hi>Bargagli,</hi> who doth not regard the number of
figures, ſo they have ſome relation to each other, and ſerve to the
compariſon: He holds alſo, that that <hi>Deviſe</hi> (whereof the body is
compoſed of three figures, neceſſary to the compariſon) hath a
better apparence, then that where there is onely one; beſides that,
it is more difficult to appropriate the quality of divers bodies to
one onely ſoule, then to animate one ſole body by one Motto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bargagli</hi> rejects the opinion of thoſe, who would have the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> not to be otherwiſe repreſented then in black and
white, and ſaith, that this practice is no where admittable, but
in Deſerts, where we can neither find colours, nor workman of
ability to draw them otherwiſe; therefore this Author allowes of
all ſorts of colours in <hi>Deviſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for my part, I ſhould be of his opinion, as to thoſe <hi>Deviſes</hi>
which are for Tiltings, Tournaments and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ques, for Enſignes
and Cornets; but for thoſe that are to be applyed to Coines, or
other ſubjects of metall or ſtone, which are caſt, molten, coyned
or carved, colours are utterly to be rejected, otherwiſe we muſt
make no <hi>Deviſes,</hi> whereof the body can be comprehended or
knowne without the help of colours, for to ſay truth, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Prince (who hath been long Maſter of a <hi>Deviſe</hi>) will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpoſe it upon ombroidered Caſſaques, upon Chimney-pieces
or Cabinets, but alſo upon his Coynes, Marble-ſtones, Braſſe, and
other metals. Moreover, when colours are not requiſite, nothing
can hinder the inſerting of <hi>Deviſes</hi> in all convenient places.</p>
               <p>We have already ſpoken of thoſe ornaments, which we utterly
reject in <hi>Deviſes,</hi> unleſſe they be hands, that hold ſome kind of
thing according to cuſtome, or humane faces, to repreſent the
winds, which would otherwiſe be very hard to decipher.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Mottoes.</head>
               <p>THe Motto ſerveth for no other thing, but for a kind of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
interpreter, or neceſſary inſtrument, to bring in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
and to diſcover the quality and propriety of the figure, in
ſo much as the uſe of it, is in reſpect of this Art, what Speech is to
the nature of man, to expreſſe his thoughts.</p>
               <p>Three things are to be conſidered in the Motto; What it ought
ſimply to be towards the proper figures of the <hi>Deviſe:</hi> What it
ought to be in extracting the quinteſſence, and demonſtrating the
naturall or artificiall proprieties of the figure: And laſtly, what it
muſt be in regard of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>According to the opinion of <hi>Ruſcelli</hi> and of many others, whom
I find to be guided by reaſon in this point, no figure of the body
ought to be named in the Motto; yet ſomtimes tis lawfull to name
ſome part of the body, as in that <hi>Deviſe</hi> where there is a Ship with
Sailes and oares without any gale of wind, with this Motto,
ARRIPE REMOS, whereof the laſt term is neceſſary, to give to
underſtand, that when the one fails, we may make uſe of the other,
that is to ſay, of the oares. We may alſo name that part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is hidden in the figure, &amp; which the Pencill cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
as the Spring of a Gun, or Watch, the Shaft of a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel,
the Axis upon which the Spheare of the world moves, and
ſo of divers others, which we muſt uſe with diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Alſo we muſt not make uſe of thoſe termes, which demonſtrate
or decipher the figures, that induce the readers inſpection: It is
therefore requiſite that we avoid ſome certaine uſeleſſe words,
which derogate much from the grace and neatneſſe of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi>
in which number are, <hi>HIC, HINC, HOC PACTO, QUI,
QUae, HOC, SIC, &amp;c.</hi> eſpecially when they are inſerted for the
illuſtration of the Compariſon, ſince the Reader (if not blinded
with ignorance) may behold the figures, call to mind their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and diſcover their application, without the help of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
termes.</p>
               <p>Though a <hi>Deviſe</hi> may be call'd a Metaphor in ſome kind, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108365:46"/>
that this figure of Phetorick is requiſite thereunto, yet is there a
difference between ſpeaking by Metapher and ſpeaking by meanes
of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> becauſe in ſpeaking by a Metaphor you demonſtrate the
thing, which you intend to ſignify, by the words onely, when as
in diſcourſing by <hi>Deviſes,</hi> you explicate the matter partly by
words and partly by figures. Whereupon have a care that the
expreſſion of the quality of the figure, which is done by the Motto,
retaine nothing Metaphoricall, but that it be altogether proper and
pure, to the end you doe not incurre the reproach of heaping Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor upon
Metaphor no more in matter of <hi>Deviſe,</hi> then in the
compoſition of verſe or Proſe.</p>
               <p>Now as Metaphorick and tranſported termes alwaies appear to
our underſtandings with two ſignifications, whereof the one is
the proper and the other the ſtrange, externe and borrowed, by
meanes of the Similitude, which it hath in comon with the firſt:
Even ſo may we ſay, that <hi>Deviſes</hi> preſent themſelves to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
with two ſignifications; the one is, the naturall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or the uſage of the thing repreſented by the figure; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, the meaning of the Author. Now to come to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> we muſt abandon the firſt ſignification, and
diſcover the ſecond, by means of the reſemblance, which the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or uſage of the thing figured hath with the conception of the
Authors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ancie. To prove that the <hi>Motto</hi> ought alwayes to ſpeak
properly, and to be taken in its firſt ſignification, we ſhall onely
need to inſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce the example of him, who cauſed a ball of Chriſtall
to be repreſented with this Motto, INTUS ET IN CUTE,
i. e. <hi>within and upon the skin,</hi> where this word IN CUTE is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Metaphorick, Criſtall having neither skin, nor any thing
on the ſurface anſwerable to a skin, therefore it had been more
proper to have ſaid, INTUS ET EXTRA, <hi>within and without.</hi>
Nevertheleſſe, we may with diſcretion uſe a Metaphoricall word,
when by long uſe is rendeed ſo familiar, that we receive it no
longer, as tranſported from one ſenſe to another, but as proper to
the ſubject we intend. This is that condition which cauſeth the
phraſe of <hi>Petrark</hi> to be approved, when he ſaith, that he hath
ſeene two lights weeping, VIDI LAGRIMAR QUE DUE
BE LUMI; For certainly Lights ſhed no teares; and it would
be without ground, whoſoever ſhould attribute to a light the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of weeping, if that word [Lights] were not commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108365:46"/>
to ſignifie the two eyes of a man, in ſuch like diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>We ought to forbeare the uſe of Synonima's, Connotatives, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithets,
and other Adjuncts, for feare leſt the <hi>Motto</hi> offend againſt
that brevity, which is requiſite thereto; and for the ſame reaſon,
two Verbs are never to be admitted to diſcover the ſame concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind, unleſſe one doth not ſufficiently expreſſe the uſe or
nature of the thing. Nor muſt we make uſe of thoſe kind of terms
which Logicians call <hi>Abſtracts</hi> and <hi>abſolutes,</hi> vertue, vice, envy,
mercy, nature, knowledge, felicity, art, and ſuch like ſubſtantives,
which ought rather to be expreſſed and demonſtrated by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and uſage of thoſe things which are figured in the body of the
<hi>Deviſe,</hi> and afford matter for the compariſon.</p>
               <p>For expreſſion of the propriety of figures, and the meaning of
the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> it much importeth, the <hi>Motto</hi> to be ſubtile, and that
the Reader may comprehend it with pleaſure and perſpicuity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring
to out-reach the propriety of the figure, and to ſerue into
the very meaning of the Author; For he that ſhould onely expreſſe
the nature or uſage of the figure, would not be capable of touching
the fancy of the reader ſo vigorouſly, as to leave a pleſant reliſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it, nor of producing thoſe other admirable effects, which ought
to accompany the underſtanding of a perfect <hi>Deviſe.</hi> Againſt this
particular, that <hi>Deviſe</hi> would much treſpaſſe, which for its whole
body ſhould onely have a Diamond, and for Motto theſe 2 words,
MACULA CARENS, becauſe this Motto would onely ſerve to
declare ſimply the prerogative of this precious ſtone, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
whereof the reader needed not any ſubtility or acuteneſſe of
wit.</p>
               <p>As for the ſenſe of the <hi>Motto,</hi> though it hath been handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet my intent is to give you here the opinion of our Author,
who haldeth, that the <hi>Motto</hi> ought not to be too intelligible, nor
yet too obſcure, for as much as the firſt exceſſe would diminiſh
much of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce, grace and quaintneſſe of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
defect would in no wiſe diſcover the deſigne or meaning of the
Author; As in the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of the Sunne and a Sun-dyall, if there
were but theſe words, NI ASPICIATUR, the Reader could
not conceive, that it is the quality of the Sun, which leads to the
intention of the Author, therefore the word which is added unto
it, NON ASPICITUR, is moſt proper and neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
becauſe it renders it more intelligible, (v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z.) <hi>unleſſe the Sun
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108365:47"/>
reflect on the Diall, the Diall is not regarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words are inſerted in the <hi>Deviſe</hi> either by <hi>Proſopopoeia</hi>
(w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a certain manner of ſpeech uſed by Rhetoritians, very effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious
to move and ſtrike the mind, by ſuppoſing that the words
come from the very mouth of the things figured) or by introducing
a third perſon to utter the words in forme of a Sentence, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with acuteneſſe of wit, the quality of the figure, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
the body of the <hi>Deviſe.</hi> And as for the uſe of the <hi>Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeia,</hi>
you need not feare, to cauſe all kind of beaſts, all mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
inſtruments and other things as well naturall as artificial to
ſpeak, thouph they have no Principle, faculty or organs proper to
forme words; And it is in reſpect that <hi>Deviſes</hi> ought in ſome ſort
to imitate Poetry which doth not onely introduce brute beaſts,
but alſo frequently cauſeth inanimate things to ſpeak, for greater
delight, to expreſſe the fancy better, and to perſwade more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
But for the introduction of the perſon who beares the
<hi>Deviſe,</hi> to ſpeak in the <hi>Motto, Bargagli</hi> forbids it, yet ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writers doe approve thereof; And for my own part, I think
that the choice of this introduction depends upon the conceipts
and diſcretion of the Author.</p>
               <p>The manner of drawing the conception out of a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> hath
never any vigour or grace, when the words declare nothing of the
quality of the body; And this is onely to be understood of thoſe
figures which are either borrowed from nature or Art: As for
thoſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> which are drawne from Events, they appertaine not
to this Rule.</p>
               <p>The compariſon derived from the quality of the figure, ought
not to be expreſſed in the <hi>Motto,</hi> otherwiſe it is to prove one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
thing by another, no leſſe obcure then that; for as much as the
propriety of the figure ought to ſerve as a meanes to make the
proof of a good conceipt. You will comprehend the practice of
this Rule more eaſily, by the defects of that <hi>Deviſe,</hi> where the
words are, SIC DIVINA LUX MIHI, and for body, the
figure of the hearb called <hi>Lotos,</hi> which hath the property of riſing
out of the water, and of elevating it ſelf meaſurably, to the Sunnes
aſcent above our Horizon, and of ſinking down with the ſame
proportion as that Planet declines toward, ſetting. The firſt
defect that I diſcover in the Motto of this <hi>Deviſe,</hi> is, that it doth
not in any faſhion explicate the property of the hearb, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108365:47"/>

                  <hi>Palazzi</hi> is of opinion that the verbe may be hanſomly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
in the Motto's of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> neither is it unſeemly when tis
expreſſed, nor likewiſe when there are two, which ſerve for a
more clear demonſtration; the whole depends upon the judgment
and dexterity of the Author, and the occaſion of it ought to be
taken from the quality of the figures, and the propriety or the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
uſed therein.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the moods of verbs, which we may uſe indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as well as the tenſes. The Indicative or demonſtrative
mood is the moſt proper for a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> the Imperative is ſomtimes
uſed to very good purpoſe: But the Optative, Subjunctive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
have neither certainty or conſtancy enough to expreſſe our
conceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:108365:48"/>
The Motto's that are formed by way of interrogation, have ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
more vigour, then thoſe which containe an affirmative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>As for Adverbs, they may have place therein, to the number of
two, but the negatives are moſt becomming; as in the <hi>Deviſe</hi> of
the Flame, NUNQUAM DEORSUM, <hi>never downwards.
Ruſcelli</hi> doth not approve of the Motto that is ſimply negative, as
for the full Moone, NON SEMPER EADEM, <hi>ſhe is never the
ſame.</hi> A Motto may alſo be negative and affirmative both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as JACTOR, NON MERGOR, <hi>I am toſſd, but not drown'd,</hi>
ſpeaking of a Gourd, or a bottle made of the emptied rind thereof,
which ſwimmes on the water.</p>
               <p>But ſetting apart theſe triviall ſearches into, and conditions of
<hi>Motto's,</hi> let us reſume the manner of drawing with dexterity, by
vertue of the <hi>Motto</hi> the propriety &amp; uſage of the body of a <hi>Deviſe:
Alexandrè Farra</hi> and <hi>Barthelemy Taëgio</hi> conſent, that if the
words doe but ſimple expreſſe the nature of the thing repreſented
in the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> they reſemble thoſe perſons, whoſe lives being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the intellectuall faculty, remaine buried (as it were) in
corporeall ſences, yet there ire many Authors that have not taken
notice of that defect in <hi>Motto's,</hi> no, not <hi>P. Jovius</hi> himſelf, as <hi>Farra</hi>
obſerveth, though other wiſe, he deſerves to be acknowledged for
the Maſter of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> ſince he was the firſt that treated of them:
For amongſt other <hi>Deviſes</hi> which he hath made, that of <hi>Alviano</hi>
hath this great error, where an Unicorne is ſeene, touching the
water of a fountaine, and about him many venemous beaſts, with
this Motto, VENENA PALLO, <hi>I diſpell venome.</hi> And this is
that <hi>Motto,</hi> which hath not the principall condition of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,</hi>
that is to ſay, that it ſhould have ſomething more miſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>In the third place, we conſider the <hi>Motto</hi> of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> ſimply in
it ſelfe, and for that reſpect the words ought to be very brief, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and energeticall: We are therefore to reject thoſe words
which are long, languiſhing, drayling and vulgar, to the end, that
the <hi>Motto</hi> received by the ear, may give a ſmart and pleaſing touch
to the underſtanding of him that heares or ſees it.</p>
               <p>But as to the brevity of the words, the number cannot eaſily
be preſcribed, becauſe that depends upon the Judgment of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and upon the ſubject which he treats of, and intends to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108365:48"/>
yet we may ſay that the <hi>Motto</hi> may receive 4. or 5. words,
and like wiſe a whole verſe, according to the opinion of <hi>Bargagli;</hi>
But according to <hi>Ruſcelli, Deviſes</hi> are ſo much the more removed
from perfection, by how much the <hi>Motto</hi> exceeds the number of
3 words, unleſſe the Authority of a great Poet, or the excellency
of a rare and happy conceipt give you leave to make uſe of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtick
or whole verſe, The number of the words is then juſt and
preciſe (according to our Author) when there is nothing ſur-z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in the Motto, nor of too much reſtraint, and when all
concurrs to the underſtanding of the <hi>Deviſe;</hi> yet ſo, as that we are
ſometimes permitted to enlarge it to give a greater grace and
quaintneſſe to the diſcourſe; But in a word, the greateſt ſleight and
ſubtility of this Art conſiſts in the brevity of the words.</p>
               <p>The order or ſcituation of the terms is alſo conſiderable, becauſe
there are ſome that are more ſutable in one place, then in another,
as well for the ſence, as for the cadence, and the fewer words
you employ, the more carefull muſt you be to chooſe them pure,
noble, acute and gracefull: To bring them to that perfection, tis
good to communicate them to your friends, and to make many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
both of your eyes and mind thereon, and not to be ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
in altering that Motto, which you have found to be good at
other times, when you meet with a better; This is that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is practiced by the greateſt Poets, Oratours, and all the

ought to make uſe of in the <hi>Motto's</hi> of <hi>Deviſes</hi> are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
for ſome hold, that the language moſt proper for that purpoſe,
is that which is moſt ancient, others prefer that which flouriſheth
in the greateſt number of Authors, and which hath moſt authority,
and ſome others attribute that property to the language, which is
moſt generally underſtood in all Countries, and is moſt in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

all others for love matters, the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> for pleaſant and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Motto's,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> for heroick and grave ones, the <hi>Greeks</hi>
for fictions, and laſtly the <hi>Latine</hi> for all ſorts of <hi>Motto's,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the ſerious and majeſticall. But the opinion of <hi>Bargagli</hi>
(who condemnes not the Judgments of others, though they be
not grounded upon my reaſon or ſolid authority) is very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
on this ſubject, and admitts the uſe of all thoſe Idiomes; For
ſaith he, that conciſe <hi>Motto</hi> which we aime at, is to be taken out
of that Language, where we meet with the beſt words, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
ſayings, the nobleſt proverbes or moſt proper termes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the quality of the thing repreſented in the figure; ſo that the
<hi>Motto</hi> (in whatſoever language it be expreſſed) doe immediately
ſrike the mind of him that reads or heares it, provided that the
words which we borrow from one language be defective in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that they have more energie and ſignification in that
language then in any other, which vertue in words may be found
out by the traduction or verſion of them. Yet I would not have
an unknowne language admitted, nor one that is much removed
from ordinary uſe, as the <hi>Perſian, Turkiſh, Muſcovian, Polonian</hi>
and the like, but rather the Latine which is received through all
the world, without adding the verſion in any other language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>But for my part I cannot abſolutely reject any of theſe opinions,
onely I find it moſt proper to follow the mod common, which
is that of the Latine, ſince that tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which is much more ancient, rich, and ſignificative; And indeed
we may uſe it freely, when occaſion preſents it ſelfe, and yet more
rarely, becauſe it is not ſo familiar, nor ſo generally underſtood
as the Latine is. Beſides that as <hi>Bargagli</hi> deſires the bodies of
<hi>Deviſes</hi> to be drawne from Nature and Art, becauſe their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and uſages are the ſame every where, and no waies ſubject to
change: So I could wiſh that the <hi>Motto's</hi> ſhould be taken from the
Greek or Latine, in regard they are the Miſtreſſe-tongues, which
are beſt underſtood by the learned, and generally of all men,
and which can hereafter receive no more alteration, ſince they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108365:49"/>
arrived to the <hi>comble</hi> of their perfection with the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>I commend much (with our Author) the uſe of Rhetoricall
figures in <hi>Motto's,</hi> as thoſe words which Counterpoint one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which fall in a like cadence, which end in a like termination,
and which carry a like tone, though they have a different ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo of others: For all theſe ornaments of diſcourſe and
waies of ſpeaking, do as much beautifie and illuſtrate <hi>Deviſes,</hi> as
Orations, ſo that on the other ſide they retaine the brevity requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and no metaphoricall terme, according to the Rule which
we have already preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Mottoes which are drawne from ancient Authors have
more grace, more vertue and authority, then thoſe which we our
ſelves invent; And yet there are ſome moderne ones, who have
made us ſee, that the vivacity of their wit hath not been incapable
of inventing and producing ſome themſelves.</p>
               <p>For borrowing from the Ancients, we muſt have a care that the
<hi>Motto's</hi> be not ſo maimed, as to leave an eſſentiall part of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be underſtood or divined at, as if all the world were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to know punctually the whole Author, from whence the
Motto is taken: This defect is noted in that <hi>Deviſe</hi> where there
is a Comet in the midſt of many ſtars with this Motto, INTER

the Julian ſtar out-ſhines the reſt,</q>
ſo that if ſome words of the authority muſt be omitted, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

ſhould be rather inſerted then the precedent, here's an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108365:50"/>
of ſome Modernes who make uſe of the ſame <hi>Motto,</hi>
which another Author of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> hath invented, becauſe that is
but to propoſe alwaies one and the ſame thing, though the body
of the <hi>Deviſe</hi> be changed, whereas in borrowing the <hi>Motto</hi> from

                  </gap>now from
whence to derive the Compariſon, Similitude or Metaphor: Now
theſe three figures of Rhetorick have but the ſame end in ſubſtance,
which is to demonſtrate the correſpondence, conformity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance,
which is between two different ſubjects, as the forme
of a <hi>Deviſe</hi> conſiſts principally in the finding out in the whole
Univerſe a naturall quality, or the uſage of ſome thing, which may
correſpond with and relate unto the propriety of our thoughts, and
conceptions of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:108365:50"/>
But if you aske me in particular a proper place, from whence
you may frame a ſubject of or matter for <hi>Deviſes,</hi> I ſhall refer you
to good Authors, who have written of the nature and propriety
of Animals, Plants, Mineralls, precious ſtones, of the parts of
heaven and earth, of the Liberall Sciences, Mechanicall Arts and
other ſubjects as well naturall as artificiall. Tis verily the reading
of ſuch Treatiſes, which will diſcover to you ſome vertues or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties
which will eaſily relate to the intention of your <hi>Deviſes.</hi>
This field is ſo ample, and the harveſt ſo great, that of one onely
ſubject, be it naturall or artificiall, we may forme not onely one,
2, or 3 fancies, but alſo an infinite number of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> as may be
proved by the quantity which are made upon the ſubject of thoſe
great Luminaries, the Sun and Moon, and which are many times
drawne ſimply from their proper parts, ſometimes from thoſe
which have a correſpondence one with another, and ſometimes
from the vertues and influences, which theſe Planets doe diverſly
diffuſe upon all inferiour bodies. The like may be practiced upon
the ſubject of Arts and mechanicall inſtruments.</p>
               <p>For the choice of the <hi>Mottoes</hi> drawne from ancient Authors,
we muſt regard the words with great prudence, that they may
be appropriated to our deſigne, and that (being added to the body
of our <hi>Deviſe</hi>) they may forme a ſpirituall and delightfull compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p>But beſides the rich matters, which Art and Nature are able
everlaſtingly to furniſh us with, we may yet draw other from the
Apologues and fables of <hi>Aeſope,</hi> from ſentences, Proverbes and
Maximes of the Sages and morall Philoſophers. Yet obſerve
that my meaning is not, that we ſhould borrow from fables, the
ſubject of the fable, as the unfeathered Crow of <hi>Horace;</hi> but that
we make uſe of the proprieties of things which are met with in
many places of fables, ſo likewiſe for matter of ſentences, I think
it were good we onely uſed thoſe which are enriched with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons,
and tis for this advantage that Proverbes deſerve to be
preferred.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeake here of the places where <hi>Deviſes</hi> ought to be
fixed, for though <hi>Ruſcelli</hi> hath treated amply thereof, that choice
depends upon the cuſtome of every Country, and upon the will of
thoſe for whom they are made. It ſhall ſuffice for me to obſerve,
that they ſerve gentilely for a Scale, and (as it ſeems to me) they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108365:51"/>
are much more gracefull then a mans proper Armes, eſpecially
when the <hi>Deviſe</hi> is formed and grounded upon the ſubject of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
miſſive or of a Seale, as that of one named <hi>Blind</hi> in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie
of the <hi>Intronati,</hi> where there is a Dart or Arrow, with this
Motto, IRREVOCABILE. Tis true nevertheleſſe that <hi>Deviſes</hi>
of Seales are yet much more handſome, when they are framed
from the Armes of thoſe that uſe them, for which purpoſe it is
not neceſſary to convert the whole Coat into <hi>Diviſes,</hi> but it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
to take an eſſentiall part of the Blazon, or that which may be
reduced into a <hi>Deviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deviſes</hi> may alſo be put upon the Reverſe of Princes Coynes,
and upon Stamps or Counters, as it is frequently uſed in France,
in which caſe they are exempted from ſome of the rigour of our
Rules, and in reſpect of their affinity with the Medall, there is no
doubt but they may as well notifie an Heroick action of a Prince,
as demonſtrate a gallant intention to be put in execution.</p>
               <p>They are alſo very ſeemly on Ladies Pictures, for as that Table
repreſents the exteriour part of the body, or the features of the
face: Even ſo the <hi>Deviſe</hi> repreſents the inclinations of the perſon
or virtues of the Lady. And as the inſtruments proper to every
profeſſion, are the places befitting a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> as the Swords, Piſtols,
and Head-peeces for men of Warre: So (me thinks) the moſt
proper place for a Ladies <hi>Deviſe,</hi> is her Looking-glaſſe: For tis no
leſſe neceſſary for a Lady to contemplate her interiours, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the motions of her ſoule, then to conſider her viſage, and
preſerve it immaculate; ſince by the mirrour ſhe onely ſees the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
quality of her face, whereas by the <hi>Deviſe</hi> ſhe diſcovers
the inclination of her mind, and excites her ſelfe more often to the
exerciſe of vertue, or to the execution of ſome noble deſign, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Deviſe</hi> renews the memory, as often as ſhe beholds it. And
it ſeemes this cuſtome may be conformable to the intention of
<hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who ordained that his Scholars ſhould often behold
themſelves in a glaſſe, to the end that conſidering the beauty of
their bodies, they might be equally carefull to imboliſh their
minds thereby to render them worthy of ſo faire an abode. Ladies
may alſo place their <hi>Deviſes</hi> on their Coaches, Cabinets, Beds,
Hangings, Cuſhnets, Carcanets, and on other parts of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and apparell.</p>
               <p>Though we have diſapproved all kind of ornaments for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108365:51"/>
of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> becauſe they may encomber the figure; and though
we admit of an hand to hold ſomething with greater grace, as we
have already obſerved; yet notwithſtanding I approve the inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ornament round about the <hi>Deviſe,</hi> between the body and
the edge, ſome Garlands or Coronets, ſome Chaplets and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures;
For example, you may uſe a wreathe of Myrtle for Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
of Lawrell for Heroick, of Cypreſſe for mourning <hi>Deviſes,</hi>
and ſo for others; ſo that within the branches we leave a certaine
ſpace for a commodious inſertment of the words.</p>
               <p>There are ſome kind of <hi>Deviſes,</hi> which can in no wiſe merit the
title of Perfect; in which number maybe the calumnious, which are
forged againſt the principall end of a legitimate <hi>Deviſe;</hi> thoſe that
by a ſimple Metaphor diſcover the conceit of an accident already
hapned, without demonſtrating any vertuous propoſition, or noble
deſigne to be put in execution; and thoſe alſo whereof the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is purely of a thing preſent. We muſt nevertheleſſe except the
<hi>Deviſes</hi> of ſtampes or Counters, which change every yeare, either
in declaring the heroick deſigne, which the Prince intends that
preſent yeare to put in execution, or rather preſenting to mens
eyes, that which the ſame Prince hath already atcheived of more
glory the yeare precedent.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Deviſes</hi> of detraction, though they ſhould be formed
according to the tenour of our Rules, they ought to be utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
from the number of the perfect, ſince the Author doth
thereby neither propoſe a vertuous ſubject to imitate, nor any lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
deſigne to execute, beſides they are oppugnant to the Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
of the word <hi>Deviſe,</hi> which in Italian ſignifies an enterpriſe,
and in French, a deſigne, without having reſpect to the particular
terme of <hi>Deviſe,</hi> whereof the ſignification is of a greater extent
in the French tongue, and by conſequence affords a greater liberty
or licence: For deriving it from this word (<hi>Deviſer</hi>) which, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the example of <hi>Sieur du Belley</hi>) is taken to depaint
the naturall diſpoſition, or deſcribe the conditions of any one, it
might include the calumnious <hi>Deviſes,</hi> as well as thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the time preſent, pad, and future.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deviſes</hi> may with equall commodity as well relate to the name
as to the Armes of the poſſeſſor, ſo that thoſe which allude to the
name be not taken from ſome ſignification too much remote from
common ſenſe or ordinary uſe; as the names whereof the Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie

I ſet a greater value upon thoſe which are drawne from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

that all the excellence and vertue which we finde in things artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
receive their origin from Nature, whereunto the neerer Art
approaches, ſo much the more prefect and excellent are its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

<hi>Bargagli</hi> will have it, that thoſe <hi>Deviſes</hi> which we draw from

becauſe that part of nature, which is in the body of the <hi>Deviſe,</hi>

which in theſe daies Miniſters of State, Princes and Kings doe
