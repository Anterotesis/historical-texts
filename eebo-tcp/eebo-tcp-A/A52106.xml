            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A Mid'ſt ſuch Sorrow, what pen can be dry?</l>
            <l>And drop no tear into an <hi>Elegy</hi>:</l>
            <l>He that abſtains through Numming winter's ſmart,</l>
            <l>May know his Inck's not frozen, but his heart,</l>
            <l>Were paper wanting, Preſs, and ſuch ſupplies,</l>
            <l>I'de publiſh forth my grief in ſobs and sighs.</l>
            <l>Weep, weep, my friends, and ſeeing a Cloud is hurl'd,</l>
            <l>To Muffle up with night our Brittiſh world:</l>
            <l>Let's open wide the Sluces, drench our brain,</l>
            <l>And prove that this our Cloud is full of rain.</l>
            <l>His Highneſs now lyes under <hi>Sagittarus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And ſhall not we ſit under moiſt <hi>Aquarius</hi>?</l>
            <l>If that our ſpring fails with the watry ſtore,</l>
            <l>Let's drop two eyes, inſtead of two tears more.</l>
            <l>The glittering light of Heaven, the Sun,</l>
            <l>Hath put his Mourning Cloke, and dark Suit on:</l>
            <l>With Foggs and Miſts Invelloping his Rayes,</l>
            <l>And drowning, ever ſince our Nights and Days,</l>
            <l>With rainy weepings, Heaven doth Simpathize,</l>
            <l>The Sun cloſe mourner keeps within the skies:</l>
            <l>All Creatures ſeem to ſay for ſuch a loſs,</l>
            <l>For ever <hi>England's</hi> Arms may bear the Croſs.</l>
            <l>And whereas it hath Argent been till now,</l>
            <l>Hence forth convert it to a Sable Hue.</l>
            <l>In Naturalls, and Politicks we read,</l>
            <l>What danger 'tis, to Chop and Change the Head:</l>
            <l>When once our Head, begins to ake or ſwim,</l>
            <l>We find decays and waſts in every limb:</l>
            <l>In ſuch a juncture all our body ſtands,</l>
            <l>The Crown gives virtue to both leggs and hands,</l>
            <l>So he through every Vain of th' Common-wealth,</l>
            <l>Glided along, and temper'd it to health.</l>
            <l>As generall head he influenc'd our hands</l>
            <l>To Fight and Conquer at his own Commands:</l>
            <l>As for his enemies, his Noble Blood,</l>
            <l>So influenc'd their Heels, they never ſtood.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Rout, and <hi>Dunbarr's</hi> famous Fight,</l>
            <l>Wherein there was no Colour left for Flight:</l>
            <l>Witneſs the Terror carryed in his Name,</l>
            <l>Whilſt they for fear made uſe for wings of Fame.</l>
            <l>Me thinks I read in every Flag a Verſe,</l>
            <l>Which all the letters of his name Reherſe.</l>
            <l>Thoſe <hi>Mottoes</hi> which expreſt his freely breath,</l>
            <l>Turn now to <hi>Epithaph</hi>'s and ſpeak his death.</l>
            <l>Seeing he, our life is dead, then let's dye all,</l>
            <l>To make our Prince, a greater Funerall.</l>
            <l>What greater grief, What more lamented Urne?</l>
            <l>Then that where Prince and people jointly burn:</l>
            <l>Gather his Aſhes, gather all his Train,</l>
            <l>No leſs a Grave will ſerve, then <hi>England</hi>'s plain.</l>
            <l>Sure <hi>Oliver</hi> that dyed in every place,</l>
            <l>Cannot Intombed be in ten foot ſpace.</l>
            <l>If that be true, that dying men ſtretch out,</l>
            <l>Sure he by now, the World Surrounds about.</l>
            <l>What though his <hi>Body</hi> here, contracted lyes,</l>
            <l>The Greatneſs of his <hi>Soul</hi> fills up the Skies.</l>
            <l>His <hi>Royall Burden</hi> would weigh down the Sphear,</l>
            <l>Had <hi>He</hi> not left his <hi>Son</hi> an Atlas here.</l>
            <l>If <hi>Hercules</hi> made Heaven's Supporter groan,</l>
            <l>Sure <hi>Cromwell's</hi> weight will quickly preſs it down:</l>
            <l>Shoar up then gracious Sir, let it appear,</l>
            <l>That only <hi>Cromwell,</hi> can a <hi>Cromwell</hi> bear.</l>
            <l>Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>Worc'ster</hi> him diſplay,</l>
            <l>The one his head the other loſt the day.</l>
            <l>Methinks I hear how Drum and Trumpet ſounds,</l>
            <l>And ſee him dig his way through blood &amp; wounds,</l>
            <l>A Paradox to moſt, Peace making Warrs,</l>
            <l>A healing ſword, and reconciling jarrs</l>
            <l>He always exerciſed; ſuch ſkill had he</l>
            <l>To bring us out of diſcord harmony.</l>
            <l>Beyond the Line, upon the foaming Main,</l>
            <l>He waſted o're Old <hi>England</hi> to New <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Flaunders</hi> then he rides. Where <hi>Austrian John,</hi>
            </l>

            <l>This had Eclipſed been, that brought ſo low,</l>
            <l>His Holineſſe had ſu'd to kiſs his Toe.</l>
            <l>But death the Princes, and the <hi>Peaſants</hi> fate,</l>
            <l>Caſt up his years, as lo'th to come too late,</l>
            <l>Shee ſhook him, and as often as ſhee hit,</l>
