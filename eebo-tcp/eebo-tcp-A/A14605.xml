            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Our Sauiour in the Goſpel commends the vſe of Innes. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. ver. 34. and brought to an Inne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea Chriſt himſelfe by his owne preſence did ſanctifie the vſe of Innes by eating his paſſeouer there. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 18.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In <hi>Acts</hi> 28. there is expreſſe mention of an Inne with approbation and liking. They came to meet vs at the market of <hi>Appius,</hi> and at the three Tauerns.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Common experience ſheweth all men what vſe there is of Innes for caſe of Trauailers, that their bodies which are the members of Chriſt, and Temples of the holy ghoſt appointed to a glorious reſurrection, may be refreſhed after weariſome labour.</p>
            <p n="6">6 It muſt not be accounted a ſmall matter to affoord houſe roome, lodging, reſt and food to the comforts of Gods children.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THough your houſe (as an Inne) bee open for all men to come vnto, yet account honeſt men your beſt gueſts: euer hold their company better then their roomes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Amongſt honeſt men, let ſuch as be religious withal, be moſt welcome. The feet of the Saints are bleſſed, and often leaue bleſsings behind them, as we read of <hi>Ioſeph. Gen.</hi> 39. 4. 5.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of religious and godly men let faithfull Miniſters haue heartieſt intertainement. The feet of ſuch as bring glad tidings of peace and good things, oh how beautiful are they. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Such as receiue a Prophet in the name of a Prophet ſhal haue a Prophets reward. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Be not ſo glad of your gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that you may pleaſure ſuch.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Becauſe your gueſts be Gods children, and their bodies the members of Chriſt, let their vſage for meat, lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diet, and ſleepe bee ſuch as becomes ſuch; worthy perſonages, as bee heires with God, euen fellow heires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In ſeruing and louing your gueſts, remember you do ſerue and loue God, who takes all as done to himſelfe, which for his ſake is done to his. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34. 33. 36.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Content your ſelues with an honeſt gaine, ſo vſing your gueſts as they may haue an appetite to returne to you when they are gone from you.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Make choice of good ſeruants, ſuch as know God and make conſcience of their waies: for theſe are likelieſt to be true, faithfull, diligent, and cheerefull in their ſeruice; alſo ſuch will beſt pleaſe your beſt gueſts, and will not iuſtly offend your worſt. Moreouer, God will cauſe your buſines to proſper beſt in the hands of ſuch.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Giue your ſeruants no euill example in word or deed, beare not with their lying, deceit, ſwearing, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sabbath, or wantonnes. Cauſe them to keepe the Lords day holy, going to the Church by turnes: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them how they profit by Sermons; loue ſuch ſeruants beſt, as moſt loue Gods word.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Remember ye are in the world as in an Inne to tarry for a ſhort ſpace; and then to be gone hence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At night when ye come to your Inne thanke God for your Preſeruation: next morning pray for a good Iourney.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Eat and drinke for neceſsity and ſtrength, and not for luſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. At table let your talke be powdred with the ſalt of heauenly wiſedome, as your meat is ſeaſoned with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and earthly ſalt.</p>
