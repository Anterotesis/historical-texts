            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Do not question but the Reader will expect somewhat should be premised, by way of Satisfaction, to such Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as may be suggested in general, concerning the Authentickness of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing</hi> Letters; <hi>which, as I conceive, they are reducible to the following heads,</hi> viz. <hi>An Account of the Author, and the Means whereby he got his Intelligence; the Verity of the</hi> Matters <hi>related; the Nature of the Correspondence; and what part the Methodizer has had in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; so I shall endeavour to give as distinct and satisfactory a Solution of each Particular, as may reasonably be expected from me, or the Circumstance of the Things will justly admit of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50018:3"/>
               <hi>First then for the Author, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence: The first time he went over into</hi> France <hi>was in the Year 1675, where he had not stay'd above a Year, but that the place of General Commis, or Clark of the Dispatches, and Particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis Interpreter to that great</hi> French <hi>Minister of State, the Marquess</hi> de Louvois, <hi>for the Affairs relating to our Three Kingdoms, falling vacant by the Death of one Mr.</hi> Kilpatrick, <hi>a</hi> Scotchman'<hi>s Son, that same Imployment was conferred by him upon a</hi> French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>a Favourite of his, named</hi> Belou; <hi>Who understanding no</hi> English, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not being able to manage the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair without an</hi> English <hi>Man, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was recommended to him for that service (as he hints in his first Letter) which yet you are to Note by the way, was not the first he writ from that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to that Noble Person he correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with, and to whom he was previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously engaged to transmit all the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he could learn of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the</hi> French <hi>Court, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon the said Imployment, (but they being not very material, he took
<pb facs="tcp:50018:3"/>
no care to reserve the Transcripts by him) and continued to be Interpreter of the</hi> English <hi>tongue till after the time of our Grand Revolution, when he came over into</hi> England; <hi>where his stay was not long, but that he was imployed by the same Noble Person to return into</hi> France <hi>again, where the dangerous part he was to Act may be better conceived than now exprest, but concerning which you may hear more hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its no hard matter to imagine what Qualifications were necessary to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Author to the Imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, and how far his out-side must differ from his in-side during his aboad there, which together with that part which he has Acted in that Kingdom, since his present Majesty King</hi> William'<hi>s Accession to the Throne, and that he knows not how soon he may still be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to return (though he be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in</hi> London) <hi>are Reasons of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without superadding any other, of the many that might be produced, more than sufficient for the suppression of his Name, and of my being engaged in the Work; which yet rather than Truth
<pb facs="tcp:50018:4"/>
should suffer, I am satisfied he will be as forward to render, as well known to the World, as 'tis to that Noble Person who has imployed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am of Opinion, the</hi> Reader <hi>will be much better perswaded of the verity of the Facts, as well as much more pleased with the new Discoveries of State-Mysteries he will meet with here, by the perusal of the Work himself, than by any thing I can pretend to say in the Defence of the one, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the other; And were it not to obviate a vulgar Error and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that I foresee would be made upon this Subject,</hi> That all that could be Writ has been written already, concerning the late Reigns, <hi>I should dismiss it; But now I am necessitated not to single out, but promiscuously to call to mind a few Heads (for to make an Enumeration of all the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Particulars <hi>were to run through the Contents of every individual</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <hi>and to ask the</hi> Objector, <hi>where it is he meets with an exact Account of the</hi> Private League <hi>between King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, and the</hi> French

Councellor; wherefore Mr.</hi> Skelton <hi>was imprisoned in the</hi> Tower, &amp;c. <hi>which, to name no more, though the rest are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual curiosity, as they had, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, been for ever buried in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest Oblivion, had not the Fate and Address of this Gentleman led him to fetch them out of the Dark, and almost inscrutable Recesses of the</hi> French <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net-minutes, so the</hi> Reader <hi>will find they carry so much Evidence of Truth with them, not only by the Connexion they have with many material Passages in Sir</hi> William Temple'<hi>s</hi> Memoirs, <hi>Mr.</hi> Coke'<hi>s</hi> Detection of the Court and State of <hi>England</hi> during the Four last Reigns, <hi>&amp;c. but by so natural an unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of what is obscurely, or but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siently hinted at by those learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who could not see beyond their light; and yet so remote from those Scurru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as well as Inconsistencies, to say no worse, which occur in some other pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the same Reigns, that it were a Crime to make any farther Apology for them: Yet it may be noted by the way, that this same doth evince the necessity of this</hi> Supplemental Part, <hi>as well for the detecting of past Falsities, as for the
<pb facs="tcp:50018:5"/>
perfecting of past</hi> Discoveries: <hi>And 'tis hoped no body will quarrel, that this</hi> Piece <hi>which is Entituled by the Name of a</hi> Secret History, <hi>&amp;c. should be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in an</hi> Epistolary <hi>way, when it be considered that such a</hi> Form <hi>was indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary under the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the</hi> Author, <hi>and his</hi> Noble Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent, <hi>and that there is a very engaging part naturally couched under such a method of bringing</hi> State-Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's <hi>to light, by way of</hi> Letters, <hi>which, in the very Notion of them carry something of secrecy; Though after all, the</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>cannot but observe an Air of History to run, in a manner, through the whole composition; but whether arising from the Mode of those</hi> Minutes <hi>from whence our</hi> Author <hi>drew his</hi> Intelligence, <hi>or from his own natural</hi> Genius, <hi>or partly from both, is, I confess a Question I never asked him, neither do I think the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of it of any great consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the nature and manner how this Correspondence was managed, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer may take notice that the conveyance was not so difficult; For the Post, during
<pb facs="tcp:50018:6"/>
all the time these Letters were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was free between both Nations, though he is also to observe, that some of them occasionally for fear of interception were written in Cyphers, which I retain by me, as I do the rest of the Original Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, for my own and the Worlds satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: But for the method pursued by him, during the present Reign, It will then be time enough to give such hints thereof as in prudence shall be esteemed safe and necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But though the Station this learned Gentleman was in, did, together with his own industry and curiosity, entitle him to the vast Discoveries made in these Letters; Yet the ticklishness of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and the fears of being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, together with a natural tendency that is in Mankind, to take notice of present rather than past Occurrencies, would not admit of a continued succession of writing Matters of Fact as they have fallen out in order of time; Which as it is a most convincing Reason of so many inverted and promiscuous Dates, so it has introduced the</hi> Methodizer: <hi>First, under a necessity of frequently altering the
<pb facs="tcp:50018:6"/>
prefatory and conclusive parts of the</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>and then of making up some small breaches, which under the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Circumstances must necessarily happen, and which yet are grounded upon the most irrefragable</hi> Authorities, <hi>that there might be a connection between the several Parts, and the History appear entire, and all of a piece. And it could not be thought ungrateful to our</hi> Reader <hi>to have the Contents inserted before every</hi> Letter, <hi>with the Observation of the Years, so far as was needful, when each Matter was transacted, whereof there neither was a necessity for the</hi> Author <hi>to observe to that</hi> Noble Lord <hi>to whom he was the</hi> Intelligencer, <hi>who is too great a Critick in History to need it, unless it were upon some very special occasions; neither indeed would the promiscuous way of Writing, which the stinted Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, he was under, forced to him, admit well of it; especially when these Papers at the first taking of them were not designed to be made publick. Though his own Curto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity led him to keep</hi> Copies <hi>of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he writ that was material, then which nothing is more common with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons under the like Circumstances; The
<pb facs="tcp:50018:7"/>
many</hi> Letters <hi>and</hi> Memoirs <hi>that have from time to time appeared in the World, being a convincing proof hereof; And without which Method it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to have transmitted to Posterity the thousandth part of what the World has been obliged with, in things of that kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its true there are some</hi> Letters <hi>to be met with now and then in the course of this Correspondence, which, at first sight, may seem to be foreign, and have little or no relation to the main Subject; But besides that there are few or none with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some sort of connexion, and do not in one degree or other interfere with the</hi> British Affairs, <hi>they are so much an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishment to those parts they fill up, as not to merit so severe a Censure, as to undergo the fate of being castrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Defile several Battalions of Foot towards <hi>Calais,</hi> giving out at the same time, that their Design was to Besiege <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces; and that after the Place was taken by them, it was to be delivered up to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50018:10"/>
pursuant to an Agreement made between them, that the latter had consented to give up <hi>Cambray,</hi> and some other Places, to the <hi>French</hi> in lieu of it; at which proceedings of theirs, the Queen-Mother then in <hi>France</hi> taking the Alarm, she briskly remonstrated unto them the unnatural part they acted, considering the near Ties of Blood in her Person between the Royal Families of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and how dishonourable it was to oppose the Restitution of a Prince, which they were bound to promote even by Arms, tho' he had been no ways Allied to them: but she was answered, that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reasons of state which superceded all those Scruples; that for her part, she might be assured, she should be as well provided for as otherwise; that it was not safe for her Son to be brought in purely by his own Subjects; but that if they both would have a little patience, they did not question but they had taken such Methods so to embroil and weaken <hi>England,</hi> that there would be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly room enough for the <hi>French</hi> King to bring him in, in a much more Glorious manner, so as that he might be Absolute Master of his Subjects, and have his Royal Authority no more to depend upon the fickle and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Temper of a Perfidious Nation, nor be in danger to receive any check from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that would sooner or latter prove Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and Dangerous to his State; that it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50018:11"/>
was visible the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a great hand in promoting such a Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> and therefore they desired her to consider how dishonourable it would be to the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to suffer it; and how dangerous such a Conjunction of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> (which would naturally follow) against them would be, she her self might judge; and that therefore since a little patience would Infallibly retrieve the whole Game to their Interest, and much more to her Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, they could do no less than pursue the Methods they had taken, and make both her and her Son happy, tho' it were against their Wills; that she was much in the wrong to judge of Things by present Appearances, that they were assured, however Matters might be concealed from her, the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proposed to the King her Son by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, were little to her Satisfaction, when they imported no less, than that her two younger Sons (of the Elder of whom she had conceived greatest Hopes) and her self, must never set footing on <hi>English</hi> Ground, and that the King himself must Marry a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Heretick, and suffer no <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> to live in his Dominions. But when they found all their Politicks had failed them, and that the King was restored in spight of them, according to his Hearts Content, they afterwards fell upon other Stratagems, put in due time in Execution to work upon his

            <p>IT's not unknown to your Lordship, that one Topick in the <hi>French</hi> Politicks has been now for many Years, to bring their Neighbour Princes into their Interests, by procuring them Wives; and the <hi>French</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50018:12"/>
have had an Excellent Faculty to bring over their Husbands into the <hi>Gallican Noose,</hi> tho' apparently to the hazard of themselves, and their own State; so that quite failing in their end to obstruct the King's Restoration, they now attempted to Entrap him with a Wife; I understand there were several <hi>French</hi> Matches proposed to him during his Exile, and among others a great Lady, whose Name I cannot now remember, who had like to have been afterward Married to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and whom the King hotly Courted when in <hi>France;</hi> but because he was refused by her then, he in his turn refused her when Restored; tho' in reality such a proffer on their part, was no more than to sound his Disposition towards Marrying a <hi>French</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in general; for if he had consented to have taken this Lady to Wife, the <hi>French</hi> Court would not have suffered it, because she was a Martial Lady, and of the contrary Faction to them at <hi>Paris:</hi> A second was their then Madamoisell <hi>D' Orleans,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Aunt, which Match agreed very well both with her and King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Inclination; and the King seemed forward to press it; but it was not so with the <hi>French</hi> Court, who by their Artifices put it by, as remembring likewise her Martial Temper, and what she had done, when with her own Hands she had fired off the Guns of the <hi>Bastile</hi> against the King's Party in the Wars of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50018:12"/>
how hotly she abetted the Party that stood up against the King's Legitimacy; for they looked upon her still with a Jealous Eye, as thinking her yet full of Resentment, and that she would put our King in a Martial Mood, cause him to renew the Old Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>France,</hi> and to abet the Princes that might have been disposed to renew the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the <hi>French</hi> King's Illegitimacy, and to advance their own Title to that Crown; or at least-wise, that she would put King <hi>Charles</hi> upon thwarting in all things, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might promote the Grandure of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIVth. Nay, so great was their Fear of that Ladies Issue, by any Person whatsoever, that after they had Treacherously sham'd her into a Clandestine Match with the Count <hi>D' Lauzun,</hi> to hinder her Matching with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater Person; they likewise took Care she should have no Issue, even by him, by keeping of him in Prison, and never suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to come together again till they were both past Children: The third Person I find proposed, and that in Earnest, was Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Niece <hi>Hortensia,</hi> a Match of which the <hi>French</hi> Court were very fond, and such as was every way agreeable to their <hi>Gusto:</hi> the Cardinal, besides many other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical Addresses to bring the Business to bear, got the Hook baited with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a great stock of Beauty, besides the tender of a vast Sum of Money to boot:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50018:13"/>
He took Care also to have it rumoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that such a Match was not only in agitation, but in a fair way to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, all which 'twas believed might have done the Feat, but that it having been unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily rumoured abroad, that she had paid her first Fruits already to the <hi>French</hi> King, K. <hi>C.</hi> said, <hi>He would not be content with her upon the second hand:</hi> However it were, the Reasons transmitted to the <hi>French</hi> Court, why such an Advantageous Offer was rejected by our King, were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because her Unkle had so ungenerously opposed his Restoration, and used him so Contemptuously at the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because that Alliance could be of no Advantage to him, but by a little present Money, and would besides raise Jealousies in his People against him, for which the Day was yet too early; so that seeing they found they could put no <hi>French</hi> Lady upon him, they resolved to promote the Match with <hi>Portugal,</hi> whereby, they were sure, the King would have no Issue: But that was not all, for by this means, they were in hopes to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him destitute of any Powerful Forreign Ally; and that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Married to Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in Prospect of a fair Issue, both them Matches might together lay a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50018:13"/>
for New Discontents, weaken the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between King and People, and put the Younger Brother upon Aspiring Thoughts, in Prejudice to the Elder. But because the foresaid Match with <hi>Portugal</hi> might not be thought to be of their Contrivance, and for some self-ends, they put this piece of drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery upon the Queen-Mother, whom they managed so as to give her assured Hopes, her second Son, who was her Darling, would by that means one Day ascend the <hi>English</hi> Throne, and what might not she and all of them hope from him, who had ever been much more open in Profession of, and Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But great Care was taken to give it out betimes, that this Journey of the Queen was only a Visit to her Son, now a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and in all Royal State, and that she designed quickly to return and spend the remainder of her Days in <hi>France,</hi> her Native Country; and at the same time how highly she was offended at her other Son, the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the Chancellor's Daughter, which about that Conjuncture came to be publickly known, and by whom he had now a Child Born; but whether she had any Instructions upon this Journey to break the Ice, and make Overtures to her Son about the Sale of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> I could never learn, and our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes are in a profound silence concerning it; however I shall in my next give you all the

been so long Erecting, and were now in a fair way to have laid on the Top-stone, in danger to be overthrown at one Clap, and to have all their Hopes dashed to pieces; and therefore they stood still for a Time to see what so mighty a Revolution in <hi>England</hi> might produce, and what mighty things a King in the Vigour of his Years (whom they had sufficiently provoked during his Exile) so high in the Love of his Subjects, the ancient Emulators of the <hi>French,</hi> and the People now in the most Martial Posture that ever they were in since <hi>England</hi> was a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would undertake; but finding all were <hi>Haleyon Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I do suppose your Lordship may have heard of Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> being in disgrace at the <hi>French</hi> Court, of his being forced to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50018:15"/>
flee the Kingdom, of his being at <hi>London incognito</hi> some time after the Restoration; what he was publickly accused for in <hi>France,</hi> was that he had favoured the Adverse Party about the Point of the Legitimacy, that he had invited Madamoisell <hi>d' Orleans</hi> to aspire to a Match with our King, and Abetted the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of <hi>Rome</hi> against those of the Court, about the then growing Difficulties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Regale;</hi> but what ever the Reasons were, they were never Published, nor suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be so much as entred in the Minutes of other Secrets; but this is certain, that our King interceded with the <hi>French</hi> King on his behalf, and that he was admitted to return, and I have been assured, it was by the way of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and was sent afterward Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Rome;</hi> but whether all this was a Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, to carry on a Negotiation about <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> I will not positively affirm, but it looks as much like a <hi>French</hi> Trick, as one Egg does another.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pressed our King very early for the Restitution of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably true, and made pretty large offers, and it is as true that the King rejected their Proposals, which yet did not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries, of whom they had by this Time many in <hi>England,</hi> as the Minutes shew, who having ingratiated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Chancellor, and other hungry Courtiers made also their Overtures; and

told the King withal, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was to have that Town only for a Temporary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for so much Money due to him for his Assistance against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that therefore it was a Matter of Right they insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted upon seeing they were now ready to lay down the Summ, with more then Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, nay, and they were so bold as to tell him farther, that if he refused to give it for Money, they would endeavour to recover the same by a War, and questioned not the Junction of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with them, both by Sea and Land in that Case; they being as unwilling as the <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> should have footing so near them on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and in effect they made use of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Faction, and some <hi>Jews</hi> their Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>England,</hi> more then any Body else to bring that Affair about; and because they would be sure to meet with no Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by renewing their Instances to the King, and alleadging a greater right to the Town then the <hi>French,</hi> they amused them with a Design they had to restore it to them again, upon a reasonable equivalent in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and gave it out that they had entred into a Treaty already with them upon that Head; but whether it was so in Reality I cannot tell, and this is all that I am able to inform your Lordship concerning our parting with that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Place; Only that the summ paid for it

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50018:17"/>
all Thoughts of Military Glory, so far as if there had been a sudden Transmutation of the <hi>Genius</hi> of the People, they resolved to make another Essay upon the easie temper of the King, and try whether he would also part with <hi>Tangier</hi> unto them; but whether it were that the King was sensible already of his Mistake in parting with <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi> or that this very Motion of theirs put him upon considering what he had done, and the great Error he had committed in Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thereby, it is certain he gave them an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Denial; and that their Minutes speak, but say withal that to be revenged of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and make him odious after their usual Manner; this Court ordered it however to be reported as if he had been willing for it; and further add, that the Kings real An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, that <hi>Tangier</hi> being his Queens Dowry, to whom he had not long been Married; it would not at all suit with his Honour to sell it, neither could he well part with it, unless he parted with Her; that it was by Parliament annext to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and so could not be Sold without them; that if both He and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament too might be willing to sell it at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time; yet to be sure, it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to think of it just then, when after so much Treasure and Blood spent upon it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, it might if ever, prove of some use to the Nation, in the War then like to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

with the <hi>Dutch:</hi> that he could not part with it to the <hi>French</hi> King so well as to any other Christian Prince, nay not so well as even to the <hi>Moors</hi> themselves, without giving a very just and therefore a dangerous Cause of Jealousie to his People, especially in that Juncture, when by the Carriage of the <hi>French</hi> he had great Cause to suspect, they were Jealous of his grandeur at Sea; and would joyn with the <hi>Dutch</hi> against him: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of his, I must tell your Lordship, was indeed one of the secret Causes among others why they soon after actually joyned with that Nation, to diminish our Power, to sham them, and weaken and undermine us both, as well as to hatch up a Navy of their own; and since I am entred upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; your Lordship will pardon me, if I proceed a little further, and acquaint you; that they did afterwards renew their Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Sale of the said Place, with much more earnestness then before, and that at a Time when their Interest was much stronger, and more prevalent at our Court; and yet even then, tho' the Parliament had denied him the supplies which he demanded extraordinary, as your Lordship well knows, to be appropriated for the maintenance of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and that he was in great streights for Money, he would not sell it to the <hi>French,</hi> nor restore it to <hi>Portugal;</hi> but chose rather to demolish it, and abandon it to

briefly; when they found our King did not lay hold of those Advantages put into his Hands upon his Restoration to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self great at home and formidable abroad, and made not the least meen of a Martial, Designing and Ambitious Humour, they made it their first business by their Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's at our Court, to hinder his closing with <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other in the Interest of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> by making up the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Match, as I have already hinted to your Lordship; next by gaining the Duke of <hi>York</hi> timely over to their Devotion, and then by other Emissaries and Pentioners, whereof they had good store, both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to stir up such Disputes between the two Nations as might end in a War, and so divert the first Essays of the Power of our new Monarch from themselves: In this how admirably they succeeded, is well known, the <hi>Dutch</hi> on the one side being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly incited and encouraged to Insolencies and Encroachments, and the <hi>English</hi> to as deep Resentments; insomuch that a War was hotly urged against them by our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it self; the <hi>French</hi> Court in the mean time playing Bopeep with them both; for it does manifestly appear by the hints that I have seen, that they promised Succour to both Parties in Case of a Rupture, though it were really resolved to see us fight first, and then succour the weakest, and so

kill two Birds with one Stone, that is, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and weaken both our Naval Forces, and make use of one of us to increase their own Naval Strength, till which War was very inconsiderable; which they most effectually did, for they no sooner saw the Ballance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to our side by the first great defeat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in that War, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the Assurances before given to the King, they not only sided with the Enemy; but drew the <hi>Dane</hi> too into their Confederacy, tho' they never did either of them any good by fighting for them at Sea, but only by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing one at that Time in the highest Favour in our Court; I need not Name him, got a part of our Fleet, sent on a blind Errand after theirs, where 'twas sure not to be found, while the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the rest of our Ships and Commanders, were left to batter one another to pieces to make them sport; having gained their Ends in this Point, they proceeded and gained also another of yet more dangerous Consequence, and that was to get the unthinking <hi>Hogens</hi> to build them most of the best Ships, they now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess, and with which they have since scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Dutch</hi> both before <hi>Palermo</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therParts, and with which they have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed since to Match either them or us; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, my Lord, by the Minutes of the Lists we have of their Navy, whereof some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were Printed, but at present I cannot help

            <p>THE Reformed in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> since the King came himself to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Government, had rather been retrench'd in their Liberties, and decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Power than otherwise, whereas while <hi>Mazarine</hi> was Minister of State, he (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Queen Mother's virulancy against them; whether it were to Cajole <hi>Cromwell</hi> and their then Governing Powers in <hi>England,</hi> or out of his avertion to the Clergy in general, of whose Abilities as well as Honesty he had no great Opinion) things went tolerably well with them; but now that the <hi>French</hi> King found himself couped up with the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple League,</hi> and considering that any rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Procedures against the Protestants in his own Dominions, would at this time be interpreted much to his disadvantage by those of other Nations, and particularly, that there was no hopes to break the said League, or to disunite it, especially the King
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50018:24"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> of whom he conceived the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test hopes, and had the greatest Eye upon, as being not only nearest, but also most powerful of any of the rest; it was resolved to put forth an ample Declaration in Favour of the <hi>Reformed,</hi> which revoked several un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Judgments given against them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied many Important Difficulties and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities they laboured under, whereof they had made their Complaints to the King, and which gave them hopes that they should for the future be left to live in Tranquillity and Peace. They knew well enough, unless this were done, there was no very great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood to bring our King to their Bow, of whom the Parliament had already entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some Jealousies, and who would not fail to be enraged, when they came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand he had entred into an Alliance with a King, who gave way to the Oppression of his Protestant Subjects: but this specious pretence of the <hi>French</hi> Indulgence, might serve him very well to amuse his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at the same time to deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and the Protestant Nations in general without, might very well believe the <hi>French</hi> proceedings herein, and especially that part of it which related to the Reformed's future Tranquillity, were real; when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>France</hi> were fully perswaded of it, and imagined that the Days of <hi>Henry</hi> IVth, were returned upon them again. It's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50018:24"/>
there had been considerable Efforts made, since our King's entring into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned Tripple Alliance, to have it further strengthned by the Accession of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Protestant Confederates into it; and that there was a certain Person whose Name was <hi>Marcilli,</hi> a <hi>Rocheller</hi> Born, and a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the Reformed Religion, that took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains in it; the true Story of this Man is very odd, and falling pat with the Design of this Letter, I shall give as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise an Account of it as I can, not doubting of your Lordship's kind Acceptance; this Person, I say, taking the Advantage of the Conjuncture of the League between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and very much doubting of the sincerity of the Declaration made in Favour of the Reformed in <hi>France</hi> thereupon, made his Application to several Protestant Princes about entring into the said Alliance, and was no small Instrument to induce the King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> to come into it, which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its being called the Tripple League. He had been also at our Court, and opened the King's Eyes, in relation to many things that had been misrepresented to him, and wherein he had been imposed upon, either by the <hi>French</hi> Agents, or the falsity of his own Ministers of State; but these Addresses of <hi>Marcilli</hi> were not long concealed from the <hi>French</hi> Court, wherefore they took Council, and dispatcht away the Mar-Marquess

               </hi> into <hi>England,</hi> with Instructions to take off those Umbrages our King had taken, upon the Conduct of the <hi>French</hi> Council towards him; the Marquess his Religion, being a Protestant, as well as his Capacity, recommended him as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Person to assure the King of the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>French</hi> proceedings, and that the Reformed should have all the Justice in the World done them; in short, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess did his Business so effectually at our Court, that tho' he were the Reformed's Deputy-General, he had almost Bankrupt his Credit with all the Churches, who did not a little resent his Complaisance upon that Head. <hi>Marcilli</hi> having done, as he thought, his Business in <hi>England,</hi> was gone upon the same Negotiation to the <hi>Swiss</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, not without Directions, as 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>France,</hi> tho' dissembled for a time, from our King, to induce the <hi>Swiss</hi> to come into the Alliance; whereof when <hi>Ruvigni</hi> had advertized the <hi>French</hi> Court, the King gave Mareschal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who yet made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Protestant Religion, Orders to Seize him, if possible, and Kidnap him back into <hi>France;</hi> the Mareschal to disguise the Matter as much as might be, and to give as little umbrage of any such Design as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, pitcht upon Three Officers making Profession of the same Religion with himself, to go into <hi>Switzerland</hi> to Seize him; the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50018:25"/>
sameness of Religion between <hi>Marcilli</hi> and them, gave them easie familiarity with him; so that at last having got him into a place where he could not be rescued, they hurried him into <hi>France,</hi> where he was Tryed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with and Condemned; the Man during his Imprisonment, shewed all the Constancy both of a Brave and Innocent Mind, and all the Application of the Judges, and Rigour of the Questions put unto him, could never make him change his Language, but he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Innocence to the last, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets he had been entrusted with by a great Prince, whom I have heard some of his very Enemies blame for not interposing in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, or afterward resenting of it at all, when there were some things put to him in relation to that Princes Person, that little suited with his Honour; even upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place of Execution, just as the poor Man was broken upon the Wheel; and now, my Lord, they had Murdered his Body, they went about also to Murder his Fame, by giving out that they were forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite his Execution, because that having found a piece of Glass in the Prison, he cut off his Privy Parts therewith, as thinking he might quickly bleed to Death, and so be his own Executioner; which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being soon observed by the Goaler, he gave the Officers notice thereof, who put him to Death Two Hours after. And that

               <hi>France</hi> might seem to be sincere at all Points in respect to the Liberty of her Reformed Subjects, out came another Declaration in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 1669, inviting all of them that Sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad, or were in the Service of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, back into their Native Country, and particularly out of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> where there were of them great numbers, as Officers, Soldiers, Merchants, Seamen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but tho' they were thus liberal in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to the Reformed, and made all the semblance of Sincerity in the World here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, yet they never ceased underhand to tempt the most Considerable Persons amongst them, by large Donatives and Hopes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to come over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and what Success they had therein will be the subject of another Letter; and so I am,</p>

               <hi>FRance,</hi> as I have informed your Lordship in my last, having invited her Subjects of the Reformed Religion home out of all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Prince of <hi>Tarent,</hi> who had been settled several Years in the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and possest of great Employments, quitted their Service thereupon, and returned to his Native Country, where he had not been long arrived, but he was Charmed into the Popish Religion, and all his Children, (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one Daughter, afterward Married to the Prince of <hi>Oldenburg)</hi> following his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; This they looked upon as a good step, but what gave them a mighty accession of strength, as much as it was a diminution of the Power of the Reformed, was their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mareschal <hi>Turenne</hi> to their Church, who, because so considerable a Person, and so famed for a great Captain, I shall recount unto your Lordship all that ever I could learn in relation to him upon this account. It's true, the Mareschal never did appear
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50018:27"/>
to be a Person very Zealous for his Religion; but as he had from time to time given some Proofs of his Constancy, it was attributed to the Coldness of his Temper, which made him Calm enough in all things; but that Constancy that appear'd in him for a time, was attributed afterwards to other Causes, and primarily to the ascendency his Wife and Sisters had over him, his Lady being Daughter to the Duke <hi>De la Force,</hi> and a Person of Exemplary Piety, keeping of him steady in his Profession whilst she lived, and his Eldest Sister the Marchioness <hi>De Duras,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways encouraging of him to be constant; and so Zealous she was, that she began to breed up one of her younger Sons, with a Design to make him a Minister, but that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign not succeeding, &amp; that Person going over very Young into <hi>Engl.</hi> has been since, as your Lordship well knows, advanced to Honour in the Kingdom. The youngest Sister the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess of <hi>Trimonill</hi> never failed also of her Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards the Mareschal in that kind. That the Marshal had been often tempted to change his Religion, is manifest; Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> who had a great Opinion of him, made him many suggred Promises if he would come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; when the <hi>Dauphine</hi> was Born, he had Intimations given him, that he might one day be made his Governour, but that did not move him neither; the last Effort that was made upon him, was by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50018:27"/>
at the beginning of the Campaign in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the Year 1667. when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him a share in all his Secrets, and higher degrees of Command, if so be he would Embrace the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but this had the same suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess upon him with the rest, and the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal acted his part with so much sted fastness, and in so Noble a manner, that the King took no Displeasure thereat; and for this the Church at <hi>Charenton</hi> returned Publick Thanks to God, who had inspired him with such laudable Constancy, but without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of him, but some time after that Peace was concluded, when there was no more talk of him upon that Score, he entred into the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and it was given out he did it voluntarily, and of his own accord, and I could ne'er learn by whose Instigation it was done, or what were the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that brought him to it, but however it was, this Change of his was attended with important Consequence, which did appear in due time; and this is all I could remark or learn concerning this Illustrious Person, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he Abjured his Heresie (as they call it) in <hi>Notre-Dame,</hi> in presence of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Paris;</hi> and so concludes,</p>

            <p>I Have in a former Letter, shewed your Lordship the great Care the <hi>French</hi> Court took, to have it believed, both at Home and Abroad, that their Declaration in Favour of the Reformed was real, and like to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, and what Politick Ends they had therein; but a Book Entituled, the <hi>Policy of France,</hi> came out not long after, to wit, in the Year 1669 that had like to have spoiled all the fine Web they had spun; It was supposed to be written by the Marquess <hi>De Chatelett,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and contained one entire Chapter of Methods to Ruin the Reformed, and he was so Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous as to Dedicate it to the King himself, and made him a Present of one of them; but his Zeal was but coarsly Rewarded, for he was sent to the <hi>Bastile</hi> for his Pains, and the Book supprest; but because the Methods he proposed therein were such as were very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50018:28"/>
odd, and may be put in Execution in time, and that I cannot send your Lordship one of the Books, I have taken out the Heads, and are as followeth; he proposed the Total De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them as a necessary Work, and reserved it for the present King, and whether he did really know, or was ignorant of the Court Designs, he did certainly I believe fit his Politicks to the Intentions of the Court. He represented them full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment for the loss of their Places of Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of being always animated with Minds to Revolting, Confusion and Anarchy, and constantly ready to make use of any Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to Re-establish themselves; He made them to be Enemies to the King's Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perpetual Obstacles to his Designs, and always to be feared because of their Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and of the number of good Soldiers, over which they could make Chiefs, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Authority to Command them. He took upon him to shew, that the Protestants of <hi>Germany</hi> suffered themselves to be ruined without any Opposition, and that they had too much need of the King's Protection, to Embroil themselves with him: He said the same thing of <hi>England, Swedeland, Denmark,</hi> the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and of all the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, whom he imagined to have been so linked to the King by strong Chains of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, that they would not concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to hinder his Exterminating of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50018:29"/>
Reformed Religion in his own Kingdom: He put a Malicious Interpretation upon the Reformed's taking up Arms in the last Civil Wars; and he pretended to Divine, that had it not been that the War had been so soon happily terminated, they would have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Grand Designs, made High Demands, and endeavoured to set up their Party again) He said, the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> was revocable, as having been a thing extorted from the then King; and admitting it might have been formerly granted for the Benefit of the State, yet it might now be revoked for the very same reason: He was far from being of their Opinion, who thought that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed were useful to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self, because they obliged the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks to Study, and lead Regular Lives; he said, that was a Trifling Argument, and concluded, that the King had sufficient Grounds to seek out ways to put them out of Condition to Hurt, or do any injury to his State. Having promised this, he was not of the Judgment to be rid of them by way of Banishment, as the <hi>Moors</hi> had been driven out of <hi>Spain;</hi> he looked upon that way of Treatment Inhumane, and withal prejudicial to the State, but he proposed Fifteen Expedients to be rid of them by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little. The first of which was, to procure a more familiar Intercourse between the Reformed and Catholicks. Secondly;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50018:29"/>
That they should be Rewarded with Estates and Honours that would be Converted, and to have a Fund setled for that end, which should ne'er be alienated; that for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of their Ambition, and not suppress that Passion in them which might serve as a Sting to their Conversion; He was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they should be permitted to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the smaller Offices, But not to give them great Places, but to the Catholicks only, for to Allure the Reformed to a Change of their Religion, in hopes to attain unto them. Thirdly, To Embroil the Affairs of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons, so as to make them attend the Council, and principally the Gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all the Dependances of the Exercises of their Families. Fourthly, To oblige them to Rebuild the Chappels they had Demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Prophaned, and that not by proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against them in general upon that Head, but by Suing of particular Persons upon that Score, and to Recommend it to the Care of each Bishop in his Diocess. Fifthly, To hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Deputy-General to interpose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which he believed might be easily effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the <hi>Hugonots</hi> could not form a Body in <hi>France,</hi> and that particular Cases ought not to pass for publick ones, and that the King would Administer Justice without any Intervention; he would not have the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Deputy-General supprest, but reduce it only to a Name without any effect, and that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50018:30"/>
no regard should be had to the General Remonstrances of the Deputy. Sixthly, To order it so that none of the Reformed should be suffered to dwell in Cities, or the Seigniories, which did appertain to such as were of their Religion; and he would have it so as they could never want specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to colour that Innovation. 7thly, To suppress by Death the Charges of Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors among the Reformed. Eighthly, To send Catholick Commiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries into the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and to chuse such Persons for that end as understood Controversie, and knew how to foment any Differences which might arise in the Assemblies; to allow no National Synods; and to require Money of the Ministers for the King's Use, under pretence of Loan, Tythes, or some other Imposition. Ninthly, To Commence some Law-Suits against them for their Debts in common, and to cause some of their Churches to be Sold. Tenthly, To Enjoin all the King's Subjects not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Kingdom without leave, for the Reformed would be comprehended under such a general Order. Eleventhly, To prevent any Catholicks by means of the Confessors, to put themselves into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> Twelfthly, To oblige them to observe the Fasting Days, under pretence of State Policy, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as they were obliged to keep Holidays.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50018:30"/>
Thirteenthly, To endeavour to Marry the Reformed into <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and to take Care that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren proceeding from such Marriages, were brought up in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenthly, To hinder the Reformed to Sell their Estates in Land, for that such sort of Estates being not to be carried away, it would oblige them to keep within the Kingdom. And Lastly, he advised, That the University of <hi>Saumur</hi> should be removed to some other more inconvenient place, for which he furnished them with several pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and he was of Opinion, that for lessening the number of Ministers, that the Candidates before they were received, should be obliged to go through a Course of Philosophy, or Study Divinity for Two Years; that they should be Examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other Commissioners than such as the King should name, and that none should be suffered to take the Function up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them till they were twenty-seven Years of Age. I have troubled your Lordship with a long Letter upon this ungrateful Subject, but I hope you'll pardon me, since I think it's not altogether Forreign to what I have some time since writ to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, about the <hi>French</hi> Courts procedure in reference to the Reformed, whom they made it their chief Business to Cajole into a profound Severity, that they might have

them with Apprehensions somewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the first; among which neither <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Holland</hi> were without some Fears, both which they took Care to allay, as the Minutes shew, by exasperating of them afresh by Secret Agents and Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, one against another; resolving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their Instruments should prevail on either to join with one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But which of the two they should Attack, was a long time the Debate of the <hi>French</hi> Council, for one of them, it was resolved without Contradiction, must be Invaded; it being impossible to make any Successful Attempt upon the Empire, as long as those Two Countries maintained the Figure and Power they did then, and in that untoward Scituation for them too; <hi>England</hi> was then in a very unprepared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, having almost no Navy at Sea, and none but the ordinary Forces at Land, whereas theirs were all ready and well Disciplined and Commanded; and this unpreparedness of ours was a great Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to most of the <hi>French</hi> Council, to put their King upon the Immediate Invasion of <hi>England</hi> with his whole Force, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fore-felt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and found them, if not Inclinable to join with them in such a War, yet content to sit still and be quiet; they moved it so hotly that they had like to have carried it, which had

they, <hi>England</hi> had run a very great risque at that time of being Ruined; for said they, If we make sure of <hi>England</hi> first, we shut a Back door fast against all Danger, and may then securely Attack the <hi>Austrian</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, having first Trampled down the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in our way, of whom, having made sure of the <hi>De Wits,</hi> (their then Chief Ministers) we shall find an easie prey: But just as the Ambition of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was ready to take Fire at those so specious Motives, Monsieur <hi>Le Tellier,</hi> since Chancellor and Father to Monsieur <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi> the Eldest and Ablest Statesman and Minister of <hi>France</hi> interposed; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of whose Speech I shall take Care to transmit to your Lordship in my next, who am,</p>

            <p>ACcording to my Engagement in my last, I shall now entertain your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Mons. <hi>Le Tellier</hi>'s Remonstrance, upon the Advice given the <hi>French</hi> King to Invade <hi>England;</hi> He did acknowledge, that the Counsel proposed was in it self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, supposing there were a certainty of effecting it; but it was to be considered, that it would prove of most pernicious Consequence in case the same were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without Success. That <hi>England</hi> was the Rock against which the late for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> had dasht in pieces its Aspiring Fortunes, and that the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition now by the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> would prove alike Fatal to its Rising Power, unless they were Infallibly sure of their Blow; For to meddle with <hi>England</hi> at all, unless they could absolutely Conquer it, would be but to rouze a sleepy Lion, slur the Reputation of their Arms, and singe the Wings of their growing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50018:33"/>
before they were fully fledg'd; That it was impossible to make such a Conquest, but by Intestine Divisions or Surprize, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were first Masters of its Outworks, the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> That for a Surprize he thought it almost impracticable; and that tho' it was possible they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to join with them, and <hi>England</hi> was then indeed unprovided of Forces both by Sea and Land, yet there was no trusting to that, because there were no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then, whose Designs were ripe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Favour such an Enterprize: And that tho' they should prove so Successful in that Advantagious Juncture, as to enter <hi>England,</hi> they could expect no greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it, than just to frighten the King and the Nation, and plunder them of a little Wealth, and so be gone, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but a <hi>Tartarian</hi> Expedition of it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the universal and strong Antipathy of the <hi>English</hi> People, both High and Low, against the <hi>French</hi> Name and Domination, would be an Invincible Obstacle to their setling there, and would quickly make that Island too hot for them. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meerly to Attack and Pillage them, without being able to reduce them totally, would but whet the Animosity of those Warlike Nations, whose Courage had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been wont to be heightned by Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, and was always Victorious, when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50018:34"/>
once fired with Indignation; That such an Enterprize would for ever alienate the Heart of the then King, and the whole Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, from the <hi>French</hi> Interest, and make them by Inclination as well as Interest, not only give way to, but passionately to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet and make most Advantagious use of the Natural Animosity of their most Warlike Subjects against <hi>France;</hi> That it would Unite the Peoples Hearts so firmly to their King, and create so much mutual Confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that it would be impossible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to divide them, and so raise the Power of that Monarchy to a pitch, from which it could not chuse but prove both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and fatal to them; That it would rouze up the King, then almost Drowned in Voluptuousness and Sensual Delights, and make him a Man both of War and Business against his Will, and cause him to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such Alliances with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and other Powers, as must needs be of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Consequences to the Designs of their great <hi>Bourbonian</hi> Hero; That therefore it was better not to think of any such Attempt, <hi>England</hi> being like a Flint, sooner broken by soft than hard Methods; That the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and also his Brother, were much <hi>French</hi> by Inclination at present, that the former was very Indulgent to his Pleasure, that he was that way so Profuse and Prodigal, that he would always be Necessitous of Money,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50018:34"/>
which his Parliament beginning to grow weary of giving him, it would e'er long cause such strugglings between the Courtiers and Patriots of the Country, as would give them ample Scope to compass their Ends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by a more sure and less dangerous way than by a War, which in all appearance would defeat all the Advantages they might otherwise reap there by other Methods. That therefore the best way was to endeavour to take Advantage of the King's Infirmities, to try whether there were a Witty <hi>French</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that could be Fortunate enough to gain on his Affections, for that such an one would be a most Admirable Instrument for them; That they should offer him Money, and feed his Extravagance that way, send dexterous Persons well furnished with Golden Charms, to work on all the Leading Men among all their Factions, and secretly to keep some Pensioners, both among their Courtiers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots and Church-men, and blow up and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new Divisions; That they should send thither some very able Embassador, and keep him there a long time; That they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to a new War with the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> with them, and treat with and Promise Assistance to the former, to the last Moment; but in Conclusion join with the latter, if it were possible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the <hi>English</hi> King to a War. And that on that pretence, they might procure such
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50018:35"/>
numbers of <hi>English</hi> Forces, especially Foot, as might not only amend the Defects of their own Soldiery, which still came very short in good Infantry, but bring their own Native People by degrees, inferring daily Examples of Strangers Bravery, to imitate their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Firmness in Set-Battels, and to get a Stock of good Infantry by Land, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>English</hi> to them against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as they had already done of good Ships by Sea, and Warlike Munitions, by joining before with the <hi>Dutch</hi> against the <hi>English</hi> in the former Wars. Yet that they might so order things, that whatever Stipulations were made with the King of <hi>England</hi> to his Advantage, to allure him to such a War, should be eluded, and he only made a Tool of; That tho' it was likely the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> would upon any great Success of the <hi>French,</hi> be for breaking of the War, and deny the King Money to continue it longer, yet after they had made a sufficient Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> they might prevail by their Golden Arguments upon the King, at least to continue Neuter, and leave his Land Forces still in the <hi>French</hi> King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for some considerable time; That this Juggling would in a little time raise Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and Jealousies between the King and Court-party, and that of the Patriots; make the latter to deny him Money, press hard upon his Prerogative, raise new Pretensions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50018:35"/>
about Liberty and Property, which if care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fomented by dexterous Agents, would give the King and People there work enough in mutual Contests at Home, which would hinder them from acting any thing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Abroad, keep the King always under a necessity of continuing their Pensioner, for fear of becoming his Parliaments Underling; yet prop him up so as to preserve him in a Capacity, still to be able to keep them in some sort under, and hinder the daring <hi>English</hi> Senate, from attaining any more so much the Soveraignty, as to Erect themselves into a Republick; He telling them from the Famous Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Authentick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that an Absolute Monarch, or a Republick in the <hi>Brittish</hi> Dominions, would prove almost alike Fatal to <hi>France;</hi> that therefore it was the best way to endeavour a Mean between this <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> by keeping a Ballance between King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and fomenting perpetual Contests between them, which was to be done by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unknown Instruments to sow Jealousies among the Patriots and People against the Court, and make them cross the latter; and at the same time make use of that crosness as an Argument to perswade the King, that his Authority could be no way safe without sticking to their Alliance, and feed him with Money both to enable him to carry on his Business and Pleasure without a Parliament,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50018:36"/>
and to Animate him from time to time to Prorogue and Dissolve them upon occasion. And when upon some Success of the King and Court—party, they should begin to make such steps towards Absolute Power, as might, if attained to, prove dangerous to the <hi>French</hi> Interest, and Embolden our Monarch to slip his Neck out of their Collar; then anew to stir up the Patriots and Popular Party against him, and abandon him wholly to them, till he were forced to break them, by returning to their Alliance again. That above all things they were not to forget to make their best use of that mighty Engine called <hi>Religion,</hi> which tho' powerful all the World over, yet was of more prodigious force among the <hi>English</hi> People, than among any other in the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earth: Now this Advice, my Lord, as coming from so Old and Experienced a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Ablest Disciple who had <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> heard the Documents and Precepts of the great <hi>Richlieu,</hi> that Famous Architect of the <hi>French</hi> Grandure, was assented to both as the Wisest and Securest, and was afterward in every <hi>Punctilio</hi> put in Execution, as Time and Conjunctures afforded occasion; whereof your Lordship may expect an account in due time from him who is,</p>

            <p>I Cannot think but that your Lordship will be pleased to understand how the <hi>French</hi> keep their Correspondence among, and make Tools of Men and Parties most averse to them in their Neighbour-Nations, and whom no manner of Motives would ever be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enough to make Instrumental to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an Interest so hateful to them, did they but know who they wrought for, and it is, my Lord, in this manner. Would they set the Conformists and Nonconformists peckee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at one another? Thus they did it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the first <hi>Dutch</hi> War, in order to prepare Factions to make way for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs which followed. They had diligent Spies to inform them where Men of quaint Wits, brisk Tempers, Self-conceited, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical in Principles, or at least of very loose Morals were to be found, as likewise to take notice of those that were in reality most Able and more Zealous, both of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and others, in their several ways, than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50018:37"/>
the rest of their Brethren; Then the first, by some Persons that pretended to admire their Wits, and that were <hi>French</hi> Pensioners, (tho' some of them did not know it) were either by some present <hi>modicum</hi> of Money, Promise of Preferment, or sometimes by the meer tickling Praises of the said qualified Persons, put upon writing something that might check Religion, particularly that Established; Then they knew the Crime would be laid at the Door of some Nonconformists, and cause the Reforming Clergy to write bitterly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectingly against them, and them again to justifie themselves and recriminate, till at length they engaged not only the Body of the Nation, but even their <hi>August</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives likewise in their Quarrels, and so from Religious Contests produced State Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and in this all of them, tho' they were of different Parties, were told they would please both their King, Parliament and Country; For the Dissenters were told, that tho' for Policy's sake the King did not publickly abet them, yet he was secretly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to favour them, and such Writings, if well penned, would not displease, and might procure them at last Ease in a Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for the Conformists, they were easily perswaded, that by Ridiculing the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, immoderately extolling the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their own Ceremonies, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative extent of the Prerogative, they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50018:37"/>
could not fail to please neither. And thence, My Lord, came that Legion of Books of that Nature, that came out in the Interval between the Two <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars, and which made way for After-Divisions, of which I saw a Catalogue, with the Books printed, and of what Service they were for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the <hi>French</hi> Court; Some I have forgot, and some I remember, but shall not name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for fear of reflecting on any worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who, I am perswaded, did not know by what Instruments they were abetted on either side. Then for keeping several Lords and Commons too in Pension to their Ends, without their Knowledge, thus they did it; They had their <hi>Jews,</hi> and some other Bankers at their Devotion, who would under an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of great Secrecy, tell them; that they were ordered to allow them so much Money, saying sometimes it was from their own King, to do him some private Service, in or out of Parliament, or from the <hi>Spanish, Imperial,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambassadors, under pretence of serving their Interests, and their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries too, against Prerogative, Oppression in Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and oftentimes directly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Popery, and the <hi>French</hi> Interest, that by firing them on with too great vehemency to pursue those Points, the <hi>French</hi> Court might more easily compass other Ends aimed at, which they whom they thus incited did not so much as dream of; Thus while many in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50018:38"/>
our Parliaments were so fierce against Papists, Arbitrary Power, and the <hi>French</hi> Interest, and cried out against all of the Court-party as <hi>French</hi> Pensioners (tho' 'tis true, too many of them were so) as does appear; yet little thought they, that they were likewise so themselves, and never imagined the same <hi>French</hi> were Abettors of both Parties: And the better to cover this underhand play, they drew off most of the Money they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to this latter sort, by the way of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, Florence, Amsterdam,</hi> and <hi>Hamburg;</hi> that it might not be discovered, it came Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from <hi>France;</hi> Nay, my Lord, by the by, be pleased to take notice that one main cause of the <hi>French</hi> King's Indignation against <hi>Genua,</hi> tho' it be a very secret one, and known to few, was their Bankers cackling, and discovering to the Agents of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> the Money privately sent and dispersed, and sent towards <hi>Poland, Hungary, Turky,</hi> and some other Parts not named, and has made them imploy none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since almost, but what are openly or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly <hi>Jews,</hi> who serve the <hi>French</hi> King with great Fidelity for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is in their Esteem the most Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because he Favours the Grand <hi>Turk,</hi> where they have so great a Commerce, and are in such numbers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because he gives them a liberty by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance, tho' not open Toleration.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50018:38"/>
4. Because he is so great an Enemy to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family, who have been so Cruel to them by the Inquisition, and by Banishing them not only out of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Territories, but likewise out of the Emperor's Hereditary Countries.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And lastly, Because he seems to them to be of no Religion, but almost as great a Scourge to the Christians in general, both Popish and others, as the <hi>Turk, Tartar,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian;</hi> their Principles naturally leading them to admire and revere any thing they think a Plague to Christians, whom they are taught to Curse daily, even in their Solemn Prayers; and therefore <hi>England</hi> had need have a Care of them in this Juncture.</p>
            <p>But as for the Pensions they gave the Courtiers, they Industriously affected the transmission of those Moneys from <hi>France,</hi> and had their Agents busie to buzz it abroad, in order to render them odious to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to incite the Patriots the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently against them; And tho' a great part of the Money they allowed the King from time to time, were sometimes transmitted from the abovementioned Places, and some from <hi>Venice,</hi> yet private notice was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to their Agents in <hi>England</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, with positive Orders to inform the World of the Truth of that Intrigue; unless it were some time when a particular Critical Juncture might require a contrary Procedure.

            <p>I Have formerly given your Lordship an Account of the great Levies in <hi>France,</hi> and vast Preparations for War both by Sea and Land, what Care had been taken to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Domestick Peace in the mean time, and what the Opinion of the <hi>French</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of State were, in regard to what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try should be Invaded by them.

their Military Preparations were pretty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which was in the Year 1670. they began to make frequent Reviews of their Troops, which to amuse, they continued till the end of the next Year, in several Bodies towards as many different Frontiers, that their Neighbour—Nations being used to them, and seeing no Effects follow, might think they were only done out of a Vanity to make Ostentation of the <hi>French</hi> Power and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, to keep their Soldiers in Discipline, and find their Nobility and Active Spirits Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, who else might busie themselves for want of Occupation in disturbing the State: The Artifice took, so that most of their Neighbours, tho' now and then they were troubled with a Fit of Thoughtfulness and Suspicion, begun to grow secure, and particularly the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who thought the <hi>French</hi> King so much in Jest, that they tau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

was the Council was held about the Eligibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of employing their Force, the Debates whereof I have already given your Lordship an Account. And as the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Jealous upon this approach, the <hi>English</hi> were much more (as your Lordship may well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to see such a Power brave <hi>England</hi> on the opposite Shore, and look with an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Eye towards it; and the more because of the unprepared Posture the Nation was then in; insomuch that it was thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable, to dispatch an Embassy to sound the Intentions of the <hi>French</hi> Monarch in regard to <hi>England;</hi> whereupon Choice was made of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who admirably well maintained that Character, and the Glory of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> on that Occasion; and demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself with such an Intrepidity of Mind and Conduct, and with such a Grandure and Unconcernedness at the Formidable Armed Powers he saw before his Eyes, that those who had been Strangers to the then Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Nation, would have thought he had been sent from a Prince that was at the Head of twice as big an Army, as the <hi>French</hi> King at that time shewed the Duke: And that Conduct did not a little appall the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of that Ambitious King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to the inclining of him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in Monsieur <hi>Le Tellier</hi>'s Counsel; but then withal, making him take notice of the Rare and more than ordinary Parts and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50018:40"/>
of the said Duke, it put him naturally upon concluding that it was well worth the while to endeavour to gain such a Person o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his Interest, whose Influence might be great, either in bringing his Prince to such a Compliance as he desired; or at least in briguing for <hi>France</hi> against him, in case he proved inflexible: To this end, such Complements were past upon the Duke, and such extraordinary Honours done him, and Presents made him, as never no Embassador before nor since hardly ever received; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Duke suffered himself to be Charmed, and ever since favoured the <hi>French</hi> Interest, either with or against his Prince, as Occasion or Policy directed. In fine, he was told, that the <hi>French</hi> King indeed, tho' he had great Temptations from Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Interest to Attack <hi>England,</hi> yet such was his Respect and Inclination for our King, that he was more disposed to imploy his Forces against <hi>Holland;</hi> And that he might with the surer Success undertake such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, his Majesty earnestly prest the Duke to do his utmost to Influence his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to join his Naval Forces with him in that War, by which means he might Revenge the Disgraces received in the last, especially that of <hi>Chatham,</hi> as likewise the fresher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies of that Saucy Republick, whose Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity and Power was so much the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the <hi>Brittish</hi> Monarchs, than to any
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50018:41"/>
other Crowned Heads, as the Subjects of these Nations were more prone to hanker after the Liberty Enjoy'd by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and to imitate their Successful Example; That by so doing, his Excellency would do his own Prince very great Service, and have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Obliging a great Monarch, who was as Generous in his Resentments, as Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Duke returned Home well satisfied, and brought a pleasing Answer to our King, and plyed him warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Proposition aforesaid, tho' at first he was not much harkned too; but how, when and by whose means their Designs were afterward Accomplished, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may expect to hear, when Conveniency serves, from,</p>

            <p>THe <hi>French</hi> Court having, as I told your Lordship in my Last, gain'd the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> entirely to their Interests, they began now to conceive some hopes to bring our King to joyn with them against the States, at least wise with his Naval Power, of which they had most need; and therefore to strike while the Iron was hot; they deliberated of sending over an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador of their own into <hi>England</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate the Matter; but to colour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, as if they had no Design of their own thereby, and to give no Matter of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to their Neighbours, especially the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces. It was agreed, it should be a Female Embassadress the Kings fair Sister <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and so give out at the same time, she went over purely on a visit to her Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50018:42"/>
and that it was with some seeming Reluctancy the <hi>French</hi> King upon her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Application to him to that Purpose gave his Consent; But she was furnished with such Proposals, which they knew well that sent her, none could with equal safety and privacy Advance, nor none with equal Power and Influence recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; and to secure the whole Transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the very Suspitions, as well as the Penetration of any not of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, and to make it appear as a pure visit, and the effect of natural Affection and void of all Intreague, her return was limited to so short a Time, and in so peremptory and notorious a Manner, that it might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the World to believe them too Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the natural Inclinations, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might still retain for her Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and for the Weal of her and their Native Country, so incompatible with the exorbitant grandeur of <hi>France,</hi> to entrust her with any of the mysterious <hi>Arcana's</hi> of their Politicks; and so might prevent all Jealousie in <hi>England,</hi> at that critical Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of that interview, by shewing so great an Apprehension of it themselves: She was charged with the same Message partly, and with some of the same Arguments, which they had endeavoured to insinuate by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> but having an incomparable Advantage above him,

or any other Embassador to back whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she advanced with all the Charms that a most accomplished and lovely Princes, and an only and most beloved Sister, could be armed with; she who had Wit and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity enough, to manage those Priviledges to the utmost Advantage, not only prest the said Matter, and more home and with infinitely more Freedom and Efficacy, but adventured to propose, yet higher things and of a much more extended Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; For addressing her Speech to the King (though not without intermixing some Expressions equally affecting also to her Brother the Duke of <hi>York)</hi> she told his Majesty that as she hoped neither of her Royal Brothers had any Reason to call in Question her natural Affection to their Persons, and inseparable Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for whatsoever did, or should at any Time appear to her to be conducing to their true Interest, so she believed they had as little cause to doubt, but she could see as far as another into the <hi>French</hi> Monarchs Heart, who loved her and admired her to that Degree, though innocently, as gave no small Umbrage to <hi>Monsieur</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and her Husband; And that she did sincerely represent, both as his most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Majesty's Sence, and her own, that the only way to secure to his Majesty, and the present Royal Family of <hi>England,</hi> a

more convenient for Trade, than their own Country, or at least into those Parts of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> which should be reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the King of <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> To whose Domination, as approaching near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the Sweetness and Freedom of that they now were under, they would certainly more willingly submit their Persons and Fortunes, than to that of the more Absolute one of the <hi>French</hi> Monarch, for which they had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Thousand Prejudices. In fine, she most earnestly and affectionately besought him to take those Matters into his most serious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and to return a speedy, and if it might any ways be, a favourable Answer, that she might have the Happiness to return back the Messenger of good News, and such News as might prove a Foundation of a last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Felicity to both the Illustrious Families, from which both his Majesty and her self were descended. The King after a little si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, told her by way of Reply to the things she had represented to him, That it was impossible for him to doubt of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and reality of the Affection of a Sister so Amiable, and who had always exprest so much Tenderness for his Interest; That he as little questioned, but that she had penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as far into the Interiors of his Brother of <hi>France,</hi> as it was possible any one could into the Heart of a King, and therefore upon her Representation of him chiefly, which he
<pb facs="tcp:50018:45"/>
assured her would induce him to give the more Credit to the Favourable Conjectures, he had made of his Temper, during the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time he had the Honour to Converse with him whilst in Exile, and to the general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he had, since his Personal Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Publick Affairs, obtained in the World, of being a Prince of great-Honour and Generosity, and thereupon passing by some former unhandsom and unkind Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his Court, as pure Effects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the over-ruling Ascendant of the then Regnant <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and not of that Prince's own Inclination; he should put much Confidence in the sincerity of the most Christian King, and accordingly desired her to return his said Majesty, his Royal and most Hearty Thanks for those obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Amity and Affection, he had signified to him by her, and to assure him in his Name, he should ever have his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in high Esteem, and would go as great lengths as in Prudence and Interest he could, to serve him, and to comply with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: But that the Matters proposed being of the highest Consequence, he must beg his Excuse if he required more time to give him a positive and satisfactory Answer thereto, than the short space limitted for her stay in <hi>England</hi> would permit; however, that he would with all convenient Expedition give him a better Account; In the mean while,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50018:46"/>
he should Request his most Christian Brother by her, to do him the Justice to believe he was as sincerely affectioned to his Person, as he could be to his, and should ever persist to be as far as a King of <hi>Engl.</hi> could, his constant and most Obsequious Friend: The like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, as far as it was agreeable to his Circumstances, was returned by the Duke; After which the Princess renewing the Charge in the Business of Religion, the King freely told her, That as to that Point, tho' he had entertained very kind and favourable Thoughts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and its Professors, for several Reasons he instanced, and did believe, that if it were Re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Dominions, the Monarchy would be safer and easier than it could be under the present state of Protestancy, yet he was not so fully satisfied in it, as to make it his own Religion; and that on the other side he foresaw such unsurmountable Difficulties in attempting such a Re-establishment, that he did not think any Policy, no, nor the whole Power of <hi>France,</hi> could he Command it all entire, without any divertion from other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested Neighbours, (too extraordinary a Juncture to be probably expected) could be able to carry him through them: To which, the Princess who saw well enough, as well by his Looks and Actions as by his Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that she had made more sensible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50018:46"/>
upon his Spirits, than he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to acknowledge; thinking she had done enough for her part, and sufficiently broke the Ice, for those that should be designed to push the Point further at more leisure, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly replied; That since that was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Sence, in which he was fixed, she would wave all farther Importunities on that Subject, and leave it wholly depending between himself and God, whom she would continually pray to Inspire his Majesty with Light enough to know, and Courage enough to embrace the Truth, in his appointed time; But however, she should be glad to know his Majesty's Sentiments as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign against <hi>Holland;</hi> adding, that she was confident, he could not but think it was at least for his Interest, and seasible too: Yes, Madam, answered the King, I am Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that if crowned with Success, it would be enough for the Interest of this Monarchy, and of my People too; but yet as practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it seems to be to you, it is likewise not without its Difficulties, and those very great ones too; for the ill Success of my last War with that Nation, the Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my People thereupon, the Tripple League in which I am lately engaged with <hi>Holland,</hi> the Inclination my Subjects have for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as being a Protestant Nation, and the Implacable Avertion they have to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50018:47"/>
the <hi>French,</hi> and their Jealousies of their Power, and of their Religion, are mighty Obstacles in the way; However, if my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France</hi> can propose me any practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expedients to remove them, which I much doubt, I will, as I have said, do what I can to comply with him in that Enterprize: And so the Princess declaring her self well satisfied, with what had been said upon the Subject of her Errand, they passed from the Businesses of State, to the Divertisements of the Court, from which being obliged much sooner to break off than they were willing, by the more swift than welcome approach of the time Limitted for her departure, with unconceivable Regret, and ill-presaging Tears, she took her leave of her Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; tho' little did she or they imagine it to be her last Farewel, for soon after her return to <hi>France</hi> she died, not without vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Suspicion of being Poisoned; But that her Husband the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> had any just Cause given him further to foment his Jealousie of her upon this Visit, (for he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was suspitious of her Conduct before any mention of that Journey) and so push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on to the practice of undue means to accelerate her Fate, has been a Matter of much Discourse both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and continues to this Day a Mystery, which I will not nor cannot pretend to determine,

Name of Madam <hi>Carewell,</hi> but much better since by the Title of Dutchess of <hi>Portsm:</hi> to serve the <hi>French</hi> King as a Heifer afterwards to Plow withal, as being such as was not carelesly or fortuitously picked out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>French</hi> Herd, but expresly singled out for that purpose: And how well she acted her part in time coming will appear in its proper place, so that if they failed in their Ends of furnishing the King with a <hi>French</hi> Wife, they were resolved to make it up, by supplying of him with a <hi>French</hi> Whore; and this being an Omission in my last, and having nothing of greater Moment to write at present, to keep my Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with your Lordship, I have taken the Opportunity to testifie unto you how ready I am,</p>

               <p>The paces made by the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and afterward by the Princess <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Orleans,</hi> towards bringing the King over to joyn with the French against the Dutch, not fully succeeding according to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, they resolve upon other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods: First by making sure of the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and then by inciting the Dutch to provoke the King to a War with them.</p>

            <p>I have given your Lordship an account of the Princess <hi>Henrietta</hi>'s Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England,</hi> and of the Kings dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Answer, in regard to his Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>French</hi> to make War upon the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> which put the French Polititians somewhat to a Nonplus; but considering how well inclined the Duke was to the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and how he had exprest his thoughts to the Princess, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, of the advantage and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the French Proposals, they made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50018:49"/>
an Essay, to see what they could do that way, and whether the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he had with, and Influence over his Brother might not induce him to accept of the offer. They found him plyable enough; but upon Application, he did not find the King so, but much more disposed to live at Rest and Pleasure, than to engage himself in so much Sollicitude, as a War would inevitably bring him to; And besides, he was much afraid to discontent his People further, who were already so ill satisfied, with the ill Conduct and Disasters that befel them in the last War, and whom he knew so wholly averse to a new one, unless the Fresh Water-Gandy-Caps and Feathers especially were dismissed, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of it wholly left to the Old Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polians, who so successfully asserted their Cause with those People in the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> and <hi>Oliverian</hi> times, the happiness of which the late ill Success had much enhaunsed in their Eyes. Yet the French Agents continued pressing of him, and tampering with his Ministers to compass their ends; urging all the specious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the World, and sparing neither present Advances of Money, nor the most Magnificent Promises of future Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; but finding still a great Resistance to any such Overtures; they at length resolved to play their Game
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50018:49"/>
another way, and employ'd their Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries in <hi>Holland,</hi> to stir up those Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to provoke the King's Resentments by all the ways that Artful Malice could devise; they caused him to be represented to them as a mean Spirited Prince, drowned in Pleasures, and by them Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; and that would put up any Affronts, rather than be weaned from them a Moment. That slender courage he had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cowed in the last War, as likewise were the Spirits of the proudest Merchants and Seamen, his Subjects, under such an Unactive Prince; adding moreover, that to their certain knowledge the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was now a Papist, tho' in hugger mugger, and that the People had a strong suspition of it, how clandestinely soever carried, and had thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such an implacable Jealousie against the Duke therefore, and against the King himself on his account, that they would never patiently brook the Command of the one, nor heartily assist or fight for the other, in a War against a Protestant State; but break into Factions, and rather abet them, then support so Unwarlike, so Unfortunate, and what was worst of all, so Popishly affected a Prince: that therefore now was the time to give that finishing stroak, to that so Great, so Glorious, and so Advantageous a Work to their most Puissant and Renowned Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50018:50"/>
which they had more than half done in the last War, under the favour of the most Powerful Assistance of their great Master, <hi>Viz.</hi> to obtain for ever the dominion of the Seas, so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for by the <hi>English,</hi> and ingross the whole Trade of both the Hemispheares to themselves; And that in so Glorious an Undertaking, As the Great Monarch of <hi>France</hi> had, when in extremity, most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely and successfully assisted them in the preceding War; So he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do in this, not with a few Auxilliary Troops and Ships as before, But with his whole Force; being resolv'd of nothing less than to concur with their High and Mightinesses for the Absolute Conquest of that Queen of Islands, that had so long domineered over the Sea, and pretended to give Laws upon that Element, which God and Nature had left as free as the Air it self. And that their High and Mightinesses might enter into no Umbrage of his designing any Greatness to himself, that might be prejudicial to them by such a Conquest; he was content to share it with them, and that so Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Favour, that he would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himself with the two Poorer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the former for the sake of its Ancient Alliances with his Kingdom, and the latter because of the Conformity of the Religion of its

native Inhabitants, with that of his own Subjects; leaving to them the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, which was <hi>England,</hi> where all the Chief Trade, Riches and Power, both by Sea and Land of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Empire, was concentred together, with all its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dependances both in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> with which he could not pretend to meddle; the success of which Proposals I design shall be the subject of another Letter with the first opportunity, From</p>

               </gap>e Inviting Proposals made on the <hi>French</hi> King's part to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my last to your Lordship, so tickled the <hi>Hogens,</hi> that they suffered themselves to be deluded into a close Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the French Court for that great
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50018:51"/>
Expedition; not at all thinking what Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine was designed themselves, and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their own Territories between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> was then Modelling among the <hi>Monsieurs,</hi> as a further tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to induce our King to arm with <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Holland;</hi> and that the very League the <hi>French</hi> pretended to be making with them, was but the master Stratagem to procure that other Allyance, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the unexpected and timely interposition of Divine Providence had proved the <hi>Mene-Tekel</hi> of their Flowrishing State, and turned that great Magazine of the Trade and Riches of the Universe into a sorry bank of Lillies; accordingly they began first to insult our King in his Person, by multitudes of most scandalous and insupportable Pasquirades and Pictures, which the French Agents endeavouring to make him resent as they deserved, and finding still that he declined to comply with their desires; alledging again for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, the ill success of the last War, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed chiefly by them, the averseness of his People to another War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And farther, his unwillingness only for Injuries that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally concerned himself alone, to engage those Nations again in so bloody and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive a War, as after all could be of no very considerable advantage to either side, be the event what it would. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded then to tempt him further by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50018:52"/>
a larger proportion of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces when Conquered; and besides, such an assistance in Money, as should enable him to go through with the War, tho' his Parliament should deny their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with him therein; and to make their perswasions the more effectuall, they did again warmly ply the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> attacking of him on the blind side, <hi>Viz.</hi> his Religion, and telling him, that tho' he were privately a <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple began to have a strong suspition of it, and would at long run come to know it, and would not fail then to make such strong brigues against him, as that they would certainly put him by the Succession; unless before such a Discovery were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made, he could induce his Brother to joyn his Arms with those of his Most Christian Majesties, for the Conquest of <hi>Holland;</hi> where were the Vitals that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred Life and Spirits to all those Factions he had to fear, and which after the Conquest of that United many-headed <hi>Hydra,</hi> would soon be supprest, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut could be by no other way: and that then the introduction of the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these Kingdoms, whenever he should succeed to them, would be easie, else im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; that his Most Christian Majesty was then provided with such formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forces, and had laid the Empire into such a Sleep of Security, and so amused
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50018:52"/>
the other Neighbour Princes, with such doubtful and contrary appearances; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could awake, and rub off the dust they had thrown in their Eyes, they might have done their work on the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who least of all the rest expected an Attack, and were therefore unprovided. The Duke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enough before, but now quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by these pretences, became their most earnest Sollicitor anew to the King; but tho' he neglected nothing in that case, that a Prince of that great influence over his Brother could do, to bring him over to consent to the Measures concerted between the <hi>French</hi> and him; He found him still inflexible and averse to a War, not out of any disaffection to the Cause, but out of a love to ease, and a Principle of Fear, as I have formerly hinted to your Lordship: Upon which the <hi>French Council</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their last Master Stroak in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, resolving in case they succeeded not therein, in spite of all hazzards to take the opportunity of joyning with <hi>Holland,</hi> to Invade and Conquer <hi>England,</hi> if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To this end they had all along ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged a close Treaty with <hi>Holland,</hi> even while they were endeavouring one in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the powerful Negotiation of their Friends the <hi>De Wits,</hi> and <hi>Lovestein</hi> Faction: So then still the more to rouse up our King's Resentments, or to Force him, to make appear to the World, that he had indeed

none, neither for his own Royal Dignity and Honour, nor for the Honour or Interest of his Relations and Kingdoms, nay not so much as a sense of the preservation of any of them from Dangers, tho' never so visible, so present, and so fatal to all and every of them; they put the <hi>De Wits</hi> on all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts they could to keep down the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Illustrious Family of <hi>Nas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which Design being thus set on foot by those Ministers, the

               <hi>French</hi> still the more eagerly to incite them to pursue their Point, insinuated to them; That the only way to expect the full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of their Desires in the total Destruction of that Family, would be to cause a new War to be declared against <hi>England,</hi> upon the plausible Pretences and Encouragements before mentioned; in which Juncture the People of <hi>Holland,</hi> who in the Prince his Fathers time, had begun to conceive an Umbrage of that Family would be the more easily brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to what remained, to the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving and Disinabling them to aspire to any Greatness that might be above their Pity: and that by the potent and auspicious Assistance of the <hi>French Monarch</hi> in that War, the States coming to overpower so gloriously their Rival in Trade, and to acquire a Possession of so great a share of the <hi>British</hi> Dominions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50018:54"/>
to the same, if not much greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Priviledges, then those that had been so long enjoyed by that illustrious House; in which, addeth they, you may be assured, that from time to time, you shall never want the friendly Offices, and most efficacious Assistances of our invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monarch, who is no less Constant, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and Magnificent, in his Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards his Allies and Friends, then he is Formidable and Inflexible in those to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Enemies. In fine, they soothed these miserable ambitious Ministers to that degree, and acted that Sham-Treaty with <hi>Holland,</hi> by their means so to the Life, that the States not doubting but they were in earnest, made all the forward Steps ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable towards the Alliance proposed, and began to Arm by Sea, not minding how careless a Posture they left all their Places by Land, as dreaming of nothing from <hi>France</hi> but Friendship and Assistance. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly that Faction having with all the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> imaginable, concerted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, he like a sly Gamester, wheedled them to sign their part in it, and sent it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as privately to his Master; who, said he, would not fail immediately to answer them with a Counter-Change; telling them, that by this means, they should shew a great deference to his Dignity, and the Figure he made in <hi>Europe,</hi> and testifie their great
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50018:54"/>
Confidence in him, then which nothing could be more obliging to a Crowned Head, especially to him, who much more then any other Prince, valued himself upon his Honour and Integrity: and besides, would contribute much to the success of the great Enterprise they were joyntly to go upon; because by this means their common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign would be most dexterously concealed from the <hi>English Court,</hi> whom his Master, said he, amused all this while with a sham-Alliance, and hopes of making Peace with you for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so keeping them from Arming for their Defence, and so afterwards be executed with such a surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Celerity on them, that they should sooner see the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet on their Coasts, and the <hi>French</hi> Troops on their Land, then hear of them. The Stratagem took, and the Instrument of the said Treaty was with all expedition sent ready Signed by the said Faction, to the great <hi>Monsieur,</hi> who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed speedily to answer the Ceremony on his side: And now the <hi>De Wits</hi> and their Party were Cock-a-hoop, and were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in hopes, sharing their part in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Spoil and Division of the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy; when the more politick <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi> having brought them into the Snare he had laid for them, instead of sending back and Signing a Counter-change of the said League to them, sent it secretly to his Embassador in <hi>England,</hi> with Orders pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50018:55"/>
to shew it our King, that he might by that be convinced what advances, the People he was so hard to be perswaded to wage War with, had made to attack him and his Kingdoms, as they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy insulted his Person, Honour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And how affectionate his Master was to his Majesty, who was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from all the Advantages he might pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially hope to reap by such an Alliance, in that disadvantagious Posture of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish.</hi> Affairs, and rather inclined to joyn with his Majesty against those sawcy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans,</hi> and sworn Enemies to all Crowned Heads: Ordering him withall, to tell him, that the Obstinacy he perceived in his Majesty, in refusing to vindicate his own, his Families, and his Kingdom's Honour and Interest against them, had prevailed with him, to push on a Treaty with them so far, as to get it, by Address, Signed by them afore-hand; that he might have wherewithal to give his Majesty an undeniable Proof, both of their malicious and dangerous Intentions, and of his own sincere Inclination to his Majesty; and delude them into a security, that might hinder them from providing for any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by Land, against the Forces he had ready to pour in upon them; in case his Majesty would please, while it was yet time, to joyn with him. And further, to add, that for his part he had not Sign'd it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50018:55"/>
yet, but was ready to Sign one much rather with his Majesty, and would on that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition so protract the time with delatory Answers and Excuses, that their present Naval Preparations should be eluded, and they attacked, when they least expected, and when his Majesty might have time enough to make sufficient Provision, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him therein by Sea, to both their certain and glorious Advantage: And lastly, ordering the said Ambassador in the close to tell his Majesty roundly, that tho' indeed he had carried on that sham League for the Reasons afore-said, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Interest of his <hi>Brittish Majesty,</hi> as well as his own, for the better conviction of him, of the Necessity, as well as Convenience of joyning with him, and lulling the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy into that security, that was necessary to the Success of the Arms of both Crowns; yet if after all these steps, his Majesty would still persist to be deaf to his own Interest, so visibly and plainly made out to him; that truly his Master then would be forced to decline those of his Majesty, take new Measures consonant to his own, and in a word, turn the sham Alliance into a true one, by immediately Signing and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging it; and at the same instant, joyning with those Enemies against him, without giving him time to make any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Preparation, that might enable him to weather their first Attempts; for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50018:56"/>
that it was his Masters undoubted Interest to keep great Forces on foot, and not to keep them idle: And that therefore if the King of <hi>England</hi> would not joyn with him, to employ them where he had most Inclination, and much Interest too, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them; he would be forced by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est against his Inclination, to employ them against him, being resolved to employ them some where; and so the Ambassador con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Harangue, as I shall conclude this Letter, having been tedious, I am afraid, to your Lordship; and so remain,</p>

            <p>HAving in my last to your Lordship, set forth the successive Intrigues of <hi>France,</hi> to bring our King into their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and to come to a Rupture with the <hi>Dutch</hi> States; their Artifices, especially the last (as how could it choose, unless he had been indeed the Log, he has been resembled to) wrought so effectually with him, that he then, without Reluctancy, consented to the <hi>French</hi> King's Overtures; and an Alliance was, tho' very privately, concluded on, wherein were inserted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for a projected sharing of the States Dominions, already Conquered by our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as we had been before by theirs; and now both Courts concert Measures to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Amusement of the Enemy, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50018:57"/>
to gain some other Neighbours into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence or Neutrality. The <hi>French</hi> King after some Demur, to gain time, and to finish his Intrigue in <hi>England,</hi> had no sooner concluded it, but after his usual way of Dissimulation, sent back the Instrument of the Treaty with <hi>Holland</hi> to the States, but with such Additions and Amendments, as he knew would take up time to debate, tho' couched in most suggred Words, and backed with large Promises, of continuing and augmenting Friendship: And having in the mean time gained the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Munster,</hi> and some others on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> partly by Money, and partly by deceitful Pretences to joyn with them: They had also the vanity to attempt (tho' the very Thoughts of such an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were charged with insuperable Difficulties) to delude the very <hi>Spaniard,</hi> if not into a Compliance, yet into a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality with them, while their Forces should be acting such Tragedies, as were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their view, and not without passing through their Country, they having such Creatures and Factions in <hi>Spain,</hi> as they much confided in; but after all their Wheedles and Intrigues there, they found such strong Opposition made by the <hi>Queen-Mother,</hi> who was a great Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> as gave them little grounds to hope for any great Success in that Negotiation; so that they began to content themselves with what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50018:57"/>
they thought they were sure of, <hi>viz.</hi> By gaining of so much time, in keeping of Matters in suspence, both in the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> Councils, who were naturally slow enough in their Deliberations, as might suffice them to accomplish their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon <hi>Holland,</hi> before they could be in a readiness to hinder the finishing Stroke; (If so be, they should declare for the States against them, as was to be suspected they would) after which secure of Success, they concluded they should be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to attack, rather then to expect the whole <hi>Austrian</hi> Force, tho' fortified with the Succours of all the rest of <hi>Christendom: My Lord,</hi> I am not at present furnished with the Topicks they went upon, to bring the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to a Compliance in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but I hope I shall be able to give your Lordship a good account of them in my next, which shall be with the next conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, but in the mean time, I am,</p>

                  <hi>Coleman</hi> being engaged in the French Interests, here follows the Topicks he went upon, to induce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to a Neutrality in the War in 1672.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat the French Ministers are <hi>Gens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax omnia perpeti,</hi> is very manifest, by what I have written to your Lordship before; but to be so adventurous, as to form Topicks for the engaging those in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Interest, to favour their Designs, by deluding that Nation to a Neutrality, seems to be a Master piece of their Policy, as well as Audacity: Having therefore gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> whom they judged of any other, the most proper Instrument to carry on such a Design, they formed the following Topicks for him, the better to help him to compass it; and he was to urge closely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That tho' his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty had been by the intollerable Insolencies, and base Outrages of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and necessitated much against his Inclinations, to depart from so much of the tripple League, as concerned the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50018:58"/>
yet he would not fail to retain still, his Inclinations to promote as much as lay in him, the chief Intent and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it; which was in Substance, to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from aggrandizing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to the Diminution of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but more particularly to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Catholick King, during his Minority, provided he would stand Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That his Neutrality would be a firm Security to him, of what he yet possest in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by obviating, and taking clean away from the <hi>French,</hi> all manner of pretences to molest his Subjects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the destroying the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who were base Rebels to him, (and whom it was as much Scandalous as Pernicious, for any Crowned Head to suffer to flourish and prosper in Wealth and Greatness, as they had but too manifestly done, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their Neighbours, and much less to abet) would be highly Beneficial, and of manifold Advantage to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majesty. For that the vast Trade of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and other great, populous, and flourishing Towns in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the other Provinces, being ruined and depopulated; many of the Inhabitants, at least all those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, a great many of the <hi>Deists,</hi> and other <hi>Adiaphorites,</hi> who were very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and careless, whether they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50018:59"/>
any publick Worship at all, or no, but chiefly, and above all other things, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trade and Gold, with which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Territories swarmed above any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either on this, or the other side of the Hemisphere, would, without all doubt, refugiate themselves, as being nearest, and most commodious for them, in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Territories and Provinces, especially <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and would quickly multiply and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in them, not only People, but Trade and Riches, from whence, encrease of Power and Strength, both by Sea and Land, would be a necessary and infallible Consequence: And that then, the now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most abandoned City of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> once the most famous, and most flourishing City in Trade, of this part of <hi>Europe,</hi> should have free liberty to lay open her <hi>Scheld</hi> again, now damm'd up by the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> and recover her former Riches, Glory, and Strength, as would necessarily all the other <hi>Spanish</hi> Cities, and trading Towns in that Country, in a proportionable degree, which would be a means to make <hi>Spain</hi> herself become much more Flourishing and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> would by this means, have her Hands quite rid of the most troublesome, as well as dangerous Rival, in Trade and Conquest in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> of any other <hi>Europian</hi> Nation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; in which respect, neither <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50018:59"/>
nor <hi>France,</hi> tho' trading Nations, as being Monarchies, had not been, nor indeed could possibly be, or become so prejudicial to it: However, they might, perhaps afterwards, be fortified with new Accessions of Strength and Power; as that one single <hi>Republick,</hi> which, tho' scarce of one age's Growth, had yet already, to the Amazement, as well as Detriment of their Neighbour Nations, and especially the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Territories belonging to it, monopolized into her own Hands, the advantageous, and incredibly gainful Trades to the great Kingdoms of <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts, both of the <hi>East Indian</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Coasts, whither in former times, no other Nations in the World, besides those of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> had any manner of Access.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Power of that upstart <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> was already at that exorbitant Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Grandure, that there was no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, either of humbling or depressing it, and much less of a total Subversion of it, by any other in <hi>Christendom,</hi> then the united Powers of the Kingdoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and yet things were brought to that pass, that if timely care were not taken, to have the said <hi>Republick</hi> removed out of the way, or at least mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to a very great degree; it must of necessity, in a short time rise up, as <hi>Old Rome</hi> did, to such a prodigious Strength,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50018:60"/>
Power, Dominion, and Grandure, that it would give Law to all the Crowned Heads in this part of the World; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, at last devour them, since it well appeared, and was conspicuous to all that did not wilfully shut their Eyes, that by such little Blows as the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alone was able to give them, in the late War, and Sea Engagements they had with them, their Experience, numbers of Seamen, Power, Strength, and Riches, were every day advanced and encreased, after the Respite of a small breathing time of Peace: And that consequently, if his <hi>Catholick Majesty,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or rather the <hi>Queen Regent</hi> and Ministers, as also his <hi>Imperial Majesty</hi> should suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so over-ruled by such a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as well as unseasonable Jealousie, so far, as by their Interposition to obstruct and hinder the now probable Downfal of that usurping, and encroaching <hi>Republick,</hi> what could they expect and hope for in the Revolution of a few Years, but to see those very People, whom, by their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Solicitude, they had saved from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, be so adventurous, as to seize into their own Hands, by way of Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for their Kindness, their precious Mines of Gold and Silver, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico;</hi> when it should be quite out of the Power, either of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or indeed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50018:60"/>
both of them together, should they find themselves so disposed, to prevent their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Loss, which would be not only a most pernicious Blow, but, as might very well be feared, even a deadly one to the illustrious House of <hi>Austria,</hi> as well as a very sensible one to all the other Princes and States of <hi>Christendom:</hi> And therefore it could not but be a matter even of high Importance, and greatly for the Interest and Benefit of his <hi>Catholick Majesty</hi> and his Subjects in general, for him to resolve to remain and continue neuter, in this War that was to commence shortly against the united <hi>Dutch Provinces,</hi> and to connive at, and give way to the Success of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Nations; since it was evidently as necessary and requisite, for the Safety and Grandure of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain, ut deleatur ist a Carthago,</hi> as it was for that of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> from whom a mutual Jealousie, which, as it ever was, could not but be still continued, would sufficiently secure <hi>Spain</hi> to all future Ages, from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any such Violence, or making any such Attempts on their Golden, and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>West Indies,</hi> as would certainly, as well as unavoidably, be made in less then half an Age upon them, by the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Holland;</hi> If his <hi>Catholick Majesty,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and his other Allies, should stand so far in their own Light, and become guilty of so much Imprudence, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50018:61"/>
could hardly be thought of them, as to give any divertion unto, or otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the only Powers in <hi>Christendom,</hi> that were able to prevent that Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and render it quite of none Effect.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That his Most Christian Majesty <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIVth of <hi>France</hi> had solemnly engaged to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majesty the King of <hi>England,</hi> that upon the Condition of a Neutrality agreed by <hi>Spain,</hi> he was willing to relinquish all pretensions to the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> and all the other Dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to get that same Renunciation Signed and Ratified by the <hi>Dauphine</hi> his Son, as well as by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and to leave no room for any future Jealousies, even by the consent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Three Estates of his Kingdom, whom he would take care to Assemble for that very end and purpose, as also by the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> that so all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and pretences of any future War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> might be entirely and totally cut off by this one Amicable and Advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; nay, and that rather than fail in this particular, his <hi>Most Christian Majesty</hi> would be brought to re-deliver to the <hi>Catholick</hi> King, even all the Towns, Cities and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories taken from him by <hi>France</hi> in the last War, and keep strictly to the other, as well as the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Treaty which was as much as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could wish for themselves
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50018:61"/>
or had upon any occasion insisted upon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the <hi>French</hi> King would be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to give such strict Orders to his Troops and Armies, that in all their March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es through the Countries belonging to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they should be so far from being injurious and burdensom to the respective Inhabitants of them, that they should receive very great benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from them, by their exact and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paying for what ever they had of them, and that he would afterward leave such a firm barrier on all sides the Country, as should for ever secure them from all Apprehensions of encroatchments from <hi>France</hi> or any other Neighbouring Nation whatsoever; and that by this means the <hi>Spanish</hi> Territories would remain very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and be filled with Money and all sorts of Rich Commodities, whilst the <hi>United Provinces</hi> would be run down, and never be in a condition to molest or annoy them more; and what advantage and security that would be to them, they themselves could tell, and a remembrance of former experiences in that kind, must needs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate and add strength to the same.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That there was no just cause of Jealousie to be entertained, or any great Reason to fear the growing greatness of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for that the accession of strength, which by such means might in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50018:62"/>
happen to her, would be much more than ballanced by that which would accur to <hi>England;</hi> by which his <hi>Britannick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would become a much more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assistant to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, against any Violations of Treaties that might afterward upon any account whatsoever happen to be offered by the <hi>French,</hi> then he could be at this juncture of time, even tho joyned with the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> of <hi>Holland;</hi> and yet rid the <hi>Catholick</hi> King even at the same time of such a dishonourable as well as dangerous Ally as <hi>Holland</hi> was at present, and which would certainly prove within a small Revolution of Years a destructive Enemy also, if they were not now in this favourable nick of time obstructed and throughly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the King of <hi>Swedland</hi> who was the other Crowned head that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himself in the Triple Alliance for the protection and security of the <hi>Spanish Netherlands,</hi> was likewise of the same mind and disposition to remain Neuter in the present case, unless he were provoked to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English;</hi> But that however he would at the same time joyn and sincerely concur with his <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majesty for the guaranty of this desired and useful Neutrality with <hi>France;</hi> that both Kings would be ready to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a League Offensive and Defensive, with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50018:62"/>
the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to assist the same with their full force and whole power, against any manner of infractions that should happen to be made, or fall out against this or any other former Treaty or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on the part of <hi>France</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And Lastly, That the <hi>French</hi> King was ready and willing to accept their guaranty and not only so, but freely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> and other of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, that could be brought to stand Neuters, and were willing to enter into the same, to be made Partners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; that all the World as well as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Spain</hi> might be convinced, beyond all suspitions to the contrary of his Most Christian Majesties, as well as the King of <hi>England</hi>'s sincerity in that matter.</p>
            <p>These, my Lord, were the instructions Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had, and the Topicks he was to go upon for the carrying on this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Design; but how far he put the same in practise, that I could never learn; but he was not the only Engine they imploy'd for that purpose, they had their Agents in <hi>Spain</hi> it self, who did their utmost to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this Neutrality of which I may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give your Lordship an account ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; In the mean while I am,</p>

into his Kingdoms again, which great and glorious, as well as meritorious Work, the <hi>Catholick</hi> King and those who had the Administration of his Dominions ought to have to heart above all other Interests and Considerations whatsoever, especially since this would enable the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to do <hi>Spain</hi> many good and friendly offices in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> as well as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and be a means to ballance the <hi>French</hi> Faction there, when they should take upon them, as they frequently did, to oppose the Interests and Advantages of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> as <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth and other Kings of <hi>England</hi> had formerly done before the Schism broke out, and their Kingdom came to be overspread with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie; But you know, my Lord, the effect this and the former bait and flourishes have had; for <hi>Spain</hi> after some short disimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to gain time declared for <hi>Holland,</hi> on whose fate they well foresaw that of their <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the whole Fortune of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> depended; in which resolutions notwithstanding all the Artifices used to the contrary, they were seconded by the Emperor, who then had his Arms loose, and by some other Princes on that side, whom tho' they fail'd to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enter into an Alliance for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Holland,</hi> yet they have met since with too much success in rendring their Conjunction as little hurtful to them as

Charms, upon such methods as would Bankrupt his Reputation with his own Subjects, and so become an entire depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon them for his support.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50018:65"/>
and keep up his Dignity and Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any attempts, which the Jealousies caused by the faults he had too unwarily been insnared into by his false Friends on this side, might so strongly influence most Orders of Men in one degree or other unto throughout his Kingdoms against it, and which he might easily be induced to choose; prefering rather to be a Pensioner, and at the beck of a Forreigner, then the courtesie of his own Subjects, who have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refused to support him in what tended to his real Interest and Honour upon any moderate prospect of security for it; but things did not end here. The other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of theirs was not only in view but close at the heels of Granting a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion by vertue of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Royal, of which your Lordship will hear more in my next, in the mean time I am,</p>

            <p>IT was not enough for this Court to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the King to consent to a second War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and shutting up the <hi>Exchequer</hi> purely to serve their Interest and Designs, but they must put him upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother piece of State-Druggery, which at the same time, I am well satisfied he was not of himself much averse to, and that was the Declaration of Indulgence to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consciences, as they have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to cant it; they knew well enough what severe Laws were in force against all those that dissented from the Publick Church, and some of them fresh enough in memory not to be so soon forgotten, and they knew full as well, that both the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and Presbyterianly affected Persons as well as the Prerogative and Republican Party who then began to revive, that were about the King, would greedily promote it, or at leastwise some of all the mentioned sorts, as a means whereby to attain to the ends aimed at by those differrent Factions.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50018:66"/>
these the <hi>Monsieurs</hi> took care to influence in their several ways so as to spur up the King not to delay the granting of it; but whatever the several Parties ends were in the obtaining of such a Grant, the intent of <hi>France</hi> was chiefly to divide us, and so make sure of the other event of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Measures; for they concluded then, had the King gained that point without dispute, and the People suffered that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing with the Laws to pass tamely and without any interrogating about it, for an inherent Prerogative of the <hi>English</hi> Crown; that he would be able to keep a firmer Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them, and assist them in all their Designs without controul with his Arms, and that he should at long-run be easily perswaded to receive Twenty or Thirty Thousand Auxiliaries to secure his new acquired Authority, in that and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Usurpations they intended to put him upon both in Civil and Religious Matters, in lieu of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Forces he should furnish the <hi>French</hi> King with; or if he should happen to be so weak as to yield up that important piece of Royalty to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; that still by such a diminution of Power he would in time by their pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing more and more upon him, as they had contrived in that case they should, be still necessitated in his extremity to have recourse to their help against the popular Waves, which when their state <hi>Eolus's</hi> had

blown enough to a sufficient high Sea, they designed to assist him to asswage, for fear else of giving place to the second Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of that terrible <hi>Monster</hi> called a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which they dreaded more then any thing that could have happened in this Western World; the memory of what a terror that late <hi>Monster</hi> in our Isles had been to them, as well as to the rest of their Neighbour Nations, being yet too fresh to have been forgotten by them; thus did these State Empericks drench us, and brought our Nation under such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, that without the help of kind Heaven, must end in a total Dissolution, <hi>Sed futura nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Ministers of this Court are not only the most inquisitive Persons in the World into the Affairs of other Courts, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50018:67"/>
even into the Persons that manage them, whose Natures, Dispositions, Religion, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Acquired Abilities, as well as Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Infirmities, they endeavour to sift out to the quick, that so they may use them or shun them as they find occasion; and for this reason it is that they make some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon them in their Minutes as well as upon the Affairs transacted by them; And therefore since the Five Persons who made up the Cabal in <hi>England</hi> a few years ago, and who your Lordship may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were the Dukes of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Arling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Clifford,</hi> were very distinguishable for the Stations they were in, the Offices they held and the Parts each of them acted in the Government, I find this Character given of them: For the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> as he was the Kings Favourite, so he really deserved to be so, as being very capable to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State, if his application to business had been answerable to his Talents, if his mind, which was furnished with excellent Endowments had not been distracted with <hi>Libertinism</hi> which was in him to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream degree, and by a love to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which made one of those Persons in the World that was fittest for great and solid things, vain and frivolous. Of the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> there is little or nothing said, but that he is a great and quaint Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50018:67"/>
and no question but he has merited that Character at their hand: Of my Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> they are as profuse in their Praises, as I doubt they have been too of their Money, saying; he was a Person who wanted nothing but a Theatre, where Vertue and Reason had been much more in use than it was in his Country in the Age wherein he lived, for to be superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to and overtop the rest: My Lord of <hi>Arlinton</hi> they make to be a Person of a meaner Capacity and more limitted Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us than any of the Five, but say his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences supply the Defect, and has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him especially a very great knowledge of Forreign Affairs; last of all, they bring in <hi>Anthony Ashley Cooper</hi> the Renowned Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> of whom they say; he was by far the fitter Person of any of them to manage a great Enterprize, and so was as the Soul to all the rest, being endued with a vast Capacity, clear Judgment, bold Nature, and subtil Wit, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firm and constant in all he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; a constant Friend but an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enemy, with many other Expressions, such as his not being terrified neither with the greatness nor the multitude of the Crimes he judges necessary for his own preservation, or the destruction of others, much to his Lordships dishonour, which is a clear Argument he was not for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and for which he is much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Of the Methods practised by the <hi>French</hi> Ministers to corrupt our Embassadors.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>

            <p>HAving given your Lordship some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the opinion the <hi>French</hi> Court have had of some of our Statesmen; it may be it will not be unacceptable to recount to your honour in this place some of those ways they have taken here to corrupt and pervert our Embassadors; And I can bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm that there has been hardly any one Embassador sent from our Court hither, since the Restoration whom they have not endeavoured to corrupt and to get into a private Intreague to traverse not only what he was to Negotiate, but even something of what themselves prest on our Princes by their own private Agents, and on some of whom, I have named one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50018:68"/>
to your Lordship formerly, they have made very great impressions to our Nations detriment; for matters of main Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, were treated of by private Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Messengers between both Kings, which were not as much as mentioned to the Embassadors sent in Publick, who have been on our side sent only for Parade, to Negotiate many times, things whereof the contrary had been most commonly agreed upon especially in private, only to blind by that piece of Formality the Eyes of our Subjects at home, and of our Neighbours abroad; or else to treat about matters of meer Complement or of but ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and tho' what has been privately treated on between the Two Kings, or but only proposed was of great Concern to be kept secret, and that for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they knew our Embassadors were not made acquainted with it, yet such has been their Malice and Treachery to our King and Country, as to discover to our Embassadors or Envoys and their Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, such parts thereof as they have thought, being once known to them, would be most proper and effectual to induce our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to enter into a particular Cabal with them for by-ends, and many times to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm things more invidious than ordinary to have been agreed upon between both Courts, which were only proposed; which kind of Communication of theirs had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50018:69"/>
powerful influence by the curiosity that is natural to all Mankind, to work upon our Ministers to entertain such a Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with them to the dishonour and detriment of their King and Country; for they have told them sometimes, that not only the Points proposed by the <hi>Dutchess</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> but other things of as bad and dangerous consequence for the Subjects and Religion in <hi>England,</hi> were absolutely concluded on between both Crowns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto them; and that our King and Duke of <hi>York</hi> had taken such and such Measures to put themselves into a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do what they pleased, and that the King their Master was willing to flatter them in such hopes and feed them with a little Money to keep them from taking part with his Enemies; yet that truly at the bottom he had no such Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion nor for the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as he had not for the King of <hi>England's</hi> over great Power and Absoluteness in Rule, being things which could not but be prejudicial and very incompatible with his own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and therefore he should not fail un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand to favour the People of <hi>England</hi> in supporting their Liberties and Rights, and defending their Religion, and confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingly or Regal Power to its own due limits; And therefore if they, <hi>Viz.</hi> our Envoys or Ministers would serve him in that design, they might assure themselves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50018:69"/>
they should be well gratified for their Compliance; that there was no occasion to scruple it; since they knew well enough that our Government was but a qualified Monarchy, wherein the Subject owed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Allegiance to their Country than they did to their Prince; And that since their King went about to deal so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly and injuriously with their Country, as to enter into Leagues and Treaties, and that underhand with a Foreign Prince, contrary to their true Interest, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Embassadors by transacting things different from, and opposite to what they had received in their Instructions, and trusted not his own Ministers but only Forreigners with his main Secrets of State; it could not be thought any great infidelity in them to deceive such a Prince, and to enter into private Intreagues against such Designs as were pernicious and destructive to their Country, and would be so to the Prince himself, if not prevented in time, with a great deal more matter still more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious than that, to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>Such Methods as these, My Lord, I find in the minutes of the Instructions prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time, to those who are imploy'd to converse with our <hi>English</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors or Envoys, and after-notes do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so remark they had success enough with some of them, whom your Lordship may so well guess at, that I need not name them.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50018:70"/>
However this opinion they entertained of most of the <hi>English</hi> whom they gained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Intrigue, except it were the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and one or two more, that they served them with the same mind, with which they imploy'd them, for this was and is still an usual saying with them, <hi>We imploy'd them not for any love we have had to them, or any good we intended them, but only for the Interest and Advantage of our own King, and the Dishonour and Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of theirs.</hi> So they as we believe and have by experience found by most, served us not for any love to our Interest, but to our Money, and with intent to make what we intended for the disservice of their Country turn in the end for the good and benefit of it, or at least to the Factions and Perswasions they themselves were off; I could inlarge much more upon this Head but I have been already tedious and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must conclude and remain,</p>

            <p>HAving already given your Lordship an account how our King was brought into the Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and to engage in a second <hi>Dutch</hi> War; I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to set forth the insincerity of the <hi>French</hi> Friendship, and how little Benefit our King was to reap thereby, in case of Success, and the Methods they had to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude him. Tho' their chief Design was to destroy <hi>Holland,</hi> yet they intended <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> should reap no Benefit thereby, but rather decrease and truckle under them; for that they meant nothing less then the real Performance to our King, of his Share in the projected Division of the Enemies Countrey, as if it had been their Motto, <hi>Pereat Hollandus, nec non subsidat Anglus.</hi> And therefore they so resolved to carry things on by Sea, as that they seemed to be rather unconcerned Spectators, then Actors for us in any of the Engagements; tho' your Lordship well knows, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when they were left alone with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50018:71"/>
the War, they could Fight well enough to Defeat the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleets in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and bereave that State of their famous Admiral <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> which was more then ever we in all our Combats with him could effect; For as if the <hi>French</hi> Dealing had been a Graft of old <hi>Punick Faith,</hi> they treated us more like perfidious <hi>Africans,</hi> then generous <hi>Romans,</hi> giving not only private Orders to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Naval Forces, which they should send us at Sea, to avoid as much as was possible, any effectual Fighting for us, but only to observe and learn what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements they could from us, both as to our manner of Fighting, and the Situation of our Harbours; and in the main, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themselves, not only as Cyphers, but as broken Reeds to us, who were in expectation of great things from them; and this evidently appear'd afterward by their Conduct towards Captain <hi>Martel,</hi> who for falling in bravely with us against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> was first soundly checked, and then disgracefully cashir'd for his Honesty and Bravery: and as their Instructions by Sea, to their Officers, was to play the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain</hi> with us in this manner; they gave the like Instructions to their Land Commanders on the <hi>Holland</hi> side; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, tho' it had been concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Courts, that whilst we should attack <hi>Zealand,</hi> which was the Province
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50018:71"/>
alotted to our share; their General in the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> should divert all Relief from it, by a great and sudden Irruption into their other Provinces, which in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation they then must needs be put to, he might most effectually do, yet not only their Minutes, but the Event clearly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was the least of their Thoughts, we should have a foot of Ground for our share on that side; for you may very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when our Army was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actually Embarqu'd for that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, in which in all probability, had he done his part, they had succeeded; yet in that critical Moment wherein he should have acted according to the Lesson given him, he did upon some frivolous Pretences neglect the same, and so frustrated that Expedition, which obliged our Forces with no small Confusion to return back, and Land without attempting any thing: It's most certain, <hi>My Lord,</hi> and by their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes it doth appear, that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed before hand, that in case they met with any powerful Resistance by Land, that then their Auxiliary Squadron at Sea, should act in earnest with us, and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously second us in humbling the Enemy; but if they made any considerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Territories, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they had laid their Measures, they supposed they could not fail of, then they were to observe the Cautions since
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50018:72"/>
practised by them; for that their Interest required no further, then that we should with as much Damage to our selves, as might be without Advantage to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> divert and debilitate their Force; but to suffer us to be absolute Masters of the Seas, or of but one Maritine place on the <hi>Belgick</hi> Shoar, was too great an Error in Pollicy for them to commit; but in case there were an appearance, that our Fleet, notwithstanding their base Prevarications should master that of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and that at the same time their Armies by Land made progress in the Conquest they thought themselves sure of, that then they should by their Emissaries, both in our Court and Countrey sow Jealousies, but more especially to propagate a strong Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of the Duke's having embraced the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, which they were sure would work the same, if not a greater Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then the publick certain Knowledge of it could do; for it would cause such Factions and Divisions therein, and such an Aversion to that Prince, that he should be forced to yield up his Command into other hands, and to alienate them from the Quarrel, that it would most effectually hinder the <hi>English</hi> Success from passing the Bounds they intended them; and hence would arise such a Disreputation to the King, and such a Dissatisfaction in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, as should conjure up such
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50018:72"/>
devilish Factions, as with all the Art he had, he should never be able to lay quiet enough to leave him at liberty to act any thing considerable against the <hi>French</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; in case he should attempt that way, to regain his Subjects Confidence and Esteem; and consequently would deter him from the very Thoughts of disobliging such a Friend, and quitting such Alliance, of so near, so present, and of so potent a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, as the <hi>French</hi> King had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pass with our deluded Prince, against the so much dreaded Practices of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans,</hi> which those Emissaries still took care, tho' covertly, to represent in the frightfulest Colours, their most <hi>Romantick</hi> Inventions could supply them; and so, with my humblest Respects to your Lordship, Concludes,</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50018:78"/>
and withall that his Attempts upon the young Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> proved abortive; however, considering he was Master of all the places round about, and no Power then on the Continent, being in a posture to come to its Relief, and that tho' the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> were restored to the Command of his Ancestors, he had as good almost to have been without, in the Posture his own, and the Affairs of the State were then in; and confiding still in the Influence of those of his Cabal within, who were Men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Estates and Eminence (tho' at present laid aside) then that obscure Burgher, and those whom the Mob had advanced to their Offices; and besides, that the little Vigour that seemed to be infused into the drooping Spirits of the Citizens, by the foresaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution and Remonstrances, would quickly vanish, and be interpreted as a flash of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable and insignificant Rashness, at the sight of his formidable Troops, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear like Smoak before the <hi>Sun,</hi> to whom his flatterers had taught him to compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; it was resolved, the place should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if not otherwise, by his Arms with all speed, to prevent any interveaning Accidents, that might impede the mighty success: But seasonably came another Adventure, that put a new Spoke in the Wheel. For, my Lord, while the <hi>French</hi> Court thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves secure of all things on our side, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Imagination, not only lulled the

King asleep, but the five Persons that made up the Cabal that managed him (and in effect, there were four of them in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests) the fifth Man, who was that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Statesman and true Patriot, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> then Lord Chancellor of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whose sagacious Head could penetrate deeper then the rest, and whose Eagle Eyes, the Splendor of those Golden Pieces, stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such abundance from that <hi>French Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eton,</hi> and which had blinded so many others in the like Station, could not dazzle, used all his Efforts to rouse up our King from the heavy slumber of Security, into which <hi>French</hi> Sorcery had cast him; and highly to represent to him in their true Light, the fatal Consequences to his Crown, Dignity and Interest, attending the taking of that City, and the total Conquest of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> tho' now his Enemies, by any other, at least then <hi>English</hi> Hands, and above all, by the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> and constrained him by the <hi>Cogency</hi> of his Reasons, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Representations of a speedy and brisk Interposition, prest home with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, that would admit of no Evasion, nor allow any Repose, but immediately to dispatch away an Embassy to divert the impending Stroke: But, tho' my Lord, by his pressing Eloquence, gained his Point, in regard to the Embassy in it self; yet your Lordship very well knows, that two of the three Persons employed in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Duke

when he would with all sincerity render it to him undamaged, and without poling or peeling the Inhabitants whom he should always consider as the Subjects of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>England</hi> and Ally; And if that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer would not content them, than to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that what he designed was too necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of too much importance for both Kings, and particularly for their Master, that if he were not imposed upon, or were but rightly informed of his own Interest in that Expedition, he would be so far from opposing it, that he would rather incourage him to it; and therefore could give no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther return to their Instances, but desire them either to wait for an Answer to the Premises from their Master or go home and report what he had Remonstrated, not doubting but his Envoy whom he had sent to <hi>England</hi> since their coming, would by that time they returned have so well satisfied his Majesty, that he would perfectly acquiess in the Resolutions he had taken for both their Profits, return him thanks for the same, and fully repose in the sincerity he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found in him: And therefore assuring himself as much of his Majesties approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what he designed upon his better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of it, he should without losing any time push on his Advantage while he might; and as for the Envoy he sent for <hi>England,</hi> they advised him he should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away immediately upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50018:81"/>
rising, with the Instructions they should then concert before another Audience were given to our Embassadors, that he might have time to tell his Tale first before any Letters or Advise could come from ours: <hi>Alas!</hi> said they, <hi>this Embassage is none of the King of</hi> Great Britain'<hi>s doings, but a meer force put upon him by the importunity of some Popular Grandees whom he dares not displease for fear of the People; let Your Majesty but send a Sop to them to take off their mouthing, and then ply the King with the usual Flatteries and Protestations and the forementioned preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of promises seasoned with a little Salt of</hi> Peru, <hi>and you need not doubt but his Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Indigency is great enough to swallow the Bait; And as for what he may fear from those Popular Men, it may be suggested that the taking of that Town only will break the neck of their Faction, and when it should be put into his hands, which if he durst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in a Prince whom he had reason to believe by the uncontestable proofs he had given him just before the War of his inviolable Friendship for him, should be as he promised, it would quiet all mutining Spirits again in a moment; he is, Credulous enough,</hi> said they, <hi>to believe shams less artificial and less alluring than these, and if after all, our Flatteries should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail alone, our Menaces will; for tho' he be a little fearful of the Resentments of his People for cleaving to us, he is more of us, for he fears their Hate, yet durst not trust their Affection,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50018:82"/>
whereas he durst not provoke our Hate, but trust our Friendship as the only private fence, we have taught him to think he has, against their Discontents; And therefore a final threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from your Majesty, telling him, if he knows not his own Interest, your Majesty knows it, will hector him out of any stiffness, the fear of them may put him upon against your designs at least: Tho' you cannot with his Embassadors here, you may by yours with him prolong the Contest long enough to gain time sufficient to effect your Work; For those Inhabitants, soon growing out of hopes of Succour from</hi> England <hi>as well as</hi> Germany; <hi>they will relapse into a more violent Fit of despair than ever and yield. After whose acquisition it will be easie for your Majesty to banter the</hi> English <hi>out of their pretences, or should they be so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy as to assert them by Arms, it will be easie for your Majesty to beat them off the seas, and make their Country the next Stage of War, when</hi> Germany, Spain <hi>and</hi> Italy <hi>deprived once of the</hi> Low-Country <hi>passages, tho' never so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the Spectacle, would not be able to help them; And therefore your Majesty,</hi> continued they, <hi>need not be awed by any fear of disoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for taking in what places by Arms or pollicy you can, especially this on which so much depends the Conquest of the rest, which once accomplished, when the</hi> English <hi>shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the share allowed them by the Treaty, and by your Majesties repeated Promises; what plausible banter will it be to tell them, they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50018:82"/>
have little reason to expect a share in the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of others, who when they might, have made none themselves, but rather have been prejudicial to the Common Interest by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable and unreasonable divisions, of and in which,</hi> &amp;c. said they, <hi>we have sown such seeds as cannot fail production; and in their great Council of Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. That the <hi>true purport of the Treaty was only Conditional, allotting each Party such and such a share in the Countries projected to be Conquered, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal that they should attack and subdue each of them their respective proportion; and therefore that it was ridiculous in them to pretend a claim, who had made no Conquest, not so much as of any one place, and had been so far from landing on the Enemy, that they had not done their duty at Sea. And in fine,</hi> added they, <hi>to compleat the Farce, how spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Conclusion will it be, to assure them however that your</hi> Most Christian Majesty <hi>to manifest to them how religiously punctual you are to your promises, will take no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their failures or their Misfortunes, but provided they will give your Majesty a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable consideration for the Expences of Blood and Treasure you have been at in the taking and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, for them in a tenable condition; you are ready to order them Livery and Seizing of them according to the Letter of the Treaty and your own repeated promises, for which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended expences,</hi> persued they still, <hi>your Majesty may instruct your Ministers to demand such
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50018:83"/>
excessive Sums, as you know they neither can nor will disburse. And as for their asserting their claim by a War, after your seizing of</hi> Amsterdam <hi>that great Magazine of the dead riches of</hi> Europe <hi>and both</hi> Indies, <hi>and of Warlike Provisions both by Sea and Land, and the total reduction not only of that Potent</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick <hi>of which it was the Head, but likewise of the living sources of Treasure both in the</hi> East <hi>and</hi> West, <hi>by making their great Fleet, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Colonies, and Commerce all your own, which cannot but clear your way to</hi> Guinea <hi>and</hi> Peru; <hi>What stomack,</hi> said they, <hi>can the</hi> English <hi>after this have, by taking of their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works the</hi> Low-Countries, <hi>debarr'd from all assistance from</hi> Italy, Spain, <hi>and</hi> Germany, <hi>if in their right senses to have recourse to Arms. Alas! what power to attempt any thing but what will move your pitty more then your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation; nay rather what greater Ambition will be left them than to Court your Majesty by an easie and voluntary submission to receive them as Honourable Tributaries, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a shadow of their Ancient Government and Liberty, without incurring the certain desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by an impotent and fruitless resistance, of being forcibly reduced into a Province of your growing Empire; to which the</hi> Roman Eagle <hi>it self abandoning the defenceless Towers of</hi> Austria, <hi>shatterred both by</hi> Eastern <hi>and</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern <hi>Hurricanes, for the better preserving and re-establishing its Ancient State and Majesty, will then be glad to retire.</hi>

               <hi>This may be your Majesties method,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued they, <hi>to preserve Peace a while with</hi> England, <hi>or stave off at least the War, till your present grand design be accomplished; and these your Measures how to deal with them afterward, in case they suffer you quietly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve this important Conquest; But should we be able by no Art to buoy up the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands <hi>Spirits against the head-strong opposition of the popular party about him; nor so much as to delay a Rupture, nor to hinder that violent People from immediately declaring against us; yet all considerations on all sides duly weighed and perpended, it will be much greater and more certain advantage to your Majesty, and of much less dangerous consequence to your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in general to venture a War with them now about a Town, which with all they can do, they cannot assist time enough to rescue from you; and by whose acquisition against their wills you will not only be quit of all their Pretentions, but gain power to crush them too at pleasure; than after you have for fear of them quitted so great a Conquest, to have a War in a little time after both with them and all the rest of</hi> Europe, <hi>not only without those advantages, but with the greatest disadvantage imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as without setting on work an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred expensive and troublesome Intriegues you now will have no need off, your Majesty will certainly have then, notwithstanding all pour complyance to them if you quit your present Design, For,</hi> said they, <hi>suppose upon your

proceeding to the Expedition in question, the</hi> English <hi>declaring a sudden War against you should cause the</hi> Amsterdamers <hi>to assume cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to repulse your Arms, how easie were it for your Majesty upon advantageous Terms to clap up a sudden peace with those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed People, and by returning out of their Country to pacifie all those powers now prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against you, and then with your whole Force to fall upon the</hi> English <hi>with which perhaps too the</hi> Hollanders <hi>would easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to joyn theirs, as glad to see themselves delivered so unexpectedly, their old Enemies drawn so genteely into the Snare, and so fair an occasion put into their hands to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on that Rival Nation for joyning with us against them, with which it will not be amiss however by your Envoy to threaten the</hi> English <hi>King; Nay and how probable it is that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular party in</hi> England <hi>would on that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on favour the</hi> Hollanders <hi>to keep down Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, and to preserve their Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the aspiring Duke and Popery; all which they strongly feared would have come in at once upon them after the ruine of that Protestant State? At least,</hi> said they, <hi>how effectual may it be to let you Majesties Envoy add that threatning amongst the rest to the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>But Alas!</hi> continued they, <hi>it is but a matter of meer Speculation never likely to come to pass; that any thing the</hi> English <hi>can do at present should, as the posture of their Affairs are now in, hinder your Majesties taking that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50018:84"/>
City, whose Richest and Eminentest Citizens being already gained to your Party, the very terror of your Majesties Navy and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your Forces, will quickly open it unto you; notwithstanding the weak opposition of a Party formed in a tumultary way among a Mobile by a few particular, biggoted Citizens, who at the noise of your Cannon would immediately turn to the other extream and cry out, as loudly for a surrender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for the</hi> English, said they, <hi>our Emissaries have been so busie and so successful at</hi> Amsterdam, <hi>that it can never be thought, what ever good Opinion they may have of the People of</hi> England, <hi>that they can be induced to confide so much in their King, whom they have so personally and so grosly affronted in all that can be sensible to a Prince, and whom they know so much</hi> Frenchified, <hi>as to think he can heartily intend them any good; or that they can expect any milder terms of subjection under him, either in respect of Religion or Property, then under your Majesty; Since they are daily, and by very good tokens assured that he is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately advanced already towards</hi> Rome <hi>as far as the other, and waits only the subverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their</hi> Republick <hi>to assume every whit as Despotical and Tyrannical a Dominion over his Subjects in both respects as the</hi> French <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had over his; or in fine, that they had so great an opinion of his Power in that Posture of Affairs as to think him able to rescue them time enough, or remove the</hi> French <hi>from them
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50018:85"/>
if he went really about it: And consequently that in the great Consternation they then were in, and the little hopes they had of the slow Forces of</hi> Germany; <hi>and the distrust they lay under both of their own strength and of the Faith and Power of the</hi> English, <hi>together with the Apprehension they were possest with, of losing the great Riches they had there by an obstinate resistance which they might secure by a timely composition; they would undoubtedly submit upon the first Summons of his Majesty or any famed General of his at the head of a considerable Body of Men, especially when his Majesty should offer them such advantageous Conditions, as they advised him to do, the more effectually to avert them from all thoughts or temptations to close with</hi> England, <hi>and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to them: That matters of Religion and Commerce should remain in the same state; As also the Priviledges of their Companies, Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That they should have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Natives, in all the other Dominions of</hi> France, <hi>with many other Sugar-Plums; To the exact performance of which it was not to be questioned but they would easily give credit, since to that time his Honour was entire, and had no ways been stained with any gross Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and that the Protestants, then enjoyed no small Liberty in his Dominions. And when you shall be in the possession of the place, all these specious promises need not hinder your Majesty,</hi> said they, <hi>from seizing however as much of their Treasure as your Interest shall direct you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50018:85"/>
to take, nor from putting such other restraints upon them as you please, for which they gave him such expedients as were thought proper and necessary for to elude the advantageous and specious Conditions, by which their over-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Inhabitants were to be wheedled out of their precious Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last place they laid before him the many and grand Inconveniences, which by letting slip such an advantageous Juncture would unavoidably follows, which they represented, as much more in number, and of vastlier greater Consequence, than those that could possibly arrive from his pursuing it; <hi>For,</hi> urged they, <hi>if your Majesty let go this Opportunity, It will not only be said of you, as of the Great</hi> Hannabal, <hi>that you know how to get, but know not how to prosecute a Victory, but the same Fate will likewise befall you; This despised and almost oppressed Enemy will recover Strength and Courage, the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>and the House of</hi> Austria <hi>will come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its succour, you must quit your present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to oppose them, and your present Allies on the Continent will forsake you; If you be beaten how disadvantageous and perhaps fatal must the event needs be to you, and if you overcome, yet how far will you be from a compleat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, or from making that advanced and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured progress towards the erection of a new Empire; as you would do in the taking that one place, whose Gates tho' they belong but to one City, would let you into the Possession of

            <p>THere was hardly a Prince on the Earth worse served than our King and paid more, no less than Three Embassadors to make up the Embassy mentioned in my last save one to your Lordship, and yet Two of the Three concurring with the <hi>French</hi> designes to the ruine of <hi>Hollund</hi> first, and so consequently their own Native Country next; so that the poor <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as your Lordship may well remember, were forced to save their Country from the <hi>French</hi> (who pursuant to the last advise were ready to devour it) by losing it in the Sea, in breaking down the Dikes the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and the only remedy they had left them; for this gave them time to think of their Affairs, and this first brought the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> then the Emperor,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50018:87"/>
and at last the King or Queen Regent of <hi>Spain,</hi> as apprehensive of the common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to all of them in general by the <hi>French</hi> subduing the <hi>Dutch Provinces,</hi> to enter into a mutual League for their defence; and by their Conjunction, The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> who had all this time struggled with the hardest destiny that could be, and lay neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by his Uncles as if they had no share either in his good or bad Fortunes, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed several of the Upland Towns in almost as little time as they had been taken by the <hi>French,</hi> and like another <hi>Scipio</hi> having joyned <hi>Montecucucli</hi> the Emperors General in the dead of Winter, and so carrying the War out of his own Country Besieged and took <hi>Bon,</hi> the Residence of the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> and thereby did cut off the Comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>French</hi> were necessitated not only to quit their Conquered Towns by heaps, but he also opened a passage for the Imperial Forces to joyn the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spanish;</hi> But tho' neither the sence of his own true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, nor the Tyes of Consanguinity to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> could induce our King to come to the rescue of <hi>Holland,</hi> which notwithstanding the Princes brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and success was still but in a pitiful plight, as having but newly recovered their drowned Country; yet the <hi>French</hi> had an incurable Jealousie of him, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the forementioned interposition
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50018:87"/>
by his Embassy was still fresh in memory; And as that fell out when they least expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any such thing, so they considered a Peace might be struck up in as sudden and surprizing a manner, and therefore they set all their Engines on work to hinder it if possible, and in the first place knowing that great Person who had the influence over the King to procure such an Embassy, and might also by the same Arguments induce him to make a much hardier step, and force him at last in spight of his own inclinations, or of <hi>French</hi> Menaces, as well as of <hi>French</hi> Charmes, not only to a Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> but even to a War against them; They therefore left nothing unes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say'd, or stone untur'd to get him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Chancellor's place, tho' it was well known the King himself upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain occasion had given his Testimony of his being the wisest Subject he had in his Dominions, and seemed at that time to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue him accordingly: I cannot posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively inform your Lordship, by which of their Instruments it was done, for I never could find it was inserted in the Minutes; but I have heard it generally discoursed at the <hi>French</hi> Court, that they ploughed in this Affair with the Heifer they had formerly presented the King withal, and that the Duke also whom they by their Emissaries iritated against

him, to whom they alledged that he had taken notice of his keeping off of late from the Protestant Worship, and talked too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally thereof, not without some Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons boding much danger to his Highness, and even levelled at putting him by the Succession it self, gave an helping hand thereto.</p>
            <p>But for all they had gained so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a point, as the removal of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, yet fearing still the worst, they never left off their former apprehensions; And therefore their Ministers still continued with utmost Application to pursue their Game, both by magnificent Promises and Offers of Money, and some Menaces <hi>a la sourdene;</hi> but with instructions after all their industry, if they could not succeed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the peace, yet not to fail to elude it, which how well they succeeded in the first for a time, and when that could not be warded off no longer, how much more fortunate success they have had in the latter I shall endeavour to make your Lordship ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with at another time, when I hope they may be no less grateful to your Honour's gusto, from him who desires to approve himself to be,</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50018:89"/>
throughly, and thereby not only renew, but make sure against all Events that Alliance that hath since proved so pernicious to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and so vexatious to the one, as well as to the other of our Princes: This Match they knew might be of great importance to them, not only as to the promoting their Ambitious Ends in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Italy</hi> too; and if they could once ensnare the Duke into it, would as fixedly tie him to their Interests, as it would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lose him every where else, and engage not only the Protestant Subjects of these Kingdoms, but even all the other Powers of <hi>Christendom,</hi> as well of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as the Reformed, to oppose his future Elevation, that so he might be wholly dependant upon them; She being a Lady, not only <hi>Italian</hi> by Nation, but a Relation of the Pope, (and in that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity most odious to <hi>England)</hi> and also of the late Cardinal <hi>Mazarine;</hi> and in a word, of a Prince Pensionary to the <hi>French,</hi> and an adopted Daughter of <hi>France;</hi> which last Quality they honoured her with, to render her compleatly hateful to all the World, besides most liberally paying her Portion, Pentioning the King, and greasing the Ministers to have the Parliament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, that in the interim the Match might be huddled up with all the precipitation imaginable, for fear upon the least delay, by contrary Sollicitations from the <hi>Austrians,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50018:90"/>
or any other Potentates abroad, (or any black) and grumbling Clouds at home, the unstable King might be over-persuaded or frighted from letting his Brother go on with that destructive Alliance. These, <hi>my Lord,</hi> were their Contrivances and Precautions upon this Subject; and they succeeded so well in their Endeavours, that mauger any Reasons the King might have to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or any Opposition made by some few then about him, that Match was concluded, from which <hi>England</hi> may in a very great measure date the commencement of her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Grievances; and which, according to the Parliament's Prediction of it, caused such terrible Earthquakes in the three Nations already, and God Almighty alone knows what the dire Effects may be, and where things will terminate at long run, though it may at the same time prove better than our fears. For after it was once done, they cared not what Storms it produced amongst us; for if the endeavours of an Alliance cemented with so charming a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, unwearied in enticements, could not allure, nor the sug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

give them part of his Estates, whenever it should succeed, and make them Executors of his Will; or at least, at all Adventures, keep up such Divisions, as by the care they would take to balance the respective Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned in them, would both divert and disable the Nation from exerting their Resentment against them to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

            <p>I Have formerly taken notice to your Lordship of the Methods and Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>French</hi> used to keep our King from making a Peace with the <hi>Dutch-</hi>States; and how they made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to dispossess all those, and particularly my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> of the King's Ear and Favour, who were concerned for His and the Nation's Interest, by promoting such a Peace; but though they prevailed therein, as well as in that of the Duke's Marriage with a Female of their own chusing; yet <hi>my Lord,</hi> you know very well, they failed to stem the Tide that broke in as a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon that Vote of the Commons, <hi>Octob.</hi> 31. 1673. That considering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Nation was then in, they would not take into further consideration any Aids or Charges upon the Subject, except it did appear the obstinacy of the <hi>Dutch</hi> should

render it necessary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries had taught the King and his Juncto their Lesson, to wit, to give out that the <hi>Dutch</hi> were full of Sullenness and Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and would come to no honourable Terms, and therefore there was a necessity of further humbling of them; but now the Court of <hi>England</hi> were as hasty to make up the Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> as e're they were to declare War against them, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the 9th of <hi>February,</hi> 1673/4 but though the <hi>Dutch</hi> came hereby to enjoy Peace with us at Sea, yet they found the pernicious Effects of the Valour of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Troops which continued in the <hi>French</hi> Armies, and gained them several Victories after that Peace; till upon the earnest and repeated Instances, both of the Foreign Powers concerned, and of our own Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, some redress was given to that Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but never a total one; a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation being obtained for recalling our Forces from the <hi>French</hi> Service, which yet was construed not to extend to the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, who after that, by that foul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence of our King, not only continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there in Bodies as formerly, but drew over Recruits from time to time, and were most highly cherished and cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as indeed were the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation all along, with a sensible difference above the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> especially when a War was expected with us; they having a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

design upon that Kingdom by one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or other, ever since their first draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our King into League with them; which they did not obscurely intimate, when by way of encouragement they would now and then say to the <hi>Irish Roman</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers among them, as likewise to other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Gentlemen Travellers of that same Nation.

That the time would come when he would shew them marks of his Esteem, by conferring the Hereditary Guard of his own, and his Successor's Persons on their Nation, instead of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were now departed from their Interests; and that as a Catholick Prince, and the Guarantee of their Treaty with King <hi>Charles,</hi> when in Banishment, for restoring to them their Estates whenever he should be restored, he would see them righted, and would one day free them from the Tyranny of the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>

But notwithstanding all underhand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of our Court with that of <hi>France,</hi> as our Peace with <hi>Holland</hi> had already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased them, This recalling of our Troops, as partially executed as it was, quite put them out of humour; so that though they durst not shew their Resentments too far, for fear of increasing the Evil they fretted at; yet they did what they could by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to debauch, and by hard Usage, and all imaginable Discouragements, both to deter as many as they could of our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from paying Obedience to the said Proclamation, and to disable those who were fixedly bent to return, from being service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their King and Country. Among the rest, mighty Advantages were offered to my Lord <hi>Dowglas,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> to intice him to stay; and some time after he was gone, upon hearing he had no Preferment under his own King, by reason of the severity of our Laws against Men of his Perswasion, there were very great Rewards proposed to those they thought had any influence over him, to perswade him to return, and particularly to my self, in case I could find any who could so far prevail over him; but all in vain; yet most of the <hi>Irish</hi> remained to the last, and were very serviceable at the brisk Action of <hi>Gyrone,</hi> and on some other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and after the fear of the War with us was blown over by the Tempest raised
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50018:93"/>
among our selves, whilst we blinded our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and People by seeming to observe exactly the Articles of Neutrality agreed upon between our King and them, they for a long time, and even till now, have refused to receive any <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Officers and Soldiers to their Service; tho' contrary to their Allegiance to their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, several of them, and some of them <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of tried Affection, proffered themselves, yet still as many <hi>Irish</hi> as presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, were readily entertained.</p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>My Lord,</hi> Tho' these subtile Politicians missed of their first point in hindring our Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> they suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but too well in the second, through our Court's weakness and base Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication, which was eluding it, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting our Neutrality, with such a partiality on their side, that it was an Honey-Comb to them, whilst it was but a Spunge of Gall and Vinegar to the Confederates; but foreseeing that in time this jugling conduct of our King would make all <hi>Europe</hi> murmur, and render his Friendship or Mediation suspicious every where; That it would make him odious to his People, and blow into a Flame those old jealousies that already began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle, and afford ample matter for the Emissaries of the Confederates to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Nations, and consequently to actuate our People so violently to a League

with the said Allies against them, that it would be impossible for the King, with Safety, to resist them; (for of his good Will to them, by this time they were pretty confident) they therefore were careful to make a timely Provision against an inconvenience so much dreaded by them, and to endeavour to make use of those very Jealousies, Fears, and Animosities, whose Effects they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, against their Adversaries, by dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously catching them up, like Fireworks before they brake, and returning them back upon our selves; and this difficult sort of Game they managed by several Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, of which I have neither room nor opportunity to advertise your Lordship at present, but must defer it to a proper season, and remain, as I truly am,</p>

               <p>Of the Marquess <hi>de Ruvigni,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Protestant, his being sent Embassador into <hi>England;</hi> and what the Politicks of <hi>France</hi> were therein.</p>

            <p>I Do not question but your Lordship does remember the first time of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Ruvigny</hi>'s being sent Envoy from this Court into <hi>England,</hi> which was in the Year 1669. and which, I think, I have in one of my Letters hinted already; That he was a Person very capable for such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, none can doubt that knew him; but that ever he was chosen by this Court purely for his Capacity, is not to be admitted of. You know, my Lord, the Triple League stuck then close in the <hi>French</hi> King's stomach, and that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Religion was in, as well as Property, from the progress of the <hi>French</hi> Arms before in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> contributed very much to the cementing of such an Alliance, which this Court were labouring tooth and nail to break to pieces, and more especially to get the King of <hi>England</hi> out of it; and to that end, Monsieur <hi>Ruvigny</hi>'s Religion, he being a Protestant, highly recommended him: How well he discharged his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50018:94"/>
then, I need not recount to your Lordship, the Event has sufficiently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it to <hi>England,</hi> as well as to <hi>Holland</hi>'s sorrow, and to the no small regret of some of those of his own Religion and Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>France.</hi> It was much about Six years after, that the same Marquess was entrusted with another Negotiation at the <hi>English</hi> Court, to no less pernicious an end than the former, and I fear at long run with worse effects: They had, my Lord, besides the Instruments I have formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for some time before this, imploy'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their own <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for the carrying their Intrigues more effectually on among our Protestants, which <hi>Hugonots</hi> have been the more forward to please and obey the Instructions of their Prince and his Ministers, in that they have believed them very compatible with their own particular Interests; wherefore they have done all they could to contribute to the Elevation of the Presbyterian Government in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, because the same with their own, they have naturally had some desire to see established in a Kingdom so able to protect them, and which had hitherto been the great impediment to their extirpation in <hi>France.</hi> But to return from this Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for which I beg your Lordship's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to the Marquess <hi>de Ruvigny,</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions were to endeavour to possess the Protestants in general in our Nation, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50018:95"/>
were now, my Lord, full of fears of some Secret Designs a brewing between the two Kings, in prejudice to their Religion and Civil Rights too, that they needed not to be so much concerned at Appearances; that it was far enough from the thoughts of his Master to make their King great to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects prejudice; and that he was not so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion as they might imagine, whereof he was to urge several instances and to endeavour to throw off all the <hi>odium</hi> from him upon the Pope and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby make them level all their Fears, Jealousies, and odious Reflections that way; to the end, that by the Royal Church-Party, who had the King's ear, they might still secure him further in their Interests, and have their helping-hand to carry on those Points they aimed at that way, <hi>viz.</hi> the hindring the Princesses matching with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Offensive Alliance so much feared then and now with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi> &amp;c. But this was but one Party of the Protestants; his Instructions also were to make a particular Interest among the Dissenters, and such as inclined to them at the same time, that in case they were defeated in the one, and saw no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of staving off the other, they might have them ready prepared to enter the lists against the former; and when War was ready to be declared against <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:50018:95"/>
to push them on, if possible, to raise a Civil Combustion at home, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate into them; That the King, his Master, was willing privately to assist them as his Predecessor had done theirs in the late Civil Wars upon occasion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which sort of Negotiation the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis was effectually enough seconded by his Countrymen-<hi>Hugonots</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> and particularly by a man of singular Parts and Learning, and exceedingly well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Intriegue, named Monsieur—but on the contrary, in case they should have been able by the Royal Party to have been strong and successful enough to gain the two said Points, and hinder both the Match and the War, which was their business, and is still in part, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; they had Orders to have the same Dissenting Party still ready, when King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and his Cousins of <hi>England,</hi> should have had that part of their ends of the Conforming Party, to make use of them against them, if they would not humour them so far as to suffer themselves to be carried quite back to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because all our Protestants, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever differently denominated, should take no umbrage at any of this Court's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they thought fit once more, to let their <hi>Sun,</hi> as they so often term him, to cast some warm beams on the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party at home, and to entertain them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while

            <p>YOUR Lordship cannot be ignorant, that during this Intrieguing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Canvassing of Designs against our King and Kingdom, the War went on on this side with various success; but I find <hi>England</hi> is not the only Country that has been bubbled by the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries, and had its Secrets betrayed; I cannot tell any one part of the <hi>Confederates</hi> that have been exempted; but <hi>Germany</hi> more particularly has suffered in this kind variously, but in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so remarkably as in the business of Prince <hi>Lobkowitz</hi>'s being disgraced some time since by the Emperor, and which has made so much noise in the World, that your Lordship could not but hear of it: That he corresponded with this Court, there is nothing more certain; though when the business was once winded, their Emissaries thought it adviseable to be the first Rumorers of it, but related the same with Particulars so extraordinary, that were scarce credible, that thereby they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50018:97"/>
might turn the whole at length into a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule: But the way of their Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the said Prince, and others in the Empire, was so intricate to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed, that 'tis no wonder the matter has been as it were dubious in the World to this day; for little did the Councellors of State, and other Princes and Grandees at the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> think, that those very <hi>Jews</hi> who sold them Jewels, Pearl, and other rich Moveables, were wont at the same time to bring and carry Letters to the forementioned Prince <hi>Lohkowitz,</hi> and other vile Traytors to the Emperor and Empire; and though these sort of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min have been banished the Emperor's Territories and Dominions, yet for filthy Lucre-sake, to which they are addicted above any Nation or People under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and to serve the <hi>French,</hi> whom above any other they value for the Reasons I have formerly given your Lordship upon another occasion, They make no scruple of assuming those Shapes which they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly would most seem to abhor, and whose Principles they have disbeliev'd above these Sixteen hundred years, I mean Christians, and to this day drive on the old trade.</p>
            <p>But our private minutes relating to this Country, and which I have had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity lately a little to inspect, tell us positively, That at least two of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's

own Confessors of the Iesuitical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the much more dangerous Traytors than any other could be, were guilty of the same Crime.

                  </gap>rades,</hi> their Plenipotentiaries for the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> who quickly began their attack upon Sir <hi>William,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Instructions I find they had given them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To insinuate slily, what a value the <hi>French</hi> King their Master had for his Person and Character; and that therefore during the course of the Negotiation they were to enter upon, they had Orders to make their application to him; That they knew how much he was in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the King his Master, and of his chief Ministers, and therefore how filly qualified he was to put the finishing-stroke to a Treaty he had had the greatest hand to set on foot, and of which he must needs reap all the Glory; That he might reckon very much upon the facility of the King their Master in that weighty Affair, but yet so far still as to have a just regard had to the great Successes of his Arms during the War.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They were to make a Mien of their being fully possest of the States great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to strike up a Peace, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50018:99"/>
their Allies must comply with, tho' they might for a time retard it; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only way they could see for to give <hi>Europe</hi> Tranquillity, was for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to interpose his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which was so great with all the Allies, that they were very well satisfied in their willingness to agree to whatever terms he should be resolved on, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Peace: That therefore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring that grand affair to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and sudden issue, it was their Opinion, there was no other or better way for it, than for his Highness first privately to agree with <hi>France</hi> upon the Conditions, and what each Party's Proposition should be; and when that was once done, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in the course of the Treaty, which was to be supposed, could not spin out to any great length of time, then to draw all matters by concert together to the scope agreed upon between them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To seem very confident this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod would do; but that if it should so happen that the unreasonable pretences of the Allies should obstruct or delay a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace, that then the Prince might make use of the usual Temper of the States to bring it to a sudden issue, and make a separate Peace; that if the Prince pursued this method, it would be in his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50018:100"/>
power to do great things for himself and his Family, for which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many instances as they could of parallel cases; And that as for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Prince's own personal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Interests, the King their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster had given them full power to assure him, That he might set down his own Conditions, and they should be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That tho' they had many others to, make these Overtures to his Highness, some whereof they were also darkly to intimate, yet that they were to pursue their Master's Orders, which was to apply themselves to none but to him, if he thought fit to charge himself with it; That they were very sensible of the Credit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he was in with his Highness, and how much deference he had to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in what concerned the publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the Allies at that time, as well as his own; and that if he would effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually espouse that Affai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he might reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon what he pleas'd himself from the Generosity of the King their Master, whose constant Character it was, never to let the least Merit go unrewarded.</p>
            <p>But if it should so fall out, that Sir <hi>William</hi> proved stiff in the matter, as it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50018:100"/>
seems he did by the sequel, they were to turh the same Batteries upon Pensioner <hi>Fagel,</hi> with a variation of Phrase, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement agreeable to the Person and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and more especially to try what the force of the French Pistols might effect that way; And if so be matters were carried so far as that the Prince was found to give any ear to it, then he was to be rounded briskly what mighty things the French King would do for him in relation to his future Greatness both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> That for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Orange,</hi> he should have it resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him again, or such a compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nigher Home, as he would reckon on himself; as also for his Lands in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and any other Losses, Damages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, they were ordered to offer him a very large annual Pension, if he would have complied: But half these things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually Proposed, because the said two Ministers, and the Prince himself more than any, were as so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>PErhaps since all the noise of the <hi>Western</hi> World, at this time is the Affairs of <hi>Hungary,</hi> between the Turks and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists, the particulars whereof I need not trouble your Lordship with; it will not be amiss to look a little back, and remark what influence this Court has had upon this War, and what Designs they have long since hatched under the Covert, not only of this, but all the other Broils they have engaged <hi>Germany</hi> in; I find by <hi>Patin</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so far back as 1671. that it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then not questioned, but that there had been Designs concerted to have the Dauphin created King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which made me endeavour after a more particular informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that Intriegue, which at last I have found to be inserted in this manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the distinct Heads that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="2">II. The former Wars against the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates was attempted for the same Ends in a great measure, all their Designs against the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy having a tendency that way.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Their unspeakable Pretensions in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Madam,</hi> the present Dutchess of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. They have now for the same end, their Emissaries in <hi>Turkey,</hi> being partly Jews, and partly Jesuits, who incited the

               <hi>Turks</hi> to begin the War, and to push it on even to the Capital of the Empire; and did at the same time, by other Agents, both in <hi>Poland,</hi> and at <hi>Venice,</hi> all they could, that they might hinder those Countries to come into the Confederacy against them, as thinking themselves Cock-sure, that if <hi>Vienna</hi> had once been taken, the <hi>German</hi> Princes would have been in such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, that as the only remedy, they would have called in the French Power to oppose against such a dreadful inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Infidels as would thence have followed; and for which they could have done no less than to have declared the Dauphin King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and have made the French King Guardian and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in the interim, of the Emperor and Empire, especially having the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Cologne, Mentz,</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> either inclined for, or over-awed by them, and it being easy in that juncture to have forced the rest: This, <hi>my Lord,</hi> is the substance of what I have found they have projected upon this Subject from time to time, as the circumstances of Affairs gave way and occasion and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain than that they have had it all along in their view, to advance the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to that Dignity, which they have hitherto failed in, and I hope ever shall.

            <p>IT's not long since I have given your Lordship an account of the advances made by this Court towards a Peace; but you know, since that, the War went on with various successes; and perhaps your Lordship has heard of the Business of Don <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> How he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from having the Administration of the Affairs of that Country, by a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Hand, when he was just going to embark for the relief of <hi>Messina;</hi> there was at that time an expectation in the Confederates of mighty things to be perform'd by him to their advantage, and the preventing him from a share in the Government, was esteemed generally to be a <hi>French</hi> Trick, and so it was; but I believe the Confederates were guilty of a grand mistake in their expectation of him; for the French Memoirs say, Don <hi>John</hi> was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50018:104"/>
perfectly their Creature, and that it was the violent hatred of the Queen Mother of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well as a jealousie to have her own Power invaded, that put him beside the Administration; That it was through his means the Matching of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the Emperor's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was put by, and that with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Daughter effected; and that he was going to act mighty things for the <hi>French</hi> Interest, for which he had large Promises made him of their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual Assistance to obtain the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> for himself, after the Decease of the present King, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he should quit the <hi>Spanish</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the <hi>Indies, Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> for the performance of which, they had sufficient Assurances from him.</p>
            <p>I am further to observe to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from the said Minutes, That they have attributed his Death to a Dose of Poison administred by the order and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prescription of the Queen-Mother, and that out of a fear she had he would one day Poison the King her Son; and because he had against her Will, been the instrument to make the <hi>French</hi> Match. They further add, how true the one or the other, I will not take upon me to determine, That the Queen Mother's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Don <hi>John</hi> was inveterate; that she
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50018:104"/>
had attempted once before to have Stab'd him, and at another time to Pistol him: As for the fore-mentioned Letter from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to stop the Don's passage for <hi>Messina,</hi> they say it was sent by the Instigation of the Duke de <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> then in the <hi>French</hi> Faction, with an intent to make him miss that stroke, and secure him in their Interests, by letting him know, that it was by their Intreague he was admitted to Court.

what good effects several previous Intreagues of theirs had to our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; they saw plainly the second <hi>Dutch</hi> War had much more impoverished us than the First; and the ill conduct of it much more sunk the King's Reputation, besides the Divisions in the Fleet, and the Jealousies and Factions in the Parliament, and among the People, about the Duke's Religion, produced him great disgusts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; That the shutting up of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> had ruined his Credit; and his Majesty in proclaiming Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by Virtue of his own Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his levity afterward in flinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it so unexpectedly, had so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged and wounded with Jealousie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all Patriots in Parliament tender of their Priviledges, who held the Peoples Purse-strings on the one side, and so incensed with a fresh Animosity the baffled Dissenters on the other; that being over-whelmed with Debts, opposed by dangerous and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Factions, and yet Bankrupt both of Money and Credit too; they fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded he could have no other recourse but to them; which odious remedy, they supposed, would but more and more heighten the mutual Jealousies, and widen the Breaches, till they grew large enough for them to enter by at long-run upon

            <p>IT would be very strange to think, that the Ministers of this Court, who have had a hand almost in every thing relating to our Nation, should not be concerned in the affair of the <hi>Popish Plot;</hi> but it is so far otherwise, that they have been the chief managers and starters of many things which have since come to light; Nay, I am bold to say, That the very actions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of almost all the Instruments of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and even of some of the <hi>French</hi> themselves, were very wide, tho' villanous enough, from those of the <hi>Machiavillian</hi> Off-spring which set them on work. My Lord, you have heard of Father St. <hi>Germain,</hi> and perhaps of Father <hi>Columbiere</hi> too, who succeeded him in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> these were the Persons, who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their other assisting Emissaries, disposed of Things and Parties in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to favour their Designs in reference
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50018:109"/>
to the said Conspiracy, and whose Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from Father <hi>La Chaise,</hi> were to take upon them to inform and press upon the Creatures of the Pope, and Ministers and Creatures of other Princes of the Roman Communion, but of a different Interest from their Master's the French King; That for their parts, they were only actuated by a Zeal for the propagation of the Catholick Religion, and the re-union in time of so famous a Monarchy to the Church by gentle and peaceable ways and means, and chiefly for the Conversion of our two Princes so nearly Related to their King in Blood, and for whom he had so much Esteem and Affection; and that their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being their nearest Neighbour, and seated most conveniently to assist them on occasion, would with his Purse promote all he could the quiet Conversion of all sorts of People, that could be drawn in by the Godly Eloquence of their Missionaries, or by the more powerful language of Pensions with some, and was heartily willing to supply our Princes with what was needful, or might be so, to maintain themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Attempts that might be made against them, upon the jealousie or discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any such design, and succour them by a sufficient Military Force too, in case they were likely to be reduced to Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by an open Rebellion of their stubborn
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50018:109"/>
and discontented Subjects on that account; without once pretending to so idle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable a design, as some of them whom they spoke to were tutored to call it, as by that means to go about to make the Crown of <hi>England</hi> seudatory to that of <hi>France,</hi> or to strengthen himself with the additional power of <hi>England,</hi> with intent to encroach afterwards upon the Rites and Prerogatives of the Holy See, or give Umbrage to other Temporal Enemies of that Communion, or to draw any other advantage to the <hi>French</hi> from the Alliance of the <hi>English</hi> Princes, than to be able in the quality of Most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King, and first Son of the Church, to promote the growth of the Holy Catholick Religion in their Realms and Dominions, and make use of their Mediation and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to ballance in some measure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent force of so formidable a Confederacy, as was lately formed against him. That it was a thing ridiculous to think, or once as much as imagin, that whilst he was in actual War with so many considerable Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at that time, he could be so simple as to attempt <hi>England</hi> by force; or if he were out of War with them, that he could as much as offer at so considerable an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon any pretence whatsoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allarming them, or expecting to be opposed Vigorously by them, as well as by the other <hi>Protestent</hi> Powers of <hi>Europe;</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:50018:110"/>
or that he could be thought to be so rash as to venture on such a difficult Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst he foresaw so powerful an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>But that indeed upon the happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a general and lasting Peace among the Catholick Princes, he would most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and readily join and concur in any holy League with them, and contribute his full proportion of Forces with theirs, to so glorious and laudable a Work, as would be the restoration of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to their pristine Power and Majesty, and the Holy See to its former just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction in these famous Islands; which for so many former Ages had made so considerable and profitable a Province of the Roman Church; and therefore they were to desire and press them, not to let any particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests which they had against their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in worldly and secular Concerns, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to go about to mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret or any ways obstruct their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Souls, which could be of no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prejudice to them in those other respects; but rather readily to concur with their Endeavours in so pious and charitable a Work, wherein they ought wholly to lay aside all distinction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Interests, and Cooperate as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50018:110"/>
of one Body, and Subjects of one universal Prince Christ Jesus, and his Vice-gerent-General the Pope. With which Arguments and sly Suggestions, they were to wheedle all Foreigners to at least a careless security and unconcernedness about the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> whilst they play'd their pranks to destroy both our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government, and make us an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennage of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church and Crown; which I pray God, I may never live to see, nor my Country feel; and shall ever do so whilst I am, as I am resolved always to be,</p>

            <p>HOw far the Subject-matter of my last to your Lordship hath relished your Palate, I am altogether ignorant, but adventuring for once to presume its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proved grateful, I have in this, as it were, subjoyned those Instructions the French Agents have received for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musement of the Native Papists of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in order to the carrying on of their Designs under the covert of the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> against our Native Country; To them therefore they were to use in substance the same pretences as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with some further additions, as, That the King and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> were both certainly gained over to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> That the most Leading-Men of the Kingdom, and the Men of most Power and Interest both among the Clergy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50018:111"/>
and Gentry of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were Popishly inclined, and would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, come galloping over tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivy to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when it should be a proper time for the King to declare himself upon that Head; as being well convinced, that Monarchy and Prelacy had no other way to defend themselves against the restless and violent practices and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Sectaries and Republicans, and others their Adherents in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by seasonably re-uniting with the Roman Catholick Party, from their unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifiable Separation and Schism, from whence innumerable, incurable and endless Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Distractions and Factions, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. That for their comfort and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, it was now much otherwise than in the late Civil Wars against King <hi>Charles</hi> I. That the present King of <hi>France</hi> being in a condition to give their now Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, a most powerful and numerons Assistance; and being a most Generous Prince, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al most cordially and well-affected to their King as well as to their Cause; there was no manner of question to be made, but he would effectually do it, without any by-ends of his own, as soon as a general Peace should give leave, by which time things would be ripe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to favour his good Intentions to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50018:112"/>
go on with the Conversion of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yea, and would take care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a sufficient Body of Troops for the abetting of so hopeful a Work, in case there should be any such need of Force, but that it was reasonably to be supposed there would need none: For that by the help of safer Methods and of Mony, which that great and zealous Prince would not let them want for so good a Work, the number of the Roman Catholicks must needs be so mightily encreased in a few Years, that the King might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to declare himself in their favour; and then by the voluntary return of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, and by the very dread of the formidable Power of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, who was known to be a sure and fast Friend to our two Royal Brothers, the other dissenting Factions would be so over-powered with the number of their Opponents, and so terrified at their Strength, that if it had not the good effect to work them up into a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it would at least into such a tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that they would neither be able to hinder, nor have the rashness to oppose what Changes and Innovations the King should afterwards have a mind to make in Church or State, and make them Triumphant in <hi>England.</hi> And thus they were to lead
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50018:112"/>
them on till they had noosed them fast in a Correspondence with them; but not a word was to be told them (till they had first sounded them whether they were fit to hear it) of any design they had to subject <hi>England,</hi> or enslave the rest of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to <hi>French</hi> Tyranny, or of the Murder of King or Duke, or both, in case they found them not pliable enough to their Instigations, or that their abominable Ends could be compassed no other ways; to which, if they would not be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, they were then by those Tools to have some of their Correspondence with them discovered, and have them accused as if they had been really guilty of what they were only tempted to: And so by this means all the considerable Men of them, besides some Rascals to make Tools of, were to be drawn into a close Correspondence with <hi>France,</hi> and beaten quite off from any application to <hi>Rome,</hi> or correspondence with the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> sliely insinuating, that <hi>France</hi> was the only Power in <hi>Christendom</hi> that could preserve or support them. But the full design they had upon the Nation (as before hinted) was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret imparted but to a very few; nay, it was not as much as communicated to the <hi>Jesuits</hi> of the two <hi>British</hi> Nations, but kept almost to the last, as an <hi>Arcanum</hi> among such of them as were Native <hi>French,</hi> except only
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50018:113"/>
two or three <hi>Irish</hi> Fathers, and some very few more of that same Nation, whom they thought averse enough to the <hi>English</hi> Name and Nation, to be heartily true and constant to any Foreign Interest and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er capable to support and effectually to back them in the bloodiest and blackest Contrivances against their detested Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors: for rather than fail, to such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Tragedies they were determined by some means or other to proceed, if they could no otherwise effect their wicked Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and could have found a way to fix the Crime, as they had projected, on some other Party and Nation. <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have been tedious, but could not avoid it; I design without a Countermand to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Your Lordship in my next the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made to rhe Protestant Party up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Head; and in the mean time remain,</p>

            <p>PUrsuant to my Resolutions in the close of my last Letter, without I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Countermand from your Lordship, which I have not, I am to acquaint you, what this Court's Maxims were, and what Methods they went upon, either to make the Protestants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> helpful to their Designs, or at least to do them no disservice, and be no obstruction to them therein. To the Clergy therefore and Gentry of the forementioned Church, whom they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined there was any likelyhood to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, they were to alledge most of the same things as before, as Arguments to perswade and induce them to return to the Bosom of their Church, and would argue much from the agreement in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50018:114"/>
things of both Religons; and were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, sometimes not only first to insinuate and then affirm the King was actually Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; but were moreover impudently to assert, That such and such Bishops, such and such Eminent Doctors, such and such Peers of the Realm, and such and such remarkable Gentlemen, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, Estates, and exquisice Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were to their knowledge, certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly so too, tho' at present but covertly; and, That a greater part of their Church (whatever they might suggest with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the contrary) than they were aware of, or was easily indeed to be imagined, were of the same Sentiments; but that they were under a restraint, and durst not declare themselves to be such, for fear of the <hi>Mobile,</hi> and of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> other Sectaries and <hi>Republican</hi> Parties, which like so many evil Spirits, presided over those Savage kind of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and stirred them as they pleased themselves, against their Superiors.</p>
            <p>But to those, <hi>My Lord,</hi> whom they found to be of the more inflexible sort, they were instructed to make use of great Flatteries and Complements, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, that they had a great deal of reason to love the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> had to do so
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50018:114"/>
by them; for that they had had for a long time the same Common Enemies; had suffered much with them conjointly for the same Royal Cause in the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions; that their Adversaries were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous enough to require their united Power and Strength against them; and that their subtilty was no less to be dreaded by them, whose effects could not be warded off without such a double Force; that there was much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Monarchical Government, now from the Sectaries, than from their Church; for it was plain to any one that was but willing to see, That it was now no more the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> Interest, since they were out of all hopes of being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Religion in the Kingdom, to act against the Church or State of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> under whom they had such mild Treatment, but much rather to join and fall in with them against the Sectaries and Common-wealth's-men, under whom they could never expect any thing but utmost Rigour and Cruelty; That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible for them alone to support and maintain themselves in <hi>England</hi> against so great a number of Sectaries, as were with the greatest inveteracy imaginable animated against them, without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50018:115"/>
the Monarchy, tho' but by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence; It was therefore so much their Concern and real Interest, to Pray for and endeavour after the Prosperity of both Parties, tho' different in Perswasion, that they had no reason to fear any thing from them, nor be alarm'd at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions they had happened to make, which were so few and inconsiderable, as never to be able to do them hurt, had it been so designed, as it was not; That there was no danger neither from the <hi>French</hi> King's Friendship or close Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with their King, it being the only Foreign Security, as matters then stood, that he could have against the intriegues and power of the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> who not only ruined their Commerce by Sea, but were the only People that buoyed up and supported the Sectaries and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Party, and harboured and abetted all Designs both against the Church and State of <hi>England</hi> under the then Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; it being their inseparable Interest in all things to thwart the <hi>English,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every particular they valued themselves upon in the present Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Whereas, there was no exception to be made, but that it was his Most <hi>Christian</hi> Majesty's undoubted Advantage and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Interest to cultivate by all good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the said Friendship and Alliance, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50018:115"/>
to avoid by all manner of means any Rupture or Mis-intelligence with <hi>England,</hi> and to oppose above all things, the change of our Monarchy into a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick.</p>
            <p>In the last place, continued they, Whereas, there had been for some time Reports spread not only of the Duke's, but the King himself's being of their Perswasion, they were to give out to this sort of Men, that that was only a suspicion, and, as they really believed, ill-grounded enough; for tho' they had reason to wish them, and all Mankind else, of their Opinion in that case; yet they had no such reason to think them so; but that the King's having shewed some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them upon the score of their Sufferings for, and Fidelity to his Father and himself, and out of respect to the Most <hi>Christian King</hi> with whom he was so closely Alli'd, for his better support and establishment against the enemies of Monarchical Government, was the only grounds People had had for such Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which were industriously foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the Authors of the former Fears and Jealousies against his Father, in order to get an opportunity thereby once more to destroy the Regal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And, that they made this noise
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50018:116"/>
indeed against Popery, but levelled it only at Episcopal and Kingly Government, not at such contemptible Adversaries as the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks were at that time of day. Then as for the Duke, they were to affirm, They thought and had reason to believe, he was no more a Catholick than the King; but that being a Prince of an high and inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible Spirit, and Heir presumptive to the Royal Diadem, disdained to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any Subjects, either to take an Oath, or give any account of his Religion, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gratifie their Humours and Fancies; and chose rather to forbear acting in any publick Employment: But, that for their part, as he had not yet declared against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> so he had as yet made no profession of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion as they knew of, but took care to keep himself as much reserved towards them, as towards those of the Protestant Perswasion.</p>
            <p>By such sort of Sophisiry and cunning Artifices, thrse <hi>French</hi> Incendiaries were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to endeavour to Keep up the Stiff Church Party in a perpetual Animosity against the Protestant Diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Am come to the last Body of Men within the Kingdom, whom this Court, by such like Engines as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, has endeavoured to manage for to serve their own turn, to the Kingdom's disadvantage, and they are the <hi>Protestant Dissenters;</hi> but they were necessitated, to give the less um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage, to change their shapes and form of expression to those of that Party whom they had the design upon, and to whom they closely and warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated; That they had no occasion to be jealous of the Proceedings of <hi>France,</hi> and be animated so fiercely against King <hi>Lewis,</hi> if they would but once consider,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50018:117"/>
the great Liberty and Priviledges which their Protestant Brethren enjoy'd in the <hi>French</hi> Dominions; their former assisting the oppressed Protestant <hi>Dutch,</hi> and other Protestant States, against the Bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, and Unchristian Inquisition; the severe Persecutions of the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> the frequent differences of <hi>France</hi> with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle power the Pope was allowed in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, no more than what was Titular; and that if these things were but duly weighed, it might be more than presumed, the present <hi>French</hi> King would little concern himself, or any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with Religious Contests in <hi>England:</hi> But that whatever opinion they might have of that Neighbouring King to his disadvantage, which yet did but little affect or concern him, they had on the contrary much occasion to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them at home; and to that end, these Emissaries were to promote, tooth and nail, the belief of the King and Duke's being both Papists; but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to affirm, that the Duke was most certainly of that Religion, and at the same time to discover assured Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of it; as also of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures concerted to bring in both Popery and Arbitrary Power, and really to detect some Measures, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50018:118"/>
had as yet but only projected, or at least but proposed, and that too but to the Duke only, as if they had been fully consented to, and begun underhand to be put in practice; And having once well imprest this, they were to exaggerate the greatness and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the danger, the more to alarm them; and slily to insinuate, that an Accommodation was Transacting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and a thousand other Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they us'd besides, to animate each Party against the other, too tedious for your Lordship to read, or me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; neither need I tell you how they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed one another's designs, only I must Note, Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange,</hi> and almost all the Writers for that side, under a pretence of serving the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Monarchy, and some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the other Party, though unknown to themselves, were and are still but the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Tools and Instruments of <hi>French</hi> Jesuits and <hi>Machiavillian</hi> Emissaries; who were the main Conjurers, that by undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Spells have raised up those Devils of Discord, that under the Names of Whigs, Tories, and Trimmers, have so much disturbed our Native Country, and the LORD knoweth where it will terminate.

               <p>Of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s being drawn into a close Correspondence with the <hi>French</hi> Court, with an Account of his Pension from thence.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot think your Lordship will so much admire, that the Duke should suffer himself to engage into a close Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the <hi>French</hi> Court, yea, and to enter into a separate Treaty with them, when other things more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, have been made evident enough so as not to be contradicted: I cannot tell at present whether there be any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of this same Treaty, than what has come within my Cognizance; but so much as has, as I hope it will be acceptable, I as freely communicate, and was in substance as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:50018:119"/>
First, The Duke was engaged to stick close to his Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Treaties with those of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and even with the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, without the <hi>French</hi> King's Privity and Approbation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To oppose to the utmost of his Power, the King his Brother, from engaging in any War for the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To joyn with him, the <hi>French</hi> King, in making a strong Effort to draw in, if possible, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to embrace a separate Interest from that of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> and if not, to come over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, at least to enter into a separate Treaty with the Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> under a pretence of laying a sure foundation for his own future Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and establish it on both sides the Sea by the suppression of all Factions which now disturbed his Uncle, and might afterward disturb him; and in case he proved still obstinate, to second him in all Methods that might be used to hinder his Succession to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> by hindring any Match that might be proposed between the Prince
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50018:120"/>
and the Princess <hi>Mary;</hi> and that he should for that purpose keep off Matching either of his Two Daughters upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretences to gain time till a fit juncture might come, when Matches might be accomplished for them both, with <hi>French</hi> Princes, or some other Princes in that Interest, <hi>viz.</hi> the eldest to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and the younger to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or a Prince of the Houses of <hi>Conde</hi> or <hi>Conti,</hi> or to the Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the Duke should do his utmost to have the Government of his Children himself, and to have them Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ored, if possible, in his own Religion; and if they were obstinate, in case he should sail of other Issue, then they would have had him to exclude them, and Adopt the Duke of <hi>Chartres</hi> for his Heir, (but this was only proposed) and Intail the Crown thence forward to Heirs Male only, and to have the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> Law Established in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in <hi>France;</hi> but and if he should not be powerful enough to hinder a Match with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or some other Protestant Prince, (but of the former they were most jealous,) then to concur with them to cut him off; but this point would not be formally assented to neither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50018:120"/>
But all Points proposed were on his part easily assented to; As doing his utmost for the propagation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, pursuing Measures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed for dividing of Protestants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of Parliaments, and putting forward Arbitrary Counsels without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and particularly to raise Arms in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and call in <hi>French</hi> Forces, in case the King should at any time, by any Motives whatsoever, be influenced to act to the <hi>French</hi> King's prejudice.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Duke was to take care, That no Popish Clergy or Layety should be imploy'd by him, but such as were in the <hi>French</hi> Interests, and trust his main Secrets with none but such as were <hi>French-</hi>born Jesuits; on which Conditions he was to have a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Annuity of Six hundred thousand Crowns, and extraordinary Sums when necessary, and the circumstances of things did require to carry on any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Points, even to what he pleased himself to demand.</p>
            <p>So all things being thus concluded, he received in hand, Three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Crowns of his Annuity, and Six
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50018:121"/>
hundred thousand Crowns extraordinary; and Jewish Bankers were accordingly imployed to transmit the Money to him from time to time; Besides all which, the <hi>French</hi> King's Confessor promised him a private Contribution from the Clergy, and others under his influence, of six hundred thousand Crowns more. But notwithstanding all these mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and other more magnificent ones, That he should not want five or six Millions of Livres at any time, to bring a design to perfection when once he had made a progress; their Notes say, That private directions were given to feed him only with such mean pittances as would but just enable him to keep himself up, and persuade him still to go on, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex matters, or <hi>Broviller les Cartes</hi> as they term it, raise and exasperate Factions and Parties; but never to proceed so far as totally to suppress any, lest he should make himself too much Master, and by that means be able to set up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, without their further Aid and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, or have any Money to spare and lay up for his own use, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in private Cabals against them.</p>
            <p>The same Method they used. <hi>My Lord,</hi> with most of their other Pensioners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the English Popish Party; but to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50018:121"/>
all their other Instruments, they were most liberal and punctual, till such time as they had no further use of them, and had a mind to turn them off, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them, as we have said, to use their Talents on a contrary side.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50018:122"/>
how he spent it; to use all the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence she had over him, to perform with utmost exactness all the points of his Agreement with them; but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that part which related to the Duke's Daughters; and finally, to second effectually the means which they should prescribe her at any time about giving an <hi>Italian Fig</hi> to the King, either of the two Princesses, or all of them, if it were though requisite, as the cause of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, her own main Interest of securing the <hi>English</hi> Throne in the Succession of it to her Husband and her own Issue, should necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require, without concerning the Duke her Husband at all in the said Intrigue; In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of her compliance wherein, she was likewise to have an Annuity assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, but the definite Sum is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and whether she had Sons or Daughters to live, she, as far as lay in her power to promote it, was to assent to have them Match'd to the most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent of the Royal Family of <hi>France,</hi> if there were any such for them; or into such other Princely Families as were most suitable for them in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Most Christian Majesty; who did oblige himself to take a Paternal care of them, and would ever keep his Royal Word by the exactest Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.

            <p>YOur Lordship will not now wonder, when such as I have mentioned in some of my late Letters, have plung'd themselves so deeply in <hi>French</hi> Sudds, that others should be so easily drawn into their Interests; I am to acquaint you therefore, That this Court had, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Projection, gain'd the most considerable <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in the Three Kingdoms, by fair and specious Pretences, to comply even to every thing they desired of them; as thinking King <hi>Lewis</hi> to be a most Generous Prince, that had no By-ends in it, but as he was most able, was most willing to promote the propagation of that Religion, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instating their King in a condition to Protect them, out of a pure piece of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Zeal for the Catholick Faith,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50018:124"/>
as they were wont to Word it; who therefore most willingly entred into a Correspondence with his Agents and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries; and some of them took Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but I cannot give your Lordship a List of their Names at this juncture; but most of that Kidney acted freely, in using all the endeavours they possibly could, to induce both King, Duke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a compliance with them in all things they had instructions to move to them and sollicit for; as they had long done themselves in the points I have already mentioned to your Lordship, and which I need not repeat: But tho' they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, if either one or both of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Brothers should disoblige them too much, especially the King, or that any juncture of things, or grand conveniency of theirs, should persuade, to proceed to some barbarous Extremity against the Persons of one or both of them; yet they thought not good to trust any <hi>British</hi> Papists with any thing so black, no not so much as their Jesuits, but took par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular heed to reserve th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se Mysteries to another Cabal, having provided for that a <hi>Juncto</hi> of Foreigners and <hi>Irish</hi> for the taking off the King, if things came to that extremity: And as for the Duke, they seemed not much afraid of him, and therefore made no such exact provision,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50018:124"/>
but they knew of some two or three desperate <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> whom they had in reserve for that purpose, and they were of the <hi>Scotch Nation;</hi> but if the King alone was to be taken off, then the Dutchess's Cabal in conjunction with that of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> were to engage in it; but if things came to that extremity, as that both Brothers were to be removed, then <hi>Portsmouth</hi>'s Gang was only to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, without the concern or privity of the other. And this last Cabal of <hi>Portsmouth</hi>'s was composed of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Jesuits, and Jesuited Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots.</p>
            <p>But among them there was a certain Priest named <hi>Kelly,</hi> who was a long time Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to the Cabal, and is still I believe, on this side the Water, and coming to hear by the Correspondence he held with his Complotters in <hi>England,</hi> there were some who scrupled such Undertakings; he went Over, saying, He would procure enough to do either of the Works if occasion were. I had once a Bill upon him for a Friend of mine, and then I remember he railed mightily against both King and Duke, and said they were both Knaves, Fools and Cowards, for that having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the <hi>French</hi> Interest, they would be Ruined, and see all their Kingdoms quickly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50018:125"/>
in Flames; That it was an easie matter for the King of <hi>France</hi> to do it; That it would very quickly be effected, and be a most laudable Action; and would, he hoped, end in the total subjection of the Three Kingdoms to the <hi>French</hi> King's Power, which he heartily wished for his poor Country's sake, so tyrannized over by Hereticks; with abundance more of such Stuff; but I knew not then he was so deeply concerned as afterward, when I found his name for an Undertaker in <hi>Portsmouth</hi>'s Cabal; one Father <hi>Patrick</hi> also who used often to go and come, and was wont to conceal his Intriguing under a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar appearance, was another of the same Cabal, with two or three <hi>French</hi> Men, whose Names I have not at present.

            <p>I Have already upon two several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions observed to Your Lordship, how the Duke and Dutchess were drawn into private Correspondences with the <hi>French</hi> Court, which when they had once happily effected, and by them and some others, already in their Interests, (whereof I have mentioned soome) drawn in, many more both Courtiers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they proceeded, being thus so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably re-inforced, to hedge in the King himself; and it was high time, for they had now a greater Jealousie than ever, of the Match with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> tho' he were not yet come over into <hi>England</hi> to that purpose; and so far they did prevail, that he did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himself to do all he could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve still a partial Neutrality with them:

Then they proposed his hindring the Match with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> unless he could be drawn into a separate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the two Kings, and delay at all Matching of the Princesses till a general Peace, and to reserve the Eldest for the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> tho' in the mean while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> the same ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for his Daughter, the better to keep him in a Neutrality with them during the then War with the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> but never intended it with the latter, if they could have effected it with our Princess; But in that, the King told them, There might be difficulties insuperable, and so could promise them nothing but his Endeavours, which by reason the Parliament and People were much out of Humour, upon the Duke's late Match would require much Money; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause now for him to go about to cross them afresh, in obstructing, or so much as delaying such a Match, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal whereof was already so much known to his People, and found to be so much desired by them, as the only remedy they imagined they had left them against the feared mischief of the other, would hinder them perhaps from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him such Supplies as he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise expect of them: unless his Most Christian Majesty obliged himself to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50018:126"/>
supply him with Money enough to need them not, or at least to buy Votes, and to stop clamorous Mouths; but as for that Motion of theirs about committing the Children to the Duke's Care and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>orage, tho' they were seconded in it by the Duke himself with all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity imaginable, yet he absolutely denied them; saying, They were his Children, or rather the Nation's, and not the Duke's, especially now he had Matched so much against the Nation's liking; and that could he have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the People of <hi>England</hi> would have taken so much Allarm at that Marriage, he should have taken care to have stopped it in time; But that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving let one Fault pass, to admit another much worse, was a thing he doubted not but would cause such Earthquakes as he was resolved not to run the risque of, therefore should not do it; so that Article was wholly laid aside, and the Treaty concluded without, by which the <hi>French</hi> King was to pay ours an Annuity of Twelve hundred thousand Crowns, whereof Six hundred thousand in hand, besides a Donative of a like Sum at the same time for Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and if any occasion should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by crosness of Parliaments, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, or otherwise, that should reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50018:127"/>
require so much, then he was promised to have it augmented to twelve Millions of <hi>Livres</hi> whilst such Troubles should last, tho' this latter part they never intended, but gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he should be treated only with a Bit now and then, as was the Duke his Brother; only if a Civil War should happen, they were to feed it on both sides, till it were fit to pour in <hi>French</hi> Forces among them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I have observed, during my abode in this Station, that there was a Fund of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Millions of <hi>Livres</hi> designed for our three Kingdoms, whereof sometimes they gave largely to the King and Duke his Brother, and slenderly to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions, only to keep them in heart; and sometimes again largely to them, and little or none to the King and Duke, to make the former Lusty, and Mettlesome to kick and keep the others Low, that being in a crowing condition, they might comply with them. Of those Sums, there has gone some years Four, sometimes Six, and sometimes Eight Millions to <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but to the King and Duke, there never went more than than I have mentioned, and that but the first Year neither; all the rest went to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50018:127"/>
other Courtiers, and to the several Factions, who of late have had most of it.</p>
            <p>In this Treaty, which was concluded by a private Agent, as were the others, there was a Clause incerted, which gave the King leave, if too much press'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to pretend as if he would side with the <hi>Confederates</hi> against <hi>France,</hi> and to get Money of them, as also of his Parliament on that account; but yet he was by no means to Declare, but to get an Army and Revenue settled for some time, such as was supposed to be the duration of the War, and then to use both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to settle his Prerogative-Royal, and make himself Absolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>My Lord,</hi> without some Reluctancy, think of several Passages in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and particularly, that a King who above Twenty Years had had the greatest opportunity of any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors to make himself great both at Home and abroad, should fall to so abject a State, as to become a <hi>French Pensioner,</hi> which without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any other Crime, is more than enough eternally to blast the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of an <hi>English</hi> Monarch; but I know

               <p>Of King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Politick's upon his Entring into the fore-mentioned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate League with <hi>France,</hi> as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the <hi>French</hi> Court.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>

            <p>IN my last, your Lordship had the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Private League</hi> entred into by our King, and this Court, it may not be now unworthy your curiosity to know the Censure they have past upon him in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that head; they have said, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood well enough that what ever their Design might be in obtaining such a point, that the King, and his Brother's too up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, was to draw as much Money out of them as they possibly could thereby, and yet not to venture too far on any of those important and ticklish Points propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, without very large Summs, to secure every Step made forward, and that by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance too; for that they both concluded that the best and only way to make the <hi>French</hi> stick close to them was, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways considerably before-hand with them, not without reason, as they imagined, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if they were not still before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, when they had engaged them in Difficulties, and saw them fast, they would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50018:129"/>
leave them in the lurch: As for the King, tho' they knew him to be no more a Papist than he was a Politician, yet he was of the Opinion, if the Popish Religion could be handsomly made predominant, it might suit better with the Monarchy; yet having no Children to succeed him, that he was but careless in that point, and his Brother only being concerned in that matter, he moved only as he was spurred on by his importunity, the Temptation of Money, the Diffidence he had of his People, and among others, the Fears he had either of having his days shortned, or his Crown very much endangered by the Intrigues of his Brother, or the <hi>French</hi> King; should he not keep fair and humour them both in some tollerable measure, since he found himself so far intangled in their snares: For as for his Nephew the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that he had no aversion for him, but rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination through Nature and Policy, and therefore was of himself willing enough the Match should go on; yet that he would have been glad, if the Prince could have been drawn over to the <hi>French</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, for that then he thought he would have compassed many desirable Ends in one business, and made a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to have satisfied all parties in the greatest part of their several Pretensions; because that then he supposed he could have satisfied the <hi>French</hi> King, in bringing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50018:129"/>
over a Prince to his Interest so very capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to serve him in that juncture of time; that he would have satisfied also those of his own Subjects, who were well affected to the <hi>English</hi> Monarchy, as he would have likewise our Trading Companies, by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying our Princess to a Prince of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion,</hi> whom he by separating from the Interests of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and drawing into a League with two great Kings, should have put into a condition to depress that Republick, which was so ill a Neighbour to the Monarchy, so much our rival in Trade, and so great a fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Schisms and Factions in <hi>England;</hi> that thereby he should have laid grounds to hope, that if ever he succeeded to those Crowns, he might be able to subject the <hi>Belgick</hi> to the <hi>British Lions,</hi> and transfer the magazine of the Riches of the World from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> into <hi>England;</hi> and that fie thought to have satisfied the Duke, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a great measure, by so satisfying his friend the <hi>French</hi> King, and likewise by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing a Republick so well scituated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to abet his deadly Enemies, that in all appearance would way-lay his Succession to the Throne, and thereby cutting off all occasion from that Male-content party, that continually sought occasion to stir up against him the old Devils of Fears and Jealousies of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> And that he thought to oblige the Prince
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50018:130"/>
too, by putting him into a method to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Sovereign in time. And lastly, that he was perswaded, if the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with those Methods, the Match could disoblige no body, but the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the sympathizing Factions of the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Republicans,</hi> whom he thought inconsiderable; but that how desirous soever he was of such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with <hi>France,</hi> as they desired, yet it was not in his inclination to break the Match, for that he having in reality a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mind to the Alliance with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> than to that with the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> in which he did imagine he foresaw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furmountable Difficulties, and such as might endanger, if not over-turn, his Throne, ruine his Brother, and the whole Royal Family, and at last make <hi>Great Britain</hi> but a <hi>French</hi> Province; however that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temper of the Duke, his Brother, and the vindicative humour of the <hi>French</hi> King, he was willing to seem almost all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisant, and temporize for a while, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might appease them, and at the same time get what Money could be drawn from <hi>France,</hi> both for his own security and pleasure; and when he had done that, that he knew wheeling about and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Match, when they least thought of it, or expected it would please his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple again, tho' never so unsatisfied by the delay. These, my Lord, are the Sentiments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50018:130"/>
of this Court, concerning him; which, if true, in all points, I conceive they are more beholding to him, than many persons in <hi>England</hi> are willing to believe of him; but I shall leave it to your Lordships profound Judgment, to revolve upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and remain,</p>

with them some time before; but whether it were that the Ministers on this side conceived such a Judgment of the King, as I have already related, and such of the Duke, which I am just about to relate, I cannot possitively determine; but thus it is they censure him, saying, That though he was so much a Bigot in Religion that he was totally averse to the <hi>Aurangian Alliance,</hi> unless it could be reconciled to those ends which he proposed to himself thereby, and especially about Replanting both the <hi>Popish Religion</hi> and <hi>Absolute Power</hi> in the three Kingdoms, and incline rather to the Match suggested with the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the more friendly to oblige his Most Christian Majesty to assist him through all the difficulties he fore-saw he had to pass; yet he was not a little affraid, of the great Resistance he knew would necessarily be made against such an Alliance, which many in <hi>England</hi> looked upon as the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious that ever could befall their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; being also of himself not a little jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that if once such a Match between his Eldest Daughter and the <hi>Dauphine</hi> were concluded, some sly practises might be carried on by the <hi>French</hi> Court, against the Issue he should have by his now Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, in favour of that his Daughter might probably have by the <hi>Dauphine;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was much more willing and desirous, if it might be compassed, that a

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50018:132"/>
reference to their League and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies with them, and especially the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of the Match, I could neither deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it were purely their own Suggestions, collected from the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and natural Positions of things as they then stood, which I was inclined to, or to some secret Information from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, but now I find the latter to be true; for whatever the King, Duke and Dutchesse's true Sentiments were, so they were represented under-hand by <hi>Coleman</hi> to the <hi>Juncto</hi> here, and by some other self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended Confidents of theirs, of whom but more particularly of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> I find it thus inserted in our Minutes: That being entered into a close and separate Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence of his own with this Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that known to their Highnesses, whose Agent he was, he was therein to give them intelligence of all that was transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>White-hall,</hi> and <hi>St. James</hi>'s, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he could, but more especially of the Comportment of the King and the Duke, as to the Points agreed on between <hi>France</hi> and them; as also of the Disposition of all the Factions in <hi>England,</hi> and of the foreign Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to obliege himself to make Parties to cross his Master, the Duke, or the King, or both; in case either, or both of them, should go about to deviate from the Measures prescribed them by the <hi>French</hi> Court.</p>

I find, my Lord, he was besides this a great Undertaker for Conversions, and Proselyting Men to <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather <hi>France;</hi> and his Agreement with them was to have allowed him as an Annuity the Summe of Twenty Thousand Crowns pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to be paid, and for Extraordinaries, as should be calculated, according to the emergency of the Occasions: His Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for Conversions were manifold, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant enough in the relation of them; and did slily at first insinuate, and when he had once broken the Ice, warmly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that whereas the Duke had very large Remittances made him upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Conversions, wherein he was an Undertaker; that it were more advisable, for the future, to entrust him with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Summe for that purpose, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by save themselves that deal which they must have sent to the Duke upon that Account, if they should send any; and so moved them, entirely to wave that point with him, for that he could do much more in that nature, than the Duke could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, because more imperceptibly.</p>
            <p>He promised them likewise for the gaining of Members of Parliament over to their Interest, great and mighty things, and then discreetly insinuated those things already spoken of, about the Designs of the King and Duke towards them, and thereupon advised them to transmit unto
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50018:133"/>
them both only but moderate Summes, and let him have but moderate ones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a private Man's fortune, and he would take effectual care both to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them, and do their business in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> more to purpose, than they would do without him.</p>
            <p>He also added, That to give the King and Duke great Summes, would be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to enable them to buy the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's Votes for themselves, and not for the Interest of <hi>France,</hi> and to get such store of Money of them, that they would afterward take such measures as they themselves pleased, without any regard to <hi>France,</hi> being sure to please the People at any time whenever they were minded to go contrary to them; and much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the same purpose, with which I shall no farther trouble your Lordship, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe my self, as I unfeignedly am, and ever shall be,</p>

            <p>YOu have heard what a Spoke Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was pleased to put in the King and even, the Duke, his dear Master's wheel, which they, poor Princes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of, moved hard for the Summes promised by <hi>France:</hi> the Duke as supposing his Credit the better, being the forwarder of the Two, and whose Pretences were, that he had been forced to lay out by advance, the greatest part of the Money already pay'd to make Creatures for their mutual Interest, and future advantage, all such Enterprizes being much more charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to begin, then to carry on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that when Correspondencies were begun they must be carried on, and that still by advance, if any thing of service were expected, or hoped for.</p>
            <p>That he had a most difficult and uneasy Task to deal with the King, his Brother's timerous and changeable Disposition, and was, and had been at a very great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to greaze Favourites of more Kinds then one, that might influence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50018:134"/>
him to, and hinder others that might disswade him from what they in <hi>France</hi> did expect from him, or urged him to; as also to appease and quell Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on all sides, which his late Match with their adopted Daughter, and change in Religion had stirred up violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and that to keep the King, his Brother, steddy in a favourable Neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in regard to <hi>France,</hi> and yet at the same time either break off the Match quite with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> defer it so long as they desired, or negotiate a private Treaty with that Prince in their favour, and to their advantage, with that power and good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect desirable, required, as they might well imagine, more than ordinary Summes of Money, and all ready, and in <hi>Specie</hi> too.</p>
            <p>But that if besides his ordinary Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, according to the Agreement, which he expected should be punctually pay'd him every six months, he could but have a Summ of a Million of Crowns again seasonably advanced him for Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, before the time of the next proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Parliament were expired; then he did believe he might bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so to bear, by such a Reinforcement, so as to be able to gain Votes enough even in the Parliament it self to carry it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all others, both in respect to the Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, and to the gaining their Consent for deferring any Foreign Allyance, by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50018:134"/>
way of Marriage of either of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till a General Peace was concluded, and work very much with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> too to comply with their desires, when he should see the Parliament gave him no hopes otherwise of compassing his Aims; or if not, yet at least he should be able hereby to keep himself still strongest in the Privy Council, and in the Court, where nothing should be transacted to their disadvantage.</p>

            <p>YOU have heard what pressing Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces His Highness has made for his Remittances, according to Agreement; and what mighty Encouragements he has given this Court of gaining their Ends, both in Court and Parliament: And now 'tis fit the King should put in his Plea at last; which he did in this manner, as their Minutes represent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:50018:136"/>
That for his part, he had advanced ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than less Money than he had already received from them, for carrying on their Work; and that, not to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate many Particulars, he would observe to them, that when he saw there was no other Probability of obliging his dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France,</hi> in preserving the Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, so much desired by him, but by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing of his Parliament, which they knew well enough, was a tender Point: That yet not to be wanting to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Interests, and his own Engagements, he had adventured so far, as even twice to Prorogue them; and had withal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended most of his own Moneys, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, if possible, against the next Meeting, or Session of Parliament, to make a Party, so as to be able, in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Way, to over-match his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, and those of the Most Christian King, his Brother; and not only that, but to be in a Condition to support himself, during their Recess, in the Figure he ought, as King of <hi>England,</hi> to make, both at home, and abroad, for his own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as well as that of the Most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King's; and so carry on the Work of Mediation between him and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, as his Brother of <hi>France</hi> would have; as likewise the desired Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Holland,</hi> to induce the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to a Compliance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50018:136"/>
That they could not but know he was much involved in Debts by the last War, in Conjunction with them, against <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and other extraordinary Occasions, by Troubles arising, and fomented chiefly by his adhering to his Brother of <hi>France</hi>'s Interest; and that he having Prorogued his Parliament upon his Account, and thereby put himself under an absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of being deprived of the Legal Assistance of his People; it was but very reasonable and just they should advance such a Sum as might enable him, not only further to gratifie His Most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Desires, but also to satisfie in part his own extraordinary Necessities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence him for the Subsidies he miss'd of thereby again and again from his own Subjects.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, He demanded, at least, such a Re-inforcement as he had before receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Conclusion of the Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> and that by way of Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, besides his Annuity punctually paid: And of this he expected an exact Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance before the——, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides another Advance at the Beginning of that Session; that so he might be able to make his Party good against all Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers at their next Meeting, or else Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue them, without fear of wanting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney during their Recess: And did further insist, beside some other Proposals not

            <p>YOur Lordship may refresh your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by calling to mind what I have some time since writ to you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the King, and his Brother the Duke's pressing of this Court for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittances agreed on, and what further
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50018:137"/>
Additions they wanted, for Negotiating of Businesses then in Agitation, with <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Countermine to part of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. I am now further to acquaint your Honour, that the fore-mentioned Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, together with those Cautions of <hi>Coleman,</hi> produced this Effect, that they sent about half as much Money as they had advanced at first to each of them; telling them at the same time, that the Most Christian King's Conveniency would not admit of a larger Remise at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; neither could he do it with that Privacy he would, but by his <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Geno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a;</hi> and therefore desired them to make what shift they could with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, till the Event of the Parliament was seen, whether it were Prorogued, or no.</p>
            <p>But to the Duke they more particularly told, that if what was then remitted would not serve turn, and that he wanted more, rather than baulk his Designs, he might venture hardily on the Most Christian King's Word, to lay out of his own Store; that he should certainly be re-paid again at the time mentioned, with an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus: And that as for the Conversions he spake of, they waved them; and said, Father <hi>la Chaise</hi> and that Society had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided now a Fund for that Work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50018:138"/>
But to <hi>Coleman,</hi> not mentioning the Motion about Conversions, they only sent a good Gratuity for the Prorogation before, and about the Sum of Twenty Thousand Crowns Advance Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to hire an House, and to do other things, in order to the Corrupting of Parliament-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he saw like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of it, he was to have—000 Crowns more, for to try Events; if he succeeded, he was promised—0000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; and for a Prorogation when judged necessary, for so long as desired, another very considerable Sum, not particularly mentioned.</p>
            <p>How far any of the fore-mentioned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did proceed, by way of Compliance with this Court, I know no otherwise for the present than thus, (in general) that they have noted the two Royal Brothers were a little disheartned to see their Friends on this side so backward to supply them; but that however, considering the Plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the French Excuses, and their own pressing Necessities, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the King's, they not only took what was sent them, but resolved also to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to oblige the <hi>Messiurs</hi> as much as they could, to the end they might induce them by Performances to send them more.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50018:139"/>
thereof; and the better to draw in the Men, they were very industrious in ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Women of Quality most fit for intreague, to declare themselves for their Church, and under that pretence to make so many Partizans for <hi>France</hi> as they could; whose Grandeur chiefly they had in view, as to the best of my remembrance I have noted once and again to your Lordship: And not that of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or his Religion, which was only to serve for a Covert to the other, to the end their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices might not be discovered, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the other foreign Ministers of that Communion. And so good success they had in those Jugling-proceedings, that it bred in them indeed too much confidence of their going through with the rest of their Work with the same ease, and so made them guilty of the weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of an over-hasty bragging and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Secrets of their Measures, which in so jealous a Nation as <hi>England</hi> is, for a Jesuite, and a <hi>French</hi> one too to do it, was a very great Error in Policy; for St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> and his Gang, having met with such success in their work as they dreamed not of, they hence, after having made sure of the Duke, took the confidence to attempt the King himself, and were, as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, heard very favourably by him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been often told by him in Complement, that he looked upon their Religion as the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50018:139"/>
most politick, and that they had really made him so much a Convert, as to think that the Protestant Religion produced but ill Subjects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But finding for all this that the effect was not answerable to the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and favourable incouragement, that he could not be brought actually to declare for them, they oftentimes railed at him in private in <hi>England,</hi> and when any of them came over hither occasionally, the mildest Character they could give of him was, That he was a Prince that looked upon all Religion as a politick Cheat, to keep the World in awe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for before upon such Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the King, as aforesaid, they were so over joy'd, that it did indeed make them indiscreet upon it, so far as to make it almost their common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Discourse, not only to those alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fixed in their Opinion, and that were of a stay'd and reserved Temper, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to new Converts, and baulling talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Women; nay, and inserted it in their Letters too, both In-land and Foreign, that they had gained both Duke and King to their Religion; that they had fished in the <hi>British</hi> Ocean with such wonderful suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that they fished now only for the greater Fish of all, leaving the small Fry to come of themselves, having already catcht two Royal Fishes (the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and <hi>Tung)</hi> with many such like Expressions;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50018:140"/>
and it was very ordinary with them in Conferences of Controversies, when they saw other Arguments have little effect, to urge the Example of the King and Duke; two such wise Princes as they represented them, who knew and understood perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well the Principles of the <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and all the Arguments it was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by, and yet had in a manner yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the invincible force of the Truth, which appeared on their side; and had, said they, against their Temporal Interests, to the evident hazards of their Persons and Dignities, to which they preferred the Welfare of their more precious Souls, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Opinions.

            <p>IT was not without some Difficulty that I have been able to perform the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory Clause of my last Letter, in reference to Father <hi>St. Germain</hi>'s unseasonable Words concerning the King's Perversion to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; who, among others, more particularly repeated the said Brags to a young Friar, then lately turned Protestant, in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> (as I learnt afterward;) and whom, for what peculiar Reasons I could never come to know, he laboured with more than ordinary Application to reclaim back again from his pretended Heresie, and at any rate to dispatch him back into <hi>France.</hi> That same young Friar went by the Name of <hi>Lusancy;</hi> but <hi>St. Germain</hi> said, his true Name was <hi>Beau-Chateau;</hi> and, it seems, had been <hi>St. Germain</hi>'s Scholar formerly, when Regent in the College of <hi>Clermont,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50018:141"/>
in this City; and consequently, knowing more of <hi>St. Germain,</hi> than any other Man, perhaps, in <hi>England.</hi> It may be, the Fear of some Inconveniency to their Designs, by that Knowledge, and such Discourses as he might happen to have thereupon, was one Reason of the said Father's so great eagerness to remove him out of the way. In fine, How, <hi>de facto,</hi> and in truth, he managed the Business with him, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirm; but certain it is, that <hi>Lusancy</hi> pretended, that upon his deferring, as the other thought, a little too much his full Compliance with his Desires, he offered him Violence; and, with several Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, threatned to stab or pistol him if he would not sign such a Recantation as he presented, and go along with those he brought with him, in order to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Transportation: And that upon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint thereof to the Parliament, then Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by a noble Lord, to whom <hi>Lusancy</hi> applied himself, and whom I need not name, I believe, to your Lordship, though perhaps you have never heard this Story before, in its full length, and by the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of some other of their Practices, the said <hi>Lusancy</hi> forced <hi>St. Germain</hi> to flee; and was the Cause of some Stir against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Priests and Emissaries at that time; which were the <hi>Praeludium</hi> to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed afterwards, in the time of the late Conspiracy imputed to the said Party. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50018:141"/>
no less certain it is on the other side, that <hi>St. Germain</hi>'s Imprudence and ill Conduct, both in that and other things, was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless and inexcusable, that he was a long time in some Disgrace with the Duke and Dutchess, with Father <hi>la Chaise,</hi> and the whole Society of his Order; to whom he was forced, by a long and laborious Apology, to vindicate himself as well as he could; particularly, about the unhappy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of <hi>Lusancy,</hi> and his rash and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Speeches of the King and Duke of <hi>York,</hi> which he compiled with much Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Eloquence; and made me cloath it in the English Tongue, to the end he might satisfie his Friends of both Nations of his Innocence of those foul Aspersions cast upon him, as he would have it: Yet he could never so solidly refute what was so plainly objected against him, but that still there remained Causes sufficient to suspect, that the Assertions of such as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused him were not without some real Grounds. And indeed, though they were glad to have the same pass for a plausible Defence among Secular Persons, for their common Reputation, upon which that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Society so much value and esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet within their own Cloisters they were so little satisfied with his specious Pleas, that they mulcted him, as they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually do their own Members upon failure of Conduct, by sending him to and fro,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50018:142"/>
and employing him in low and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, which only <hi>Juniors</hi> used to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and were a long time before they admitted him to any considerable Post a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; though at last, after sufficient Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, upon his uninterrupted and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Importunities, to be restored again once more to their good Opinion; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Promises to be more assiduous in their Service, and careful of his Conduct for the future, and because he had been at first with <hi>Coleman,</hi> the chief Author of the Duke's being drawn into a close and separate Intrigue with the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by the Intervention of Father <hi>la Chaise,</hi> and knew best of any the Secrets and Mystery of it, he was again intrusted to manage the Continuation of that Correspondence, by the means of <hi>Coleman,</hi> his old Friend's receiving all Letters from him, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all those of Father <hi>la Chaise</hi> and his Creatures in <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Coleman</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and others with whom they had any Intrigue in <hi>England;</hi> among whom was one Lady <hi>Glascow,</hi> who received and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed most of the Letters which were not inclosed in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Pacquet, and which were commonly numerous enough, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her under six or seven several Names, changing every time, or every other time at least, the Name, and the Direction.

let her be in the <hi>French</hi> Disposal; and that his Brother, the King, would be involved in equal Trouble on that Account, as on the other: For that if she were given to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> without first enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him in the Interests of <hi>France,</hi> that thereby he would have a double Claim to the Crown; that of Course the King, his Brother, must be drawn into a War with <hi>France;</hi> and that by so doing, both the Royal Brethren would lose for ever the <hi>French</hi> King's Friendship and Support in case of Extremity, which they would infallibly be reduced to by such a War, or by but making a Shew of it; For if it went on, whether there were Cause, or no, there would be Jealousies of the Duke's Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding with <hi>France;</hi> yea, and of the King too: And that, after all, such a Match would be interpreted but for a piece of Policy, only to hide from the People their Correspondence with <hi>France;</hi> and would never cure their Jealousies, nor take off the Fears they had of a Popish Succession by his new Dutchess; but add Strength and Courage to them to oppose Remedies against it. That thereupon, when they had the King once in a War, they would not give him any Money to carry it on, unless they saw the laying of it out, and had, in a manner, the Administration of the War in their own Hands; in which His Highness would be but a Cypher, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50018:143"/>
would never be trusted. That then, not content with that, it was not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that the Exclusion of himself, and of his Heirs by the Second Bed, unless educated in the Protestant Religion, would likewise be hotly urged in the next place, in favour of a Protestant Prince so doubly Allied to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Enemy of <hi>France,</hi> and a Native of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Country, next their own, so much adored by them. That such an Alliance would strengthen that Faction, that was already but too strong. That such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion being press'd, the King must either grant it, or deny it; if he granted it, as it was to be feared he might, then was His Highness, and the Heirs of his Religion, lost without Recovery; and then it would be out of the <hi>French</hi> King's Power, as well as Inclination, to assist him, after having been so disobliged, against the Power of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> united; neither could he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Advantage to himself, be it as it will: That if the King should resist the said Importunity about Exclusion, that then he would expose himself to the Distractions of a Civil War, which might end both in the Ruin of the Royal Family, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy it self; for that the Republicans would not fail to lift up their Crests again in those Troubles: And that besides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> being already very popular,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50018:144"/>
might be tempted by so fair an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to put in for a Pretender to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; and that it was not impossible that the King, if he saw him favoured by the People, might be tempted too to prefer the Interest of a Son, before that of a Brother; and a Brother too, for whom he must be necessitated to undergo so much Vexation and Trouble, and run so great a Risque to defend. That in the mean while, <hi>England</hi> being in a War with <hi>France,</hi> that King, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of helping him, must be obliged, in his own Defence, to foment those Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and abet his Enemies. That perhaps he might think some of these Fears but imaginary; but that His Highness might assure himself, they had better Intelligence than he in that Case, and were very well satisfied that all the said Parties were ready disposed, and had concerted all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against him; and that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted by Men of the greatest power and Interest in the three Kingdoms; and then, of what Power and Influence such plausible and popular Pretensions would be among the People, when promoted and advanced by such Men, His Royal Highness could not be ignorant of.</p>
            <p>That therefore, all summed up, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared, the Dangers attending the Espousing his Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> were as great, if not considerably greater, than those that would be incurred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50018:144"/>
by giving her up to the Disposal of the <hi>French</hi> King; for more could not be feared from that, than what had been mention'd: Therefore they conjured him, as he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his own Good and Safety, or that of his Posterity, or of his Brother, or, lastly, of the hopeful Beginnings of the Catholick Religion in these Kingdoms, that he should be persuaded, and also persuade his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to take the Council of <hi>France,</hi> both in the Disposal of the Princess, and other things relating thereto; for that the Danger of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the French King was no greater than that on the other side, but that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance on his side would be great and powerful, as well as Cordial; whereas it never could be in the other Party's Power, much less in their Interest or Inclination, to afford him any Succour in his Troubles, but rather to add Oil to the Flame: And above all, never to be so rash, as to suffer himself to be tempted to consent to a War against <hi>France,</hi> for that the Factions would then have their Ends of him, as having a full Opportunity put into their hands thereby to compleat his Ruin without Controul. These were the Arguments used to His Royal Highness, against the March with the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> And with which I shall at present conclude, who am,</p>

               <p>Proposals made to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> about consenting to have his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> privately Trapanned into <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Gave in my last to your Lordship a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Remonstrances used to the Duke, in general, against his consenting to have his Daughter married to the Prince of <hi>Orange:</hi> I shall now endeavour to oblige your Lordship with some new Proposals made to him upon that Head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Duke should use all the Power and Interest he had with the King, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to let his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> take a Voyage into <hi>France,</hi> to take the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bourbon;</hi> or else to consent she might be privily sent away by the Duke, as against his Knowledge and Will; and that then they would get her speedily married; which putting things past Retrieve, Matters might the better, by good Management, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and made up to all their Satisfactions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to this purpose the <hi>French</hi> King would send a most splendid Embassy into <hi>England,</hi> of one of the chief Peers of his Realm, with a very numerous Train of choice Nobility. But if the King consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50018:145"/>
publickly to that Proposition, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess might go over in the said Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor's Company: Or if he gave private Consent, she might be conveyed away, as in the first Article.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the King should by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it, that then the Duke should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a Way to get her seized and shipped off at the Ambassador's Departure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's Privity or Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That if it were done by the King's Consent, the Sum of Five and twenty Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Livres</hi> should be, without fail, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, at two Payments; the first, as soon as the Princess should arrive in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and the other, three Months after. And that the King and Duke in that Case should seem highly concerned, and disposed to declare War against <hi>France</hi> on that Account; and with the Money sent, raise Forces, as if it were for the War, and call to the Parliament for Mony to maintain it; which if they granted, to take it, <hi>(there was no doubt of their Consent to that:)</hi> After which, the <hi>French</hi> King was to send a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry submissive Embassage to <hi>England,</hi> offering to make ample Satisfaction for the Injury, and to strike up a Peace with <hi>Holland</hi> at any rate: Upon which, our King was to take upon him to be appeased, and to pretend the <hi>Dutch</hi> were in the fault that he did not make War.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That then, if there should happen any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50018:146"/>
Motions for Exclusion, that His Majesty might make use of the Money, and of the Forces raised as aforesaid, for his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: And that if any Rebellion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, he might be assured, the <hi>French</hi> King would send him both Men and Money enough in case of Need.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That if it were done without the King's Consent, he, the Duke, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend himself wholly ignorant of the Rape, and seem as much concerned as the King for Satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But that if the King should be so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with His Highness, as to side with the adverse Party against him, after he had stood his Ground as long as he could, and made as many Friends as was possible, that then he should privately retire to <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> and raise Arms there, where he should be powerfully assisted, both with Men and Money, from the <hi>French</hi> King; who would likewise use Means to raise Divisions among his Enemies, by several Methods they had concerted; and suddenly discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them all, by an unexpected Peace with <hi>Holland;</hi> tho' there was but little Prospect that Things should come to this Extremity.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Princess, still the better to appease the Heats in <hi>England,</hi> should, upon her Marriage, have, in ample manner, a Protestant Chapel allowed her; and that at the same time, the Protestants in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France</hi> should be used with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50018:146"/>
Kindness and Favour for her sake, till a general Peace, or other fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> time to take off the Mask, were come.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the better to take off the Edge of the <hi>English</hi> Fury to a War with <hi>France,</hi> besides the Peace to be made between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> a third War was to be raised by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> against <hi>England;</hi> and they put with might and main upon new Encroachments and Insolencies against the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. That the better to cover all this, the Duke was not only to make a Semblance, but really to go to the Protestant Church again, and to give out with a full Cry, that he had been most maliciously tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and that he never was reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance in some things lately put upon him, did only arise in that he conceived such things were not to be imposed upon a Prince, as on a Subject.</p>
            <p>I have had the Opportunity, my Lord, to see several other things, of lesser Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, projected here, for the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Affair to the Interest of the <hi>French</hi> Court; with which I shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Lordship, and remain,</p>

               <p>Arguments used by the <hi>French</hi> Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>England,</hi> to the Royal and Church of <hi>England</hi> Party, against the matching of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>

            <p>THe <hi>French</hi> Emissaries finding (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the strong opposition made by them to the matching of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> with his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as I have some time since informed your Lordship,) that there was a very strong Current in the Nation for that Allyance, and having informed their Principals in the <hi>French</hi> Court therewith, they had fresh Instructions sent them, to gain, if possible, the time desired by them, which was till a General Peace were concluded, and to ply the Royalists, and high Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not only close upon that Head, but their Instructions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to these Branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They were to represent the Match as dishonourable, and too much reflecting on the Honour of Crowned Heads, to match a Daughter in so fair a way to be Heiress to three Crowns, to a Prince who was not only no Sovereign, but descended of a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50018:147"/>
Family which had distinguished it self chiefly by heading a Rebellion against his lawful Prince, and who was himself but the chief Officer of a Government so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all Kings, as a Common-Wealth, and that of one founded by Rebellion too; that such an Allyance must needs be more particularly dishonourable to the Royal Family of <hi>England,</hi> which had so lately and deeply suffered by a Rebellion mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against it by their own People, chiefly out of an Emulation to be like those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; That indeed King <hi>Charles</hi> I. did match his Daughter to the present Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Father; but it was because he was involved in Troubles, and had not time or opportunity to dispose of her better, and thought by that Match to please the people, appease the Faction animated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and by such a protestant Match allay the Jealousies conceived of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing popishly inclined, or having Leagued with popish Powers to their prejudice; and lastly, obtain some Assistance from the States of <hi>Holland</hi> in his Distress; and yet that after all his projection hereby, that Match was condemned by most of his Friends, as highly Dishonourable, and of very ill Example and Consequence, and is charged upon him as one of the great Errours of his Reign, and therefore by no means to be reiterated by a new one of the same kind.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50018:148"/>
2. They were to remonstrate, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was bred in Presbyterian Principles, and to exaggerate, with all the terrible Circumstances that could be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the danger the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Episcopacy would be in by the acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of such a Prince to the Crown; <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> being no less passionate Enemies to the Church of <hi>England</hi> than Papists, and being much the more dangerous of the two, as being incomparably the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; the strange success they lately had in effecting so total a Subversion as they did of the Episcopal Church in the last Reign under rebellious Leaders, being too sensible a proof of both what they could, and what they would do again more effectually and more irrecoverably, when headed by a lawful Superior, and strengthned by the assistance of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Holland:</hi> This, my Lord, is the substance of the Instructions sent from hence to their Emissaries in <hi>England,</hi> for the managing of the forementioned part, and with which I shall conclude this Epistle, who am</p>

raise his Authority in <hi>England</hi> to what pitch he pleased, and Adieu to all hopes of a Common-wealth there, when that of <hi>Holland</hi> should be subject to his Scepter, and Adieu to all expectation of making <hi>Presbytery</hi> the predominant Religion there; for that it was almost incompatible with a moderate Monarchy, much less with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power; and that whatever Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Prince had been bred in, as to Religion, though he might like them well enough as a Member of a State, with whose Constitutions they perfectly agreed; it was not to be doubted, that when he came to be a Monarch, and so powerful an one too, as the <hi>United Provinces</hi> thrown into the weight of three Crowns would make him, but he would, like most Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, make his Religion conform to the Model of his Politicks, and when he became a Monarch, and so great an one too, take up Monarchs principles, which could be no other than Popish, or such as exceed them, if possible, in maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> Those of the Tantivy Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> none else agreeing with despotick Rule; so that whatever hopes they might flatter themselves with from such a Match, and the Prince's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Throne; they should find themselves so far disappointed, as not to have any reason left them to expect as much as a Tolleration in Religion, and the Freedom

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50018:150"/>
which their Emissaries had Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to work upon, were the <hi>Lovestein Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to whom nevertheless they were to address themselves very cautiously and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly, and first to insinuate to them, and by them to the State-Party.</p>
            <p>That indeed it was true the Illustrious Princes of the House of <hi>Nassau</hi> had not only been the first Founders, but also the great preservers of their Common-wealth, and that it could not be denied but that the present Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had very much contributed to its late Recovery, after it had been brought to the very brink of Destruction; and that they were fully convinced that same Family must remain a necessary Bulwark to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, so long as their Interests should continue inseperably intwisted with those of the State; but if they should be so blinded as to consent, or but tacitely give way to any Steps that might alter those of the Prince into any other Channel; that same House might, in process of time, prove the fatal Cadency and Dissolution, as it had been the happy Rise and Glory of that flourishing State. That the implacabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Royal Family against those that have once offended them, and their bloody and unjust Proscription of the noble House of <hi>Orange,</hi> had so firmly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Interests of the Princes of that Family with those of the States during the

Wars with <hi>Spain,</hi> that there could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly any Danger arise to them from that House, how much soever they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Authority of the States, they being then best secured by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Power of that. Nay, and that after the Peace made between that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> there could be no Danger from those Princes neither, so long as they matched into inferior Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Families, as those of <hi>Germany, &amp;c.</hi> which might add Strength, but never could Power enough to the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> to crush the State, or in the least divide from its true Interests. But that it might be of the dangerousest Consequence, if any of them were suffered to match into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of any Crowned Head, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of any near Neighbour to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; for that would be an effectual Means to fill their Heads with aspiring Thoughts, and great Designs to Aggrandize themselves, and might afford them Power enough to put them in Execution; a Temptation too strong for almost any active spirited Prince to resist: And therefore such an one as this present Prince ought by no means to be exposed to by any wise States-men, whose Interest it was to keep him from it, and who had Cunning enough to put him by it. That never any of His present High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Predecessors have been ever as much as suspected of aspiring at any Power over
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50018:151"/>
the Commonwealth; but what tended to its greater Security, and for the Elevation of the Majesty of the Republick, without the least Glances of assuming any to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, unless it were His Highness's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who, in all probability, was anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by his matching with a Daughter of <hi>England:</hi> And that his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have proved fatal to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, beyond Retrieve, if his immature Death, and other seasonable Providences, had not intervened. That the Influence of that Match had proved very detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to that illustrious House, by stirring up such a Jealousie in the States against them, as would not suffer them to admit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Prince, for a long time, to enjoy the Places of Honour, Authority and Trust formerly so well maintained and officiated by his noble Ancestors: And that, at the same time, it had proved as pernicious to the States themselves, in creating and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Factions among them, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to keep up the Republick upon a new Model, without <hi>Captain-General, Stadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, Admiral, &amp;c.</hi> and to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the so necessary and Auspicious Assistance and Conduct of that most Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious House; and thereby exposed even almost to be made a Prey to the dangerous Ambition of the <hi>French</hi> Monarch.</p>
            <p>And therefore now, when they had so newly re-enter'd into their true Interests,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50018:152"/>
and happily re-fixed all things on the old Foundation, by restoring the present Prince to the Dignity of his Ancestors, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Helm of the Tempest-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten State, and had by his Courage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Interest recovered the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to a very hopeful Condition of Power and Prosperity again, it would be no less than a Madness to venture the Ruin of all those fair Hopes, by a second Match with <hi>England,</hi> when by the former they had been almost all Shipwrack'd; and to suffer a Prince who was now wholly their own, to espouse, in such a Marriage as was then in Agitation, a Foreign Interest; and such as, in all probability, could not, in time, but interfere with theirs: And therefore desired it might not be.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because, though the Prince's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should happen to continue never so right and firm to the Interest of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, yet this Match could not but be still very detrimental both to him and them, by causing incurable Jealousies, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Animosities amongst them, without end; and which could not but be of pernicious Consequence to them both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That by reason of the little probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s having any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious Male Issue, this would give the Prince such a near Prospect of the <hi>British</hi> Crowns, that it could not but engage him, in that View, upon all Occasions, to strain
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50018:152"/>
his Power and Interest in the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> to the utmost for the advantage of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, to the prejudice of the <hi>Dutch</hi> increase of Power and Interest.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if he ever came to be King of <hi>England,</hi> the Power he would thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, added to that he had already in the <hi>United Provinces</hi> as Stadt-holder, Captain General, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to the great Influence he had among the Soldiery in the States pay, would undoubtedly be a great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to him for to reduce that State un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>English</hi> Crown, and influence the others to assist him in it; And that if he should have Issue by his Princess, as it was likely enough he might, the danger under that Circumstance would be in a manner inevitable.</p>
            <p>Its likely, my Lord, our Politicians here forsaw very great Difficulties would arise in making any manner of Impressions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the States against the Prince's Match, for by the foresaid Remonstrances it does appear to me their Master-battery was turned on that side; but though all their Politicks have failed them for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage, yet they have not failed to put some of these Arguments fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

the Match were broken, was the late solemn Embassy sent over from hence into <hi>England,</hi> whereof the Count <hi>d' Estree</hi> was the head, accompanied with the Duke <hi>de Vendosme,</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> one of our great Minister, the Marquiss <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois</hi>'s Sons, and at least fifty Lords more of principal Note; and whose publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, tho' they imported nothing more then a great Complement, and some overtures about forbiding any recruits, to be sent over to our Land Forces in the service of the Confederates; yet privately they were to endeavour a <hi>French</hi> match, and if they saw they could not succeed therein, to concert closer measures with the Duke, about puting in practise what he had before consented to, about geting the Princess his daughter privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd away, in Company of this Embassador into <hi>France;</hi> and perhaps your Lordship will not be dissatisfied, if I recount what I have heard discoursed one day at this Court, between our Commissioner and some other Courtiers concerning the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy.

they will upon this occasion, for 'tis a greater honour our King now does to the King of <hi>England,</hi> than he has ever yet done to any other Prince, or ever to the Emperor himself when at Peace with him; and such an Honour cannot but work sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly upon the heart of a Prince, who is so easily wrought upon, and may work some good Effects for us in time, if not for the present; And however, if the worst come to the worst, this extraordinary Honour now done him by our Monarch, will make his Parliament and People so fully persuaded that he hath entred into an extraordinary Engagement with him, that all he can say, or do, will never convince them of the contrary, or induce them to trust him with Money to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France,</hi> for fear he should use it against themselves; and not only so, but it would make him as suspected among the Confederates, that none of them, from hence forward, would trust him, either for an Assistant Allie, or Mediator, and so would render him of insignificant force to thwart our Designs. </q>But the King did for once Trick the Trickers, by the care he had taken of the Princess, as I shall note elsewhere to your Lordship, and by his sudden marrying her to his Highness the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> so much to the surprize and disappointment of this Court, that I

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50018:156"/>
to advise him; That though it were at that juncture necessary he should obey the King, yet it was no less prudent that he should, in so doing, take all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Precautions, not to abandon his Fortune to the discretion of his Enemies; that they did not doubt but that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would push hard, to get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self declared Legitimate by the ensuing Parliament; That the business of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> would be renewed, and that there was room enough to fear, least his Retreat might be rather interpreted for the flight of a guilty Person, than for the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a submissive Subject; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was expedient he should get the King first to promise him that he would declare, and get it Recorded too in the Courts of Justice, that he had never been Married to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That he would by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the <hi>Exclusion</hi> that was now likely to be prest upon him; and lastly, that he should give him express Order in writing to require his Retirement.

            <p>THE joy conceived by the Ministers of this Court, at the displacing of my Lord of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> from his great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of President of the King's Council, and consequently from all Administration of Publick Affairs, is as open and unexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as the Instruments and Causes of such a change are secret; but so far as I have had any intelligence of this grand Affair, which I predict to be no good Omen to our poor Country, I am free, and I hold my self in duty bound to communicate to your Lordship; who perhaps will not much wonder at such a change, when I tell you that the Emissaries of this Court, but more especially the women kind, whom I need not Name, have incessantly as they have been taught their Lessons,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50018:158"/>
been buzzing the King in the Ears with such Calumnies and Accusation, as here follow according as they are inserted here.</p>
            <p>They were to lay hold on all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to render the said Noble Lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the King, but yet to be very tender in their first attack, and therefore frequently to say; That truly his President was a person of incomparable Parts and Abilities in matters of State, and that to do him Justice, he had done his Prince as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant service as any of his Subjects; That though he had in former times fallen in with the republican interest, which was then predominant in the Nation; yet he had since shewed so much Zeal for the Monarchy, as might justly obliterate all former miscarriages; provided still he proved constant in his Devoir, and gave no suspition of his being inclinable to re-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the principles, which he seemed once so entirely to have forsaken; and when they had again and again made way by such insinuations as these for more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Attacks; They urged his Majesty might call to mind the time and occasion when, as well as of whom the Earl had once said, that when a man is wanting to himself, he deserves that others should be so to him also; and he might consider how false and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50018:159"/>
dangerous a Maxime that was, when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to a Prince or ones Country, to whom one is never allowed to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; That the Earl had been as good as his word, was already sufficiently manifest, when he had discovered in Parliament the secret motives that had engaged the King to grant Liberty of Conscience before the late War, as well as his Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and insinuated the designs his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty had to retrench the liberty of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was indeed no more then to reduce that Assembly within the bounds of their Duty; that his conduct ever since in promoting the Test, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave no small Umbrage that he meant more then a bare exclusion of his Royal Highness from publick Offices; That they could not be positive that a change of Government was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, and a new essay for the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Metamorphosis of the Monarchy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Republick once more; but that surely, it looked that way; For if the thing were considered aright, the King, 'twas true, was an Established Prince, and now long in possession, and in whose person there could be no plausible pretence to induce the people to abandon that form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and for the Regal power it self, the time was yet too short since a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Tyrants had plunged the State into Troubles, for to propose an entire aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of King's a second time, seeing those very persons who went under the notion of Republicans, did not so much yet aim for the most part at the change of the form of the Monarchical Government, as at the diminution of the Authority; and hence it might be reasonably inferred, that the Earl well foreseeing he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed directly to that which he aimed at, began cunningly to take a round which he judged would conduct him with more safety to the same end: And that seeing no possibility of dispossessing the King, he had formed a design to disinherit the person that ought to succeed him, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the best expedient to destroy the regal Dignity, was to disturb the order of Succession; And that his Majesty must needs foresee the dangers arising from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells of so pernicious a Man, whose autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Court, Parliament and City was equally formidable as his Pollicy.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAD I been able to have given your Lordship some remarkable passages relating to the Duke, and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s History, in the time the great Affair of the Popish Plot was in Vogue and Agitation, I do not doubt but I should have perform'd a grateful part to you; yet I find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so singular and diverting therein, that I cannot but flatter my self, it will still, in some measure, prove agreeable. Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had, for a long time, manag'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Courts, and that your Lordship well knows, for his Letters that were seiz'd and publisht make it evident; and he was one of the chief Instruments to draw his Master, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> into so close a Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with them as he was ingag'd in, of which your Lordship has heard before; and from the Year 1676, to near the time he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50018:161"/>
was Arraign'd and Condemn'd for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot; I am free to acquaint you, my Lord, That all his Letters past through my hands, being first directed to a <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who took care to transmit them to me, with Orders to send them to Father St. <hi>Germain,</hi> who manag'd all Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and Father <hi>La Choise,</hi> but I saw the Contents of few or none of them, till lately I have found them among other things of that kind in the Minutes of our <hi>French</hi> Secretary, and which is the Reason your Lordship has not receiv'd this Account sooner, at which, I am sure, you cannot but stand astonished, as I was my self, when I acquaint you, that I find it entred here, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was, during this famous Correspondence, two several times in <hi>France,</hi> and Closetted to boot, by his Most Christian Majesty (which, by the way, unfolds the Mystery of the Proposals I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, about Trapanning the Princes into <hi>France)</hi> but it was both times by Night, and the Works of Darkness, between One and Two of the Clock in the Morning, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty persons being ready posted to Introduce him: And one time a Councellor of the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> to whom, Some of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Letters were directed, happening ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally to let fall an Expression, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Person, tho' it was Voic'd up and down among the Courtiers it was <hi>Coleman;</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50018:161"/>
he receiv'd a very severe Check for his unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Inadvertence; and, as a farther pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, he had no more any Secrets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him: for, the Letters from thenceforward were distributed by another way. The first time the Duke was Closet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was a little before the second <hi>Dutch</hi> War, to concert Measures, how he should he enabled to induce his Brother to give his Consent to it to promote the <hi>French</hi> Designs thereby; as was likewise our Famous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Sir <hi>Edward Spragg,</hi> for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, not very long after the Duke. The second time was a little before the Splendid and Extraordinary <hi>French</hi> Embassy was sent into <hi>England,</hi> and wherein Measures were Concerted how to induce our King to give his Consent to have the Princess <hi>Mary</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>France;</hi> and, in case that would not do, how to Steal her, and send her away when they went off; but this Intrigue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be privately discover'd to the King, by one of the Duke's great Confidents, he had the Cunning to dissemble the matter, and took no manner of notice of it to the Duke his Brother, but gave secret Orders that a strict Eye and a good Guard should be kept over the Princess, and would not permit the Duke to have her abroad upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Invitations, or other pretence whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, till the Embassadors were quite gone; saying, <hi>It would administer Iealousie to His People, if She should be permitted to stir abroad
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50018:162"/>
much, while the</hi> French <hi>Sparks continued in</hi> England. And to prevent the like Plots upon her for the future, and to please His People, who were now upon the fret, and, as they would have it here out of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against such an Indirect and Rash Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, which, had it taken effect, as he said, would have dashed him and his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an Instant upon an inevitable Rock, he Married Her, as your Lordship well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to the great Regret and Vexation of the <hi>French</hi> Court, and of the <hi>Duke</hi> too, who, from thenceforward hath not cared how almost he exposed the King his Brother, by engaging of Him in continual Troubles for his sake, nor how closely he United with the <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who afterward wreakt their Revenge for some time upon the Duke himself, but chiefly upon the King, by their Intrigues, in bringing the following Popish Plot upon the Stage: Both the times the Duke was on this side, the King knew not of, or at least they design'd He should believe so, but thought he was retir'd for Indisposion, yet both times he brought Remittances for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Sums of Money; yet the <hi>French</hi> were highly displeased at him for his failure in the aforesaid Match, and the subsequent Plot upon his Daughter; so far, as that they Suspended his Pensions, as they likewise did <hi>Coleman</hi>'s, which made them both incline to Revolt to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction, and moved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50018:162"/>
the Duke to some seeming willingness to go over, and Command the <hi>English</hi> Forces in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the War then likely to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from <hi>England</hi> against <hi>France;</hi> for which they were cruelly revenged upon Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> by contriving his Ruin and Death; and against the Duke of <hi>York</hi> too, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Popish Plot, in which they were highly Instrumental, and by imploying the Dutchess of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and some other of their Creatures in our Court, which were bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted to their Interests, to promote the Bill of <hi>Exclusion,</hi> that so that Prince might be brought under a necessity, as they thought, to return to, and absolutely to rely upon them; for when, in those Troublesom Times, the Duke was forced to retire to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was heard to say, <hi>That had he follow'd his Counsel, and been constant to him, he should not have needed to have retir'd to</hi> Bruxells, <hi>or to any other place but</hi> France. But however, I find all was accommodated again afterward, and the Duke got closer in with them than ever, when the Whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, as they call'd it, was quash'd, and things were ripe for another Plot, called. <hi>The Pr.—one.</hi> But however, before that Breach we have spoken of with the Duke and <hi>Coleman,</hi> they were resolv'd first to get some Service out of them; for, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the Allyance with <hi>Holland,</hi> that our King was somewhat inclin'd to comply with His Parliaments and Peoples Instances,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50018:163"/>
well as those made to Him by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ministers in Declaring a War in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with them against <hi>France,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd by His Speech to the Parliament; But more by their Voting a Fleet of Ninety Capital Men of War, and an Army of Nine and twenty thousand Land-soldiers for that purpose: of all which it does appear, <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> sent over hither a speedy Account; They then presently Renewed their Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, and to the Duke for some time, with a Solemn Promise of a considerable Sum by way of Gratuity besides, if they could so far prevail, as to sow such Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the King and Parliament, as might hinder those Preparations by being seconded by an Actual Declaration of War, which they did effectually; for they had, by their Creatures, inspired into the heads of the most Stirring and Active Members of the House, that the Pretence of War against <hi>France,</hi> was only a Court-trick to get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and a Standing Army to Enslave the Nation; and therefore it were not their best way to trust the King with Money for that purpose, unless it were at certain moderate Sums, and with such Limitations as might Secure them from any Arbitrary Deligns, and from Intrigues with the <hi>French;</hi> and at the same time it was Infused, with much Artifice, into the King's Head, That if he once ventured on a War against <hi>France</hi> without an Unconditional Vote for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50018:163"/>
sufficient supplies, and that in very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Sums at once; as for example, of so much yearly as long as the War last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that he was an undone and lost Man, and would, by that false step, be infallibly unhinged; by which Artifices a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War against <hi>France</hi> was so long protracted, till the <hi>Hollanders</hi> despairing of any good from <hi>England,</hi> were necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to clap up a Separate Peace (which the <hi>French,</hi> with all diligence, proposed to them) whilst the King and Parliament in <hi>England</hi> were disputing the Case about Funds for the War. My Lord, I have been necessitated to recapitulate some things here, which I remember I have Written a Larger Account of to your Lordship, and that because I could not well other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have brought in the succeeding part of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s History, who, to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Duke, having effected the foremention'd Divisions, Jealousies and Disputes, claim'd his Promised Reward of Monsieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador at <hi>London,</hi> having yet received but one Payment of it; but the slie <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi> finding his Business was so far done, that he was able to go on with the rest himself without their assistance, put him off at first with Fair Words, but <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> still Renewing his Instances, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillon</hi> began to slight his Applications, and at last told him, in Down-right
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50018:164"/>
Terms, he had no Orders to Pay him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Money; That he had Receiv'd enough for the Business he had done; since there were other Instruments which he had there, who had done more, and been much more Serviceable in it than himself; and, in a word, That his Master, the <hi>French</hi> King, had no further occasion for the Service of such a Sawcy, Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and Inconsiderable Fellow as he was: <hi>Coleman</hi> was Netled to the Quick at this Unexpected Treatment, which he conceived he had not deserved at their hands; and therefore he reply'd again as warmly, saying, <hi>That for his part he had neglected much greater Rewards then what he demanded of him, and which was his Iust Due, which he might have had from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Party; and that now since he found he was so slighted, he should take care to let them see they should find the miss of his Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by what he would, and was resolv'd to do for the other side, and that he question'd not but to bring the Duke his Master to be quickly of his Mind: Barillon</hi> thereupon answer'd, <hi>That his Master would be sure to find them such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in a short time, that they should have no leasure to think of serving the Confederates, or hunting the</hi> French <hi>in</hi> Flanders, <hi>having already such a pack of Hounds in a readiness, as would quickly snap him, and hunt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster too off his Legs, if he did but offer to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50018:164"/>
depart so much from his own Interest as to quit theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this mutual Huff, <hi>Coleman</hi> going to take his Leave of Monsieur <hi>Barillon,</hi> the <hi>Frenchman</hi> retaining still a spice of <hi>French</hi> Civility, came to attend him to the Gate, where, seeing <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Coach standing right before it; <q>Sir, said he, briskly to him, What is the meaning of this, that your Coach stands right before my Door, that is no place for a person of your mean station and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That's strange, <hi>Monsieur,</hi> Answer'd <hi>Coleman,</hi> I should be of meaner quality now, then I used to be; there, you know well enough, it used to stand; But pray where would you have it to stand then, continu'd he? Two or three doors off, cry'd <hi>Barillon:</hi> So indeed, said <hi>Coleman,</hi> I used to place it, when I went to a Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-house, but I did not take yours to be such till now, and so adiew. </q>It was but a few days after this rencounter, my Lord, that <hi>Coleman</hi> was seized for the Popish Plot, at the news of which, the Discourse was at the <hi>French</hi> Secretaries, that <hi>Coleman</hi> would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay dear for having adventured to displease the King their Master; for that they had perswaded the Conceited Fool to keep his Papers all by him, which they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd him, were Rare Compositions, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50018:165"/>
Specimens of incomparable Wit and Parts, in which they said were things, not only enough to hang him out of the way, but so to hamper the King and Duke too, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them in such Troubles, that they would be glad to quit all their thoughts of leaning towards the Confederates, and so return again to their interests at last, as most expedient for them; and that they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed such Tools as would not fail to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all their Inttigues, and be in spight of their Teeth, forc'd to acts of Repentance and sorrow for what they had done: And in fine, when <hi>Coleman</hi> was Condemn'd, and the Duke would have interpos'd for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for him, Monsieur <hi>Barillon</hi> oppos'd it Tooth and Nail, and said, <hi>He ought to be Sacrificed upon that occasion, and that if he were not, the King his Master would find means to have a worse Discovery made, than all that had yet been made to appear out of his Papers or otherwise:</hi> After <hi>Coleman</hi> was Hang'd, his Wife reduc'd to a forlorn state, retir'd into <hi>France,</hi> and presented a Petition to the <hi>French</hi> King to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whereas her late Husband, besides his many other good and timous services done to his most Christian Majesty, had upon his instances by his Minister at</hi> London, <hi>hired an House in</hi> Deans-yard <hi>in</hi> Westminster, <hi>of a considerable Rent, some time before that Session of Parliament wherein the matter of a War against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> France <hi>was to be debated and agitated,

for the better convenience of Treating some Members of Parliament, and some other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had influence over them; That he had expended considerable Sums of Mony that way, as he had done in like manner among other use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful instruments he had in the Country as well as the City for promoting his Majesties Service in</hi> England, <hi>for which he had declined much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rewards from the</hi> Spanish, Imperial, <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>Ministers, and other Agents, than he expected or desired from him, whom he served more by inclination than Interest; and that he had had the good Fortune happily to effect the great task imposed on him by his most Christian Majesties Commands, in dividing the King of</hi> England <hi>and his Parliament, and breaking the neck of the intended War against</hi> France; <hi>that yet for all that, when his work was accomplish'd, Monsieur</hi> Barillon <hi>had refused to pay him his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and never had given him one quarter of the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

saw it time, they had enabl'd the King to stiffe the other Popish one; and thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the current of his Arms ready to fall upon them; it was necessary, having new Designs of Conquests in view (and what can it be, but <hi>Luxemburg</hi> block't up by them last year) to raise a new Disturbance in his Dominions, which could not be better effected now, than by starting a Plot of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Stamp, which would not only inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate the King to interpose, and put a stop to their career, but would also be an effectual means to make the holding of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments impracticable at least for a time, and make him quite fast in a manner to their King's Purse-strings, towards which they had by the other Plot made such considerable Advances.

upon him, that it happened to him as it did to one of the Ancients, as Recorded in Holy Writ, that he should find in the Gall of a Monster, that was about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour him, that, wherewith to cure him of his Blindness. For, that it was in Reading of the History of the Reformation, written by a Protestant Author, that he came to see the Error wherein his Birth had engag'd him; that when he was oblig'd, when in Exile, to leave the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and to retire to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and having leasure enough to Read, he lighted there upon the History of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> written by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> which he Read with much Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and notwithstanding the many strained pretences (say they) which the <hi>Protestants</hi> made use of to colour the Schism of their Country, he clearly saw that their Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so plainly contrary to the Maxim of Unity, which is the Foundation of the Church, was nothing else but a meer ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Humane Passions; that it was the Dissolute Life, and Incontinency of King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> the Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> the Pollicy of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> the Avarice of those that were gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to seize upon the Revenues of the Church, had been the Principal Causes of that Change, wherein the Spirit of God had no concern; that upon reflecting with himself. That God of old made use of <hi>Prophets</hi> of a most Holy Life, to be the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50018:174"/>
Guides of his People, and to Intimate his will unto them, in respect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that upon the change of the Divine Dispensation, the Apostles Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Heavenly Vertue, and more like to Disimbodyed Angels, than Carnal Men, Preached the Gospel; and that upon Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Irregularities, both under the one, and the other <hi>Testament,</hi> They were not carnal persons, Vindictive Souls, Ambitious Spirits, that had Preached Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; but Men full of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Spirit, or of <hi>Christ</hi>'s, the only Channels worthy to receive the Waters which run from his Living Sources; so as that there might be no room left to render them suspected of Corruption or Falsity: he from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward became a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> in his heart; That he had acquainted the King his Brother with it soon after the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who highly Applauded him; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to put that restraint upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to keep it secret: But, that some years after, having, by his Conduct, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occasion to others to observe his Steps more warily, and finding he was not Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion and Interest; they say here, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and two of his Brethren Remonstrated the same to him; that he heard them with much Patience, and did not decline to Confer with them; but that their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Arguments, were so far from

Staggering and Seducing of him, that they Confirmed him the more in the Faith: And they say farther, That tho' it was given out in <hi>England,</hi> That the late Dutchess of <hi>York</hi>'s Complaisance to the Duke her Husband had wrought her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, in the Communion of which she dy'd: yet it was notoriously false; for that she was brought over by a very remarkable event, next to a Miracle, by Reading the same Book that had Converted the Duke: But I shall trouble your Lordship no more with a Matter, which, I am sure, you cannot think of without trouble of Mind, and so I remain,</p>

            <p>IT has been a matter of much discourse and reflection here, that our King should be Crowned by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and not by one of the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> it was expected, that since he had begun so briskly and openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Himself for <hi>Rome,</hi> that he would not have stuck at being Inaugurated by a <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop; I find by the return made hither upon this Subject, that his inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were violent enough for the latter, but that the Reason of his Non-compliance was, that having at his assumption of the Crown, declar'd to the Council, and by them, to his People, That he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law Establish'd; and that the Ceremony
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50018:176"/>
of his Coronation was such as the Laws of the Land did prescribe; The thought it was a little two Early to begin, and that by so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick an Act, which, to be sure, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted not only as the most manifest Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the National Constitution, but the <hi>Preludium</hi> to a despotick Power, which no man knew the end of.

            <p>THE Reason of my long silence to your Lordship, I hope, will not be interpreted by you, as any forgetfulness, much less neglect of your Honours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Expectation; <hi>I</hi> am too sensible of the many Obligations that have been heap'd upon me from time to time, to be guilty of so Notorious a Crime; but the want of somewhat that was Solid and Grateful to your Lordship, has been one genuine. Cause that obstructed my Corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, to which I may add what your self knows very well, the private Orders given in <hi>England</hi> to open all Letters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Domestick or Foreign; and since I had for so long a time continu'd to write to your Lordship, and that undiscover'd, I was not willing for want of a little pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50018:177"/>
caution, and suspension in such a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, either to expose your Lordship to any hazard, or thereby for ever to exclude my self from any farther Correspondence with you, whom I so much Love and Honour; But now, my Lord, understanding that the Storm is over in <hi>England,</hi> by the defeat and death of the Duke, as we have had some days ago an Account from <hi>Scotland</hi> of the like misfortune to have attended the Earl of <hi>Argyle.</hi> I have adventured to Salute you with these Lines, and to tell my thoughts freely upon the matter. I must confess, I never had any great opinion of either of the Expeditions, because concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men who had very different ends in what they did; the Duke and some others for Monarchy, but the greatest part Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans; and therefore I do not wonder the whole hath miscarried, especially when I can assure your Lordship, both the one and the other were (tho' very privately) Abetted by <hi>French</hi> Agents, to undertake such an Expedition: such a procedure may well be wondred at, I confess, since there was apparently so little advantage like to arise to the <hi>French</hi> Court therefrom; but besides their loving to fish always in Troubled Waters, they have somewhat in them that is very like the Devil, who loves to do Mischief, tho' with no benefit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But whatever the World may think hereof, those who are fled, that escaped
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50018:178"/>
from either Kingdom, after the Defeat, are as kindly received here, as those who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly fled from the <hi>Popish Conspiracy;</hi> but yet they are daily sifted and examin'd by the Spies that continually haunt them. I would gladly know? might I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, your Lordship's Sentiments of both Descents, and the Miscarriage of them: to be plain with you, I own I have very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehensions of them, now they are over, than I had at first; and the rather, because the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it; tho' most Maliciously interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King, and his Popish Council, whetted on by <hi>Gallican</hi> Agents. When the Prince had the first News of the Duke's Landing in <hi>England,</hi> he acquainted Mr. <hi>Skel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> the King's Ambassador, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> though he were a Person but of indifferent Parts, yet he had a Warlike <hi>Genius,</hi> and had more Experience and Skill in the Art of War, then most of them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd against him; That for his part, if the King his Father-in-Law pleased, he would assist him, not onely upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, with his Troops, but with his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also; and to that end was sending Mr. <hi>Bentinck</hi> over to <hi>England,</hi> to know the King's pleasure. But <hi>Skelton</hi> malevolent enough of himself, and farther influenc'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice against the Prince by <hi>French</hi> Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, took care to inform the King before <hi>Bentinck</hi> came, that such Assistance as was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50018:178"/>
proposed by the Prince, was very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and much to the same purpose; so that upon Mr. <hi>Bentinck</hi>'s Motion, the King answered, That their Common Interest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the Prince should stay in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and gave such further expressions of his Mind upon that occasion, that plainly discover'd, that such a Zeal in the Prince was esteem'd unseasonable, and not free from Suspition. With which, and a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment of all your Lordship's Favours to me, and my Family, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, I shall now conclude, and for ever remain,</p>

            <p>THAT the King intends to Assume a Power into His Hands of Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against <hi>Recusants,</hi> I believe your Lordship may be sensible of by this time, since it's manifest, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

the Parliaments Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance to the contrary, he retains the Popish Officers still in his Service; and that it is so far from being a Secret here, that I can oblige your Lordship with some of those Methods and Arguments suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, by the Agency of this Court, to carry it onward, wherein it's more then whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd here, he has fully acquiesced. It was thought advisable, considering the violent Humour of the Nation against the admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such Persons, either into Military or Civil Offices, and that all the Cry was, That the King had not kept his Word, but did thereby Infringe their Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, to bring the matter into <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall,</hi> to have the Dispensing Power there Argued upon a particular Case; but, to make sure of the Judges before-hand, to Favour such a Procedure; the King was told, could he gain such a Point, his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness were done for ever; tho', at the same time, it was his undoubted Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to dispense with Laws, being an Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial right, and an usage in <hi>England</hi> as anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as the Kingdom; that it was in being at all times, and in all Reigns, that there were several Acts, wherein there had been Provision made for such a Reservation to the King; that the Term of <hi>Nonobstante,</hi> which was so common, was always a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing with some Law; that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Punishments are no less a proof
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50018:179"/>
thereof; And how much more were Remissions, Pardons, the Restoration of Criminals to their Goods again, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> That there were Presidents to be met with, wherein the King's of <hi>England</hi> had suspended the Effects of Laws, not only by Dispensations, regarding particular and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle persons, but by a general Suspension, in regard to the whole Kingdom: That his Brother had done so in cases of the Statute relating to Carriages, whereof there was not the least complaint in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: neither was it so much as once said, that he had thereby exceeded the Just bounds of His Authority: That the same had been done by <hi>Henry the Seventh,</hi> his Great Ancestor, and <hi>Solomon</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> in respect to the Act that prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Continuation of Sheriffs in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice above One Year, which, in Council, was declared null, and impracticable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that thereby the King was divested of of his Regal Power in disposing his Subjects.

            <p>THE Ruin of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in this Kingdom is as much precipitated, as that of a <hi>Protestant Church</hi> is designed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else, and which I believe your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by this time, is pretty well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of; and to this end the Popish Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy have accosted the King with a severe Remonstrance against them, the sum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for want of more entertaining News, I shall write to your Lordship at this time: They began with the hardiest Lie they could have invented, saying, That there was nothing included in their Complaint, but what was most necessary, and could be most clearly jnstified and made good. Whereas it is most evident, that every ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it tends to Destroy and Persecute, and is grounded upon the most manifest Falsities in the World: then they begin to charge the <hi>Reformed</hi> with Calumniating, and falsly Accuting the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that they did not believe the Truths of the Faith, as they express it; whereas the <hi>Protestant</hi> Divines here, have so far been complyant, as to testifie from time to time, that the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50018:180"/>
               <hi>Roman Church</hi> retained still those Truths that were Essential to Christianity, In that she makes Profession to Believe in one God in three; the Incarnation of the Son of God; the Redemption of Sinners by the Price of his Blood; and divers other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contained in the Antient Creeds; then they proceeded, saying, That the design of the <hi>Pastoral Advertisement</hi> in 1681, was to oblige the Reformed to acknowledge, that their Separation was not grounded but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Suppositions and Jealousies, and they hugged themselves, that the many Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which had been wrought since that time, have been almost all procured by this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; which they call an Invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that as there could never have been any Just Cause of Separation, all those alleadged by the pretended Reformed, could never have any sollidity; That the Protestant Ministers did their utmost to hinder the People to profit by that same Advertisement, either by deterring of them from Reading of the same, or else by giving false Explications thereof, as they were wont to do of the Holy Scriptures, and Works of the Fathers: Adding farther, That the Exercise of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion had been permitted by the King's Predecessors, provisionally only, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which have no longer subsistance: that tho' the Clergy had very good Reasons to urge it so as to require a Revocation of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50018:181"/>
Edicts which contained this permission, yet that it was not their present design to insist upon that Point: that it was now the only favour they pray'd for, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Calumnies of the <hi>Reformed</hi> against the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which were not, and which could not be allowed by any Edict, being an unhappy Liberty, which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters themselves might be ashamed of: that such a supposition and Calumny were Crimes Condemn'd by all Laws both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine, and that the Reformed durst not maintain, that those excesses ought to be permitted, nor to make their Complaints, if the King should forbid them to commit them.</p>
            <p>Then they went to speak of the Method they had thought on, to make the King acquainted with the truth of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: they drew up in Two Collumnes the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that, which they said, the Reformed imputed to them, to the end it might be easier for the King to compare them; and said most Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignantly, That they had avoided the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of many thing; which exceeded all the bounds of Modesty, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself would not have as much as named amon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50018:181"/>
that they would never have made any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Reformed, had the matters in question referred only to the Persons of the Bishops; and that on the contrary, they would have been content to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their Power, in order to testifie, by their Patience, and voluntary Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Outrages that were done them, that singular Charity which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for them; but that they could not neglect the Honour of the Church, attack'd by the Calumny of the Ministers, nor the Conversion and Salvation of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Children, which they retained in the Error of their false suppositions; wherefore they concluded after all, that the King would be pleased to repress a Malignity that was so contrary to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christianity, as also to the Rules of Natural Justice; and that consequently,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he would renew the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons already made to the Reformed of using Injurious and Opprobrious Terms, in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Articles and Mysteries of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That he should forbid them to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> any other Doctrine then that of its profession of Faith, nor any of those Errors which they had had till then, the rashness to impute unto her.</p>

Goods, the Places where the Ministers should Preach against the Articles of the Edict, to lose the Right they had, to exercise the same function for ever; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Booksellers in case of their Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any kind, to forfeit Five Hundred Livres, and for ever to lose the Freedom of keeping open Shops: And thus, My Lord, you see this Court has shut up the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Mouths in all matters of Controversy, and leave that Liberty only to the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Divines, thereby preparing of them for an assur'd Victory, and hereby, besides, That the Ministers, are reduced to be silent, and not to concern themselves, as to the greatest part of the Articles of the Confession of their Faith, which consists in the Rejection of the Tenets of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as false and contrary to the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Gospel; that they might effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preclude them from the Right they had to complain of this unjust dealing, the King, by way of addition, in the Preface to his Edict, to the Reasons which the Clergy's Petition had suggested to Him, has incerted, That it was enough for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of a Religion, tolerated in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to teach their own Tenets, without being carried into Disputes against the Publick and Prevailing Religion, which also is therein call'd the True One: But one should think this Edict were as needless as many others, seeing there are not now past

            <p>I Have in the close of my last Letter to your Lordship, hinted somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Suppression of Protestant Books in this Kingdom; I have since seen a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which contained almost Five Hundred Authors, whose Works are all Condemn'd. Some men in the World love to put the Cheat upon themselves, so they here, to heighten the Number of such Books, have repeated some of them more than once; but they have been also as careful to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get several others, as the Works of the Learned <hi>Grotius, Vossius,</hi> and many more, whose Writings are opposite to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but your Lordship, I believe, is no stranger to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Practise of that Church on this head, and how the Members of it have, of a long time, endeavour'd to perswade the World, That these Illustrious Persons had re-entred into their Party; That they were willing to retain an Honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Names, tho it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the main, that the greatest part of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50018:184"/>
what they had Writ, was as remote from Truth, as the Authors were from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of their Church; That <hi>Grotius</hi> himself, who hath carried his Complaisance towards the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, much farther than any other, yet he never rang'd himself of her side by an open Profession, and did still retain diverse sentiments that were very contrary to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> also; but that this Default might be Remedied by a Pious Fraud; and to the end, they may one day perswade the simple and ignorant that all the Heresies that have sprung up in these last Ages of the World, are as so many Tenets of the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> they have not only joyn'd the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Books to them, but also those of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the Works of <hi>Spinosa;</hi> And they have not, my Lord, contented themselves to Condemn the Books which have been Written by the Reformed against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they have also hemm'd in Books that refer only to pure Morality, and which Astonishes many here: the Theses also of <hi>Josua de le Place,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excepting those written by him against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and is a Book that does not attack the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in any one of her Tenets, and is only design'd for to prove the Divinity of our Saviour, against the Sophistical Arguments of that Sect; the Translation also of the History of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which <hi>Amelot de la Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50018:185"/>
a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Author has put forth, is comprehended in the Catalogue of Heretical Books; I cannot be positive to affirm to your Lordship who had the chief hand in forming this Catalogue; it's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attributed to the Arch-bishop of this City; but they tell us further, That because he would have appear'd to have acted too much like a Patriarch in obliging the rest of the Bishops to take this Rule of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from him, he has by the intreagues of the Procurator General, brought his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so to bear, that the Parliament here have committed it to his care to make an Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of those Books which ought to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd; the Order was no sooner Published, but the King's Officers, and the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates who were commanded to have the same put in execution, have accordingly made a search for those Books in all Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers Shops, and also in the Elders and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Houses.</p>
            <p>The Arch-bishop, my Lord, has some Years ago made use of a very Efficacious Method for to hinder the Publication of any Book that deserv'd to come into the World; I believe, your Lordship, may have seen the Historical and Chronological Tables of <hi>John Rou,</hi> who was a Person of great Learning, and whose Merit had acquir'd unto him the Favour and Protection of several Persons of the Highest Quality in the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and which Tables he presented to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50018:185"/>
the Duke of <hi>Monthauzier;</hi> there is but a very slight mention in the Book, and that but by the by, of any of the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those also which she Esteems, and looks not upon to be of the highest consideration and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but these slight touches, and the Honour which the Author had done to some Ministers of the Reformed to Name them, among the illustrious Doctors of their Age, raised the Indignation of all the Bigots in the Church against him, and so they got his Copies and Tables, which to his great cost and Expence he had got En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, Seiz'd; and the poor Gentleman could not find an Ear open to the offers he made to Correct and Amend those places which might give Offence; and all the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations and Friends he could make, could never prevail so far as to get Justice done him; there are some Persons now who would Redeem them for their own proper use; but tho it be nine or ten years ago since the forementioned Transaction, they have not yet forgot the Noise it then made, and they will by no means part with them; who knows but the Crafty Jesuits have a mind to reserve them, to procure Honour to themselves by them, when they think the ingenious Person that contrived them may be no more Remember'd; for it must without Vanity be own'd, that they are compos'd with so much Art, Judgment,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50018:186"/>
Order and solid Learning, that there is no man but may glory to be esteem'd the Author of them.</p>
            <p>This Search, my Lord, after the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Books, has been already made in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, and not only some other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who have no manner of dependance upon the Archbishop of this City; but other Parliaments, we hear, have receiv'd the Catalogue, and put the Order of the Parliament here in Execution; There are several of the Protestant Churches, which have very considerable Libraries; but some of them already are Rifled under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by the <hi>Romanists;</hi> and 'tis not to be so much doubted as 'tis to be fear'd, the rest will soon run the same hard Fate; This Search has also reach'd the Houses of several particular Persons; whom they have been so severe upon, that they have not so much as left them their Bibles, because the Catalogue has put the Versions of the Bible made by Hereticks, among the Number of Prohibited Books; but surely these Translations, how faulty soever they may suppose them to be, cannot justly be put among the Number of those Books, wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was accus'd of holding Opinions which are not receiv'd by her, nor consequently be comprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those whom the Edict ordered the Suppression of: As for the Ministers they are us'd very variously, the greatest part have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50018:186"/>
not yet been molested upon the Account of their Books, for perhaps, as they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contriv'd to be rid of them by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them out of the Kingdom; they look upon it as a kind of Suppression of the Condemn'd Books, to suffer them to carry them away along with them; but I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd they have given others of them much molestation in diverse parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; some of whose Books they have Seiz'd, some Confiscated, and caus'd others to be Burnt; nay, they have been so outragious against many of them, as to disposess them of all their Manuscripts and Sermons; I am sorry, I am forc'd to give your Lordship this Relation of the Misery of the distressed Protestants of this Kingdom, because I know it will Trouble you, and inspire you with a Noble, tho grievous Sympathising of their condition; but I am afraid the worst is yet to come; I pray God to divert it to whom I commend you and yours, and am</p>

            <p>THIS Court is so taken up with Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Methods and Projects to bring the Reformed to a Complyance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that I do not find they mind any Forrein Affair at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: I have seen several <hi>Formula's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in very easie Terms, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Re-union, as 'tis call'd by them; but, among others, this that follows, I thought very remarkable, and whereby your Lordship may see the Latitude they assume to themselves, for the promoting their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, tho', no doubt, it is but a Bait to catch some of those harmless Gudgeons; the words were these, <q>I own and confess the Catholick Apostolick and <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as it was in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and I Renounce and Abjure all those Errors which have crept in ever since. </q>The Bishop of <hi>Meux</hi> hath, to

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50018:188"/>
somewhat verify'd by the consequence) that the <hi>Pope</hi> should be comply'd with, and the rather because they were well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with his inflexible temper; and that as they believ'd, it would be dangerous to sow Division between the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> at a time when they were labouring to reduce all <hi>Frenchmen</hi> to the Unity of the Church; it would be more advisable for them, to keep to the usual Profession of Faith: And now, my Lord, the Clergy give out, every where, that they will not qualify any Points, but vaunt, that in reducing the Reformed, they will not put out any one Taper that Adorns the Altars.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50018:189"/>
been without foundation; but indeed, this is a method that the <hi>French</hi> Council has for some time used, when they have been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to put out any Order in prejudice to any of the Privileges granted in the Edict that are exprest so clearly, as that no Cavils raised by them can render them dark and and absurd: And, as they found it too difficult a Task to find Reasons forcible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to elude such formal Concessions, they made a shew of being ignorant of them, and they were willing to put forth such Orders that might only seem to Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late such New and Extraordinary Cases. But yet that they might have some coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretences for what they did herein, they charged the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion</hi> with Two Crimes; <hi>First,</hi> That they abus'd that Power which they had in that quality over those in Pupillage to them, and hindred them to become <hi>Catholicks;</hi> Then that they Imbezell'd the Estates of such Minors, when they became Converts against their Will, which was a great Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to their Preferment when they came of Age: These two things were spoken of, as if there had been nothing in the World more certain and truer, and of which they had had abundant experience; but they are of the number of such instances, that are alike easie to be raised, as impossible by any proofs to maintain; and, any ones Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, my Lord, will give him, especially as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50018:189"/>
to the last Article, that it must be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously false; For can any one believe, that such <hi>Guardians,</hi> who would adventure in a malicious way, to imbezill the Estate of their Pupils, could go unpunish'd, in a Countrey, where their Religion and Power was so much in the Wain; and surely he must be next to a Madman that would thus adventure to play with the Zeal of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of this Kingdom, animated by the Recommendation of the Clergy, who are forward enough to make their Court into them.</p>
            <p>And if, my Lord, the <hi>Protestant Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> are thus Injuriously used, the <hi>Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of the same Perswasion have fared much worse, as being deprived by another Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of their Means of Living upon the most ridiculous pretences in the World; they alleadging, that since those of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion</hi> were already deprived of all Judicial Affairs, and the freedom to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the Functions of Counsellors at Law, it were to be feared the greatest part of their young Men might fall to the Study of <hi>Physick;</hi> That, that would considerably augment the number of <hi>Protestant Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and that those of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> must by that means as much decrease, and that hereafter that would become very prejudicial to the Salvation of sick <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> in that the <hi>Reformed</hi> would take no care to put their <hi>Patients</hi> in mind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

            <p>When this hardship was put upon the <hi>Physitians,</hi> the <hi>Chyrurgeons</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> every where began to look about them, and were terribly afraid their turns would be next: they had just reason for it, my Lord, for not many days were elaps'd since the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the former, but comes out an Order of Council, Prohibiting all <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> and <hi>Apothecaries</hi> who made Profession of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to exercise their Art, neither by themselves, nor by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of other Persons, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, nor consign their Privileges to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, nor by any other way or means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: insinuating, that the exercise of such Trades gave them easie admission into Mens Houses, and by that means hindred the Conversion of other Religionaries.

            <p>THE <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bearn,</hi> had been several Years ago under some sham pretences or other, reduced to the Number of Five, and the Parliament from time to time, have endeavour'd to render them of no use by the Imprisonment and Silencing of their Ministers; but now there has been such a prank plaid for Converting some of the Inhabitants to the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> as I think hardly has ever been Practised by any other People in the known World: For the Intendant of the Province having
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50018:192"/>
made use of a Notorious Fellow to carry on the Work, he deludes some of the People to go with him to a Tavern, and there by his Artifice found the way to make them Drunk. Next Day when they were come to themselves, he goes and tells them, That they had promised him they would go to Mass, and that if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deny it, they would be sure to be Treated as Apostates; That they had besides spoken ill of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Ministers, of Religion; and that the only way for them to escape a severe Punishment, which they had made themselves lyable to, was to Conform to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> There was about Fifty of them that were catched with this simple Wile; whereof the Intendant Vaunted so much, that he has Writ to Court, that there is so General an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the whole Province to become <hi>Catholicks,</hi> That the King has no more than to Testify his desire they should do so, for him to see the whole Country Embrace the <hi>Roman Communion;</hi> And so having obtained such farther Orders as he desired, he has caused an Assembly of New Converts to meet together at <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac,</hi> and hath Ordered the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the Neighbouring Places to cause the <hi>Reformed</hi> of their respective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes to come thither, under pretence of hearing a Sermon, which the Bishop of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50018:193"/>
               <hi>Lescar</hi> was to Preach there: Now the Bishop, my Lord, as is well known, is fitter for a Play-house than a Pulpit, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of his Preaching was look'd upon by all a thing so rare, as to excite the curiosity of the most stupid in the World to go and hear him; wherefore abundance of Persons from all parts presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at the place appointed; But when they came there, they could hear no other Sermon than the Declaration of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, to acquaint them, That it was the King's Pleasure they should all turn <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> Those who refused to comply to this unexpected Command, were Cudgelled into the Church, had the Doors made fast upon them, and with the same Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, were forc'd to keep silence, fall down upon their Knees, and to receive from the good Bishop an Absolution of their Heresy; and thereupon were told, That if they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the future to go and hear their own Minister, they should be infallibly Punished for Apostates: such and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand the like Violences they Practised of late in that Province; as I have a faithful Account thereof, too tedious to trouble your Lordship withal; but because your Lordship may perhaps have heard a mighty Noise of a Design to Besiege <hi>Fontarabie</hi> by the <hi>French:</hi> I shall in a very few words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold that Mistery to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50018:193"/>
The Intendant, my Lord, having found that those, and the like sham-Tricks above mentioned, did not answer his his End, but that the generality of the People still stuck Tight to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; found there was a necessity to bring in Armed Men to constrain them to a Complyance. It was given out here, That this Court was highly dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied at that of <hi>Spain;</hi> that they durst appear sensible of the Outrages done them on <hi>Flanders</hi> side; and so for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, talked loud of nothing else than Besieging <hi>Fontaraby;</hi> saying at the same time, That <hi>France</hi> would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was Just, and therefore they were not willing to begin a War on that side where the Barrier might be broken (which was made by the late Peace) between their Conquests, and the United Provinces; and in carrying their Arms towards the other side, could give them no manner of Umbrage. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this seeming Design, the-Troops Defiled towards <hi>Bearn,</hi> but in stead of Advancing to Invest <hi>Fontara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,</hi> they have halted there ever since, and committed all the Insolences that the most barbarous of Nations could e're be guilty of. But since I have entred upon the Relation of the Misery of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50018:194"/>
Province, I shall endeavour a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further to trespass upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Patience, and shew what pretences the Clergy have raised to Justify the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Prosecution of the <hi>Bernois,</hi> before others in the Kingdom; They have had the Artifice to Abolish the Remembrance of the Conspiracy which their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had formed in this Principality against their Lawful Sovereigns, and have had the Audaciousness to perswade the King, that the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> was never Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in that Province, but by the Authority of Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> who would have her own Religion to be Uppermost; And that as she had then Banished the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> out of her Dominions by Arms, in favour of that Doctrine whereon she her self Doted; the King who was the Eldest Son of the Church, might very justly do the same thing for the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating of that Change in Religion there, which had been introduc'd by Violence; and thus you see, my Lord, the Popish Clergy here leave nothing unessay'd for the Advancement of their Designs, (I am afraid they are of the same Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney every where else) and they have got the knack (when there is occasion) of making that a Crime in their Enemies, which is but the just Punishment of their

own; for by disguising the Truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, as they have done herein, they have made that to pass in Queen <hi>Jane</hi> for an Usurpation over the Liberties of her Subjects, and the freedom of their Consciences, which was but a Lawful Revenge she had taken on the Perfidious Clergy of her Dominion, who had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against her, and the Princes her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren such a Conspiracy as can hardly be paralell'd, before the introduction of the <hi>Ignatian</hi> Order in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This was the ground pretended for beginning to put <hi>Bearn</hi> under Military Execution; as if from what was formerly done for the just Punishment of a Rebellious People, there were a just consequence to be drawn for an unjust Oppression of the most Submissive and Obedient Subjects: But having already Trespassed by an over

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50018:195"/>
People, had to bring them over to their Communion. They have not fail'd to Testify as much Joy at it, as if there had been some Battle got, or some City tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the Enemy: But what was very Cruel and Terrible, was, That the poor <hi>Reformed</hi> were forc'd to take part in these Rejoycings, of which their own Ruin was the Subject. It would be too tedious to recount to your Lordship, the many Cruelties exercised in this Country, and particularly at <hi>Pau,</hi> as a <hi>Preludium</hi> to this Force; But after the Reduction of the foresaid place, they made a general Procession, whereunto they dragged the New Converts, and withal Celebrated High Mass, whereat the Parliament as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in a Body: And then when that was over, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung, the Guns Fired, and the Citizens who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to stand to their Arms, made several Discharges and Vollies of Shot; Then followed Illuminations and Bonfires, and Fireworks were prepared at the Charge of the Publick for the same occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But how much soever this was a mock-shew, yet great care has been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to transmit such Relations to the Court, of all the particulars relating to their Proceedings and Success, as are drest with all the Art Imaginable, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to perswade them, who are but two
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50018:196"/>
ready to believe it, that all the People every where, have Re-united themselves to the Church, with all the freedom and good will Imaginable; and because they were resolv'd to make sure work of it, they have accompanied the same Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Certificates, which they caused to be signed by the same means, as they have procured their Conversions, as they are pleased to call them; and wherein those who had suffered a thousand out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and Violences, that cannot be nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without detestation and horror, were constrain'd to declare that the King's Soldiers, who of themselves are well known to be as profligate wretches as any in the World, had lived and demeaned themselves among them with all Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and had kept strictly within the bounds of their Orders, which yet, my Lord, is a base Equivocation, for who knows what their Orders were; but what is more pleasant yet then the rest is, that besides the forementioned Narrations and Certificates; they have Transmitted hither also a Speech made to the Intendant by Monsieur <hi>De V—</hi>a Member of the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> who was one of the chief Instruments to induce the Church of that City to come to a compliance, and who taking upon him to speak in the Name of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50018:196"/>
Rest, came to give him assurances of their entire Submission: But I hear, My Lord, he is like to have but little thanks for his pains, for the Council here are no ways pleased that he should attribute the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of that same Church, to the King's Puissance, and thereby make too clear a Discovery of what they have no mind should be known by any means, <hi>viz.</hi> That any of the Soldiery have been imployed in this Expedition, these were his words, which I take to be genuine, <hi>That there was need of the same Force that had Subjugated both Seas, and also made the</hi> Spaniards <hi>humble, to cause the</hi> Reformed <hi>to Re-unite to the Church.</hi> Which Words being not to be Explicated any other way, than by Force of Arms; and concerning which, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> willingly acknowledge, That the Power was much more Formidable than the Justice of them; the Council have Stomacked it, and the more it seems, because the same Lawyer has fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly and impertinently Attributed the best part of that Conquest to the Intendant; Which Procedure did not concur, and fall in right with the Court Maxims, who are wont to attribute to the King alone, all the Glory that Redounds from all Events.

            <p>HAVING not yet any better En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for Your Lordship, then by pursuing the same Subject I have of late dwelt upon, in the Course of my Correspondence; I shall once more adventure upon a short Relation of what has lately come within the Verge of my Intelligence, concerning the Barbarous Usage of the Barons of <hi>Mompeton, de Mauzac, de Vichase,</hi> and <hi>de la Mothe;</hi> and the rather, since, If I am not much mistaken, I have heard your Lordship formerly mention some of their Names, and particularly, <hi>de Mompeton,</hi> as being of your Acquaintance, when you Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in this Kingdom: These Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were Members of the Church of <hi>Montauban,</hi> where lately the Dragoons are come; but it seems, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exercise their Fury upon the poor People, it was Contriy'd, by the Prime
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50018:198"/>
Commanders, how they might entrap the fore-mention'd Honour'd Persons, as being of Great Authority among the rest of the People, and capable to draw others to follow their Example; but yet observ'd to be of as known Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and of whom they were in despair to compass their Ends, unless it were by Surprize; wherefore they had notice given them secretly, that in order to prevent the Pillaging of their Houses, they ought to go and pay their respects to the Marquess <hi>de Boufflers,</hi> who being a Person of Honour himself, would not fail to use them as such; Whereupon the Baron of <hi>Muzac,</hi> having presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self first, at the House where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess had taken up his Lodgings; He was made to wait in the Anti chamber, till such time as the Intendant and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, (who had notice given him of the Design) were come thither; when they came, they went into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses Chamber, by another Door, and Concerted Methods with him, how they might get the Baron to become a <hi>Roman Catholick:</hi> After they had pitch'd upon the Measures they were to go upon, the Baron was order'd to come in; and after long Discourse used to him, for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to become a Voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, the Bishop began to speak, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50018:198"/>
said, <q>There was no need of so much ado with that Gentleman; that there was no more to be done, then to bring him down upon his knees, and he would too rights give him Absolution of his Heresy. </q>Whereupon, a parcel of <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians</hi> there at hand, seiz'd upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, foyl'd him, and brought him down upon his knees: This Insolent and bold Carriage, the fear of the Danger, the Consternation it brought him under, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Fall, so far prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Spirits, that he Swooned away; so as that those Miscreants, who brought him into that dangerous condition, had much ado to recover him, and bring him to himself again. There happen'd, it seems, to be a Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> in the place; who, being a Man of great Honour; and finding that this way of Converting the World, was a very odd and new way, and little agreeable to <hi>Christianity,</hi> he would have taken him away out of their hands; but, so intent were these vile Sparks on their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, that they would by no meanes give way to the Intercession of the Knight, unless he would charge himself with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing responsible for the Baron's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; But whatever the Gentleman did for the keeping of his Word with them, towards bringing of the Baron to a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50018:199"/>
Compliance, I am credibly inform'd, he could not prevail; but that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were those who got their Ends on him; and, that having, by a Terrible Method, <hi>viz.</hi> By forcing him to keep continually awake, without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Rest, they brought him at last to Dote, and be beside himself, when they Extorted his Signing. This bad success did not discourage the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as they were call'd; for the Baron <hi>de Vichase</hi> entring a little after to pay the same Respects to the Marquess, they would have used the same Violence to him; but though they got him down, yet he bravely got up again upon his Legs, and clapt his Back against a Wall, and his Hand to his Sword, and that with such a Resolution to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in case he was Assaulted, that they chose rather to give him over, and push the matter no further: The Baron <hi>de Mompeton</hi> was the last that came; who, though of such advanc'd Age, as being near Seventy four years old, and of such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as being Lord of a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Borough, in the Diocess of <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban;</hi> yet had no more respect, nor pity shew'd him then the rest: for they set upon him in the same manner as they had done the rest: but happening fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Booted and Sparred, his Spurs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50018:199"/>
hindred them from throwing him down, and his firm and stout Expressions stopp'd the Bishop's Mouth, and he escaped, tho' he was taken afterward in his Flight out of the Kingdom, and Condemn'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rigorous Proceedings of this Court, to the Galleys: and though his Age and Quality, besides the Great Sollicitations made at Court, in Favour of him, might render the matter very easie to be obtain'd; yet it was with much difficulty that he was got to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that odious Condemnation, and this was given out as an Extraordinary Mark of the King's Clemency: The Baron <hi>de la Mothe</hi> avoided the Smart, by not appearing at the place for that time; but he was punish'd soon after, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Two Fine Houses Destroy'd: And lately, through a tedious Misery of a Prison, they Extorted a Compliance from him.

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have very lately given your Lordship an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Death of Monsieur <hi>le Tellier,</hi> soon after the revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nants;</hi> I am apt to believe your Lordship has not seen the said Revocation, and therefore, to keep my Hand in ure, and for want of better matter to gratifie your Honour's Expectations, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant a little upon the Particulars of it: After the Prefatory part of it, it's asserted as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Truth, That the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> was not given, but with a Prospect to revoke it; That not only the King himself, since his accession to the Throne, but even his Father and Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Henry</hi> IV. had a Design to bring the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed back to the Communion of the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church;</hi> and that civil and foreign Wars have been the only Cause that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded the execution of that Design; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conclusion of the Truce in 1684, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were not brought to a fit disposition to bring it about, and that till now they had been content to suppress the places of their Worship,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50018:202"/>
and to abolish some of their Privileges; and that in order to make way for the accomplishing of this great Work, the King was the more easily brought to conclude the said Truce: this being prefaced, the rest contains twelve Articles, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting in general, That all Edicts made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Reformed are null; That the Reformed Religion shall be no more exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Kingdom; That all the Ministers shall be hanish'd, yet with Promises, that if they became Converts in a limited time, <hi>viz.</hi> in fifteen days, they and their Widows after them should be provided for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That no Reformed Schools shall be kept in the Kingdom; That all Children, for the future, shall be brought up in the <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Religion; That those might return into the Kingdom in four months who were out of it, else to have their Goods confiscate; That none, for the future, shall dare to go out of the Kingdom, under Penalty of the Galleys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That such Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as have been made against those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed, shall be in force; but, last of all, it g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ants the Reformed liberty to remain where they please, in the Kingdom; to continue their Trade, enjoy their Goods, without any molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or trouble, under pretence of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; upon condition notwithstanding that they shall not exercise the same, nor keep any Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies under pretence of Prayers or any other Worship whatsoever. But how specious soever this Article may seem, it's already apparent, that 'tis but a meer Illusion, and that there is much Cruelty couched under it: It would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to us, that the King had no design to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid domestick Worship, and to enforce Mens Consciences, since this expression, <hi>Till such time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50018:202"/>
as God shall be pleased to enlighten them,</hi> has been added, as one fine spun Thread to the rest of the Net: but the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> have made it already appear, that this was the least of their Thoughts, since they have actually caused the Troops to march towards the Provinces that have not yet been ravaged; tho'at the same time the chief Magistrate of this <hi>City</hi> has assembled the principal Merchants here together, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to them, by word of Mouth, what was contain'd in the Edict, and to assure them, they had nothing to fear upon that account. And this has had a very pernicious effect already, for it has sent many home into their Houses again, who had taken measures to be gone, with their Families, out of the Kingdom; for the most distrustful persons could not perswade themselves, that so solemn a Promise could be made with an intention to break it the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; but Experience has very quickly taught them, that the Imprudence to return was to no other effect, than to receive the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons into their Houses; and now, when 'tis too late, they come to know, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> had no other design, than to lay a Snare for the credulous, by a base equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating Phrase, and such as the Jesuites usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have made use of in forming the Orders and Declarations concerning Religion, which have passed thro' their Hands; and that by adding to those words, <hi>waiting till the Lord shall be pleased to enlighten them,</hi> these same, <hi>as others;</hi> he meant no other, than that the Dragoons, who had enlightned the first Converts, should also be the Dispensers of the same Light to those who continued still stiff and opinionative. But I shall, in my next, give your Lordship further

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50018:203"/>
that Clause formerly mention'd seem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke, had, upon the perusing of it, recourse to the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle of this Country, for the solution of so great a Difficulty; upon which the Marquess <hi>de Louvois,</hi> the <hi>Gallican Apollo,</hi> soon disabused him, and returned to his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion this decisive Article: <hi>I doubt not, but the quartering of a few Troopers more than ordinary upon those few of the Gentry and Commoners, that still remain of the Reformed Religion, will quickly undeceive them, and convince them of the Mistake they have been in concerning the Edict, which Monsieur</hi> de Chateauneuf <hi>hath drawn up; and His Majesty's Pleasure is, That you would make an explication of the same very severely against all those, who will be the last to make a profession of a Religion that does not please him, and the exercise whereof he hath thought fit to prohibit through all his Dominions.</hi> But, my Lord, this is not the only Letter nor Order to this purpose; for I have had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to see some others to the Officers of the Army and Intendants; importing, That for the further convincing of the incredulous, it was declar'd, those Violences were order'd by the Council; and, in short, the Marquess <hi>de Loavois</hi> was the principal Author of these cruel Expedients: But, above all the rest, I have privately seen an Order signed by him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is express'd, That the Copy thereof should be sent to the Marquess <hi>de Verac,</hi> and which ended with these remarkable words: <hi>It is His Majesty's Will and Pleasure, that you make use of the utmost Rigour and Severity against all those who are not willing to become of his Religion; And those who will have the Vain-glory to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the last of the number, must be used and

            <p>YOUR Lordship may have been desirous to know all this while, that since the <hi>French</hi> have been so cruel to their own Fellow-subjects and Natives, how Strangers fare amongst them; and therefore I shall give your Honour my Thoughts upon this matter, as far as any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars have come to my Knowledge. It's not long since that we have seen an Order here, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leave to all <hi>Protestant</hi> Strangers to have free egress and regress into the Kingdom, with their Wives, Children, Servants, and others of their Nation, at Will, and with the same Freedom and Liberty which they enjoy'd in times past; but they are strictly charg'd to carry none of the King's Subjects out with them, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Leave under the Secretary of State's Hands, nor to exercise their own Religion, <hi>whatever Religion they be of;</hi> which last words were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>dden in craftily by the Jesuites, after that of <hi>Protestants,</hi> to the end they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the Divisions amongst them, from which the <hi>Missionaries</hi> drew their greatest Arguments to entrap the simple and ignorant, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would tacitely insinuate, That all the Sects which at this day dishonour the Christian
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50018:206"/>
Religion, and which agree in any one thing with <hi>Protestanism,</hi> are so many <hi>Protestant</hi> Sects: Tho' it's well known to the World, that all <hi>True Protestants</hi> both shun and abhor their Communion. Such an Order was certainly, at this time, highly necessary; for, tho' no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have been issued out for to hinder those who would not become <hi>Romanists</hi> to enter the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet the Court was afraid their rigorous Proceedings against their own Natives would deter others, as thinking they could expect no better Treatment, nor more Safety in their Persons and Estates in <hi>France</hi> than natural <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> but how little Benefit many Alien <hi>Protestants</hi> have received hereby, is notoriously known in every part of this Kingdom; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Consul at <hi>Nants</hi> has sadly experienc'd the same; tho' one should have thought his Quality was able to secure him against any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences to be offer'd him in that kind. It has been usual, my Lord, for Foreigners, who have resided in this Kingdom, relying upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, and flourishing by Commerce, to love to take care to preserve the Fruit of their Toil and Pains in a Country where the Right of Inheritance took place upon their taking Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Naturalization; wherefore many such are to be found here this day, who never dreamt that they should be molested in their Religion, and thereby run the hazard of losing their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states also, as thinking it to be a matter very conformable to the Rules of Justice and the Law of Nature and of Nations, that they should be reduc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to their primitive states, as others, when the Kingdom thought fit to revoke the Edicts, under the protection and duration whereof they had made these Advances; and alledging, That
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50018:207"/>
they did not become <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that they might enjoy the Freedom of their Consciences; seeing without that they would never have taken those Engagements: or if the Government thought not fit to observe them, the least it could do, was to remit them to their former Liberty, and to give them their Choice, either to enjoy the Priviledge of their Letters, whereby they were naturaliz'd, by turning <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> or to lose that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to be look'd upon for the future as no other than Strangers, if they persevered in their own Religion. But these Pleas, tho' full of Reason and Equity, hath little availed any of them, for they have been generally treated with the same Rigor and Severity as the rest have been: And to this end there are and have been forty s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ivelling Pretences rais'd, to involve them in the same Misery; if any of them have <hi>French</hi> Wives; if they have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by them of such an age, born in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; or if they have a Father or Mother-in-law living with them; this is enough to quarter the Dragoons upon them. In short, my Lord, I cannot see how it can be safe for any <hi>Protestant</hi> to come and reside in this Country, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what is contained in the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Order; for tho' this Court might be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in the observance of it according to the Letter, yet seeing it doth positively forbid, that such Strangers should exercise their <hi>Religion</hi> here, it brings but a small Remedy to the Evil they have apprehended might arise by the Fear which might possess the Minds of Foreigners from residing and trafficking amongst them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such <hi>Protestant</hi> Alliens will be content (which cannot be generally thought of them) to live

            <p>IT's scarce credible how ignorant the <hi>Popish</hi> Convents in this Country are of all good Literature, especially the Women-kind, who have entertained such monstrous Notions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Principles of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that without I had had it from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Testimonies, I should not abuse your Lordship, and hazard my Reputation with you so far, as to mention it to you. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have formerly given your Honour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it has been a frequent Practise here to put young Maidens of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith into Religious Houses, to be tutor'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50018:208"/>
there, in the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and where they have found the grossest Ignorance both of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practises, as ever would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Thoughts of rational Animals: They have looked upon and entertained them as if they were such as had no Belief in <hi>JesusChrist;</hi> and not only so, but as such as did not pray to God, but invoked <hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Luther</hi> only; by others they were looked upon as <hi>Jews</hi> that had not been circumcis'd, or did not eat any Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flesh. With a thousand such <hi>Chimera's</hi> and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities have the crafty Priests fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I would not, my Lord, have continued a Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so little to your Honour's Information, had I not lain under your Commands for my so doing, and that you have always express'd your Satisfaction with my Endeavours to serve you, who am,</p>

            <p>I Do not question but your Lordship had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Mareschal <hi>Schomberg,</hi> when some Years ago in <hi>England;</hi> you may, perhaps, see him there again in a short time, for he hath with very great difficulty, notwithstanding his many and signal Services for this Crown, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Leave to depart the Kingdom, but under very hard Restrictions, the number of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks being limited, and the Vessel wherein he embark'd view'd very narrowly: The Court before his departure appointed him <hi>Portugal</hi> for his Retreat, that so that same Country, where he has been known for so many Victories, might become unto him rather a place of Exile, than Retreat. The Marquess <hi>de Ruvigni</hi> had always some measure of the King's Favour, but that, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Interest he has had with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, were little enough to procure him Leave to retire with his Family into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> but whether arrived there, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can tell much better than I. As for the Marquess <hi>de Quesne,</hi> tho' fourscore Year old, and a person that hath deserved so much for his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50018:209"/>
long and glorious Services, and under whose Conduct the Naval Power of this Kingdom, heretofore so inconsiderable, was become formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to all the World; yet he hath not been able to obtain Leave to go finish his Days in a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Country: But the Court have complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him seemingly with a great Favour, <hi>viz.</hi> to continue in this City, with Assurance he shall not be molested upon the score of his Religion; but no doubt but this Favour hath proceeded more from Court-policy than any Good-will; for they are, it's very likely, afraid, that had they granted him Leave to depart the Kingdom, he might go and inform Strangers of the state of their marine affairs, the Weakness and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whereof he knows, as well as he can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Strength and Power of the same; and as for the Liberty of his Conscience granted him, they found that also expedient, to hinder him to practise his escape by one Artifice or other, if he were menaced with any Constraint. I did not think once matters would have been brought to this pass here; but when they are at the worst, there will be Hopes they will mend, as I hope I shall in my Intelligence to your Lordship, who am,</p>

            <p>TO think that your Lordship hath not seen and read Monsieur <hi>Claud</hi>'s <hi>Protestation in the Name of the Resormed,</hi> were to judge very disrespectfully and <hi>diminitively</hi> of your Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore for me to descant upon it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be nauseous; but give me leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to your Lordship the different Procedure of the two Courts at this time, tho' its not doubted here, and I hope in a short time to give you a further account of it; but that they are entred into very close Measures and Designs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which will appear in due Place: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be heard on this Side but the loud and dreadful Cry, of <hi>Constrain them all to come in,</hi> while our Emissaries, in conjunction with their Popish Leyitical Brethren on your Side, are a preaching up a general Indulgence to tender Consciences, and a Sovereign Duty, to grant equal Toleration to all Opinions; and one would almost believe both are sincere. But, my Lord, the Burning of the foresaid Book, which is an Abridgment of the History of the Persecution, by our King's Order, under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50018:210"/>
of its containing a Doctrine contrary to the Authority of Kings, is an ill Proof of the latter; and an half-sighted Man cannot but see, that maugre all the Inclination that seems to be in the Court, towards granting Indulgence to others, their Designs must have quite another Tendency; but I find this Court has got the Ascendency, for they have cunningly enough judged it more profitable to dissemble the Injury they conceive they have received by the foresaid Book, than to take a Publick Revenge, for fear lest all the World <hi>should come</hi> to read a Piece that was so dangerous to them and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to their Interest; and when they well knew they had formed a Tool to do that to their Hands, with less Envy to themselves and more to::::: When ever they required it; I heartily beg your Lordships Pardon for my Freedom with you, who am,</p>

               <p>Of the League made between King <hi>James</hi> II. and the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have once hinted to your Lordship, That both Courts were entred into very close Measures and Designs for to establish themselves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50018:210"/>
to the Prejudice of their Neighbours; as I should have been, and am very sorry to have disappointed your Expectations, after such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations given you, I do now as much rejoyce that I have, tho' I may say, surreptitiously, got the Heads of the League lately made between them; for it is here with our Minutes as with other things, when they are fresh they are more choice and fond of them. And it was agreed in general, That our King should joyn with the <hi>French</hi> King in a War against <hi>Holland,</hi> both by Sea and Land, but in order to carry the same effectually on, it was more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That they shall both endeavour to draw the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to connive at such a War, and to consent to the Abolition of the Penal Laws and Test against the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> with specious Promises of making him Prince of <hi>Holland,</hi> secure his Succession in <hi>England,</hi> and of many other great Proffers and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but in case he proves stiff, to endeavour to make a total Conquest of that Country, and share it between themselves, as was projected in the last <hi>Dutch</hi> War: And whereof, to the best of my Remembrance, I have give your Lordship a particular Relation; and then to find out some effectual Expedients to put the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> by too of his Succession in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That upon supposal that the Prince shall refuse to comply with them in their projected Designs; that then the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shall be recalled out of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service, and be sent immediately into that of <hi>France,</hi> to be employed for a Time in remoter Campaigns,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50018:211"/>
towards <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> and for want of such Service, in Garrisons, for fear they shall turn Tail and revolt, and so the Prince and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> shall be before-hand weakened, and the <hi>French</hi> considerably strengthened.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That some thousands of the <hi>French</hi> choice Men, as of the King's Gentlemen Musqueteers, and others, shall insensibly be brought into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if the King finds his Occasions so require it, to be mixt with the <hi>English</hi> Troops, under Pretence of learning the other a more perfect Discipline.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That they shall both joyn their Forces at Sea, with all Strength possible.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That a good Body of <hi>French, English, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Troops shall be put on Board both the Fleets, that so a Mixture may be made in both, to the end it may create less Jealousie; and that the rest of the <hi>English</hi> and other <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Troops, that can be conveniently spared from <hi>England,</hi> shall be employed in the Land-Armies, against the Republick of <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. That after the War be once declared, such <hi>French</hi> Refugees as will shew themselves willing to serve under the <hi>English</hi> Banner against <hi>Holland,</hi> shall enjoy the Revenues which they had in <hi>France,</hi> tho' they shall not be suffered to dwell there.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That neither side shall desist from the War, till a total Conquest be made of the said Country, which they think themselves sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of: And that when <hi>Holland</hi> shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by their united Force, there will then be no more Fear of any Opposition in <hi>England</hi> to prevent the King from raising Arbitrary Power and the Roman Catholick Religion there to the same heighth as it is in <hi>France,</hi> nor from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50018:211"/>
concurring with the <hi>French</hi> King, till he shall obtain the Empire for himself.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That the <hi>French</hi> King shall pay all the <hi>Brittish</hi> Forces in <hi>Flanders</hi> and elswhere, and be content to defray half the Charges of the War, that our King with his Pecuniary Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be enabled to hold on the War with Vigour and Constancy enough for to make a Conquest; but that afterwards, for a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he shall be obliged to assist <hi>France</hi> in any future War with thirty Capital Ships, and twenty thousand Men, at half Charges born.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship knows, much better to make a a Judgment of such a League than I can pretend to, but I perceive the effect will be dreadful, not only to poor <hi>Holland</hi> but to <hi>England</hi> too, without the neighbouring Potentates be time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously awakened to ward the Blow; and that such worthy Patriots as your self rowse up and stand in the Gap: But I pretend not to dictate to your Lordship what every generous <hi>English</hi> Man's Duty is to God and his Country upon such an occasion, and so conclude with subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self,</p>

               <p>Of Methods to be practised by King <hi>James</hi> for keeping up the Dispensing Power, and and particularly about discarding the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of the Kingdom.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have upon another occasion hinted somewhat to your Lordship of those Arguments urged to the King for the promoting of the Dispensing Power; and you know very well, since it has been put in practise in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> in the Case of Sir <hi>F. H.</hi> and how that matter ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to the King's Satisfaction, and further heightening of his Perogative Royal, and how the same was established by the Concurrence of the Judges of the Land, if they may be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who authorized the same: These Points being gained, another Matter and that of an higher Consequence was agitated in the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Council, <hi>viz.</hi> to use some means totally <hi>to discard</hi> the Militia of <hi>England,</hi> and in liew of them to retain standing Troops in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to throw a little Dust in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Eyes, and amuse them so as that they might take little notice, or at least not oppose those their Proceedings, it was advised to act these previous things.</p>
            <p>In order to Ballance the great Power of the City of <hi>London,</hi> it was projected to grant a Charter to that of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50018:212"/>
the Pretence of its being the Royal Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Court of Parliament, and therefore ought to be dignified with as ample Previledges as any City in the King's Dominions, <hi>London</hi> it self not excepted; and to have a Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Sheriffs, and all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers necessary both for the Support and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of it; that great Encouragement should be given to rich Merchants, wealthy Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to dwell there, and to transport a great part of their Trade thither, which would cause them to stick close to the Court, and Interests thereof.</p>
            <p>And had this same Project gone on, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so projected to have a new Stone-Bridge, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating that of <hi>London,</hi> but built much broader, and more convenient, erected between the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-yard</hi> and the <hi>Horse-Ferry,</hi> and the King seems very eager and forward to promote so useful a Work.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Mews</hi> was to be ditched round, and great care taken, as well as Expedition used to have it filled with Stabling and other Buildings, fit to receive and lodge a good Body of Horse, and to be made a Cittadel, under Pretence that such Troops should not be Troublesom and a Burthen to the said City.</p>
            <p>And when all this was accomplish'd, which was concerted to have been brought about in a short Time, then the Militia of the Kingdom was to be new modelled, two or three Times over, and the new Lords Lieutenants of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and other Officers chopp'd and chang'd to the Court's Mind, who should shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves willing to obey the Orders they were to follow, which were to this effect. That the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50018:213"/>
Militia should be ordered to meet in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral respective districts, and there the Lord Lieutenants for the Time being were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, <hi>That since to serve in the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia was but a trouble to them, as well as a Charge and Burthen to the Country, yet without any Use or Security to the Crown or Kingdom, when all our Neighbour Nations were armed with Veteran Troops, the King was advised and now</hi> thought fit <hi>to discharge them of the Trouble, and the Country of the Charge of maintaining of them for the future;</hi> and so order them to deliver up their Arms, to be distributed among regular Troops, that would be more useful and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But before this was to be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was, my Lord, resolved, a Toleration of Religion should be first granted, and severe Orders given to the Soldiers for to pay their Quarters duly, demean themselves quietly and orderly, and to abstain from any manner of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; and all manner of Persons, as well Protestants, Dissenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, should be admitted into the Army, either as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or Soldiers, and if any of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should grumble thereat, and begin to sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach it, it should be alledged, <hi>There was no Reason in the World the King should be deprived of the Services of any of his Subjects however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, as to their respective Religions, for the Carping of a few Churchmen, who were more concerned for their own worldly Interests, and so would have all Places of Profit confined to those of their own Stamp, than they were for the real Interest of the Church.</hi> Then there were to be sufficient Bodies of Soldiers to be placed all over <hi>England,</hi> to assist the Lords Lieutenants
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50018:213"/>
to see all the forementioned <hi>Orders</hi> put quietly in Execution, and ready to suppress any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult that might be occasioned thereby.

            <p>'TIs but a few Days since I sent to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the particular Resolutions formed in the Cabinet Council, of discarding the Militia, and other Methods that were to be pursued, as either previous to or subsequent of such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; and now, I can assure your Lordship,

That same Project was chiefly broken by the Marquess of <hi>H.</hi> D—of <hi>N.</hi> and some other Noble Persons and worthy Patriots; but the Marquess of <hi>Powis</hi> had a greater Hand in it than any of them, as being of greater Credit with the King, who represented how dangerous and in a Word how impracticable such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was; <hi>For,</hi> said he, <hi>it will be impossible to find such Lord Lieutenants in the Kingdom as will undertake to put the same in Execution, nor no Officers that will obey, If they could find such; that such a Practice would necessitate the King to call in a</hi> French <hi>Army, which would as much inslave his Majesty to the</hi> French <hi>as his own People would be thereby inthralled to him, and that he might assure himself the</hi> French <hi>Faction had no other Intent in advising him to it.</hi> So that I find, my Lord, it was resolved to let the Militia alone as it is, and go on to secure their Proceedings, by stuffing the Army with a Mixture of Nations as well as Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and to chop and change them so often, till at last they shall get <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks enough in their Troops so as considerably <hi>to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number</hi> the Protestants there, without calling in any Bodies of <hi>French.</hi> Which Resolution, as I find it did not fully content this Court, so it hath madded them to use Stratagems to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise it, by putting the King upon unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and impolitick Artifices, and among others, to model and pack Parliaments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall be able in my next, I think, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your Lordship the Projects laid before him, humbly hoping you'll take all in good part from one that has an <hi>English</hi> Heart, and will love both his Country and your Lordship, whilst I am.</p>

            <p>I Find abundance of Projects offered to the King by the Agency of this Court concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modelling and bridling of <hi>English</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; some were for putting in Execution the Advises given formerly for that purpose to King <hi>I.</hi> I. specified I think in <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Collections, to which I refer your Lordship, but that <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> was rejected, and others of more modern date urged upon him, and particularly there were some who would have him procure a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s Methods, chiefly to be composed of the Officers of the Army, with an Intermixture of some few others; and that being effected, he might by them increase very much the Revenue of his Crown, by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up again the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> and the Right of Purveyance, and by obliging all such Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were by their Tenures anciently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to furnish so many Horse and Men, and other Necessaries, in the Wars either against <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> to supply a full Equivalent towards Ships, Men, Artillery, Provisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a War with the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other Enemy whatsoever; which they would have called for the greater Amusement of the

People, a restoring to the Crown the Jewels which had been usurped from it; which that it might be further secured, it was likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, That a <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> with the same Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction as in the King's Father's Time, should be set up again; as also an High Commission, which last tho' a sort of Tribunal introduced into <hi>England,</hi> since it had proved schismatical, and that the Kings thereof had been declared <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> yet it might very well serve a present Turn, and give the less Jealousie of his designing to introduce the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion among them thereby; but that if he did not look upon that Expedient season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that the rather because it had been abolished in Parliament as a Grievance to the Subject; he had no reason to oppose the setting up of an Ecclesiastical Commission, since the Parliament themselves had erected the same, tho' with a more limited Power than the other in lieu of it; and since they had judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the repressing of the Insolencies of the Churchmen, regulating their Manners, and obliging them to discharge their respective Duties in their several Stations, He being a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick King had more reason than any other to make use of it; the last your Lordship has seen, they have gained, and tho' the King hath a great Stomach to that other, yet my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Party hath yet prevailed and affrightned him from venturing upon such things without he had been able, as he found he was not, to have succeeded in pulling down the Militia of Kingdom, or at least in getting such an Army which he could fully rely upon, and that he hath not yet got neither; but till then he could not pretend to declare the Grand Charter void,

            <p>I Cannot think but it will be acceptable to your Lordship to understand what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Pope's Letters to the <hi>French</hi> King are, especially in such a conjuncture as this is, and when I believe you cannot be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with a genuine account by any other hand; after the prefatory part which is short and concise and somewhat different from others of his Predecessors, he comes close to the matter and says, that he could not but reflect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50018:216"/>
with no small Astonishment as well as great Grief and sadness of heart upon the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Conduct of so great a Prince, who would be thought to be and called himself the first Son to the Catholick Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the most Christian King against the holy See of <hi>Rome;</hi> that he should as much as pretend to so much Zeal for Religion, and yet at the same time, to invade the known rights of the Catholick Church; not only in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> but even in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome</hi> herself, by pretending to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Freedom of Quarters, which all other Catholick Princes had freely and generously renounced as a gross abuse.</p>
            <p>That his Persecuting the Protestants in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> ought no ways to priviledge him to put affronts upon the holy See; it was very plain that was not the way to reunite those people to the Church, when he himself was so ill a Pattern, and shewed them so bad an Example, by contemning and outraging that same <hi>Authority,</hi> which he used Force and Violence to make them own; That he was much in the wrong, and acted prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously to Prosecute them for not believing what he himself so Scandalously opposed; And that for himself at the bottom, he was not of a Persecuting Spirit and Principle; but that he was fully convinced, it was never Christ our Saviour, nor any of his Apostles way, who themselves never were nor ever used any Preachers with long Tails, Boots and Spurs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That such a practice had done most disgrace to and created, as well it might, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable prejudice against the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion</hi> than any thing else whatsoever,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50018:216"/>
and so by Consequence had much more obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted than advanced the propagation of it: That it ought never to be used in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom already infected with heresie, tho' it's true, it were a very good fence against its creeping in where it had yet got no footing; That it would be a means to blast all the blooming hopes of the <hi>Catholick Cause</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and ingender pernicious Jealousies and a most cruel Opposition in the <hi>English,</hi> a stiff necked people and the most Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Religion and Liberties of any Nation upon the Earth, against their King who was a true Son of the Church, and break the Neck of all his designs for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of it into his Dominions: And in a word, that he was so far from approving of it, that he every way disliked it, and that it should not throw dust in his Eyes from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting into and opposing of his incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the holy See, which he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend to the utmost extreamity; and so concluded with a short admonition, and with which concludes this Letter to your Lordship from him who is,</p>

            <p>SInce my last I have had the opportunity to take the Heads of another Letter written soon after that I have already sent you, by the Pope to the <hi>French</hi> King, and is to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>In the first place he takes upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the Answers and frivolous Complaints of the <hi>French</hi> King, and then descends to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule his vain pretence of Piety in persecuting the Protestants of his Kingdom for denying him Obedience, while he was no less severe to the Bishops of <hi>Alet</hi> and <hi>Pamiers</hi> and some other Ecclesiasticks, and even to some poor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besses and their Nuns for paying that Obedience which was due to the papal Authority; that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>id not only look like it, but really was nothing less but building up the Church with the Left Hand and at the same time pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it down with the Right.</p>
            <p>That he was well informed what writings came out in <hi>France</hi> against his Authority, which he well knew, was that of the holy Apostolick See; what <hi>Theses</hi> were there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and what was done by his over awing

the Assembly of the Clergy of his Kingdom, how and what method, he had taken to vel the <hi>French</hi> Jesuits against him, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Maimburg,</hi> to represent his supremacy as precarious, Itineran and Ambulatory; and not fixt to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> herself, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Capital</hi> City of the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian Prince in the World for the time; that is, <hi>gallice</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> in the present Age: that he well understood not only this, but also the designs that were formed by him to erect a new Religion which should Total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swallow up and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>YOur Lordship may call to mind what I have before written to you concerning Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion, as necessary to facilitate the King's Designs, and now you see it hath sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Buddings of it are visible enough in <hi>England;</hi> that the Parliament of the former as well as the latter opposed the Dispensing Power is notoriously known, so that there was much less Hopes they would have concurred to the Indulgence, a Point as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be gained every whit as the other; that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation were more modelled to the King's Hand than the <hi>English,</hi> the King himself well knew; as having a personal Share in it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50018:221"/>
when high Commissioner in that Kingdom in his Brother's Reign, and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Jesuitical Faction knew this as well as he; and therefore I am assured both of them concurred to have the Indulgence given there first, and that also in so partial a manner in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of those of the King's Religion, that the rest have hardly any Share therein; which manifests plainly the Design of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks whatever specious Pretence they may otherwise use, is to bring the People of <hi>England</hi> also under the same, nay a worse Yoke of Servitude, and to have their own Religion predominant quickly, and in Time the only one in both Nations: And as for the third they are cock sure of that already; but that of the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries is not so visible and above Board; for they hope such partial Proceedings must at last incense the People of both Kingdoms and that to so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent a degree, that the King must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity have recourse to call in <hi>French</hi> Force to quell them: and then, my Lord, when they have once got sure Footing, who can guess at their farther Aim; however, they have not with all their Intrigues been able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the King to use the same Partiality in <hi>England,</hi> who according to the Transmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Intelligence hither seemed very much inclined to it, upon their urging the Tractableness of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Council in the Matter, and what a great Pattern they had set to them of <hi>England,</hi> whom they did not doubt but would abrogate the Laws made against <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in imitation of them; but a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Lord, whom I have formerly named to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

already devoured with their Eyes the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Preferments in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> (in the later whereof they have got a Lieutenant of their own stamp) and more than all the Lands which they have been debarr'd from by the Act of <hi>Settlement;</hi> having (as I can assure your Lordship) a previous Promise from this Court, That the King will use all imaginable endeavours to get his Brother of <hi>England</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to abolish it; and which has put the <hi>Irish</hi> so hotly upon renewing their Importunities to the King against the said Act, that he hath in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner agreed to those measures that are pursuant thereunto; in which motions the <hi>Irish</hi> were order'd to be effectually seconded by the Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this Court, who at the same time have encourag'd the <hi>Irish</hi> privately with a Promise; That if after all, the King would not give his full Consent, or durst not do them Right, their Master was resolv'd to do it; provided they would chuse him for their Protector, which they might lawfully do, being at best but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Nation, against their Conquerors, for the recovery not only of their Native Rights in that Land, but likewise of those afresh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to them by the Treaty, (whether preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or real, I will not determine upon that Head) with the late K. <hi>Charles</hi> II, of which the <hi>French King</hi> was Guarrantee, and therefore justly might and ought to be call'd in as a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator.

            <p>YOur Lordship, for ought I know, may know much better than I can inform you, what Arguments the King has us'd to such as have been lately Closetted by him; and if <hi>Fame</hi> be not a—, you are one of that number; for a List of them is not yet come into our—; but I can transmit into your Hands what has been concerted here in the nature of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries at <hi>White-Hall</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; they were to represent to the King, and he to the closetted Gentlemen, That there were <hi>four Kings</hi> who had endeavour'd to bring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> into an Uniformity in Religion, that so the People might live in Amity one with another; and notwithstanding all the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, tho' seemingly very likely to take effect and succeed according to wish, which wise Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians had suggested from time to time; yet they had hitherto proved abortive, and their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours had been in vain: That therefore the only way left for to settle Tranquillity in a State, so as to be no more to be disturb'd about Religion, was to grant every one the freedom fully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50018:224"/>
his own: That such an Iudulgence of all Religions in <hi>Holland</hi> was as much a cause of the flourishing of that State in Wealth and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and more than any other that could be assign'd; and to say that such a Liberty, tho' it might be compatible enough with a Republick, was not yet with Monarchical Governments, was a gross Mistake; and Experience shewd it to be quite otherwise both in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and elsewhere, where the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians have been tolerated in their Religion for many Ages, and yet have been so far from being mutinous, or Disturbers of the respective States they have liv'd under, that they are great Supporters of them, especially the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who are almost the only Merchants they have in that mighty and extensive Kingdom of <hi>Persia:</hi> That the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions which our <hi>Nonconformists</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have from time to time been under, had been the cause of the flight of many good Subjects beyond the Seas, of whom our neighbouring Nations drew great and solid Advantages; and that those who have staid at home have, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Pressures they have labour'd under, provd uneasie, and turn'd Malecontents; and if they have not had Virtue and Constancy enough patiently to suffer under their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they were alwaies ready to favour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts and enter into Factions, whereof they had seen fatal effects in the late Reigns, from which no <hi>King</hi> could be able to secure his Person and his Subjects, but that uneasie and turbulent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits would be alwaies ready, under Pretence of Religion, which they abused, to disturb and molest them. Which Reasons the <hi>King</hi> was to back closely with large Promises of Favour, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50018:224"/>
if he found any obstinate, to mix his Reasons and Promises with some Intimations of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; and, upon an absolute Refusal, to proceed to divest some of their Places under him. and to alledge for a Reason of his so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it was not reasonable that they who refused their Services should enjoy his Favours; and that if hereupon any should be so audacious as to tell him, That this Practice of his was irregular and contrary to the Freedom which the Laws of the Land allow'd to them, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Members of Parliament, whose Suffrages ought to be spontaneous and free, they were to be put in mind, that they had forgot the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences used by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, upon the like occasions, and the methods so many other <hi>Kings</hi> had put in practise, to engage their Parliaments to subscribe to their Wills: that they might consider that two of the most famous Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ever were in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> had authoriz'd this Conduct, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III, and King <hi>Richard</hi> II, when some of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Bulls</hi> were contested, as being looked upon too much to entrench on the <hi>King</hi>'s Prerogative; that the Parliament pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King <hi>Edward,</hi> and obliged <hi>Richard,</hi> almost against his Will, to give their Consent, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Conferences with the Members, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to use the utmost of their Power to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>King</hi>'s Prerogative, and the Rights of the Crown, against that See, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if that after all, the <hi>King</hi> should find, that neither Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Promises, Threats, nor Examples would do, he was advis'd to proceed in his Brother's Steps by <hi>

whereon they depended, tho' this was by far the more tedious way, but yet there was one way to hasten it: for whereas new Charters, in his Brother's time granted in lieu of the old ones, were many of them retarded, because the Court-Officers insisted upon too much Mony; the <hi>King</hi> now might give positive Directions to such persons to dispatch them without such Considerations, with a Promise to gratifie them another way; and if he found that would not do, then he was to cashier such Officers, and put others in their room who would engage to do the business to effect.

That some persons of note's going over lately into <hi>Holland,</hi> was no sign he was unconcern'd at the <hi>English</hi> Affairs, or unapplied to, but must needs give Umbrage, and more than a Suspicion that he had already a strong Party within the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that indeed his Conduct without was next to a demonstration of it, since he had done all that ever he could to hinder His Majesty from all the Succours he could expect from abroad, in case of any domestick Troubles; for tho' His Majesty was sure of <hi>France,</hi> and had made a general Alliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> and might then be apt to believe that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> would not oppose him, especially when the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> was the Dispute; yet it was manifest the Prince had bid fair for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriving him of both those Supports, first by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himself, and then by causing the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HOwever the Emissaries of this Court have traduced the Noble Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the King, yet they have in some sort given the Lye to themselves, when notwithstanding all their Rhodomantade, about the Prince's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the House of <hi>Austria</hi> against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, they have been so alarmed at the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals made to him by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of a strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Allyance, which they knew, if entred into, must invalidate that made with them; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and King of <hi>Spain</hi> being suspicious of the Allyance with <hi>France,</hi> had entred into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> as I have hinted in my last; and that they might make their Party as strong as they could, and having at the same time no clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of our King's private Leaguing with <hi>France,</hi> they resolved to leave nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essayed, either to know that it was really so, or, if not, to engage the King in their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; the Marquess <hi>de Gastanaga,</hi> Govenour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador <hi>Don Pedro de Ronquillo</hi> were the Persons employed by that illustrious House in that Affair; it's well known here that the latter has omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could be done to bring the King over,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50018:229"/>
urging to him the Honour and Interest of such an Allyance; that it was the only Opportunity he had left to recover the good Opinion of his Subjects, who, he must needs know himself, were somewhat alienated in their Affections from him, with a great deal more to the same purpose; and he did at last proceed so far, well knowing his blind—as to engage, if his Majesty would enter into and be cordial in such an Allyance, to order it so that his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should acquiesce with whatever he was then attempting to get established in respect of Religion, which he could never effect by the Assistance and Agency of <hi>France,</hi> their harsh Procedure against the Reformed there being too green and fresh in Memory to be so soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the <hi>English,</hi> who had besides a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aversion to that Nation and their Politicks; But, my Lord, all that <hi>Don Ronquillo</hi> has done, was communicated to the <hi>French</hi> Emissaries, who presently took the Scent, and being not willing to give the King space to demur upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lost no Time in remonstrating to him; <hi>That they who had told him, That he ought to take that Opportunity to gain his Subjects, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the League of</hi> Ausburg, <hi>had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the inconsequence that followed upon such a Procedure; That that League now agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated was but the consequence of another made at</hi> Magdenburg <hi>by the Protestants, in favour of the</hi> Hugonots; <hi>and that it were against all good Reason and Sense, that a Prince who did his utmost to procure a Liberty to</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks in</hi> England, <hi>should concur to re-establish the most rigid of Protestants in</hi> France; <hi>besides, it would argue no good Policy for him to forsake a solid Friend, such as the</hi> French <hi>King was, to joyn

            <p>THat the King, pursuant to his late Allyances with this Crown, designs a War, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>French</hi> Arms, against <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is no longer a Secret here, whatever it may be in <hi>England;</hi> especially since <hi>Don Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillo</hi>'s Artifices to gain him over to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Interest, as I mentioned to your Lordship in my my last, have failed, tho' he were briskly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded therein by the Lord Marquess of <hi>Powis,</hi> the Pope's Nuntio, and Emperor's Minister, whose Reasons or rather Remonstrances to the King upon that Head, for want of better Intelligence, I shall at present take notice of to your Lordship, as entred in our Minutes, and which indeed were such that 'tis a wonder he should withstand them, <hi>sed quem Deus—</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They prest it very home upon him, That such a War against the States of <hi>Holland</hi> could not be attempted with any apparent Advantage to his Majesty, without a junction with the <hi>French</hi> Power, which yet in all human Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility would never enable him to conquer those Provinces, since both the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Emperor, nay the Empire would be obliged to protect them; to war with whom, especially
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50018:231"/>
with <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Trade, as he well knew was most beneficial to <hi>England</hi> of any in the World, would be attended with such manifest Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as all the Power of <hi>France,</hi> were that King a faithful Ally, would never be able to make the Nation amends for; and that supposing he should be able to conquer the said Republick, by the Assistance of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, yet to conquer it by <hi>French</hi> Force would necessarily but make himself, as well as that Nation a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary and Underling of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That in all likelihood a War with <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and against the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> would disgust his Subjects, and set them all against him, yea and perhaps move some hot Spirits to form Designs to dispossess him of his Throne; or at least, so far to make Opposition as to knock on the Head all his fine Projects for the Advancement of his own Religion in <hi>England,</hi> and engaging of his very Catholick Subjects against him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That if his Majesty intended the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Catholick Faith in <hi>England,</hi> it was to be considered, that the same was a Work of Time, and required great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that they were sure the hot and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Methods of <hi>France</hi> and the Jesuits would never effect it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That to them, for the effectual bringing about of the said Work, there seemed a kind of necessity, that he should stay till the Discords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Catholick Princes were so far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased as to be without Danger of breaking out in a long Time, for that all their Concurrence would be found to be little enough to enable him to accomplish his Ends therein.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:50018:231"/>
5. That if he should chuse rather to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a strict Allyance with the House of <hi>Austria</hi> against the <hi>French,</hi> he would thereby render himself secure of his People's Hearts and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Naval Force to strengthen him at Sea, as occasion required; and of all the other Allies Forces, to divert the <hi>French</hi> Armies by Land: And that if he should lose upon that account, as 'twas likely, any Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from <hi>France,</hi> they assured him the Pope would allow him a much better Pension to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail it; and that being engaged against <hi>France,</hi> his People would be so intent against the <hi>French,</hi> and upon that War, so agreeable to their Inclination, that they would not be so very jealous of, and so prying into the Advances he should make in the Change of Religion at Home; and that if by that means, than which nothing could be thought on more feasible, he could not settle that Religion, he might at least secure it, and make Matters easie to those of his own Perswasion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That if his Majesty persisted to make War against <hi>Holland,</hi> which would inevitably draw on one with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> if his Arms did not prevail so far as to come to an entire Conquest, he was certainly ruined, and all the Catholicks in the three Kingdoms along with him, without resource, and would perish unpitied, and without any Hopes or possibility of Succour from any Catholick Princes but the <hi>French</hi> King alone; and that if on the contrary, as it was the most unlikely thing in the World, he should prevail to a Conquest over <hi>Holland,</hi> and his own Country, that yet thereby he should, under the colour of an imaginary esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of the Catholick Religion in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50018:232"/>
               <hi>Brittish</hi> Kingdoms, but settle an irreligious Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant over all Christendom, worse to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion and Christianity in general than any Heretick in the World, nay than the very <hi>Turk</hi> himself, and who would insolently trample upon the Pope's as well as his Fellow Princes Power, and set up a new Empire and a new Religion of a third sort neither Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nor Protestant, but such as suited with his own ambitious Designs; as the Steps he had already made that way did sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: And so instead of resettling the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion where it had lost Ground, and in the Soil of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which would prove but a Quick-Sand to it, he would destroy it all over <hi>Europe,</hi> where it was now established <hi>in terra Firma,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ile leave it to the Decision of your Lordship's Judgment, whether these or the <hi>French</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances carried most of Reason, Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Truth in them, as I ever shall all that comes from,</p>

            <p>I Have already transmitted to your Lordship the Contents of his Holiness's Letters to the <hi>French</hi> King, about the <hi>Regale</hi> and Franchises; but there seems now to be a Disposition in these two high stomach'd Princes to come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and the Conjuncture of Time lies so to the Heart of this Court, that I am apt to believe they will precipitate an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; however, because their forwardness therein might be disguised as much as <hi>French</hi> Policy could effect, they have by their Agents insinuated to our King; That an Embassy to <hi>Rome</hi> from him about accommodating of the foresaid Differences must be very grateful to his Holiness, who paid more deference to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and would further regard his Mediation than any Prince in <hi>Christendom;</hi> and that tho' the <hi>French</hi> Court stood very stiff upon their Rights, yet it was not to be doubted, but as they had so high a Valuation for his Friendship at all Times and Occasions, so he might be confident that in so critical a Juncture of Time, they would not be so purblind as not to see wherein their true Interest consisted; It was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50018:233"/>
no sooner, my Lord, proposed to the King, but accepted by him, and my Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is already arrived in this Kingdom, in his Way to <hi>Italy,</hi> as the King's Embassador extraordinary on this Errand; but notwithstanding this Court has so far prevailed by their Artifices in <hi>England</hi> to procure the Kings Mediation, yet an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if it may be called so, has lately happened at <hi>Rome,</hi> which may perhaps blast all the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hopes entertained from this mighty Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. For Monsieur <hi>Lavardin,</hi> Embassador from this King at <hi>Rome,</hi> receiving Information that some of the Pope's Marshals were got within his Quarters, he ordered his Men to seize them, and commit them to safe Custody; the Cardinal <hi>de Estree</hi> has endeavoured to alleviate the matter, and mollifie his Holiness Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, saying; <hi>That certain Persons, who were no great Friends to</hi> France, <hi>had set them at Work, with a design to irritate Matters yet further between the two Courts; that he might be pleased to consider, that in the Posture Affairs then stood,</hi> that is, after his Holiness had accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Mediation of the King of <hi>England,</hi> it would look ill to admit any Innovation; but the Cardinal was asked, <hi>Whether the King of</hi> France <hi>was Sovereign in the City of</hi> Rome? <hi>And supposing he had been really so, was there any Justice to arrest People as they passed along the Streets, that had a Design to make no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Attempts upon any? That it was never yet known in any Country, or heard of in the World of any Law that condemned a Man upon a bare Suspicion; but supposing that were true, as it was not, yet it was most certain that the Punishment was reserved to the Sovereign and not to an Embassador; who whatever Latitude
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50018:233"/>
he would have allowed to his Authority, could not pretend to any more than to be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in his own Person; that as for his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks, if they pretended to the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption with himself, it was no farther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable than they demeaned themselves Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, as they ought to do; for if they did otherwise, they were subject to the ordinary Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Place they were in; That there were a Thousand Examples for it, though there had been some Embassadors who had endeavoured to extend the Privilege of their Domesticks so far, as to maintain that they ought to be affranchised. That this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended right of Sovereignty by Embassadors was so far from beng true, that they had not as much as Power to punish their own Servants, for there could not be any one Example pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that any Embassador has intruded so far as to condemn any Person whatsoever to Death, tho' there have been many who have justly merited such Punishment; That it was true, they had sometimes reclaimed them when fallen into the Hands of ordinary Iustice, but that at the same time it had always depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that of the Sovereign to concede that Favour to them, or refuse them according as they were more or less just.</hi> These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, which could not be otherwise, for they carried their own Light with them, how could it be justified that a bare Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador should dare to arrest not only his own Servants, but the Officers of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, and that even in his Capital City, and to heighten the Extravagance of

            <p>THE Commitment of the Bishops to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the Birth of the Priuce of <hi>Wales,</hi> are things so agreeable to the <hi>Gusto</hi> of this Court, that they are overjoy'd at it, about the former of which this Court has been very busie: I will not positively say the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had the first hand in it, tho' they have taken care to enter it into our Minutes so; and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to make some advantage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests of the Court, got it suggested to the King by the means of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> That in order to engage the Parliament to establish <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> it was necessary the Bishops should be order'd to injoyn the reading the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in their respective Diocesses: That the matter could not be scrupled by them, since the publication of the King's Orders had been at all times an Usage in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in other Countries. But however this matter was first started, my Lord, I will not take upon me to determine, but it was carried on by strange Instruments; for as soon as ever the Bishops had refused to read the Declaration, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest themselves to the King upon that account,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50018:235"/>
with their Reasons for noncomplyance; the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits about him, egged briskly on by such as are entirely at this Court's Devotion, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him the great Affront offered to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the Regal Dignity itself by such a Refusal; and how if he suffered the same to go impunedly, it might open a Gap for it to be trampled upon without reserve, and who could tell where it would terminate? That since he had already in all other points carried the Rights of Soveraignty to a great height, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was not now time to dissemble and wink at an Adventure that put such narrow Bounds to his Regal Authority: That there was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an absolute necessity to call them to a severe account for such an audacious Act; That they might be tryed by vertue of the Ecclesiastical Commission, and with as much Justice everywhit suspended as the Bp of <hi>London</hi> was; and what would be a mighty Advantageous Consequent thereon, was, that the Privation of the Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would advance the Regal Authority to such a pitch, as to be held in veneration by all the People. You know, my Lord, the Success these Remonstrances have had, but the variation of the Bishops Tryal is disavowed by this Court, and the cause of their being brought into <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> attributed to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's swaying the King, and for which some have gnashed their Teeth at him. Upon the Acquitment of the Bishops, the <hi>English</hi> Jesuits were horribly spighted; and the <hi>French</hi> Emis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries laughed in their Sleeves; and that they might embroyl the Nation more, had Orders to ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uate into any whom they thought fit for their purpose, That the Regal Authority had that Property in it, that it oftentimes subsisted
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50018:235"/>
more in Imagination than Effect: That if the People did but once know their own Strength, they would find it an easie matter to shake off the Yoke, which certain Puissances imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and with a great deal more, but in general Terms to the same purpose, with which I shall not at present trouble your Lordship; But they have at the same time spirited up the Jesuitical Court-Faction to importune the King, without any Intermission to review the Bishop's Cause, and bring them on to another Tryal; alledging to him, That such a Failure would undoubtedly add a Triumph to the People, whereof they had already given but too clear Signs, and considerably augment the audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of his Enemies, who were more in number than he could imagine; and that in short the only way to put both the one and the other to a profound Silence, was by not flinching from that Resoluteness and Constancy which he had made to appear since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Reign, for if he once began to flag therein, it would be quickly seen, he would proportionably sink in Reputation; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great Care should be taken to retrieve this again, since, without that were done, he must necessarily fall into a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with his People than he was aware of, and from whence many Inconveniences would arise, which some of them could be as little foreseen as it would be hard to prevent them; That therefore, as the Case stood, it were much more adviseable for him to run the Risque of another Tryal, wherein if he succeeded, his Sovereign Authority would be not only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept entire, but the greatest Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity put into his Hands to extend the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50018:236"/>
Bounds of it as far as he pleased; but if it should happen otherwise, and that the Bishops should be acquitted a second Time (which as they designed to concert Matters) was not very likely; the Case would then be but the same, and no other than now, and as much to be feared from the one as from the other; but, it seems, the King was so dispirited with the ill Success of the first Trial that they found him entirely averse to venture on another; and therefore being not able to divert him from his Resolution of giving over that Game as lost, they made it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to give out; That the King was not minded the Bishops should have been cast, that he had therefore given way that such a Jury should be returned, and their Cause to be solicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all their Friends, as was a clear Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had used all these Methods to deliver them from the Difficulties wherein they had plunged themselves, with this Design and Hopes; that the Sense of his Goodness might reclaim them back to their Duty, and that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they might set a Pattern to others not to swerve therefrom; but I do not find by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns made hither of these Expedients that they have met with any tolerable Success; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may know much better than I, how this Affair is relished in the whole, and what is likely to be the Consequence, and so Ile leave it to your Determination, and remain,</p>

            <p>WHatsoever this Court is a doing, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>English</hi> Affairs at this Time, there is little or no Appearance of it; but they seem to be much concerned at the Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our King has met with, in not prevailing with the Officers of his Navy Royal to become
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50018:238"/>
Catholicks; for me to make a Relation of that Transaction to your Lordship, I fear may be but <hi>Crambe bis Cocta,</hi> but your Honour being now remote from the Court at your Country Habitation, and that I believe we have here a truer account of that Affair transmitted to us by the Agents of this Court, perhaps your Lordship will not think your Time ill spent in perusing of it. Its seems the Commissioners which the King has sent to the several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Kingdom to dispose Men's Minds to a Willingness to take off the Penal Laws and Test, having generally found a grand Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the People to that Matter, the King was so incensed at the Report they made of it, and the invincible Stubbornness of the Nation, that he convened his Cabinet Council, and with them resolved to cashier all such out of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as would not fall in with his Designs; But that all things might be opportunely executed, it was agreed he should make himself sure first of his Fleet and his Army, without whose Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance they saw it was in vain to effect so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a Change at once; wherefore he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that Mass should be said on Board his Ships; but there was such Opposition made thereunto both by the Officers and Seamen, that the Priests, who went thither for that end, were forced to hide themselves for fear of being thrown over Board, which they had been like to have undergone, had it not been that the Principal Officers, who maintained still the Respect that was due to the King's Commands, had done their utmost to hinder it. But when the matter came to be represented to the King, his Fury was raised to an high degree, tho' he had for the Time the Artifice to dissemble his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50018:239"/>
wherefore he resolved to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Royal Presence might not operate more than his Orders, and therefore he went on Board the Fleet himself, and having commanded all the Officers to bring him their Commissions, he there asked them, Whether they were not resolved to change their Religion and imbrace his, who had bestowed their Offices upon them, in Expectation that they would do whatever he commanded them? They were surprized at the Complement, and expected no such thing, nevertheless, being resolved not to be frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either with Menaces nor be gained by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, they generally answered; That how devoted soever they were to his Majesty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and their own Fortune, yet they could not be enduced to any thing against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. To which the King replyed, That what he required of them could by no means be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them, whatever their Ministers might tell them to the contrary; that there was more of Opinion than Reason in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they professed; that they should take the Pains to reflect duely thereon, for which yet he would grant them but the Space of 48 Hours.</p>
            <p>But tho' most of them did believe from Words so positive by the King, they should certainly be casheered, yet they resolved to split upon that Rock rather than alter, whatever came of it. The King, in the mean Time, who had trusty Spies in all the Ships, having learnt their Resolutions, for all his eagerness in the matter, did not think it advisable to push on Things over far at that time; wherefore he ordered they should be told, when he sent them back their Commissions, That the 48
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50018:239"/>
Hours which he had alloted, being not sufficient for the determining of an Affair of so great Importance, he was pleased to allow them some further time to think of it, but that they would please him to conform themselves to his Will on that occasion; but in the mean time tho' the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of this Court have been much used in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> yet herein they have been laid aside, and there is an essential Difference between the one and the other, for in the Choice which our King makes of Officers, he had rather they should have <hi>Service</hi> than <hi>Profit;</hi> whereas in <hi>France</hi> they will have both the one and the other if they can, and for want of which, <hi>Profit</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preferred before <hi>Service.</hi> I'll not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure such an Attempt, but I am ashamed we should be laughed at both here and in other Countries for our Politicks, and your Lordship knows as well as any Man living, that when wise and experienced Statesmen have sate at the Helm, they never would suffer the Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be put upon such an Hazard, well knowing the least Resistance made thereunto is a Triumph to the People, but <hi>speramus meliora,</hi> I am,</p>

at <hi>Geneva,</hi> was under great Obligations to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> for the good Offices he had done him, and care taken of him; this <hi>Genevese</hi> being thus re-established in the Favour of the Prince, his Master, had it seems a greater Share of it than before, as he had also in the Secrets of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>B—</hi>his Favorite; however it was, it should seem by the sequel, that he was now by his second Introduction to Favour, become quite of Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi>'s Interest, who was the Instrument to reconcile him; For not long since he has taken occasion to be dissatisfied with the Service he engaged in, and withdrawn, and being, as was given out, but whether so in reality or no, upon his return to his native City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he took occasion to write a Letter to Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> now in this City, <hi>That the Noise about the Armamont in</hi> Holland <hi>was so far from being a false thing, or otherwise to be conceived, that it was a Matter of the highest Importance, and did no less than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Safety of the Crown of his Master, the King of</hi> England, <hi>and that it was highly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary he should be made acquainted with a Son-in-Law, whom he knew not.</hi> This he desired Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> to communicate to the King with all speed; but he was not willing to make any further Discovery of his Secret to any other save to the King himself in Person; if the King were so pleased as to send him Orders by Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> to come and attend upon him. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt of which Letter from the said <hi>Genevese,</hi> Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> hath writ Five or Six Letters to the King in a very pressing, lively and urgent manner, but what effect they have had upon him, may be the Subject of another

            <p>I Do not find Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi>'s Instances have had any great Effects upon the King towards quickening his Pace to ward off the Blow that seems to be preparing to be given him; And I have something more than a Suspicion, That it is the Desire of this Court, the Kingdom should be invaded, and that the Agents of it have been extraordinary busy to countermine whatever Advices have been given the King for taking a timely Precaution to defend himself, so that there is, my Lord, in this Case a Wheel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50018:242"/>
a Wheel, and whatever open Professions of Kindness is shewed him from hence by a timous Premonition of his Danger, there is as great Care seriously to thwart all by contrary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels; And among other things, it has been eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged to him, That the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> continues to carry himself towards him with such a Conduct, as could not leave the least room to entertain any Suspicion of him, and could it be thought that a Prince who had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Devoirs to him, so far as to make his Complements as other Princes had done upon the Birth of his Son, the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> and caused the Name of his new Brother-in-Law to be added to those of the Princes of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for whom they prayed in his Chappel, should be unsincere, or have the least Design to molest him or his Kingdoms by Arms, especially since <hi>Van Citters,</hi> the States Embassador, had particularly assured him, That what Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made in <hi>Holland</hi> did not regard <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> but had given him to understand, That <hi>France</hi> had a great deal more Reason to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed than he: But after all, whatever were intended by such Preparations, which they were well assure were much greater in Fame than in Reality; his Majesty's Affairs were in so good a Posture that he had no Reason to fear any Enterprizes whatsoever; That he had a Land Army, a Fleet and such good Magazines as were sufficient to render the Efforts of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the complicated Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, tho' such a Conjunction was as little to be expected as that his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would abandon him; who, if he saw oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, as there was now but little likelihood, would no fail to support him with all the Power

            <p>IF your Lordship should ask me, What the real Designs of this Court are in reference to <hi>England,</hi> in such a conjuncture; they seem to have other Sentiments now of the Invasion than they had a few days ago, when they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly promoting the same Might and Main, as I have intimated not long since to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, with a View to engage us in a Civil War, and thereby bring the King under a Necessity of calling in such a <hi>French</hi> Power to his Assistance as he should never be able to force out again; But now they seem to be quite against it, upon the opposition made by a great Minister of State to their Offer both of Men and Ships upon this occasion, of whom they talk strange things here, and say, that in regard to the King, however he has insinuated and winded himself
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50018:243"/>
into his Favour more than any they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend or propose, he must be an Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled only in a way of Policy and Necessity, that he had in former Parliaments pushed on the Bill for his Exclusion with greater eagerness and warmth than any other; That he had never attempted to recover his Favour, but when he had a Prospect to injure him thereby; that he is a Man intent to follow the prevailing Side, but that he had always, in case of any Change, a safe Retreat to the other side, that whilst he adhered to the Factions in Parliament, against the Royal Family and Interest, he had strict Correspondence with one of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s L—, who found a way to reconcile him to his Majesty, and by his Mediation to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> That being now come to be Prime Minister of State to the King, and almost the only one he had since his Elevation to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Throne, he had served him with Zeal, while there was a Prospect of Prosperity to attend him, but that he hath now no sooner perceived that there is a Party formed against him, but that he hath shewed himself ready to enter into a Correspondence with his Enemies, against him; That the Countess of <hi>S—</hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> That their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle <hi>H. S.</hi> a Man deeply engaged in that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, was gone into <hi>Holland</hi> to attend the Prince, was no small Proof of her Husband's being engaged in the same Interests; That there could be no other Construction made of the Violence done to the King his Master, by his engaging of him, notwithstanding all his Aversion to it, to advance Father <hi>Petre</hi> against his own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, maugre the Opposition made by the Queen to it, and in spite of the most essential
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50018:244"/>
Laws of the Order he was of, to be one of his Privy Council; That the King thereby, in satisfying of him, did on that occasion lose that Right which one should think he had to dispose of his own Subjects; That nothing else could be inferred from this Lord's Procedure and Carriage in the imbroiled Affair of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which he brought on into the Council, and which he yet favoured under-hand; That it cannot otherwise chuse but that the Contempt which this Minister has affected of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations given the King his Master of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Son-in-Law and of the <hi>Dutch</hi> against him, whereby he has in a great measure diverted him from using the means necessary to resist any Attempts made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or impressions on his Dominions, must proceed from an ill Principle and Dissatisfaction to his Interests.

            <p>THe Censure of this Court upon the late Conduct of a noble Peer and Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in <hi>England,</hi> as mentioned in my last to your Lordship, is not so universal, but that there are diverse others who have entertained a quite contrary Opinion of him, and say, That it is far enough from being an infallible Rule, that a reconciled Enemy can never become a sincere Friend; That it is possible a Man may reserve unto himself a place of Refuge and Retreat among a contrary Party, and yet be far enough from falling in with its Interests; That the Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of him are without any manifest Ground, since there is not the least Appearance that he hath personally linked himself with his Master's Enemies, or held any Correspondence with them that tends to the betraying of him; That what his Lady had done with the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> tho' it might be lyable to Suspicions in such a Conjuncture, is no sufficient Proof or Reason that the same Crime should be attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Earl her Husband; That Col. <hi>S—</hi>tho' his near Relation, might yet deceive him, and make him believe that his Passage into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

was to no other end than for the Benefit of his Health, and a Journey to drink the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> That to say he turned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick that he might the better serve the Protestant Interest, was so ridiculous in it self as to need no Consutation; That as for the Business of Father <hi>Petre,</hi> the Earl did nothing but what every wise Statesman would have done, <hi>viz.</hi> to seek out one on whom might be discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Envy of such things as should displease the People in the Court-Conduct, and so escape it himself; That as for any Enterprise by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> against so potent a King as his Master, who was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with so great an Army, it might appear to be so extraordinary and strange a thing to him, that he might believe it his Duty to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect such Advices as things unlikely, and not far from ridiculous; And that now at length he finds himself obliged to believe them to be real, those same Forces which the King his Master has on foot, might make him opinionative to reject the Succours offered him from hence, which he looks upon to be as well dangerous as unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but which if the Censures is most agreeable to Truth, Ile leave to your Lordship's Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and remain,</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50018:247"/>
Enquirers into the reason of such a Procedure, (not knowing well then from what Quiver the Arrow was taken that shot down the <hi>Goliah</hi> of all their Hopes of once nestling in <hi>England)</hi> who examin'd, interrogated him, and almost laid it to his charge, that their Advice was not follow'd: But having at length found it to be otherwise, they resolved to put him upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expedient, mention'd first by himself, to serve his Master, as they said, tho' nothing is more certain than that it is their own Interest they design'd mainly thereby: For one day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Monsieur <hi>de Croissy</hi> had prest him hard still to sollicite his Master to accept of the Troops and Ships offered him by <hi>France,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> answer'd, <hi>That it was in vain, he having Orders to meddle no further in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore durst not move in it.</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so added, <hi>That yet he was of Opinion, that if his most Christian Majesty would order his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador to acquaint the States-general what share he took in the Affairs of the King his Master, and to threaten to attack them, in case they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook any thing against him, he did believe that would quickly put a stop to the intended Invasion, and spoil the Measures the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>had concerted thereupon, without giving the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish <hi>occasion to complain their King had called in Foreigners into their Country: That this would be an effectual means to keep part of the King's Enemies on this side the Sea, and they might have leisure enough to break off the Cabals which the other formed at home against him.</hi> This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course made Monsieur <hi>de Croissy</hi> hasten to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King with it, who liked it so well, that he immediately dispatched away a Courier to Monsieur the Count <hi>d'Avaux</hi> his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

The States having paused a little for an Answer to this Memorial, and presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it being encounter'd with another from the Marquess <hi>de Albeville,</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> Ambassador there; they answered the latter, <hi>They were long since convinced of the League between the two Kings; That they had armed in Imitation of other Princes,</hi> &amp;c. which being interpreted here, that the States were resolved to go on with the Invasion; It raised the Expectations of this Court, that the tender of their Troops would be still, accepted of by the King: But the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and sagacity of my Lord <hi>S—</hi>disjointed also this Project, and ended in the Recalling and Imprisonment of Mr. <hi>Skelton,</hi> for moving in an Affair for which he had no Orders.

            <p>THo' the <hi>French</hi> Arms this year have had mighty success on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> yet the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any opposition, and the success he has met with since his arrival, together with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section of some Horse to him under my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> (tho' they say here but a very small number) has damped all their Rejoycings; And indeed, if we may judge of their Hearts by their Looks, we may see plainly that they have given over not only their own Game on that side of the Water for lost, but that they look upon that of the Kings so too, almost beyond all hopes of recovery; but yet that they may make some semblance of Zeal still for his Service, their Creatures have advised him to call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his chief Officers, and to tell them; That he had given Orders for the calling together of a Free Parliament, as soon as a more setled time would give him room to hope for such: That he had resolved to provide for the Security of the Religion, Liberties, and Privileges of his Subjects, as far as they themselves could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or wish for; Could there any more he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, he was ready to grant it?

but desired, if after all this there was any one dissatisfied, that they might declare it: That he was ready to give unto such as thought not fit to tarry with him, Pasports to go to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that he would freely pardon them their shameful Treason. This Speech, and the effects it has had, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may know much better than I; but it is now talked here, that it has met with so little success, that most of those persons whom the King had convened as aforesaid, have formed a close Conspiracy against him, and to cut their way short, resolved to seize his Person; and that my Lord <hi>C—</hi>being pitched upon to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Design, he dexterously engaged the King to go to view the Vanguard of his Army, which was that part of it which was posted nearest the Enemy; That the King was ready to take Coach and ride thither, when his Nose falling to bleed on a sudden, obliged him to stay for that time, and put off the review till another opportunity; But before that day was over, he had good Information given him, that there was a Design formed to seize him, and that measures were concerted to have him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to <hi>Exeter;</hi> and that my Lord <hi>C—</hi>upon that, with some others, withdrew to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as did the King to <hi>London.</hi> I would not have troubled your Lordship at this time, but that I know you expect I should give you the Sentiments of this side upon our affairs, and what part they take therein: Which with my humblest Duty to your Honour, is all I have at present to impart to you, who am,</p>

            <p>THE King's Affairs are looked upon here to be lost beyond all human relief, and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is now as much dreaded, as they heretofore made a semblance of despising and neglecting of him; tho, in reality, there were ever since I have known this place, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Fears of his great Constancy, Policy and Courage hanging upon this Court, and all the Hopes they have now left, and the only Twig to hang by, is his <hi>Petite Highness,</hi> who after great difficulties is with his Mother arrived here, and of which some of their Attendance give a lamentable relation; That upon my Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi>'s refusal to let the young Gentleman cross the Seas, he was carried back to <hi>London,</hi> whither the King was also come from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who with the Count <hi>de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to the place where the Ship lay: They say, it was not without very great danger of being stopped and discovered, that the Queen and the Child got out of the Court, at a time when every thing was suspected, and when the Infants crying might have been a means to have broken all the best measures in the World. They were put into a strange Disguise, and so made their escape by the way of unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Stairs and Places, crost the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and took the Road which leads from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Gravesend,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badie</hi> had stopped a Vessel for to transport them into <hi>France;</hi> and all the while the Child did not as much as once cry: They were in danger several times of being seized by Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and a concourse of People, who suspected all whom they did not know, to be fugitive <hi>Papists,</hi> and looked upon their escape as a Prey that ran away from them. While they were on the <hi>Thames,</hi> they were encounter'd with Wind, Rain, the fluctuating of the Waves, in the horror of a Night so dark, that they could not see one another: The Queen on the other side of the River waited for a Coach, near the Walls of a Church, which was harnessed in a neighbouring Inn, being all the while expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Rain, which continued with great violence; But the Curiosity of a man who came out of the Inn with a Candle in his hand, put her into a great fear, lest she should be known, for the person advanced directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where she stood, when Seignior <hi>Riva,</hi> who perceived him, immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and encountered him briskly, so as that both of them fell into the Dirt, by which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the man thinking that what befel him was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chance, they both began to excuse the matter, which proceeded no further. When the Coach was got ready they rid away with all speed, and came to the Ship, where <hi>Labady</hi>'s Wife (who had some Acquaintance with the Captain) appearing first, did so amuse him with a Story, <hi>That the Queen was an</hi> Italian <hi>Lady, returning with her Family into her own Country,</hi> till the Queen was got safe on Board, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cabin appointed for her, together with the Nurse that carried the Infant; The Marquess and Marchioness of <hi>Powis,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Dalmon</hi> and <hi>Montecuculli</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Persons of her Retinue, did imbark at the same time with the <hi>Irish</hi> Captains, sent on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the King to have an Eye over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Vessel, in case they found him any way refractory and deficient in his Duty; But of this, they say, there happened to be no occasion, for the Ship being under sail, they had an easie Passage, and landed at <hi>Calais</hi> on the 11th of this instant: She designed to have staid there for the King her Husband, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they had concerted Matters between them before their parting, was to follow her the next Day, but not finding the King come, she went for <hi>Bologn,</hi> where two Friers, and an an Officer that have made their Escape out of <hi>England,</hi> informed her of the Misfortune which befel her Husband at <hi>Feversham,</hi> and which your Lordship can tell much better than I. From <hi>Bologn</hi> she journey'd to <hi>Montrevil</hi> and from thence to <hi>S.

Flight, and dangerous Escape, which they count little less than a Miracle, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving both of the Queen and her Son to a much better Fortune.

            <p>ITs not doubted here but that there will be strong Efforts made for the Advancing of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Throne, and by the Returns made of Members to serve upon the present Occasion in the Lower House, it is concluded that their Procedures will be much in favour of his Interest, and consequently to the Disadvantage of this Court, and therefore they have taken care to give them a Bone to pick, tho' I know not well what it is for the present; But of the House of Lords they have entertained a more favourable Opinion; but foreseeing that whatever is agitated among the Commons is also likely to creep into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among the Lords, and that the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sigion, his Evil Administration, his Retreat out of the Kingdom, and the Compact between him and his People may be called in question; They have by way of Precaution given Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to their Emissaries slily to infuse into
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50018:252"/>
any such Peers as they judge susceptible of such Insinuations (but I cannot think your Lordship of that Number) That it was true, the King's Religion had been a very main Cause to bring those Misfortunes upon himself and the Nation which they laboured under, but hereby it could not be thought that should be as much as once debated for a sufficient Ground to exclude him from his Throne; That this would appear strange in the Sight of all Nations, that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prince was incapable to sway a Scepter, when even in <hi>England</hi> it self there had been no less than Forty <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Kings, who had governed <hi>England,</hi> from King <hi>Egbert</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> That it was but the other Day that all the Kingdom had by Addresses on purpose disavowed that Maxime; That the two Universities had condemned the same for an Error, and that the Parliament in One thousand six hundred and eighty five, did believe it to be a thing so pernicious and destructive to a State, that they were minded to brand with Infamy all those who would have excluded the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Succession; That all the Nation having acknowledged this Prince at a Time when he made open Profession of the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it would be a ridiculous inconsequence to pretend that that same Religion was an Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to his reigning as King of <hi>England;</hi> and that as for any previous Compact that might be alledged by ill disposed Men to have been between King and People, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> was a pernicious chimerical Notion, often condemned as a Gap opened to seditious Practices for the imbroiling of the State; That surely that Retreat could not be called a <hi>Desertion</hi> in the King, full of Discontent, and finding himself abandoned
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50018:253"/>
by his Subjects to the Mercy of a Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, especially seeing the Royal Character the bore, did but expose him to the Insults of the People, and his Person into the Hands of a Prince that imposed Laws upon him, seized him in his own Dominions, and gave him Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages that ought to presage greater Dangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; That the Offers he had again and again made to the Nation, and even to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who protected it, to treat with them amicably, to leave nothing undone for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing of their Grievances, could not but be adjudged Reparations sufficient for those Faults that were imputed to him; That the Letter he had writ, left behind him at <hi>Feversham,</hi> and ordered to be printed, with several other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he had actually writ to diverse Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, asserting his Authority and Claim; And that the Protestations, which no doubt he would make against any Acts of the Assembly to meet, if any such should happen in disfavour of him, which could hardly be credited, and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which he had taken, and whereof they heard enough every Day, and would doubtless more and more dayly, for the Recovery of his Dominions, were evident Demonstrations that he had not renounced them; And that if they were deserted by him, it was because his Person was in no Security there, and not the Throne, which he still looked upon as a Property apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him alone; That he was not the first and only King, even of <hi>England,</hi> that had made this Step; That <hi>Ethelrede</hi> in the Time of the <hi>Saxon Kings</hi> retired into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that among the Royal Stem of the <hi>Plantagenets, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> IV. past over into <hi>Flanders</hi> without King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. his Competiter his believing that he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50018:253"/>
had thereby acquired a new Title to the Crown; That as to the present conjuncture the King found himself in, the Condition of Kings would be very hard, if they of all Mankind were the only Persons who were not allowed the Favour to shun a Danger they were exposed to, and which could not be avoided but by fleeing from it, and that surely it was a Man's Prudence when he saw his House on Fire beyond a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of extinguishing it, to save his own Life, and attend an Opportunity to rebuild it again, since he could not save it from burning. What Successes, my Lord, these Remonstrances have met with, or may still, it may be your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship can tell; But I can tell you, if this fails, there is another Mine to spring, whereon they rely very much, and on which they intend to work with utmost Diligence; but I pray God to keep my poor Country from falling again into their Shares, from which it now is in so fair a way of being delivered, and to inspire your Lordship and other worthy Patriots sit such a juncture with a proportionable Zeal for the good of it, and so I rest.</p>
