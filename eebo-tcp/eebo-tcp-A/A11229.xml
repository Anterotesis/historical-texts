            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So the ſpirituall dition, made way for the temporall donation, and then was <hi>poyſon powred into the Church,</hi> when the <hi>bountie</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſought to ſatiſfie the <hi>ambition</hi> of Prieſts. The Prieſts then grew <hi>downwards</hi> towards the earth, and Princes then began to climbe <hi>upwards,</hi> towards heauen: And the coveteous Clergie finding the <hi>fayth of fewe</hi> (for the faythfull are but fewe, a verie little flock, and oftentimes not very rich in wooll) <hi>not to be ſo fruitfull as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of many,</hi> they nouriſhed that profitable and liberall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour by their uttermoſt arte, and from hence got S. Peter a rich <hi>patrimonie</hi> being dead, who when he lived, had ſcarſe a houſe, wherein to hide his head. This temporall <hi>patrimonie</hi> graced with
<pb facs="tcp:16802:4"/>
ſo holy a patronage, as the reverenced name of S. Peter, did ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and mightily increaſe in all places, eſpecially where <hi>ſuperstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was interteyned in the name and ſtead of <hi>true Religion,</hi> and where Clergie men knew how cunningly to raiſe queſtions and quarrels under hand, and then to intrude themſelues as equall arbitrators, and impartiall umpires; but ever to manage and determine all for the advantage of the <hi>Catholike cauſe,</hi> as they called it, and for the ruine of particulars: as it is reported of that Lawyer, who decided the difference betwixte the lame man and the blinde, concerning their oyſter, that each of them ſhould haue a ſhell, and he the meat. Thus dealing for the Church by <hi>pretence</hi> (themſelues being moſtly ſingle and unmarried, and ſo unſuſpected to trade for the world, and poſteritie) they had oportunitie to inrich themſelues, and their <hi>particular fraternities,</hi> and to performe ſuch actes with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, becauſe they pretended <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> not themſelues, as would haue been counted couſenage, treacherie, exaction, oppreſſion, injuſtice, and perhaps forgerie and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, if perpetrated by any other perſons, or to any other ends. But the generall opinion of their <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> (ſuppoſed and ſtiled <hi>ſacred</hi>) made all paſſe currant without queſtion or controule. Thus in a ſhort time, where they were lately glad to be <hi>graced by Kings</hi>; Kings were now glad to be <hi>graced by them:</hi> And where Kings had <hi>perſecuted</hi> their predeceſſors for <hi>the trueth,</hi> they now <hi>perſecuted</hi> Kings for <hi>falſehood</hi>; and chalenged the <hi>inveſtiture</hi> of ſuch Princes by right, upon whom their predeceſſors, out of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their pietie, and the ſuperſtitious deſire to be inaugurated by ſo bleſſed an omen, had been ſometimes formerly invited or admitted, to lay their holy hands. Now therefore they began to cutte out large cantles of the earth for their owne ſhare, and made ſo manie <hi>ſanctuaries,</hi> and <hi>Citties of refuge,</hi> that they incouraged ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, who ought to haue repreſt them, and gotte well by the bargaine too. For they ſo mightily grew by this meanes, that <hi>the world,</hi> and the <hi>wealth of it</hi> was found with <hi>Priests</hi>; and <hi>pietie</hi> was onely found with the <hi>poore:</hi> the <hi>ſecular</hi> was onely <hi>regular</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt, and the <hi>Regular</hi> was maſter of miſrule in all <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affaires: Marchandize, forraigne negotiations,</hi> and the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment civill and eccleſiasticall,</hi> firſt, by the civill and imperiall lawes,
<pb facs="tcp:16802:5"/>
after by the Cannon Law, a Law of their owne) was wholly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, and managed by them: Kings were made their wardes, and depoſed for Hereticks, as ſoone as they once thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of age to rule themſelues and their people aright, without their helpe: Yea Mars himſelfe was interteyned into their ſervice, and the <hi>Croſſe of tribulation, fayth</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> which was at firſt but a ſtaffe in the hand of the Cleargie, to ſupport them in their conſtant ſufferings, was now <hi>perverted</hi> in the uſe, and <hi>turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> in proſperitie and ſpirituall pride, and ſo became <hi>a ſword</hi> in everie Cleargie mans hand, to invade and diſturbe the peace of Chriſtendome: and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> ſerved, as a ſecret racke or torture of Conſcience, a kinde of holy inquiſition, to finde out that <hi>ſweete ſinne,</hi> and to <hi>pardon it,</hi> which might be moſt <hi>profitable</hi> to the Church, as having command over the purſe of the partie peccant. Thus it grew in time to be rightly called the <hi>Sacrament of pennance</hi> indeede: for if it had not <hi>contrition</hi> at the firſt, yet it ever ended in <hi>repentance,</hi> though ever a little too late, and therefore to ſmall purpoſe for the <hi>pennileſſe penitent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cleargie having by theſe artes and infinite others (as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is full of invention, for he that can once make his Creator can make all other things) ingroſt almoſt all into their owne hands, they made diviſions of <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and cutte them out into <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks,</hi> as all Countries, eſpecially Germanie can well witneſſe. Where the Emperor was ſhackled with <hi>Eccleſiasticall Officers</hi> of the Sea of Rome, as with <hi>fetters of gold</hi>; till the neceſſitie of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, about the riſing up of Luther, forced the Pope, to permit the houſe of Auſtria to grow a little too great, to the leſſening of Antichriſts <hi>immediate authoritie.</hi> In ſo much, as now the Papacie is made a ſervant to the Houſe of Auſtria, under a <hi>Catholike title:</hi> as the Papacie before made both that <hi>Houſe,</hi> and <hi>all others</hi> ſervants, to increaſe and ſupport the exceſſiue greatneſſe of that Sea, under the like <hi>Catholike title and pretence.</hi> But this was then, and is now a violent motion, and therefore not perpetuall: then permitted and practiſed, to prevent the loſſe of all, which was juſtly feared upon probable grounds; and now to hold what that Sea ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth, but feareth to looſe: and to regaine (if it be poſſible) what ſhe hath loſt alreadie. Which if ever ſhe could regaine by
<pb facs="tcp:16802:5"/>
this meanes, ſhe could then be content to burne the <hi>rodde of her wrath,</hi> or to <hi>weare it out</hi> in her worke, with whipping others. In the meane time ſhe is content to make the <hi>Spaniſh kingdome the Catholique ſword:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> may ſtill be the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſcabberd</hi> to that ſword, and <hi>draw</hi> it, or <hi>ſheath</hi> it at the Popes pleaſure. But I beleeue, that as by <hi>theſe arts</hi> that Antichriſtian Sea hath aſcended up to that ſuperlatiue height, wherein it now ſitts; ſo it ſhall looſe all, by the <hi>ſame</hi> or <hi>the like meanes.</hi> For whenſoever the world ſhall be ſo happie, as to haue an <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperour,</hi> who <hi>knowes</hi> his owne, and is <hi>able</hi> to diſcover, and recover <hi>Antichristian</hi> uſurpations, that ſuch a man, taking Henry the VIII. of England for a patterne, ſhall and may eaſily doe that in Germanie, and ſo conſequently in other places, which that <hi>Reſolute King,</hi> by the <hi>advice</hi> of the Lord Cromwell, and the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of Cardinall Wolſey, did in his owne dominions. viz.</p>
            <p>That King intending to <hi>diſſolue all Monaſteries,</hi> made a diviſion of part to the Nobles and Commons, from whence it firſt came, and ſo mette no oppoſition; The <hi>patterne</hi> was the Popes owne, who made Church-men Princes, and changed the title and name of thoſe Lands, which were often by them acquired, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ill arts, as if he could haue changed the nature thereof, and made them, what he called them <hi>spirituall.</hi> The King therefore did but <hi>reduce</hi> things backe to their right and former order. Here onely was the error of that worke; that the King did not reſtore the <hi>Tenths</hi> to the conſtant maintenance of the miniſterie; which portion, whether it now belong to the Church or no, <hi>jure divino,</hi> I intend not to diſpute <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con:</hi> But I dare ſay, <hi>Gods owne order</hi> hath manifeſted it to be both <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, beyond all old exceptions or new inventions, and ſo proues it to agree with the law of nature, if not to flow immediately from thence, deſerving therefore to liue after the honourable buriall of the <hi>ceremoniall Law,</hi> as it breathed long before it.</p>
            <p>Had theſe things been better ordered, and ſome Biſhopricks <hi>broken into leſſer pieces,</hi> ſo that they might haue been ſitte for <hi>honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burthens,</hi> but not too greate for the <hi>portage of one perſon,</hi> who laden with too much temporall honour and revenue, as men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrowne with fleſh and fatte, become unwealdie and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

burthens themſelues to the Church; then the undertaking had been abſolute.

ſomewhat finer.</p>
            <p>A ſpeedie and certaine preparation for this, is the <hi>diſcoverie of Antichriſt</hi>: and it is the duetie of all men therefore that <hi>can,</hi> to doe their beſt, according to their talents, in this ſubject; and amongſt others, this <hi>learned Author</hi> hath done much, and deſerues much in this reſpect of the Church. The Courſe he takes by Problemes to handle this controverſie, is not as if he doubted, or any other man neede to doubt of the trueth; but as it ſhould ſeeme, being <hi>no profeſt Churchman,</hi> he modeſtly diſputes the point, as a man that would learne himſelfe and others, by aſking queſtions wiſely; and withall inquiring, whether it can be imagined, that any man can be more like Antichriſt then the Pope is; he concludes <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,</hi> that <hi>none can</hi>; and plainely layes downe in everie Probleme the obſtinate abſurdities of ſuch, as looke for Antichriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he <hi>ſhall come,</hi> yet cannot now ſee him to <hi>be come</hi>; becauſe either he ſtands too neare them, as a beame in their eyes, and they are <hi>parte of him; bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh</hi>; or, they expect him, when he comes, to be ſo qualified for publique obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Church of Rome hath cunningly, and poetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him: <hi>But ſuch an Antichriſt they ſhall never ſee</hi>; for the church of Rome did ſo paint him in policie; not for the diſcloſing, but for the concealing, and clowding of his proper and perſonall appearance, and diverting the eyes of all men from beholding the right object. For my parte, meeting with this Booke in a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and ſeeing the profit it may bring to all, I could doe no leſſe, then be <hi>a midwife</hi> for the <hi>edition</hi> of this, ſince I am not able to be <hi>parent,</hi> for <hi>procreation of the like.</hi> And I haue taken the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes upon me, to dedicate it to no leſſe perſons, then to the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth, for it concernes them all eſpecially, aboue and more then others, to reade, and to underſtand this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, leaſt they ſhould be made drunke, or kept drunke; with the dregges of that <hi>abhominable cuppe of Inchantments,</hi> wherewith diverſe of their forefathers haue been <hi>intoxicated,</hi> and <hi>ſlept to death</hi>; and leaſt they ſhould under the <hi>appearance of Christianitse,</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſupport Antichriſtianiſme, and ſo thinking to doe Chriſt good ſervice, <hi>perſecute his poore members ignorantly.</hi> Beſides many of them haue ſuffred much from the hand of Antichriſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:16802:7"/>
his members. The <hi>Kings of France</hi> haue beene butchered by their inſtruments, and the kingdome put in Combuſtion, by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of the Roman Catholique league or partie. Our <hi>Queenes Father Henrie IIII. of renowmed memorie,</hi> muſt not be forgotten: his blood is yet too freſh upon their fingers, to be hidden from her Majeſties eyes; except they force her weake ſexe (as they haue done manie of the maſculine gender) to winke; by threatning to dippe their fingers, as deepe in her bloud, (which the Lord forefend) if ſhe caſt an eye towards her Fathers Funerall, or ſo much as inquire whether or no, <hi>he dyed by age,</hi> or by ſome injurious and <hi>traiterous hand. Our Kings</hi> haue beene, and are ſtill, <hi>excommunicated, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, expoſed to ſlaughter,</hi> and <hi>depoſition</hi> by them.

            <p>And as it concerns Princes eſpecially, ſo it concerns others alſo, as much as their ſalvation may concerne them, to know <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Saviour, and Antichriſt the chiefe enimie of their Saviour, and of their Salvation, from each other; and therefore I haue dedicated it to all Chriſtians. But if any wonder, why in the Title of the Dedication, I uſe theſe words: <hi>To all Chriſtians Reformed and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,</hi> as if I contradicted my ſelfe, in calling the <hi>Romiſh profeſſors Chriſtians,</hi> which in other places I terme <hi>Antichriſtians</hi>: I anſwer that the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe could not be <hi>the Antichrist,</hi> except he were a <hi>Christian,</hi> and tooke upon him alſo to be the <hi>chiefe Chriſtian,</hi> in externall profeſſion.

            <p>All that I feare is, that both this worke, and my owne indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhall meete the greateſt diſcouragements from ſome of thoſe, that ſhould protect and countenance us: who eyther from <hi>error of judgment,</hi> deny the Pope to be Antichriſt, and yet <hi>ſeparate from him</hi> (at which I wonder) or elſe out of <hi>humane wiſedome and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> ſeeme ſtill to be in doubt, and will not be reſolved, as fearing a diminution of their worldly greatneſſe and glorie, if this truth ſhould be generally acknowledged. Becauſe they ſuppoſe <hi>much</hi> of their <hi>authoritie</hi> would be found to be built upon the <hi>ſandie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Antichriſtian uſurpations.</hi> But ſhall we looſe heauen for earth? or looke ſo low, as to bring <hi>temporall</hi> reſpects into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with <hi>eternall?</hi> Can there be no proviſion for upholding the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>countenance</hi> of the Clergie, from <hi>common contempt,</hi> and for the <hi>incouraging</hi> and <hi>rewarding</hi> of learning, but what Antichriſt invents to uphold himſelfe withall?

            <p>And now to conclude, how much are we to magnifie the Lord for our <hi>King, Nobles, Cleargie,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> mette together lately in the high Court of Parliament, and there ſo well according, for matter of Religion, that the <hi>Subiect</hi> no ſooner ſhewed his grievance with complaint, but the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> applied the remedie with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.

<pb facs="tcp:16802:9"/>
that our Cleargie did not ſeeke themſelues, but Chriſt; as now it is our <hi>ſhame,</hi> that whileſt the Romiſh Cleargie haue conquered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries for Antichriſt, in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, we ſhould neglect a <hi>neighbour countrie, long in our poſſeſſion,</hi> ſuffering them ſtill to liue in ſpirituall captivitie, under the hands of <hi>ignorance, Idolatrie, darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>death.</hi> But now we haue better hope, ſeeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement of the Fathers to their brethren, and doubt not, but that will be effected there, which hath been performed in England and Scotland heretofore, by the <hi>conſcionable, plaine, painfull,</hi> and <hi>powerfull</hi> preaching of the Goſpell; whileſt men are not diſtracted, nor their hearts alienated from each other, by domeſtick contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.

Truly <hi>Lipſius</hi> (out of <hi>Martinus Polonus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>) ſayth, the walles of Rome were firſt xlij. miles in compaſſe, and out of <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">de magnitud. Rom.

the walles of old Babylon were 160 <hi>ſtadia</hi> on everie ſide ſquare: but note, that Babylon was all within the walles, and ſo Rome in reſpect of her ſuburbs &amp; buildings adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was much greater, as by this teſtimonie of <hi>Lipſius</hi> out of <hi>Dioniſ.</hi> appeareth. Might not this then well be called <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, in reſpect of the other?</p>
               <p>But heare what Pliny ſaith both of Babylon and Rome. Of Babylon firſt he ſayth,<note place="margin">Plin. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

               <p>THE next thing after the place, which offereth it ſelf to our ſenſes and conſideration, ſeemeth to be the ſubject, or bodie without which no Accident can conſiſt, and therefore uſed in the definition of Accidents, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relatiues, which cannot be without their Correlatiues: as a father cannot be ſo called, but in reſpect of his ſonne, nor a Monarch or king, but in reſpect of his monarchie, kingdome, or ſtate Politike ſubject unto him And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be proportionable, as we ſaid before of Relatiues. For as great things muſt haue great places; ſo a great and mightie Monarch, muſt haue a great ſtate under him: And as by the greatnes of the place we may meaſure the body: ſo by the greatnes of the ſtate ſubject to any Prince, we judge of the greatnes &amp; power of the Prince himſelf. We haue ſeene alreadie a great place appointed for Antichriſt; Let us now ſee the greatnes of the ſtate and bodie politike that muſt be ſubject unto him and ſupport him. And this alſo hath not been neglected in the H. Scriptures; but is ſet forth, and deſcribed in divers places, eſpecially three, as the beſt Interpreters do obſerue, which alſo do concurre, and haue good correſpondence with the prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his place aboue ſpecified. Firſt in the ſeuenth chap. of the prophet Daniel. Secondly the 13 ch. of the Rev. And thirdly, the 17 ch. of the Rev. which places agree in ſome things, and differ in others, and that agreement and thoſe differences, together with the reaſons thereof deſerue to be narrowly ſifted.</p>
               <p>Firſt in Daniell we finde a great and terrible Beaſt with ten hornes, and amongſt the reſt a litle horne riſing up, &amp;c. In the 13 of the Rev. we fynd two beaſts, one riſing <hi>è mari</hi> out of the Sea, as all the beaſts in Daniel, with tenne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16802:33"/>
hornes &amp;c. the other riſing <hi>e Terra.</hi> In the 17 chap. of the Rev. we fynde a great beaſt with ten hornes, and a whore ſitting on his back. Let us firſt conſider of the deſcription of this great beaſt riſing out of the ſea, in the 13 ch. of the Rev. where he ſeemeth to be moſt fully ſet forth poſitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after comparatiuely. Here therefore the great beaſt riſing out of the ſea is deſcribed firſt, in his exiſtence or parts. Secondly, in his power &amp; actions. For his exiſtence and parts, it is firſt ſaid to be a beaſt, riſing out of the ſea. Secondly, having ſeauen heads. Thirdly, ten hornes crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Fourthly, upon his heads were names of blaſphemie. Fiftly, his bodie like a Leopard. Sixtly, his feet like a beare. And ſeuenthly, his mouth like a Lion. For his power and actions it is ſaid. 1, that the dragon gaue him his power, and his throne, and great authoritie. 2, That one of his heads was wounded, as it were to death, but his deadly wound was cured. 3, All the world wondered after the beaſt, and worſhiped the Dragon, which gaue power to the beaſt, and worſhiped the beaſt, ſaying, Who is like to the beaſt? Who is able to make warre with him? 4, There was giuen him a mouth to ſpeak great things and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 5, Power was given to him to doe and continue two and fortie months. 6, He opened his mouth in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie againſt God, to blaſpheame his name and his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and them that dwell in heauen. 7, And it was giuen to him, to make warre with the ſaints, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, and power was giuen him over all kindreds tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon earth ſhall worſhip him whoſe names are not written in the Book of Life, and Loe here a ſtrange and mightie beaſt. Now what is meant by the name of a beaſt riſing out of the ſea, the prophet Daniell telleth us. For he ſaith plainly,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 7, 23.</note> that it ſignifyeth <hi>a kingdome riſing upon the earth. And the fourth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16802:34"/>
Beaſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the fourth kingdome.</hi> Which ſeemeth to be the ſame that is here ſpoken of. The prophet Ezechiel uſeth the ſame phraſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezce.</hi> 19, <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.</note> ſaying. <hi>Wherefore laye thy mother as a Lyoneſſe among the Lyons? &amp;c.</hi> And againe, the <hi>great Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, &amp;c.</hi> Now if this be a kingdome, which is ſpoken of by our Euangeliſt, of neceſſitie it muſt be ſome verie great and mightie kingdome, for ſo it appeareth by all parts of the deſcription, eſpecially where it is ſaid, <hi>that all the world wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

I aſk then, what kingdome or Empire can be underſtood in this place? Surely he that will ſay that this beaſt here, and the beaſt in the 17 chap. do ſignifie any other kingdom beſide Rome, muſt produce ſome other great Empire, to whom the ſeaven heads, and the other attributes there given unto it, may be applied, aſwell as to the Roman, which no man yet could ever do. Let us therefore ſee the deſcription of this mightie Empire comparatiue, and wherein it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or differ from that which is deſcribed by the Prophet Daniel, and by this our Euangeliſt in the 17 ch. <hi>The fourth Beaſt</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>comming out of the ſea, was fearfull and terrible, and verie ſtrong. It had great Iron teeth, it devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and brake in peeces, and ſtamped the reſidue under his feet, it was unlike the other beaſts, for it had ten horns, &amp; there came up among them another little horne, before whom three of the firſt hornes were plucked away, and in this horne were eyes like a man, and a mouth ſpeaking preſumptuous things. And this fourth beaſt ſhall be the fourth kingdome, and ſhall be unlike to all kingdomes, and ſhall devour the whole earth, and tread it downe, and breake it in peeces, and the teene hornes out of this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16802:34"/>
kingdome are ten kings, and another ſhall ariſe after them, and he ſhall be unlike the firſt, and ſhall ſubdue three kings. And ſhall ſpeak words against the Moſt High, and think that he may change times and lawes, and they ſhall be given into his hands untill a time, times, and half a time. But the judgment ſhal ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume and deſtroy it unto the end.</hi>

               <p>Now let us ſee the ſingularityes wherein every one of theſe three propheſies differeth from the other, and conſider whether they alſo do not properly belong to Rome. The ſingularities in Daniel are ſuch, as being well conſidered ſeeme to declare unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was the intention of the Holy Ghoſt not onely to repreſent unto us the Roman Empire and therein Antichriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre of: But to ſhew us alſo a Type of Antichriſtian impiety in Antiochus, that was then to come neare at hand (both being enemies to the Church, it could not be, but that one ſhould be like the other in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.) And in the Roman Empire alſo: to note that State wherein it ſtood before the Caeſars, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tempereth his words ſomtimes more ſignificantly to expreſſe the truth, ſometimes more properly to ſhadow the Type.

                  <hi>thou haſt broken down all his wals &amp;c.</hi> So God in pronouncing his judgment upon the Serpent uſeth theſe words moſt ſignificantly, to foreſhew that our Saviour ſhould overcom the Divel. <hi>The Seed of the woman ſhall breake the Serpents head.</hi> yet theſe words in the ſame place, <hi>upon thy belly ſhalt thou goe, and duſt ſhalt thou eate,</hi> ſeeme more proper to the materiall ſerpent.</p>
               <p>So it ſeemes in this propheſy, Daniel though he ſpeak principally of the fourth great kingdom more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than any of the reſt, which was the Roman; yet he inter-laceth ſomewhat concerning Antiochus the Type being though not a Roman, yet an enemie of the ſaincts: but more applyable to Antichriſt the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, as may appeare by theſe ſeven particulars or ſingularities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he doth not reſemble this fourth kingdom to any beaſt as he did the <hi>firſt to a Lyon.</hi> The ſecond to <hi>a Beare.</hi> The third to <hi>a Leopard.</hi> but of this he doth not ſhew of what certaine form or ſhape it was, <hi>but onely that it was unlike to the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mer,</hi> &amp; <hi>moſt ſtrong &amp; terrible,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I aſk how this can poſſibly be applyed to Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus who had but a peece of Alexanders Empire; and whether it do not lively expreſſe unto us the <hi>Roman ſtate,</hi> before it was ſetled in the Caeſars: when it had gott the Monarchie of the world, as Polyb affirmeth, &amp; yet had no certain form of government, but was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ruled by Conſuls, ſometimes by Dictators, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Senate; ſomtimes by the People; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Opimates &amp; Patritii, &amp; ſometimes by the turbulent Tribunes and ſeditious multitude? But in the time of S. Iohn this Empire was grown to a certain, though a monſterous form under the Caeſars: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee it by him more certainly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:16802:37"/>The ſecond ſingularitie in Daniel is, that it is ſayd to haue <hi>ten hornes,</hi> which are not here ſaid to be <hi>crowned,</hi> as they in the Revelations. And this much more properly ſignifieth the kings ſubject to the Roman ſtate, who made kings their miniſters and ſervants, then to the Selucidan Princes, which were abſolute kings, crowned, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging no Superiour. But in the Revelation, theſe things ſignifyed by the name of <hi>hornes,</hi> are ſaid to haue <hi>crownes,</hi> &amp; by certaine notes diſtinguiſhed from the other. Whereof hereafter.</p>
               <p>The third ſingularitie in Daniel is that <hi>among theſe kings there aroſe another unlike the first.</hi> And this ſeemeth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure Antichriſt, whoſe kingdome is indeed moſt unlike to any of the other kings, &amp; can not be applied to Antiochus.</p>
               <p>The fourth note in Daniel is, that before this <hi>litle Horne or king three other kings were plucked away,</hi> which by ſome Interpreters is very hardly drawen to Antiochus, but if we conſider the Roman Antichriſt, it will appear to be eaſily applied, and truly fulfilled. For it is manifeſt that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans draue firſt the Grecian Empires, ſecondly the French, and thirdly the Germans out of Rome, and Italy, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. So thoſe <hi>three kings were plucked away,</hi> to make roome for <hi>this little horne.</hi> As for the <hi>Exarch of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> which was but the Emperors Vice-Roy, I cannot afford him the qualitie or title of a king; and for the Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards they never ſetled their ſtate in Rome.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſingularitie in Daniel is, that this <hi>king coming up laſt, ſpake preſumptuous words and blaſphemies.</hi> And this I call a ſingularitie in Daniel. For although blaſphemie is attributed to this beaſt by S. Iohn alſo, yet here it is ſayd onely to <hi>be in his words,</hi> but by S. Iohn <hi>in his names.</hi> Now this was fulfilled in Antiochus, &amp; much more it is in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, as it is noted in the Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:16802:37"/>The ſixt ſingularitie is, that this little horne ſhall deſtroy the ſaints, and faithfull ſervants of God, and this was partly done by Antiochus, but much more prophecied and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Antichriſt: of whom it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.</note> that <hi>he ſhall make warre with the Saints, and overcome them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeuenth is, that this <hi>little horne ſhall thinke to change times and lawes,</hi> things which God hath ſpecially reſerved to himſelf. Litle of this doe we read to be done by Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, and indeed in ſuch things what could one man doe? <hi>Lawes</hi> can verie hardly be changed in a ſhort time: but to alter <hi>times</hi> in a ſhort time is impoſſible. But this is verified fully in the Roman Antichriſt, as ſhal be ſhewed hereafter.<note place="margin">

But it is the opinion of the beſt &amp; ſoundeſt Interpreters,<note place="margin">Our most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learned Soverain king Iames holdeth this opinion in Ep. Admonit. So Napier in Apo.

As it may be theſe <hi>Graecia, Germania, Gallia, Brittania, Aſturia</hi> or <hi>Leon.</hi> Whereunto now is joyned <hi>Spaine, Pannonia</hi> or <hi>Hungaria, Polonia, Suetia, Dania,</hi> and <hi>Norvegia.</hi> Greece, you may ſay, was before. True, as a Roman Province, but upon the tranſlation of the ſtate it became a Monarchie in it ſelf, which was not abſolute as long as the chief title was giuen to Rome. Now if this be ſo, when ſhall we ſee this performed, if it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie? When we ſee that all theſe great Princes of Chriſtendome heretofore did yeeld their authoritie &amp; power to the <hi>Roman Pontifex.</hi> And now, many of them haue forſaken him, as <hi>England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and others of Germanie, A great parte of the <hi>Dutch, Swiſſes,</hi> and divers other, which are fallen away from Rome: <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> wavering, is it to be imagined that they will againe, giue their power &amp; authoritie to Rome, or ever come againe to giue their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to any other? Therefore I ſay, that this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16802:44"/>
is now fulfilled, or never to be expected. For if we conſider well the times forepaſt, we may ſee, that all the great kingdoms of Europe, which were before ſubject to the Roman Empire, did ariſe and begin to take upon them abſolute ſoveranitie, and power of the ſword, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the remoue and decay of the Roman Empire, which was the time foreſhewed for the revealing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. And did all giue their power and authoritie to the Roman Pontifex, they did all fight againſt Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in perſecuting the profeſſors of his word and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the incitement and inſtigation of the Pope.</p>
               <p>And all thoſe which are fallen from the Pope, haue been overcome by the ſcripture &amp; word of God, which is called the ſword of Chriſt Ieſus. If theſe things be ſo, then why ſhould we looke for any other accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Prophecies? or how ſhould we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they can be fulfilled, if not alreadie? Can it be denied, but all Chriſtian kings gaue their power and authoritie, and ſome gaue their lands and territories al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Rome? Conſtantine, they ſay, gaue to the Pope his diadem, with the pallace of Lateran, and imperiall ſeat. <hi>Arithpertus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Herebertus</hi> the Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard gaue the Cottia Alpes, wherein ſtandeth Genua.

All the Chriſtian kings of that part of Europe, which was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject heretofore to Rome, gaue him authoritie, and power to do what he lift in their kingdoms. Was ever the like done to any Monark, Prince, Potentate or Man heretofore? or may we expect, or looke for the like to

powerfull and mightie, as the efficient cauſe is alwaies bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more powerfull then the effect. Now in this kinde of Blaſphemie, I demand, who ever went beyond the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans? who not onely made many Gods, and commanded them to be worſhiped, but onely ſuch as were made by them, or received by the publike authoritie of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth or Senate, by pretence of which Law, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed our Saviour Chriſt, although recommended to the Senate by Tiberius,<note place="margin">Rival in Hiſt. Iud. Euſebius Tertull.</note> with a prerogatiue of his own voice, as ſome report. So then by the Lawes of the Romans they would haue ſuch Gods, as they made themſelues, &amp; would haue none other to be worſhiped. And whether this were not moſt horrible &amp; abhominable blaſphemie, I deſire to be anſwered. If it were, let us ſee how it was uſed in the old time, when Rome was Ethnick, and how it hath ben uſed ſince. In the Ethnike Rome none were made Gods, but by the Senate, as appeareth by the Law aforeſaid, and none were worſhiped as Gods, but <hi>publicè aſciti,</hi> ſuch as were publikely accepted. And the Senate made no Gods but their king Romulus, the murtherer of his brother, and the Caeſars, which were the heads of that fourth beaſt or Monarchie. But now in the time of Chriſtianitie, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are Canoniſed, and worſhiped by the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, namely, Munkes and Friers, Nunnes and Prieſts, as well as kings or princes, popes or patriarkes. So that now we may ſee the whole bodie of this Popiſh Empire full of names of blaſphemy. Again, do they not hold &amp; affirm, that everie prieſt and frier in celebrating the Maſſe, doth make God, and that a God to be worſhiped, as not onely the reall but the carnall body of our Lord, and the verie ſame that was borne of the virgin Marie?<note place="margin">See more of their blaſpemies in D.

If they be,

Yea, and did provide &amp; prepare this ſentence alſo to meet with his intelligence, becauſe this ſentence alſo is true, aſwell as the other. For out of whoſe mouth ſoever a truth doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it is not to be aſcribed to a mutable and mortall man that ſpake it, but to the immutable and eternall God that gaue it,<note place="margin">Vide August. in confeſ. l. <hi>12</hi>

But what hurt is it to me, if I thinke the meaning of the Prophet is not as another man thinketh it to be: ſo long as I make no other ſence of his words, then that which thou, the light of all true ſpeaking mindes hast approved to be true.

for ſo many yeares from the incarnation of our Lord, it muſt needs be, that they are long ſince expired, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the power and time of that firſt beaſt and Monarchie is long ſince ended. For to take them literally for three yeeres and an half, (as that godly Father, from whom I do not willingly diſſent) doth in another place li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the continuance of Antichriſt, upon the words, <hi>a time, two times, and a half</hi>: To take them I ſay literally, that is, for <hi>three yeeres and an half,</hi> I thinke to all that haue eyther read or heard of their actions, will ſeem to favour of much miſtaking, I might ſay of much ignorance, but that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that good Father, who had not then the help and light, which we now haue, makes me forbeare other mens affected, and obſtinate, and wilfull blindnes in this point, which deſerveth the whipping poſt. But of this more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Let us come therefore to the ſixth note, which is of his <hi>Blaſphemie againſt God and his Church.</hi> But of this I neede not ſpeak any more, having ſaid ſo much alreadie.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth is of <hi>his warres againſt the Saints,</hi> whereof alſo I need ſpeak but little, ſeeing the ſaid ten horrible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and many others, ſtirred up by the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors againſt the godly chriſtians of the primitiue church, are notorious and known to all men, and never the like to be found in any kingdome or nation whatſoever, no not under the Turkes. But I proceed, this <hi>Beaſt</hi> or Empire <hi>had power over all nations.</hi> As to giue inſtance, but in one, we may read of Diocleſian, that within a verie ſhort time, he obteyned mightie and great victories in all parts of the world then known, namely in Africk over Egypt, in Aſia over Perſia, in Europe over France and Brittanie.

                  <hi>why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutest thou me?</hi> Now according to theſe different accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe two words, let us conſider of the word <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and to whom it may be applied. And firſt for the name of Vicarſhip. The <hi>Pontifex max.</hi> of Rome who is the ſeauenth head or king of the Roman ſtate, and confeſſeth and profeſſeth himſelf to be head &amp; Governour of Rome, he alſo confeſſeth, and profeſſeth himſelf to be the Vicar of Chriſt, and of God, and in this ſenſe the name agreeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and ſo his advocates and followers affirme him to be. But as the word Antichriſt ſignifieth an enimie to Chriſt, it is by them all ſtoutly denied, that the Pope is that Antichriſt. Let us come therefore to the touch, that is the text where Antichriſt is named, and thereby learne, how the word is to be underſtood. The firſt place where it is expreſly named, is in this our Apoſtle S. Iohn: <hi>Who is a lyer</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>but he that denyeth that Ieſus is the Chriſt,</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16802:50"/>
there it is to be found, and that in a moſt excellent prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, though not the ſame in letters, yet the ſame in ſence and ſignification,<note place="margin">

Firſt, the rage and furie of the enemies. 2, their joyning together againſt God and Chriſt, and their intention to ſhake off the yoke of Chriſt Ieſus. 3, the providence of God for his church, ſitting in heauen, as in a watch-tower, watching over his enemies, &amp; laughing them to ſcorne. 4, the meanes which God uſeth to defend them, by ſetting Chriſt to raigne in his church. 5, the anoynting of our Saviour in his eternall generation, and arming him with regall and ſoveraigne power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all his enemies. 6, a loving and ſerious adviſe to all Princes and Rulers of the earth, to beware to whom they cleaue and adhere, either to Chriſt, or to his enimies.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16802:50"/>
Church, &amp; to be head thereof) of if we take the name <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for all that are anoynted, namely, kings, prophets and prieſts, he affirmeth himſelf to be ſuperiour and aboue them alſo: which is a ſpeciall note of Antichriſt, as S. Paul ſayth, <hi>He ſhall exalt himſelf aboue all that is called God, or that is worſhiped.</hi> Neither do I finde,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> that ever any Emperor, Prince, Prelate, or Potentate, but onely the Pope tooke upon him the names, either of <hi>Vicarius Dei,</hi> or <hi>Christi Generalis,</hi> or <hi>Caput eccleſiae catholicae,</hi> or to be <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eccleſiam catholicam,</hi> not the Emperors of Rome, not the Turke, nor any other. But the onely thing that they ſtand upon is, as I ſaid before, that he is not <hi>adverſarius Christi,</hi> perſonally, and therefore not Antichriſt. But how can this be? For Chriſt is in heauen, and Antichriſt for all his malice &amp; power cannot touch him there. Let us therefore examine the places of Scripture aforeſaid, where the name of Antichriſt is uſed, and we ſhall eaſily perceiue that the name of Chriſt cannot, neither ought to be taken for his perſon. For Chriſt cannot be found perſonally preſent upon earth: but either ſpiritually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his graces, or ſacramentally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or appellatiuely, as the name is communicated to others, or myſtically, as to the Church. So therefore muſt the name of Antichriſt be taken for an enimie to the graces, Sacraments or miniſters of Chriſt, and that not individually in one perſon, but ſpiritually in his works, or appellatiuely in ſucceſſion. For otherwiſe it can not expreſſe the true intention, or effect of the thing, for the Emphaſis, or principall force of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in all the places aforeſaid, reſteth upon the word Chriſt, that is Anointed: as in the firſt place, He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth our Saviour is the Anointed, he is Antichriſt:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2,</note> ſo in the ſecond and third places:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4,</note> He that denyeth that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16802:51"/>
Anointed Saviour is come into the world, is <hi>Antichrist.</hi> So in the Pſalme, The kings and princes ſet themſelues againſt the Lords Anointed. Now the ointment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Saviour was anointed, was the fulnes of the graces of the H. Ghoſt, as the ſcripture teſtifieth. 1, that he was full of grace.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.</note> 2, that he was full of truth. 3, that by himſelf he purged our ſinnes. 4, that he is made to us wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> 5, Iuſtification. 6, ſanctification. And 7, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. &amp; ſuch like. Now he that denieth theſe graces in our Saviour, and fighteth againſt thoſe that aſcribe theſe graces unto him, he or none muſt be the Antichriſt, for other warres againſt Chriſt, who ſitteth in heauen at the right hand of God cannot be made. Who then are thoſe, that ſend us to other Mediators and Interceſſors, namely to the virgin Marie, the Apoſtles, and Saints, to ſpeak and pray for us? if it be the Pope &amp; his followers, then I aske them, why or for what reaſon they will haue us ſo to do? if they do acknowledg our Saviour to be full of grace, why do they ſend us to others, if our ſinnes make us unworthie to goe to him, that calleth us to himſelf, how many we go to the virgin Marie, or the H. Apoſtles who do not call us? Is he not as full of grace that calleth us, as they that call us not? Is he not as eaſie to be intreated now in heauen, as he was upon earth, when he did not reject Marie Magdalen, that had ſeauen divels, the woman of Canaan, whom he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the name of a dog, nor the man poſſeſſed with a legion. Secondly, how do they acknowledg him to be full of truth, when they ſay, that his H. word doth not contain all truth, but it muſt be pieced out with the traditions, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and expoſitions of their Church? 3. How do they acknowledg him to be our wiſdome,<note place="margin">Scriptura ſeip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam exponit. Chriſ. &amp; Aug <hi>2</hi> Tim. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> when they will not haue his word to be ſufficient to interpret it ſelf, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us, &amp; make us perfect in all good works, but we muſt

reſort to the Church and receiue her judgment from the mouth of their Pope? 4, How do they acknowledge our Saviour Chriſt, by himſelf, to haue purged all our ſinnes, when they ſay, that we muſt ſatiſfie by good works in our life, and after our death we muſt go to Purgatorie? 5, How do they acknowledg him to be our juſtification, when they ſay, that we are juſtified before God by our good works, and not onely by faith in his death and paſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be written, <hi>if thou confeſse with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, and belieue in thy heart,</hi>

                  <hi>that God rayſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> 6, How do they confeſſe him to be our ſanctification, or that by one ſacrifice, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified, when as they teach, that there muſt be offered up dayly ſacrifices for us in the Maſſe? And laſtly, how do they accept him for their Redeemer, which affirm that our poenarie works,<note place="margin">Concil Trid. ſeſ <hi>14.</hi> Bellarm. de paenitent. l. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> truly &amp; properly do ſatiſfie God for the guilt of our puniſhment, which after the fault forgiuen, remaineth to be expiated? But theſe points, with many others which may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to proue that the Pope and his Church, if not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet by conſequence (which is equivalent) doth deny the fulnes of all graces to be in our Saviour Chriſt, I leaue to our learned Divines, of whom ſome haue urged theſe things alreadie, and others I doubt not, will proſecute them more at large hereafter. The ſumme of all this may be reduced to this Problem: <hi>Whether any may more properly be called Antichriſt, or may be called an adverſarie to Chriſt, then he that thus denieth the graces of our Saviour</hi>?</p>
               <p>Let us come to that which is not onely eaſie to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but evident to our ſenſes, which may be ſeen with our eyes, and felt with our hands. For if we take the name of Chriſt here, as he is in the ſacrament, who hath been a greater enimie to Chriſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Popes, one of them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16802:52"/>
poyſoning it, another caſting it into the fire, all chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adding or diminiſhing it? But take the name as it is communicated to Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets, and ſo Antichriſt to be an enimie to them, I demand, who hath in ſecret, (as Antichriſt muſt be deceiueable) been a greater enimie to all chriſtian kings and Princes, then the Popes, ſometimes incenſing them to fight with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Saracens abroad, as de did Godfry of Bulleyn, &amp; many Princes with him, in the meane ſpace neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Chriſtian ſubjects at home: our king Richard the firſt, and the Emperor Frederike: ſometimes ſtirring up ſeditions and rebellions at home, as he did againſt the Emperor Henry the IIII. Henry the IIII. king of France, and Queen Elizabeth, ſometimes miniſtring oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to make wars betwixt themſelues, as Pope Iohn did by crowning another Emperor while the firſt was living; ſometimes, by giving away their kingdomes, as Navarre and England, ſometimes leaving them deſtitute of ſuccour, and open to the univerſall profeſſed enimie of all Chriſtians, the Turke, as they did the Grecian Emperors: ſometimes ſetting ſecret Traitors to murder them, and ſometimes procuring open enimies to invade them, ever excommunicating, curſing and interdicting one or other of them. Let the hiſtories of late times be peruſed, and ſee whether their ende and drift hath not been continually for theſe 900 yeeres and upwards, to maintaine and advance their own power, riches, juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and preeminence, by holding chriſtian princes alwaies obnoxious to them, and to make them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to keepe them under awe, by ſuch meanes as aforeſaid? So likewiſe for Prieſts and Prophets: is he not an adverſarie to all that will not ſubmit themſelues unto him? as namely to the Greek Church, and all the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16802:52"/>
biſhops and learned paſtors of the ſame, to the godly Valdenſes, Albigenſes, Wicklevites and others? Laſtly if we take the name of Chriſt here for his myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the Church, this is alſo a ſpeciall note of Antichriſt. For ſo it is plainly ſaid, that <hi>the woman was drunke with the bloud of Saints and Martyrs.</hi> And who hath ſhed more bloud of godly men, profeſſing the word of Chriſt Ieſus, then the Popes haue done for theſe laſt nine hundred yeares? I referre my ſelf to the hiſtories and Chronicles of thoſe times.<note place="margin">See Abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt. antich.</note> In that one warr which they cauſed Chriſtian Princes to undertake for Ieruſalem, under Godfry of Bollen, it is recorded, that there were ſlayn two thouſand millions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. In Merindall, Cabriers and other places held by the poore Valdois, they murdered all, men, women, and ſucking children. In the Maſſacre of France Anno 1572 within eight daies were murdered a hundred thouſand, beſide many other at other times, in England and elſe where. So that howſoever we take the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, either, as Vicar to Chriſt, or as adverſarie, eyther denying his graces, or ſuppreſſing his Liuetenants and miniſters, or perſecuting his members; I finde this name moſt agreeable to Rome: and I demand, <hi>Whether it can be ſo well applied unto any other?</hi> But here will be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me a queſtion, how this name <hi>Ho Antichriſtos</hi> that Antichriſt (as they expound the Greeke Article, which they would perſwade, is to be underſtood of one man) can be applied to a ſucceſſion of men, eſpecially, ſeeing ſome of the Fathers ſeeme to ſpeake of him, but as one man?

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16802:53"/>
ſometimes <hi>populariter,</hi> as others do affirm. This queſtion concerning Antichriſt, was not appointed for them, but for us, upon whom it muſt needs be confeſſed, that the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ends of the world are fallen, neither did they much labour in it. And yet we ſee not all of them runne in one ſtraine. Hilarie ſeemeth to ſpeak more largely. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth the judgment of the Scriptures, <hi>Antichriſtus eſt.</hi> Chryſoft. <hi>in opere imperfecto</hi> doth not reſtraine himſelf to one man: but we (ſayth he) <hi>videmus abominationem deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis jam ſtantem in loco ſancto, id eſt, populum Antichriſti in locis eccleſiae.</hi> and yet confeſſeth that Antichriſt muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end. Let the whole place be conſidered. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, it can not be ſaid, that this queſtion was ſo well ventilated in thoſe times, as it hath been of late. Then for anſwer I demand, what, or how much, the queſtion will be altered if the Pope be acknowledged to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, though he be not proved to be that Antichriſt? what difference will it make in the end? Muſt not all true Chriſtians beware, avoide, &amp; deteſt everie Antichriſt? But to the point. It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly known in Grammer ſchooles, that this particle, <hi>Ho,</hi> in Greeke, is not alwayes uſed ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly; nor in a ſignificant uſe, is it alwaies taken to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a particular and individuall perſon; nor yet in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars is it alwaies uſed to note Eminence or ſingularitie. Sometimes, and that verie frequent it is uſed indefinitely; many times it is joyned with a name of multitude, or with a name of ſucceſſion. He that hath any knowledge in the Tongues may eaſily obſerue, that <hi>Ho,</hi> in Greeke, is not ſo Emphaticall as <hi>Ha,</hi> in Hebrew, or <hi>the,</hi> in Engliſh, which yet is ſometimes emphaticall, and ſometimes not.

Yet if any will not take this for a ſufficient anſwer, let him well conſider, how he can anſwer the problems following, by which I thinke it will appeare, that the Pope is not onely an Antichriſt, but euen that Antichriſt, whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Prophecies can be verified of none but of him, and that not of one alone, but of the whole ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore, to proceede to the Names, I deſire the Reader to examine, whether any of the ſix names that I ſhall now produce, do not fully agree to the Pope, and to all the Popes that haue bèen in Rome, ſince the time of Pope Conſtantine: and if theſe names do agree, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>How it can be denied, but that they, and everie one of them, is</hi> Ho Antichriſtos, <hi>that Antichriſt?</hi>

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:16802:55"/>
Againe I aſke, whether thou doſt not in this name uſurpe the rights of our Saviour, and ſo alſo declare thy ſelf to be his enimie? When the valiant King Edward the third, of England, intended warr againſt Phillip the French King, he proclaymed himſelf King of France, &amp; that was the beginning of the warr, &amp; ſo everie Prince taketh it for a denuntiation of war, when his neighbour Prince taketh his title. And ſhall not we ſay, that this is a publike proclamation of war, by the Pope againſt our Saviour Chriſt, when he taketh upon him the ſtile of <hi>Pont. Max.</hi> that properly belongeth to our Saviour, and was never giuen truly to any man, but to him? yea doth he not exalt himſelf aboue Chriſt? For Chriſt did not take it to himſelf, but received it of his Father. But the Pope taketh it to himſelf, without the gift of any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were of Phocas the Murtherer, of whom we ſhall ſpeake hereafter. Neyther yet doth he onely take this title to himſelf, but other titles alſo not inferiour, as <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> and <hi>ſponſus eccleſiae,</hi> &amp;:c. which onely belong to our Saviour. I demand further, whom doth he follow in this title? Doth he follow Melchiſedek, or Aaron? They were both called High Prieſts, and they were indeede Types of our Saviour Chriſt, (the onely true High-Prieſt) and ordeined by God for certeine ſignes that he ſhould come, and ſo had a lawfull calling. But when the truth was come, then all types were aboliſhed, yea and they alſo are aboliſhed from Chriſt, &amp; fallen from grace, whoſoever do uſe them. Whereupon the godly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do affirme, that the Céremonies of the Law are now not onely <hi>mortuae,</hi> but <hi>mortiferae,</hi> not onely in uſe dead, but to be uſed deadly. And the reaſon is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for that whoſoever doth uſe them, doth deny that our Saviour is come in the fleſh, namely, by uſing thoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16802:55"/>

But the Pope uſing the title of High Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> or of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> doth uſe a Ceremonie, inſtituted to ſhew that Chriſt was not come in the fleſh, but was to be expected: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I aſke, <hi>Whether he doth not denye that Chriſt Ieſus is come in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon, becauſe Chriſt is God eternall, who can haue no ſucceſſor in his offices, and therefore he that will take upon him to ſucceed Chriſt, doth deny his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as he that will be his Vicar, by pretence of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Well, if the Pope can ſhew no calling, then I aſk, by what example or precedent? if it were a title lawfull to be uſed, why did none of the Apoſtles nor of the Diſciples uſe it? not <hi>Tuus,</hi> not <hi>Timothie,</hi> not <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi> not <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of our Lord, Biſhop of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the counſell of the Apoſtles, nor yet our Apoſtle S. Iohn, which outlived all the reſt, and therefore might beſt do it. In a word, I finde none to whom this title of <hi>Summus,</hi> or <hi>Maximus Pontifex</hi> hath any wayes ben applied, but either <hi>Melchiſedek,</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> or to our Saviour Chriſt: nor any that hath taken it upon them by humain authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but onely the Idolatrous <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> that was in Rome, of whom I haue ſpoken before. And if the Pope cannot juſtifie his higheſt and greateſt Pontificalitie, by ſome title from one or other of the three firſt, it will fall out inevitable, that he is the true and undoubted ſucceſſor of the laſt. And that is moſt conſonant and agreeable to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16802:56"/>
the words of our prophecie, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould be <hi>one of the ſeauen heads of Rome,</hi> and namely that head of whom S. Iohn ſayth, <hi>He was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> as is before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Probl</hi> 2.</note> The ſame alſo may be proved by his name Papa, whereof divers haue made divers derivations, but for my part I thinke none more probable, then to ſay it cometh from one of the titles, uſed or uſurped by the old Roman Emperors, which upon their coines were wont to ſtampe <hi>Pa. Pa.</hi> for <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and now the Roman Prelate, as he ſucceedeth them in the name of <hi>Pont. Maximus,</hi> ſo he taketh that title of <hi>Papa</hi> likewiſe, to proue himſelf their undoubted Succeſſor. I will not therefore ſtand here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confute their pretence and claime, to be <hi>Vicarius Chriſti,</hi> although I might ſay. that it cannot ſtand with the <hi>celſitude of a Pontifex max.</hi> to be but a Vicar, neither can a Vicar diſpenſe with the lawes of his ſuperiour: nor will I anſwer to, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> and ſuch like, which haue been ſo many times anſwered by our learned divines, neither do I think my ſelf bound to refute the immoderate titles giuen to the Pope by S. Barnard, or other late Doctors, a pointe of this weight is not to be carried away with ſwelling phraſes of Rhetorick, but by evident teſtimonies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth. Certain it is that he who ſaid <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> never ſayd <hi>Tu eris Pontifex Maximus,</hi> nor <hi>Tu eris meus vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſost.</note> no nor <hi>ſuper hunc Petrum aedificabo &amp;c.</hi> neither did he giue any keyes to him, more then to the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. But if I may ſpeak my opinion, this name <hi>Pontifex max.</hi> is the verie name of blaſphemie written in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of that purple whore, euen that Antichriſt. &amp;c. So much therefore be ſpoken of this name of <hi>Pontifex Max.</hi> which the Pope taketh to himſelf. A third title is <hi>Servus ſervorum Dei.</hi> This attribute the Pope alſo, and he alone accepteth, acknowledgeth and uſeth it. But this title was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16802:56"/>
never giuen to any, but by the godly prophet and patriarch <hi>Noah,</hi> to the curſed <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe Father was the ſcorner of that godly patriarch, and his poſteritie the mortall eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our Saviour Chriſt in his Church of Iſraell, and ſo a type of Antichriſt, and therefore were commanded utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be deſtroyed, rooted out, and aboliſhed, as Antichriſt ſhall be. It will be ſaid, that the holy man S. Grigorie uſed this name. I will not deny but he was an holy man, and although a man ſubject to ſome errors and infimities, yet as I verily believ a Prophet. For he prophecied of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Antichriſt. <hi>It is the last houre</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the king of pride is at hand, an armie of Priests is prepared to attend him.</hi> But I know that the prophets by the inſtinct of Gods ſpirit did and ſaid many things, which were in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall, but in others would be abſurd &amp; inconvenient, as Eſaiah and Hoſea, naming their children with ſtrange names. Ezechiel lying many dayes upon one ſide, baking his bread in doung, and creeping out through a wall at noone, and ſuch like; or if theſe things be taken to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or parables, yet that cannot be denyed, that one of the prophets commanded another to ſtrike and wound him. Iacob was by an Angell called Iſrael, and Salomon was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a prophet. And who knoweth whether that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Biſhop Gregorie did take that name in humilitie, foreſeeing that his own ſucceſſors would uſe it in pride, &amp; as the king of pride? It might be a title holy in him, and yet accurſed in them, as the name of Iudah was bleſſed in the patriarch, and in one of the Apoſtles, but moſt accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Traitor. Theſe two names therefore uſed by the Pope, you ſee may well be applied to Antichriſt. Now wil I ſhew forth three other names giuen in the Scripture to Antichriſt, which may as well be applied to the Pope, whereof the firſt is <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> or <hi>the Lawleſſe one</hi>: for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16802:57"/>
word <hi>Anomos</hi> in Greeke doth ſignifie ſo properly, and the word <hi>Belial</hi> in the old Teſtament is near to the ſame effect. And in this, as in the reſt of the names that follow, it is worthie to be obſerved, that as the title of <hi>Summus Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex, Servus ſervorum,</hi> &amp; others, which the Pope doth take unto himſelf, and approue, do aptly agree to the types and deſcriptions of Antichriſt in the ſcripture, ſo likewiſe the titles giuen to Antichriſt in the ſcripture do moſt aptly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the actions and practiſes of the Popes, recorded in their owne Hiſtories. For inſtance, in this name of the <hi>man of ſinne,</hi> or <hi>the Lawleſſe man,</hi> what Monarch, prince, prelate, or potentate, did ever ſo much practiſe allow, and maintain open and notorious ſinnes, as the Popes do and haue done now for theſe many hundred years, by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, pardons, licences, and diſpenſations?

               <p>The ſeauenth and laſt name giuen to Antichriſt in Scripture, is that which is not expreſſed, but ſignified by three Greek letters, yeelding the number of 666. which to count the H.

Let everie man bring forth his opinion without prejudice to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and pray to God to inlighten us all. I, for my part, thinke it beſt to follow the ancient opinion ſo farr as it may ſtand with the Scriptures. Now it is knowne that the ancient godly Father Irenaeus ſeeking for names anſwerable to this number, findeth none ſo fit, as <hi>Lateinos.</hi> For although he mention other names, as <hi>Tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, &amp;c.</hi> yet to the name of <hi>Lateinos</hi> he addeth his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of approbation, ſaying that it is verie like to be the true name.

A woman cannot conceiue and beare in a moneth or a day. An Elephant muſt haue at leaſt two yeares, and ſome ſay ten. <hi>Quando,</hi> when, is a Relatiue, as well as <hi>ubi,</hi> where, &amp; everie thing exiſtent muſt haue his due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well of the one as of the other.</p>
               <p>Let us now then come to the riſing of this fifth Beaſt or monarchie of Idolatrie, and ſee how that is deſcribed in this divine Revelation, and whether that deſcription alſo do not moſt aptly and properly ſute the Popes, from the time that the impediment of the Roman Empire began to be removed by Conſtantine the Emperor, untill the Pope attained to his Antichriſtian name in Boniface the third, to be called Pontifex Maximus, and his ſuperlatiue power to reſiſt the Emperor in Conſtantine the Pope. This Riſing is deſcribed by ſeauen adjuncts. 1, His kinde or Exiſtence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>another beaſt.</hi> 2. The place from whence he came, <hi>comming out of the earth.</hi> 3, <hi>Having two hornes like a lambe.</hi> 4, <hi>He ſpake like the Dragon.</hi> 5, His actions, <hi>ſeauen fold,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter. 6, His <hi>Marke.</hi> 7, And laſtly <hi>his Name.</hi> Whereas he is called <hi>another beaſt,</hi> and yet not reſembled to any Beaſt, <hi>working in the preſence of the first,</hi> ſeauen things
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16802:64"/>
are again to be obſerved. 1, The time of his riſing. 2, That this which is here deſcribed muſt be an Empire or monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, which is ſignified by the <hi>name of a Beaſt,</hi> as all the former were, and as the Angell in Daniel hath taught us to interpret. 3, It muſt conſiſt, not of one <hi>particular man,</hi> but of <hi>a Succeſsion.</hi> For ſo all the former did, or elſe it ſhould not haue the name of a Beaſt, without diſtinction, as it hath, and as they had. 4, It is not <hi>like any of the reſt.</hi> For if it were like in any part, it would be ſo expreſſed, as it is ſaid that the firſt was like a Lyon, the ſecond like a beare, the third a Leopard, the fourth in ſeverall parts like everie one of them, but this like none of them. 5, It is not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to them, but it is of no certaine forme. And herein our Apoſtle in the deſcription of this laſt Beaſt obſerveth the ſame caution,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.</note> that was before by the Prophet Daniell, in the Deſcription of the fourth beaſt, ſaying, <hi>it was unlike any of the former,</hi> and yet not expreſſing whereunto it was like. So indeed was the Roman Empire in its Riſing, for that after the kings, who were <hi>as the nurſing Fathers of that ſtate</hi> were expelled, it held for a long time no certain form of government. So it ſeemeth our Propheticall Apoſtle intendeth, that the kingdome of Antichriſt in his Riſing, muſt be of an <hi>uncertaine forme.</hi> 6, It muſt ariſe <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the first beast.</hi> And this agreeth with the words of S. Paul,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> who ſayth not, <hi>that he which withholdeth muſt be aboliſhed, deſtroyed, determined, or ended,</hi> but that he <hi>muſt be removed, or ſet out of the way,</hi> in ſome other place. So this Beaſt, or Monarchie muſt ariſe after the Roman Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, <hi>not ended,</hi> (for ſayth Daniel, that fourth Beaſt or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie muſt continue till the judgment be ſet) but remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the way, from Rome, the place appointed for Antichriſt. 7, It muſt ſtill be <hi>a Beaſt,</hi> that is, <hi>a Monarchie of Idolatrie,</hi> as all the reſt were. Now let us ſee how, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16802:64"/>
to whom theſe Prophecies may be applied, wherein we muſt ſo goe forward, that we do not forget that which went before. By the former Problems I ſuppoſe it hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the <hi>place</hi> of Antichriſt muſt be the <hi>Great cittie Rome,</hi> and that in time of <hi>Chriſtianitie,</hi> that the <hi>State ſubject unto him,</hi> muſt be the <hi>ſtate of Rome,</hi> and that he muſt be <hi>Summui Pontifex,</hi> one of the <hi>ſeauen Heads of that state.</hi> In this part of his deſcription we may ſee not onely a further point revealed unto us, which is <hi>the time,</hi> and <hi>manner of his Riſing,</hi> but a further confirmation of thoſe former points. And firſt, for the <hi>time,</hi> a moſt materiall circumſtance to be conſidered, I demand, <hi>Whether it be not here ſufficiently and plainly expreſsed in the Text, that this ſecond beaſt muſt ariſe, while the former is yet in being, and that not altogether, but in tract of time: ſeeing it is ſayd, that he doth all that the firſt could do, in the preſence of the firſt, or before his face, and cauſeth the firſt Beaſt to be worſhipped?</hi> And <hi>ſeeing it is confeſſed,</hi> that the place of the <hi>first Beaſt was Rome,</hi> it muſt follow, that the <hi>place of the ſecond muſt be Rome,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>the ſecond muſt worke before the face of the firſt,</hi> and <hi>cauſe the firſt to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,</hi> it followeth evidently, that <hi>both theſe Beasts,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>firſt Beast departing,</hi> and <hi>the ſecond ariſing</hi> muſt be <hi>at one time in Rome.</hi> This therefore confirmeth that which hath been ſayd before concerning his place. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with the words of the Apoſtle to the Theſſ.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>Antichriſt muſt be deſtroyed by the brightnes of our Lords comming,</hi> is a ſtrong proof of his times, viz. that he muſt <hi>ariſe, before the Emperor be quite departed out of Rome, &amp; muſt continue to the end of the world,</hi> which cleerly overthroweth the opinions of all <hi>Demiſeptennians,</hi> and <hi>Ho Antichriſtians.</hi> For if he began then to work, and muſt be in Rome in the preſence of the firſt <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Old Empire,</hi> &amp; muſt continue till the <hi>comming againe of our Lord:</hi> How can it be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16802:65"/>
imagined, that he ſhould be but <hi>one man,</hi> or that he ſhould <hi>continue but three yeares &amp; a halfe,</hi> or that he is <hi>not yet come,</hi> or ſuch like dreames, &amp;c. Or let any man ſhew me with conſent of Scriptures, who beſides the <hi>old Roman Empire,</hi> can be meant by the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> who beſides <hi>Antichriſt</hi> can be <hi>meant by the ſecond?</hi> For to ſay, that theſe <hi>two beaſts</hi> are to be taken for <hi>one thing,</hi> is verie abſurd, and contrarie to the Text, which calleth the ſecond Beaſt, <hi>another.</hi> To ſay that by the <hi>firſt</hi> is meant <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> can hardly ſtand with the Text; for then what is meant by the <hi>ſecond?</hi> If you ſay <hi>his bodie or Clergie,</hi> how can that be admitted? when it is ſayd firſt, <hi>that it is another,</hi> therefore no part of the ſame: Alſo it <hi>riſeth from another place,</hi> viz. <hi>the Earth,</hi> whereas the firſt roſe from <hi>the ſea</hi>: Alſo it doth <hi>all thoſe things which the firſt Beaſt could do before his face</hi>: But that is verie abſurd to ſay, that the <hi>Body</hi> doth as much as the <hi>Head,</hi> or the <hi>Clergie,</hi> as the chief <hi>Prelate.</hi> By the ſame, or like reaſons are refelled the opinions of thoſe that take the firſt beaſt for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell. For how can that ſtand with the Text, <hi>that the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon gaue him his Throne, and great power, &amp;c.</hi> So the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe that take Antichriſt, or the firſt beaſt <hi>pro cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu impiorum,</hi> for the multitude of the wicked, may be refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Text. For then, why ſhould it be diſtinguiſhed into two ſeverall Beaſts, the one <hi>riſing after the other?</hi> and why ſhould there be ſo many <hi>ſeverall attributes</hi> applied unto it? Therefore not intending to ſtand long upon the refutation of other mens opinions, but following the counſell of the excellent learned Scholler of S. Paul,<note place="margin">Dion Ar.</note> to finde out that which may be moſt agreeable to the Text of the Scripture, and the Truth of Hiſtorie, I aſke <hi>whether this Prophecie of the riſing of Antichrist in this ſecond Beaſt, were not fully performed in the Roman Biſhops, who ſucceeded Silveſter from the yeare of our Lord,</hi> 313. <hi>untill the time of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16802:65"/>
Conſtantine the Pope, in anno</hi> 707? Was not the old Empire continued in Rome for the moſt part of that time? Were there not in Rome for the moſt part of that time, namely, untill the yeare of our Lord 540, Conſuls, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Imperiall power, and were elected and created with Heatheniſh and Idolatrous rites, and Auguries,<note place="margin">See Helviens Renſuerus &amp; other chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers.</note> as Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus aboue cited doth teſtifie? Were not the Emperors themſelues many times made Conſuls of Rome in that time? And yet were not the Idolatrous Stageplayes, with Beſtiall filthines, ſtill celebrated in Rome, as the ſame reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Godly Author, and not he alone, but the irrefu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Doctor S. Auguſtin witneſſeth:<note place="margin">De civ. Dei lib. <hi>1.</hi> ca. <hi>23.</hi> See alſo Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note> 
                  <hi>That peſtilent corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>did infect the ſoules of miſerable men with ſo great deformitie, that euen now, the cittie of Rome being ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, men poſſeſſed with that pestilence, flying from thence to Carthage, dayly play the mad men upon ſtages.</hi> And this wrote he about the year of our Lord 413, fully an hundred yeeres after Silveſter, and after that the cittie of Rome was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſtian Biſhops; agreeable to that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before out of Salvianus. Beſides, did not the Emperor Conſtantine and his ſucceſſors, for an hundred yeeres after him, reteyn the name of Pont Max.<note place="margin">Pleſſ. ex Zoſum &amp; Baron.</note> and uſe the Robes &amp; Ornaments? So then, here was the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in Idolatrie and Majeſtie. Yet notwithſtanding I thinke no Papiſt will deny, but that the Biſhops of Rome after Silveſter, had the Imperiall ſea, and exerciſed the ſame principalitie, and did the ſame things, which the Emperors or Conſuls were wont to doe. For ſo is their decree.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dist.</hi> 96.</note> And what elſe do they clayme or pretend by the Donation of Conſtantine, which they ſo ſtoutly maintayn, but that they had that power lawfully, which they exerciſed apparantly? And yet, this was not in any certaine form of government, or reſolute manner, but ſometimes by ſchiſme and faction,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16802:66"/>
and ſometimes by flatteries obteyning the conſent or connivence of the Emperors. When they ſaw the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors able to pleaſe or diſpleaſe, then by and by they were their good Lords and Maſters, and they cauſed men to worſhip them. But when they would get it by faction or otherwiſe, the Emperor was but a Cypher in Augrim. as appeareth by the Hiſtories and records of that time. Sometimes the Conſuls governed, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Exarches, and ſometimes the Roman Biſhops were oppoſed by other great Biſhops. So the <hi>Riſing of this ſecond beast</hi> was not altogether at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and this <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> in his Riſing was (as hath been ſayd) of an uncertaine forme. And this being ſo, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points will conſequently be confeſſed. For what can they deny? Will they deny that this principally, which the Biſhops of Rome held after Silveſter, was a Monarchie or ſtate governed by one onely at once? which is the ſecond point. or thirdly, will they denye that it went in ſucceſſion? Fourthly, will they ſay, that it was like to any of the former Beaſts? This being a ſtate Eccleſiaſtick, &amp; all the former Saecular? Fiftly, will they affirme that theſe Biſhops had any ſetled and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute forme of Soveranitie, during the time aforeſaid? Will they deny that they were at Rome in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Conſular and Imperiall Authoritie, or that they cauſed men to adore the Emperors? Seuenthly, or laſtly, will they deny the Teſtimonies of S. Auguſtin and Salvianus, that the Idolatrous Rites, Superſtitions, Auguries, &amp; Stage-playes were ſtill exerciſed at Rome? I will here ſet downe a ſhort, Catalogue of the Biſhops of Rome of thoſe times out of their owne Hiſtorians, and let it be ſhewed in which of theſe things they will differ from me, and whether it were not with great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16802:66"/>
contention and ſchiſme, that they got their ſupremacie?</p>

And yet pretending great humulitie and ſubjection to the Emperor, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the letters not onely of Vigilius to Anthinius, and other principall Heretikes, at the command of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,

but of Gregorie the Great alſo to Phocas the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. Yet by Schiſme and faction ſeeking to get the place, as oft as they could, without their conſent. See more at large of theſe things in that Booke of Philip Marnay. Where alſo you may reade what S. Hierom writeth of Rome in his time, expreſſely calling it <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whore.</hi> And telling them of their Riches, covetouſnes, lewdnes, and Lupercatia. <hi>There are the Trophees of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, there is the confeſsion of Ieſus Christ</hi> (ſayth he:) <hi>but there is alſo ambition and Tyrannie, which keep men back from doing good.</hi> Neyther he onely, but Marcellinus. I do not (ſayth he) marvail, conſidering the braverie of that cittie, that men ambitious of that place, ſet up their Reſt for the purchaſing of it. For having once aſpired thereunto, they are ſure to be inriched with the offrings of Ladies and Noblemen, &amp; to be carried in their coaches ſumptuouſly attyred, and ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent in their feaſtes, as paſseth any kings table. Many ſuch teſtimonies collected are to be read in the diſcourſe of that Learned Lord. But eſpecially is to be obſerved, what he hath diligently drawn out of Baronius, where he ſayth that Conſtantine in the 24 year of his raigne, ordeyned <hi>that the Biſhops of the Chriſtian Law ſhould from that time forward haue the ſame Priviledges, which the Idolatrous Prieſts had in time past.</hi> They had (ſayth he) their <hi>Rex Sacrificulus,</hi> and <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi> And who can think, that Conſtantine would long indure, that they ſhould exceed the Chriſtians in Pompe and glorie? So Baron. their Cardinall and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Annaliſt, yeeldeth unto us, &amp; freely confeſſeth a point of no ſmall moment, <hi>that this their Pontifex Maximus, who now is in Rome, ſucceedeth in priviledge, Pompe and glorie to the Heathen Pont. Max. which was before in Rome.</hi> Yet the ſame Baron. ſheweth alſo, that Conſtantine firſt tooke the name of Pont. Max. to himſelf, and giveth a reaſon for it,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16802:68"/>
namely that the Senate and people of Rome, thoſe that were, yet of the Heatheniſh faction, might not ſo eaſily be drawen to conſpire againſt the Chriſtian Emperors (<hi>was it not a verie Chriſtian policie think you?</hi>) And yet (ſayth he) <hi>the Pope had the power of ſupreame judge in all cauſes.</hi> So that this ſtandeth moſt conſonant with all Prophecies &amp; hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that theſe two Beaſts were at one time, both together in Rome, and that the new Pont. Max. of Rome hath the power of the Pagan Pontif. But that his power appeared very ſlowly, and that the <hi>Pontificall name</hi> in <hi>Temporall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was for a long time verie baſe and obſcure appeareth by the teſtimonie of the learned Guicciardin,<note place="margin">Guicc. l. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> and other Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I demand therefore, <hi>Whether we may not here ſee the manifeſt performance of this prophecie.</hi> I, <hi>Another Beast</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after the <hi>firſt in Rome,</hi> and <hi>in the preſence of the firſt.</hi> 2, Ariſing <hi>by degrees out of the earth,</hi> that is, out of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts and deſires of riches, luxurie, Pompe and pride,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <hi>Iames</hi> 3.</note> and alſo by earthly wiſedome ſtrife and envie. 3, Having <hi>two hornes</hi> indeed, that is, a power <hi>temporall &amp; ſpirituall,</hi> but ſhort and weake, and (as Guicciardin ſayth) obſcure and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inviſible, as the <hi>Hornes of a lambe.</hi> 4, <hi>Speaking like the Dragon,</hi> that is, contrarie to the Commandements of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.</note> as the Serpent did to our mother Eue: but equivocally, as Vigilius, whom Baron. himſelf calleth Antichriſt, did equivocate with Sylverius his Predeceſſor, and Theodora the Empreſſe. See the Hiſtorie in Platina. And divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them did flatter &amp; equivocate with the Emperors. The fifth conſideration therefore is of his <hi>Actions.</hi> The 6, of his <hi>works.</hi> And the 7, of his <hi>Name.</hi> But of his name I haue ſpoken before, and of his <hi>marke,</hi> I might referre the Reader to the writings of the Excellent Paraeus, Napier, &amp; Iunius upon the Apocalyps. But I cannot omit the greate and learned Archbiſhop Antonin. In ſumma where he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16802:69"/>
ſheweth that everie one that entreth into their Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders receiveth <hi>a Character,</hi>

                  </note> which he interpreteth, to be <hi>principale inſtrumentum ordinis.</hi> But in another place upon the place of the Apocalyps now in hand,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.</note> he expoundeth the Character of the Beaſt to be <hi>cultum Beſtiae,</hi> the <hi>worſhip of the Beaſt in his right hand</hi>; that is (ſayth he) <hi>in his ſpirituall works, as fasting, Almes, prayer, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>in his forehead,</hi> in <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance,</hi> at the leaſt, and <hi>in outward conformitie.</hi> We may alſo obſerue, that if we ſubſcribe to the opinion of Irenaeus, that the name of the beaſt is <hi>Latinus,</hi> this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all their prayers. But conſidering well, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the opinion of Napier with Antonin, &amp; both with the Text, I cannot chuſe but thinke, the Character is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed unto us in the ſuperſtitious uſe of the croſſe, which they make upon the forehead, or otherwiſe, with their right hands. But for his Actions, they are here ſomewhat largely ſet forth in this 13 chap. For firſt it is ſayd, <hi>that he exerciſeth all the power of the first Beaſt, before his face.</hi> So did the Popes before the Emperors, as I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Secondly, <hi>he cauſeth the earth and earthly minded men to worſhip the firſt beaſt.</hi> So did the Popes to the Emperors, while they were in power, and continued Pontifices Max. Thirdly, <hi>he doth great wonders making fire to come downe from heauen in the ſight of men.</hi> So the Popes in fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Excommunications out of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Heauen</hi> in this Apocalyps. Fourthly, he <hi>deceiveth men with theſe wonders.</hi> So the Popes, for they are but <hi>ignes fatui,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.</note> cauſeles curſes, and ſo forceleſſe. Fiftly, He ſayth <hi>to earthly men, that they ſhould make the image of the first beaſt.</hi> So the Popes in ſetting up another Pontificate, with like power to the firſt. Sixtly, it was <hi>permitted to him to giue a ſpirit to the image of the Beaſt, that he ſhould ſpeake.</hi> So do the Popes animate this image of the firſt Pontificate.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16802:69"/>
And ſeauenthly, to <hi>cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the image of the Beast ſhould be killed,</hi> Regall power of life &amp; death. And whether the Popes haue not exerciſed that power, let all men judge. What part or point then of this deſcription is not fully accompliſhed in the actions of the Popes aboue named? Is it not manifeſt, that the popes did exerciſe all the power and authoritie of the old Idolatrous Pont. Max. in Rome, before the Emperors face, who for a while held that title of Pont. Max. If we ſhould deny it, doth not Baronius himſelf affirme it? The power of the firſt Beaſt is ſayd to haue been <hi>in making warre with the Saints, and prevayling againſt them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.</note> and <hi>over everie kindred tongue and nation.</hi> And did not the Popes moſt ſtifly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, both with other Chriſtians, and with the godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Graecian and Eaſterne churches for appeales &amp; Supremacie, untill they had obteyned it? Did not Iulius enter into contention with the Orientall Biſhops, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them S. Athanaſius, and reprehend them for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Counſell without his leave to confute the Hereſie of Arrius? Did not Liberius excommunicate the ſame worthie Father and ſaint Athanaſius, which made the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father S. Hilarie ſo bitterly to cry out.<note place="margin">The Pope in his first riſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by S. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie.</note> 
                  <hi>Anathema to thee O Liberius, and all thy Companions. Anathema againe and againe to thee thou falſe hearted double dealing Liberius.</hi> Doth not S. Hierom complain of the ſenate of Phariſees, ſaying, <hi>that there was not ſo mean a ſcribe of that faction of Ignorance, but did conſpire againſt him, which made him to forſake Rome, and returne to Ieruſalem?</hi> Did not Celeſtinus ſeeke with force and armes to reſtore Antonius a Biſhop of Africa, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Biſhops of that countrie, amongſt whom were thoſe Excellent biſhops, Aurelius, Alipius, &amp; S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine? which cauſed that godly and learned Father ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie earneſtly to put him minde of the words of S. Peter,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16802:70"/>
                  <hi>that he ſhould not domineer over his Bretheren.</hi> And did not moſt of them contend with the Patriarchs of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople for Supremacie? What was all this but warring againſt the Saints? And when did theſe Contentions ceaſe, but when the Pope had prevailed againſt, &amp; got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Supremacie over all theſe Chriſtian Nations? And after he had ſubjugated all Biſhops, how they haue continually made warre againſt other godly Chriſtians, namely the Valdenſes, Albigenſes, Wicklevites, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, Bohemians, and others, everie man may read in the Hiſtories of theſe later times. Now if theſe things be ſo, <hi>How can theſe prophecies be otherwiſe fulfilled then they haue been in theſe Roman Biſhops? To whom elſe can they be applied, &amp; how may we expect any in time to come that may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe prophecies, if they be not alreadie?</hi> It is not amiſſe here a litle to ſtay our contemplation, and as far forth, as the Sunne of Righteouſnes, and moſt pure light of truth ſhall illumine our underſtanding, to ſearch out the cauſe, why the ſame bleſſed and all ſeeing ſpirit, to whom all times are preſent, would not onely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the four Monarchies, or Great Beaſts of Idolatrie by four ſeverall mettals: but alſo, why it pleaſed him to make choiſe of thoſe Mettals, viz. <hi>Gold, Silver, Braſſe, Iron,</hi> and none other, ſaue with the laſt there is mixed earth or clay. Although the Prophet Daniel hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed the chief &amp; principall reaſon, yet if we finde any other reaſon thereof, which is agreeable to the truth, and no way repugnant to that holy prophecie, I hope it will not ſeem unworthie of our conſideration. That the Babylonians, Perſians, Greekes and Romans were all Idolaters, is confeſſed, and therefore they were aptly joyned together in one Image. But why is this Image made of theſe ſeverall mettals? Surely ſomewhat
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16802:70"/>
may be found if we ſearch into it. He that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>us to ſeek,</hi> hath promiſed <hi>that we ſhall finde. Thou O King, art that Head of Gold,</hi>

(ſayth our Prophet) <hi>the Great Cittie that ruleth over the kings of the earth.</hi> Of ſome parts of which Deſcription I haue ſpoken before, both in the firſt and ſecond Problem. For which cauſe I ſhall not neede to ſpeak much here, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of ſuch things as haue not been touched before. And to ſpeake a word by the way of that which is moſt plain and evident, which is laſt mentioned, that it is called the <hi>Great cittie,</hi> by which name we commonly underſtand, the king, Prince, or Prelate thereof, as in the Prophecies againſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Iſraell, Babell, Ninive,</hi> we underſtand many times their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>principall men</hi>; and in our common ſpeech we call <hi>Prelates</hi> by the names of their <hi>Seas</hi>: as <hi>Canterburie, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Magunce, Trever, &amp;c.</hi> So here, by the moſt <hi>proper Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct</hi> we underſtand <hi>Rome,</hi> and by <hi>Rome</hi> her <hi>Prince, Prelate</hi> or <hi>Governour.</hi> It will be in vaine therefore to aſke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be hee, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt ſayth, <hi>this is he.</hi> But it will be (I thinke) worth our labour, to conſider, how theſe qualities may be applied to the chief Pontifex of Rome, and whether they may be applied to any other: And if to them alone, then whether to <hi>one more then to another</hi>: or to the <hi>whole ſucceſsion.</hi> Let us therefore peruſe them in order. The firſt qualitie is, <hi>The Great Whore.</hi> Whoredome in Scripture (as hath been ſayd) is underſtood ſometimes <hi>literally,</hi> for the corporall filthines: ſometimes <hi>myſtically,</hi> for the <hi>ſpirituall whoredome,</hi> which <hi>is Idolatrie.</hi> Now for this later it is evident, not onely by the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Salvianus, aboue recited, but of their own hiſtories, that the verie Heathen Idols continued undefaced in Rome, and worſhiped untill the time of Boniface the fourth, who having obteyned the Pantheon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Phocas did conſecrate that Temple to the honour of <hi>the Virgin Marie, and of all martyrs,</hi>

Now if he firſt <hi>caſt them out,</hi> then conſequently they remayned unto his time unremoved. And although S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie is ſayd by ſome Authors in a zeale to Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to haue broken &amp; defaced ſome of theſe diveliſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments, and that therefore Sabinian his Deacon, &amp; next Succeſſor, was ſo much offended with him, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to burne his bookes,<note place="margin">In vita Sabin.</note> yet Platina ſtiffely denyeth that either Gregorie did deface Images, or that, that was the cauſe of Sabinians malice againſt him, although he himſelf ſheweth no other cauſe for it. But howſoever it was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gregorie did ſo, or not ſo, yet both by the teſtimonie of Platina, and by the Action of Boniface, we may ſee that the Romans ſtill continued thoſe heathen abhominations. And no ſooner had Boniface, who ſucceeded next but one after Sabinian, caſt out the <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> but ſhortly after, they erected the <hi>Images of Saints,</hi> and commanded and compelled men to worſhip them,<note place="margin">about the yeer <hi>625.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; that with ſuch eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and furie of contention, that they deprived the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Emperors, and tooke from them all Italie, becauſe they reſiſted them, namely Leo, whom they called in ſcorne <hi>Iconomachus,</hi> that is, a fighter againſt Images. This worſhipping of Images was then, and ever ſince condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by godly men, and held to be direct Idolatrie, unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, whatſoever diſtinctions they pretend, which indeed are but Gloſſes of their ſchoolemen, and haue no ground nor evident proofe in the Scripture. For what Scripture warranteth us to giue the worſhip of <hi>Doulia</hi> to any Image or Saint whatſoever? I am ſure the Text in one place ſayth: <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue:</hi> where the word is the ſame that ſignifieth <hi>Doulia.</hi> What warrant haue we in Scripture to giue the ſame worſhip to the picture, Image, or Croſſe of Chriſt, that we giue to Chriſt Ieſus?

               <head>VII. Of the Times of Antichrist.</head>
               <p>ONE of the greateſt Arguments, that the Popiſh Advocates do inſiſt upon, to proue that their Pope is not Antichriſt, is this of the <hi>Times</hi>: wherein firſt they ſtifly mainteyne, that Antichriſt ſhall raigne but <hi>three yeares and an half,</hi> whereas the Pope hath raigned (ſay they) many hundred yeares. Marke here by the way, they confeſſe that he <hi>raigneth</hi> in Rome. Secondly, they hold that Antichriſt ſhall be but <hi>one man,</hi> and ſhall not come, <hi>untill ſhortly before the end of the world.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>Enoch and Elias muſt come before, or in his time.</hi> All which conceits are without any warrant of the Holy Scriptures, and haue been largely refuted by others, eſpecially by the excellent learned Robert Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat late Biſhop of Saleſburie. and for the two firſt, I haue ſayd before ſufficiently. Againſt the laſt I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but one queſtion, which ſhall be drawen out of the verie words of the Text.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.</note> For in the 11 chapter of the Revelation, where there is mention made of the two Prophets; whom they will haue to be <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> it is ſayd, <hi>that they ſhall be ſlayne by the Beaſt which commeth out of the bottomleſſe pitt,</hi> and not by the Beaſt which cometh out of the Earth. Now in the 13 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we finde <hi>two Beasts,</hi> the firſt aſcending out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> having feauen heads and ten hornes. Which is by the beſt Interpreters judged to be <hi>the Old Roman Empier, and

                  </gap> properly underſtood to be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, as hath been ſayd before. And in the 17 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it appeareth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.</note> that the firſt Beaſt, which hath the ſeuen Heads, is that which is ſayd to aſcend out of <hi>the Bottomleſſe pitt.</hi> I aſke then upon the Conference of theſe Texts together, <hi>How it can stand with theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to ſay that theſe two Prophets must be Enoch and Elias, &amp; ſhall be ſlayne by Antichrist, when as they must be ſlayne by the Roman Empire, and not by the ſecond Beaſt, nor by the Whore?</hi> and the Roman Empire muſt be removed before Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt be revealed. <hi>Iudicent Theologi.</hi> But theſe and ſuch like conceits of theirs being brought into the light, and appied to the flames of thoſe holy burning and ſhining Candles, the Prophets and Apoſtles, will eaſily diſſolue and melt away like ice before the Sunne. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever applieth himſelf with any heede and diligence to reade and marke the Scriptures, and compare them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, may ſoone perceiue that the bleſſed ſpirit of Trueth, <hi>who leadeth us into all Trueth,</hi> verie often, and verie largely ſpeaketh of the Times of Antichriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them with <hi>ſeauen remarkeable Conſiderations,</hi> whereof not one of them telleth us of <hi>Henoch and Elias,</hi> or that Antichriſt ſhall be but <hi>one man,</hi> or indure but <hi>three yeares and an half, &amp;c.</hi> But contrariwiſe repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto us long Periods and continuance of times. As to the Purpoſe: Firſt, that which we may call <hi>Praepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſitiones Materiae,</hi> which by the Apoſtle I thinke is called the <hi>working of the Mysterie of Iniquitie,</hi> and <hi>began in the Apoſtles time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> and muſt continue till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the Roman Empire, which was about three hundred yeares. The ſecond is the <hi>Removing of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,</hi> and the Riſing of Antichriſt, which in reaſon
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16802:83"/>
muſt follow, for <hi>ſublato impedimento emergit actio.</hi> And this not at an Inſtant, but at leaſt in 300 or 400 yeares more. For ſo long it was before the Empire was cleane removed out of Rome. The third is his <hi>Revelation</hi> not upon a ſodayne, but by degrees in long time, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Riſing. The <hi>fourth</hi> therefore <hi>is his Raigne</hi> more near to a Septingentan, then to a Demi-Septennian. The fifth is <hi>of the Signes of his times,</hi> and the manners of men in thoſe times, not incident to a ſhort time. The ſixth is of <hi>his decay and conſumption,</hi> not haſtie: and the ſeauenth of <hi>his finall end, and utter deſtruction</hi>; which muſt be <hi>by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming of our Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> So that the working of this myſterie, and the progreſſe thereof muſt be from the time of the Apoſtles unto the end of the world. And there is not one of theſe ſeauen Conſiderations but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſpoken of in the Scripture moſt of them verie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as ſhall appear by that which followeth: Whereupon I aſke, <hi>Whether it would not ſeeme verie vaine and unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not onely for the majeſtie of divine Truth, or dignitie of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike writings; but euen for the gravitie of a ſober man to ſpeake ſo often, or make ſuch incuications of things, that ſhould either come ſo late, or continue ſo ſmall a time.</hi> Therefore to ſpeak of the firſt conſideration, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This therefore may be well taken for a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Remoue of the one, and Riſing of the other, which was about the yeare of our Lord 327, and but a beginning.

This time falleth out ſo agreeable to the prophecies, on the one ſide, and to the events on the other, that it ſeemeth no doubt can be made, but that here begann the Remoue. For if we follow M. Foxes computation in the ſeverall times aboue mentioned, we ſhall finde that thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Notations of time, as they ſpeake but of one thing, that is, the perſecutions of the Church by the Roman Emperors: ſo they ſignifie but one time, namely two hundred, ninetie four yeares, the ende of which falling ſo certeyne in the dayes of Conſtantine, do ſhew that the beginning muſt be accounted from the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, in the yeare of Grace four and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or there abouts.</p>
               <p>For firſt, a thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore dayes,<note place="margin">Note this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of a time, two times, and half a time in ſeverall places ſeemeth to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie ſeverall times: for in Dan. <hi>7, 25, 26.</hi> it ſeemes to intend a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Secondly, three dayes and an halfe, or a time, two times, and halfe a time.

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:16802:88"/>Of the other ſide, if we account the beginning of theſe yeares to be certaine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</note> the continuance and end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will fall out evident. But by the twelfth chapter of the Revelation it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Dragon went out to perſecute the Church,</hi> when? After <hi>that our Saviour was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into heauen</hi>: ſo then reckoning theſe 294 yeares to beginne at the Aſcention of our Lord, we muſt adde the yeares of our Saviours life upon earth, which was about four and thirtie yeares, and it commeth fully to the yeare 328, about which time the ſaid great <hi>Nicene</hi> Counſell was celebrated. And ſo taking the beginning of our computation from the end of the perſecutions, in the time of Conſtantine, about the yeare of our Lord 328, and reckoning backwards 294 yeares, we come to the ſame yeare of grace 34, wherein was the Aſcention of our Lord. So that both wayes, whether that we expound the prophecie by the event, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the event by the prophecie, we are brought to the ſame yeare of our Lord 328. Now therefore, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was the holy Cittie troden under foot of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Now the Martyrs of God, which had ſo long time prophecied in ſackcloth, and were ſlayne, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine revived in their Doctrine.

haue ſhewed how it began, from the removing of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of the Roman Empire, in the dayes of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and increaſed more and more, untill it grew neare to this notable <hi>Epocha</hi> of 666, whereof both the precedents and conſequents are worthie to be obſerved. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the year 600 that great and vigilant Biſhop S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, obſerving the immoderate ambition and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was then for Primacie and Supremacie, between his Predeceſſor in Rome, and the Patriarch of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, out of a propheticall ſpirit, moved no doubt with grief of hart, to ſee ſuch things in the Church of Chriſt, made as it were a publike Proclamation of the comming of Antichriſt. <hi>Filioli noviſsima hora eſt, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Litle children, do you looke for the accompliſhment of the times of Antichriſt, or of thoſe 666 yeares? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould it is the laſt yeare of the laſt times, the laſt day of the laſt yeare, and the laſt hour of the laſt day, The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies are fulfilled, the king of Pride is at hand, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Prieſts is readie to attend him. What ſhall we ſay to this notable Proclamation, made by this great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Biſhop? Was it true or falſe? If falſe, then that great Biſhop was a falſe Prophet: if true, then is Antichriſt come into the world long agone, and the Pope muſt needs be he, for none elſe hath had Armies of Prieſts to attend him, neither doth S. Gregorie goe ſingle. For S. Barnard ſeconds him: <hi>Ministri Christi &amp;c. The ſervants of Christ now ſerue Antichriſt.</hi> And in another place: <hi>The Beaſt of the Apocalyps, ſpeaking blaſphemies, and warring againſt the Saints occupieth the chaire of Peter.</hi> But to returne to S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie. He writing to Iohn of Conſtantinople affirmeth, that <hi>whoſoever calleth himſelf Vniverſall Biſhop in his elation is the forerunner of Antichriſt.</hi> Was this alſo a true prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or did the holy man fayle in his predictions? if true,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16802:92"/>
then was Iohn of Conſtantinople the forerunner; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binian, or Boniface of Rome, who next called himſelf by that title,<note place="margin">Renſuer.</note> was Antichriſt himſelf. This firſt contention for Primacie began about the yeare 588, and continued till the Pope had gotten it to himſelfe. But that great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop did not fayle in theſe prophecies. For immediately after his death Sabinian was made Pope, a man of obſcure birth,<note place="margin">Platina.</note> and more obſcure in manners, and therefore might well be ſayd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.</note> to riſe out of the earth: And he tooke upon him this Title of Vniverſall Biſhop, and had armies of Prieſts readie to attend him. <hi>Et invidia exarſit in Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um homo malevolus,</hi> ſayth the Author: And the malicious man was ſo incenſed with envie againſt Gregorie, that he had almoſt cauſed his bookes to be burned. See at firſt how he warreth againſt the Saints. Boniface the third, and the fourth went forward in the ſame courſe, and obtayned of Phocas the Paricide,<note place="margin">By Traytors Tyrants, and Murderers &amp; uſurper; the Pope is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced viz Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas Arithper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus &amp;c.</note> the priviledge of Primacie, which none of their predeceſſors had: and therefore here ought the Catalogue of Popes to beginne, and not as they doe with S. Peter or Silveſter. For it appeareth manifeſtly by Gregorie, that none of the former Biſhops of Rome had the title of <hi>Vniverſall</hi> giuen to him. I aſke therefore, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here were not an evident beginning of the Revelation of Antichriſt.</hi> The Emperour was removed out of Rome, the making of the Conſuls was diſcontinued; the tenne Kings began to receiue their kingdomes. The Pope tooke upon him to rule in Rome, and was <hi>Summus</hi> or <hi>Maximus Pontifex,</hi> onely, the Exarches remayned at Ravenna, with little power. I aſke then, <hi>Who was now revealed to be the ſeaventh Head, or Governour of the Roman State, but this Vniverſalis, and Summus Pontifex?</hi> Let us ſee then how by degrees this Antichriſt was dayly more &amp; more revealed.<note place="margin">Platina Faſc.

So ſayth the <hi>Carthuſian: Vbi impij colebant Daemones, ibi Chriſtiani colunt omnes Sanctos; ſic ars deluditur arte.</hi> About the ſame time the Pope gathered a Synod at Rome, for the confirmation of his primacie. About the yeare 618 Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the fifth ſucceeded, who ordeyned, that churches ſhould be Sanctuaries for theeues and murderers. About the ſame time began the great Apoſtacie and departure of the Greeke Church from the Roman, of the Eaſt Church from the weſt, the Greeke church not yeelding to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſupremacie, and the Eaſterne churches receiuing the damnable doctrine of Mahomet: ſo the propheſies by litle and little began to be fulfilled. The Empire it ſelf was now almoſt wholly removed, the Kings were riſen, that after gaue their power to the Pope. The Apoſtaſie was come, the pope was called <hi>Summus Pontifex</hi>: one of the ſeauen dignities, which had long before been of greateſt power and authoritie in Rome, and which the Heathen Emperors had uſed, and ſo the ſeauenth Head of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtate began to appear. Three things yet lacked: One to haue their ſupremacie fully confirmed and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Emperor (which yet was queſtioned, as well by the Exarches, as by the Emperors) for in the yeare 647 Pope Martin, one of the beſt of them that ſucceeded Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, was taken by Theodorus the Exarch,<note place="margin">Pantal. anno <hi>650.</hi>
                  </note> and ſent priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Conſtantinople, and from thence baniſhed into Pontus. A ſecond thing was after ſuch confirmation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to ſhake of all ſubjection, and all ſignes of ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Emperor. And a third, to make this an Empire of Idolatrie, and as it were the Image of the old Idolatrie, uſed by the Pagans. All three followed ſhortly after. For about the yeare 663, the Emperor Conſtans comming to

Rome the great cittie, that ruled over the kings of the Earth, the cittie of ſeauen Hills, and that had receaved ſeauen kings of Soveraigne command; Rome that glorious mountaine of holynes, yet full of Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall filthines, and Egyptian Idolatrie.

This <hi>Summus Pontifex</hi> was become the abſolute Ruler and king of that State, acknowledging no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, Controull, or Countermand. And hath done ſuch, and ſuch things according alſo to the prophecies of Antichriſt, as no Iew, Turke, or divell can do in ſo ſhort a time, as they would make us beleeue is allotted for Antichriſt: If by theſe things he be not ſufficiently revealed, when will he come, or when ſhall we expect him: or ſhall we imitate the Iewes, in looking as long
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16802:95"/>
for Antichriſt, as they doe for Chriſt? To this may be added an Argument <hi>à ſufficienti diviſione,</hi> which I propoſe in this manner.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:16802:96"/>
we come againe to another ſtrange and wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of prophecies &amp; events, times and actions, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the yeare 1366, and 1400, whereof we will ſpeak here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when we haue taken a view of the actions that fell out in the meane time, namely, in the end of the ſaid firſt 666 yeares, and beginning of the ſecond, and ſomewhat conſidered what manner of men raigned over the Roman ſtate, during the ſecond terme of 666 yeares. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Apoſtle propheſied, <hi>that there ſhould be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staſie,</hi> ſo there fell out (about thoſe times eſpecially) divers great and lamentable Apoſtaſies, ſuch as the like were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeene, neither can the like be expected in any time to come: namely, firſt about the year 760 the great and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rent and departure of the Eaſt Church from the Weſt, by reaſon of that wicked contention betweene the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches for primacie, and that abhominable doctrine of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, which an Hiſtorian verie Chriſtianly calleth execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Secondly, the wofull rent, and departure of the weſt Empire from the Eaſt, by the Popes ſetting up of the French kings Pipin and Charles. Thirdly the rent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the greateſt part of the Eaſt Empire from their lawfull Prince, by the ſodaine and great victories of the wicked Saracens in Aſia, ſent of purpoſe to plague Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (I thinke) for their Idolatrie, as they do object it unto us unto this day. And fourthly the lamentable ſpoyle and falling away by that meanes, not onely of thoſe ſeauen excellent churches, whom S. Iohn by his Epiſtles ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified and forewarned: but of all the reſt of the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Churches of Aſia, which yeelded either by feare or force, to the overflowing Impieties of Mahomet, ô lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times! O times never without grief, and ſhame, and teares of Chriſtians to be remembred! Within a few years, and as it were with a ſodaine floud and inundation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:16802:96"/>
blaſphemie, and filthines, the great and mightie kingdomes of Arabia, Syria, Paleſtina, Phoenicia, Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Perſia and Media, and many other Countries, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous churches of Ieruſalem, Antioch, Epheſus, Nice, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, and all the reſt of the leſſer Aſia, which the Apoſtles had ſo diligently planted with their doctrines, which the Martyrs ſo plentifully watered with their bloud, &amp; crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their Confeſſions, yeelded to the horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and Idolatries of Mahomet, with infinite effuſion of Chriſtian bloud, and murder of Soules. What Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies were ever like to theſe? or how can we looke for the like in any time to come? Say that we ſhould imagine an Antichriſt yet to come, can we haue the prophecie of the Apoſtle S. Paul concerning an Apoſtaſie precedent ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled? Hath all the Chriſtian world now ſufficient roome or place, wherein the like Apoſtaſies may fall out? What do theſe <hi>Summi Pontifices,</hi> theſe Vniverſall Biſhops, which would needs be the Head of the Catholike Church in the meane time. Let us take a ſhort view of their actions alſo in generall and particular, and ſee whether it be poſſible for any Antichriſt hereafter to do the like. The firſt great action that we meete with of theirs, is the puting downe of three kingdomes to advance themſelues; according to the propheſie of Daniell, concerning the <hi>Litle Horne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom three of the other Hornes fell.</hi> For firſt they draue the Grecian Emperors out of Italie, upon the quarrell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Images, by the helpe of the Lombards. Secondly, having ſubdued the Lombards by the helpe of the French, they draue out the French by their owne diſſentions, and the help of the Germans: and laſtly, they expelled the Germans alſo by rayſing factions amongſt them ſelues: the Hiſtories whereof, becauſe they are too long for this place, &amp; are well collected by the learned Mornay, I think
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16802:97"/>
needleſſe here to proſecute. <hi>Is it poſsible for any Antichrist to come to doe the like? Are there any ſuch three kingdomes in the Chriſtian world, everie one of them having command of Rome and Italie, to be put downe hereafter, to make roome for another Antichrist?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerved, that this firſt Action contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it ſelf, manifeſt Treaſon and rebellion againſt their lawfull Princes the Emperors, whom Gregorie and all the Biſhops of Rome before him had acknowledged to be their gratious Lords.<note place="margin">Colimus Imp. ut hominem a Deo ſecundu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoloque Deo eminorem. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ul. ad Scap.</note> Whom they were bound to obay, as thoſe to whom God had giuen power over all men. The ſecond great action, was their ambitious and Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian exaltation aboue all Biſhops, Patriarchs, Princes, and Emperors, in taking the title of <hi>Vniverſall Biſhop,</hi> and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping power over them by excommunications, deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, interdictions, and other ſentences: incouraging ſometimes their Enimies, and ſometimes their ſubjects againſt them: as they moved the Lombards againſt the Emperors, the French againſt the Lombards, and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed factions and diviſions amongſt the French, and thereby ſtill increaſed their owne power and dominion. And in this they advance themſelues againſt God, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to whom onely the Supreame and Royall <hi>Prieſthood after the order of Melchiſedek is confirmed by the oath of God himſelf:</hi> and that individually, as we noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and who hath placed Kings and Emperors in their ſupream places. A third action is the lawleſſe pardoning and diſpenſing with horrible and crying ſinnes, ſtill to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their owne authoritie. As namely, their diſpencing with the horrible Parricides, Treaſons and Rebellions of Phocas, who murdered not onely the Emperor Maurice, but all his male children; namely Theodoſius then crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Pleſsis.</note> Tiberius, Paulus, and Iuſtinian, Peeter his brother,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16802:97"/>
Conſtantine a principall Senator, and divers others. And this is that Phocas notwithſtanding, whoſe actions they all to this day juſtifie, and Baronius will haue us to beleeue that he was a good Catholike. Although he can ſhew no teſtimonie of his repentance, but that he ſent his owne picture and his wiues to Rome, which were preſently ſett up in the pallace. And in this point alſo the Popes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelues aboue God himſelf, who never pardoneth ſinnes without repentance. But this Phocas, three years after the murders of Maurice and his ſonnes,<note place="margin">Pleſsis.</note> hearing that the Empreſſe Conſtantia and her daughters were kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hidden in a Church, ſent certayne Souldjers to make them away. But Cyriacus the Patriarch of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople withſtood them: and would not deliver them, till he had taken an oath of the Tyrant, that he would do them no violence. Whereupon this good Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike conceived a deep and inplacable hatred againſt the Patriarch, and for the preſent put them in a Monaſterie, but about a yeare after cauſed them all to be murthered: and ſo Phocas four or fiue yeares together continueth ſtill a murtherer, adding to his paricide perjurie, and to his perjurie parricide, with extreame hatred againſt the good patriarch Cyriacus, that would not approue of ſuch hideous actions. But the Roman <hi>Pontifex</hi> made good uſe hereof. For thereupon, and by ſlattering this <hi>Catholike Phocas,</hi> he obteyned of him the title of <hi>Soveraigne, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> or <hi>Vniverſall Biſhop,</hi> which from that time to this they all maintaine. A fourth noble action was their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and open uſurpations, of the Territories and Lands belonging to the Emperours, their lawfull Souverains: which they gotte partly by the Lombards, partly by the French: another act of perfidious Treaſon and rebellion. A fifth action was their favouring, exciting and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:16802:98"/>
of Subjects to rebell againſt their lawfull princes, and to depoſe them, as they did the French againſt the Emperors of Greece: Pipin againſt Childerick of France, and Advaldus the Lombard againſt the king his Brother in law, all to ſerue their owne turnes. And this alſo the popes to this day do allow and maintaine, ſtill reaping the fruits, and enjoying the Territories and lands, which they got by theſe practiſes. A ſixth action is their <hi>horrible Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,</hi> in the erecting and worſhiping of Images, which howſoever they labour to blanch, excuſe, or defend with ſubtill or Sophiſtike diſtinctions, which cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Scripture (as they ought to be, for <hi>Vbi Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura non diſtinguit, neque nos diſtinguere debemus, quia ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus nostri &amp; enarrationes ſine Scripturis teſtibus non habent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi>:) yet both at the firſt beginning and ever ſince it was ſtill judged to be open and manifeſt Idolatrie, and that not onely by godly Chriſtians,<note place="margin">vide Agrip. de van. ſci <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And a ſeauenth or laſt notable action is the publike declaration and proclamation to the world, that they hold themſelues <hi>abſolutely lawleſſe,</hi> and that <hi>if the Pope neglect his owne Salvation and others, and thereby draw millions of ſoules into hell with him, yet no man may judge of him, no man may reprehend him.</hi> Theſe were the firſt, and the generall actions of this ſeauenth Head of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:16802:98"/>
Septimontan cittie. And all of them are juſtified and mainteyned by the Popes, and by all of them with one conſent, from their firſt perpetration and beginning, unto this day. All of them take the benefit, all of them do allow and approue of theſe things, magnifying theſe ther Predeceſſors, juſtifying their ſucceſſion from them, and mainteyning their Decrees and Actions: holding this for a Principle inviolable, that <hi>they will not confeſſe themſelues to erre in any thing,</hi> as Thuanus hath obſerved.<note place="margin">Thua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iohns aera, which is the aſcention of our Lord, and was in the yeare of our Lord 34, or 35, and it maketh 1394, or 1395, which is alſo within tenne yeares of the former numbers. The like may be ſayd of the number of 42 moneths, which yeeldeth 1620 dayes, and of three dayes and a halfe, which accounting twelue houres in the day, as our Saviour Chriſt doth, yeeldeth 42 houres, and everie houre to be reckoned according to propheticall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,

a ſabbath of yeares, or ſeauen yeares, ariſeth to l260 yeares. So a time, two times, and half a time; everie of theſe reckoned from the Aſcention of our Lord cometh to the ſame yeare 1394: all concurring within the fiftie yeares aboue mentioned, and making a great concurrence and conſonance of Propheticall yeares. So that here we may boldly ſay, that ſeauen thunders, namely many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets uttered their voices, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">

And to this councell there came learned men out of this our Countrie of England, as well as out of other nations, and were entertayned by that famous and excellent learned Chancelour of Paris, Gerſon, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

the conſent of the Church of France with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh church in that matter. Shortly after this the Papall Church had againe three popes together, and ſo became Triceps, like to <hi>Cerberus</hi>: and ſo the great cittie (ſayth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was divided into three parts, according to the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Apoc. 16. Soone after that therefore was aſſembled the ſecond great councell of the ſaid fiue Nations at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And therein it was againe with great conſent, namely of 900 Biſhops and learned men, fully concluded and decreed, againſt the Popes Law, <hi>that the Councell is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Pope, and hath authoritie immediately from Chriſt, unto which all, of whatſoever ſtate or dignitie,</hi> etiamſi Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, <hi>albeit the Papall, is bound to obey.</hi> And yet in the ſame councell, the pope ſhewed himſelf in his Antichriſtian pride, riding to Church on horſeback, the Emperor of the one ſide, and one of the Princes Electors on the other ſide, leading his horſe: yet in the ſame Councell the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bohemians <hi>Iohannos Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hieronimus Pragenſis,</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proteſted againſt the Pope: ſaying, that <hi>if he did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ in his life, he was not Chriſts Vicar:</hi> for which &amp; other like ſentences, they were condemned and burned, contrarie to the publike fayth, and ſafe conduct of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and to the eternall condemnation of all Popiſh faith and fidelitie. And yet in the ſame Councell God himſelf overruled their voices, and cauſed them to decree againſt the Popes canon law, as aforeſaid.

What then ſhall we ſay to theſe things? Were not theſe extraordinarie great actions, or are not theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſutable to the Prophecies? or may we ever expect the like againe? Whether then may we not here ſafely reſt and fixe the eyes of our attention and contemplation upon this notable <hi>periode,</hi> ſo manie times pointed out and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God himſelf, and accompanied with ſo great and notable events, as happened within this one Centure of yeares, or litle more, namely from the time of Boniface the eight, till the Councell of Baſill. In the beginning we ſee the Pope like a God, proclaiming a Iubile, and thereby <hi>changing times and lawes,</hi> renewing a Iewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and thereby <hi>denying that Chriſt is come in the fleſh,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:16802:106"/>
clayming the abſolute Lordſhip and command of all the world, as well in temporall, as in ſpirituall things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating great and vertuous Princes for ſmall faults, and yet he himſelf weltring and wallowing in Egyptian filthines, and inceſt with his owne Neeces. Then great ſchiſmes in the church, his Succeſſor moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horſeback, the Emperor &amp; Prince Elector lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Palfrey by the bridle, with many ſuch like notes of more pride and elation, then was ever read or heard of to be uſed by any mortall man whatſoever. And in the end the Pope, notwithſtanding all his pride and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferian exaltation, by three great and generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels gathered out of all Chriſtendome, declared to be an Heretike, which in reſpect of the greatnes of his Sea, his followers, his long continuance, and other circumſtances, muſt needs be underſtood the greateſt Heretike, of all that ever were or can be; and ſo by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable conſequence declared to be Antichriſt. Not ſo, will ſome Babylonian peradventure ſay. It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe circumſtances, nor all of them, can make him the greateſt Heretike, no more then Arius in his time was therefore accounted the greateſt Heretike, becauſe the whole world (as it is ſayd) became an Arian; but becauſe he denied one of the greateſt points of our fayth, namely, <hi>the equalitie of God the Sonne, with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therefore was called Chriſtomachus. Be it ſo: yet I thinke no man will deny, but <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the circumſtances aforeſaid will both augment, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Hereſie. But let us conſider firſt, the greatnes and extent of that point, which the ſaid three generall Councels condemned for Hereſie: ſecondly, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereſies, and how manie and great the Pope doth maintaine, and if either that point ſo condemned be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:16802:107"/>
great, yea verie great, or that he mainteyneth more or greater, then any other; then will I leaue it to thine owne Conſcience Chriſtian reader, to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the Pope be the greateſt Heretike, that ever was or not. And becauſe it is not my meaning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to build upon weake foundations, or to make long work, of that which is readie at hand, I deſire thee to conſider of the termes of this diſputation, <hi>ut conſtet quid ſit id qou de agitur</hi>: Firſt I ſay, I deſire to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou doſt hold, that there is a Rule of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth, whereby to judge of Hereſies, which rule ought to be certaine and knowne to us; as not onely the Fathers,<note place="margin">De verbo dei, l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> but we at this day do all agree, and Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the great Champion of the Romiſh Church affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; <hi>For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>if it be not knowne it connot be a rule unto us, and if it be not certaine, it can be no rule at all.</hi> So ſayth the Scripture.<note place="margin">

                  </note> I aſke how it is knowne, whether it be not knowne according to the literall ſenſe, out of which effectuall arguments ought to be drawne, as we alſo are agreed. <hi>For certaine it is</hi> (ſayth the ſame Bellarmine) <hi>that that ſenſe which is immediately gathered of the words, is the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>: which I thinke he intendeth; ſo as it ſtand with other plaine places: <hi>For in the Word of God no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is to be admitted.</hi> God cannot denye himſelfe. But the ſenſes myſticall and ſpirituall, which may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Scriptures are various, and therefore cannot be uſed for arguments to confirme points of Fayth, becauſe we are not certaine, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt, as the ſaid Bellarmine affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of S. Auguſtine. Laſtly then, it reſteth to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:16802:107"/>
know, what that rule is, and where to be found. Of which becauſe thou mayſt ſee, that I will not hide, or diſguiſe any thing from thee: I finde four opinions. Whereof none in my underſtanding can juſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: for they all agree together in ſubſtance. The firſt is of the moſt ancient Tertullian,<note place="margin">De praeſcript.</note> who goeth no further for the rule of fayth, then to the Vulgar Creed,<note place="margin">The ſame as it ſeemeth is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Ar.</note> commonly called the <hi>Creede of the Apoſtles, which</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>amongst us hath no questions, but ſuch as Hereſies bring in and make Heretikes: To know nothing but this, is to know all that we ought to know.</hi> And <hi>they that do not beleeue this, are not faythfull, are not Chriſtians, are not to be admitted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the Scriptures</hi> (ſayth he.<note place="margin">In Enchirid. ad Laur.</note>) The ſecond is that of Auguſt, who affirmeth, this rule to be conteyned in the <hi>Creede</hi> and the <hi>Lords prayer</hi>: For (ſayth he) <hi>therein is the whole ſumme of all Chriſtian religion, namely, whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth fayth, hope, or charitie.</hi> A third opinion is that of the common Catechiſtes, which adde to the two before named, the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and the doctrine of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> The fourth is that which is now commonly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, which maketh the <hi>Scripture in generall, to be the rule of fayth.</hi> And in this Bellarmine alſo conſenteth. My queſtion therefore is, whether thou do not approue theſe rules, or any of them? if thou do, and do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that theſe Rules, or any of them be certeyne and knowne to us, and to be litterally underſtood, as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine confeſſeth, it followeth then to conſider, who by theſe Rules ſhall be ſaid an Heretick, and whether that be not clearly defined unto us by Moſes, S.

                  <hi>nihil minuit, nihil addit.</hi> Then to the point: I aſke firſt concerning that Article, by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels aforeſaid decreed, That the holy Catholike church, being the body of our Saviour Chriſt, repreſented in a generall Councell, is aboue the Pope, and hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie immediately from Chriſt, unto which the Pope himſelfe, as a member to the whole, ought to obey, &amp; whoſoever denieth that verily is an Heretike: Doth not the Pope (as I ſaid) and haue not all the Popes ſince the making of that decree, mainteyned themſelues to be aboue the generall Councell, and ſo denyed that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and that no decree of a generall Councell is able to binde them, neither is lawfull, if it be made without the authoritie of the Roman Pontifex? Aſke Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Advocate. Do they not maintaine that he is the head of the Church? that he cannot erre in matters of fayth, and that all are bound to obey him, <hi>ex neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſalutis?</hi> Are theſe things expreſly and literally to be found in the Creede, the Lords prayer, the tenne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, the Sacraments, or any part of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If they be, why did all the Chriſtian Churches of Europe ſo manie times determine againſt theſe Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues of the Pope? If not, then whether are not theſe moſt great additions to that Rule, to which none muſt adde, and from which none muſt deminiſh? If we will truly judge of the greatnes of this Hereſie, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greatnes of the buildings erected upon it. For great buildings muſt haue great foundations. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this Supremacie over the Church of Chriſt, repreſented in the generall Councell, they haue groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their abſolute power to call, beginne, determine, ende, prorogue, and tranſfer generall Councels at their
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:16802:108"/>
pleaſures, and alſo to confirme and allow, or to abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and diſanull them. Which point if it be granted, they are ſure, that nothing can be determined againſt them in any ſuch Councell. Then an abſolute power over all not onely Biſhops and Prelates, but kings and princes will eaſily be inferred. For it ſtandeth with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he who is aboue the whole, is aboue everie parte, <hi>in toto &amp; pars continetur.</hi> Then followeth their power to adjudge and condemn that for Hereſie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he thinketh fit. Then the power to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Nations and Countries, to depriue and depoſe kings and princes, &amp; to giue their lands for an Heritage to whom they will. And in a word, their abſolute <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> and lawleſſenes, that no man may judge of him, no man may diſpute of his judgment, <hi>or call it in queſtion, though he draw millions of ſoules with him into hell</hi>; a prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue which the Scripture never intimateth to be clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by any but Antichriſt, and never claymed by any but the pope; wherein all the authoritie, power and ſtates of Chriſtian kings, and ſubjects, prelates and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, with their lands and goods, bodies and ſoules are giuen to the Pope, and that without appeale, revocation or queſtion, whether he goe to heauen or hell. Iudge then Chriſtian Reader, whether this Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie be not greater then that of <hi>Arius, Pelagius, Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Ebion, Cerinthus, Simon Magus,</hi> or any other? Who although they rayſed damnable Hereſies, yet never clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuch prerogatiues? Yet you will ſay, that theſe Hereſies mainteyned by the Pope do not denye Chriſt Ieſus, as it is ſayd of Antichriſt, that he denyeth both the Father and the Sonne. Well, if thou be not ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that which I haue ſayd before, conſider what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hereſies are mainteyned by the Pope, and how
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16802:109"/>
great they be. Firſt in the Creede, when we beleeue in one God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</note> the Father almightie, who is a ſpirit inviſible, whom no man hath ſeene at any time, nor can ſee; for he dwelleth in light inacceſſible: is it a ſmall Hereſie, to maintaine, that that moſt glorious and inviſible ſpirit may be repreſented to us by the picture of an old man, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a wall, or graved in ſtone or wood? Is this to be found in the expreſſe and literall ſence of any the Rules aforeſaid? When we beleeue in one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who was borne of the virgin Marie, as a naturall man (though not onely man) crucified dead and buried as a true man, and aſcended up into heauen; is it a ſmall addition or Hereſie to ſay, that this naturall and carnall body now conteyned in heauen, is in ſo manie thouſand millions of conſecrated Hoſtes upon earth, carnally fleſh bloud and bones? Muſt we now haue ſo many millions of Lords, and the Virgin Marie ſo manie millions of naturall ſonnes borne of her bodie? And our Saviour muſt haue ſo manie millions of bodies, that ſuffered upon the croſſe, died and was buried for us &amp;c. Yea but <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> and God is Almightie, and can doe what he will, and ſo we muſt beleeue. It is true he hath ſaid, this is my bodie, but did he ever ſay, This is my carnall bodie, or naturall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: or this is changed, or ſhall be changed into my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodie? Is there one word to that effect produced by Bellarmine out of the Scripture, or out of any the rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid? He ſayth, This is my bodie. So it is ſaid alſo, that <hi>we are members of his bodie,</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:16802:110"/>
who is the ſpirit of trueth, that ſhall leade us into all truth, whom God promiſed to poure out upon all fleſh,<note place="margin">

Without whom no Decree of any Generall councell muſt be held firme or lawfull. When we beleeue the holy Catholike Church, is it a ſmall addition to ſay, that this Catholike Church is now confined to Rome. When we beleeue the forgiuenes of ſinnes, is it a ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſay, that we haue this forgiuenes by the Popes pardons, and indulgences, eyther for ever, or for ſo manie thouſand yeares? Doth this agree with that article, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we beleeue, that Chriſt ſhall judge the quick and the dead? ſhall he judge, when the Pope hath pardoned, or ſhall he judge according to theſe pardons? Is it a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from the commandements to leaue out a parte of the firſt? Is it a ſmall addition to the Sacraments to make ſeauen in ſtead of two, to adde ſpittle and other ſuch traſh to baptiſme? Is this literally to be found in the rules afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid? is it knowne? is it certaine? Is it a ſmall addition to giue to the Sacrament of the bodie of our Lord devine adoration? or is it a ſmall detraction to make it private, and ſo to take it away from the common people, except ſet and ſolemne times, and the cup alwaies? Finally, when we are agreed, that the litterall ſenſe of the Scripture is the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:16802:111"/>
moſt certaine and ſafe rule of our beleefe, and that it hath in it ſelfe an incredible harmonie and conſent, and is the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt; is it a ſmall addition to this point, alſo to ſay, that the Pope is the ſupreame interpreter thereof, and judge of fayth and manners? And that he cannot erre? If this be knowne and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, then why did none of the rules aforeſaid expreſſe and ſay ſo? Why is it not expreſſed in the Scripture, why did no ancient generall Councell decree it? yea why did the three generall Councels aforeſaid, decree contrarie, that the generall councell is aboue the pope? Admitte the caſe to be, that the pope judge contrarie to the litterall ſenſe of the Scripture, muſt it be no error? Admitte that he maintaine, that the Scripture is to be received by vertue of his authoritie? that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the commandements of God? that he is the generall Commiſſarie of God, aſſumed into the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power, are theſe ſmall additions to the rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid? The like may be ſayd of manie other points, upon all which I thus propoſe, and referre it to thine owne ſoule and conſcience (good Chriſtian) to judge if theſe be great additions and detractions, and more, &amp; greater, then ever any other Heretike made to thoſe Rules of fayth before mentioned, and if they haue been oftentimes reproved, and admoniſhed for them, and yet ſtill maintaine the ſame, then, I ſay, I leaue it to thine owne ſoule to judge, <hi>Whether the Pope be not the greateſt Heretike that ever was?</hi> And <hi>whether we may not well affirme him to be that Antichriſt, then whom never any was nor can be greater,</hi>

ſinne is no leſſe a blaſphemie, then to make our Saviour Chriſt the protector and Author of ſinne and wickednes. A ſecond notable deſcription of men of thoſe times is made by S. Paul.

And ſo all the Reprobates are one in the divell, as all the elect are one in Chriſt.

For if one divell ſhould do homage or ſacrifice to another, or commit or giue a licence to commit Treaſon, Inceſt, or murther, yet that could not be any way ſo great a ſinne, as when a Chriſtian, baptiſed in the name of Chriſt, and for whom our Saviour Chriſt the onely ſonne of God, hath ſhed his moſt precious bloud, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſuch an offence, or giveth ſuch a Licence. And by the ſame rule of proportion: if theſe haynous Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Treaſons, Murthers, Adulteries and other ſinnes, which haue beene committed by the Popes, and their Licences and diſpenſations, were done, or licenced, committed, or permitted by any other then a Chriſtian, &amp; one that taketh upon him to be the head of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and over all Chriſtian Biſhops, yea and ſuch an Head as cannot erre, certainely theſe ſinnes in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not be judged ſo great, offenſiue, or in intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.

               <p>VPon all theſe premiſes, for a concluſion, I would deſire the Chriſtian Reader, to conſider of theſe ſeauen ſhort Problems, firſt concerning theſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies before touched, as I haue demanded of them everie one in particuler: ſo now of them all in generall: If they be not fulfilled alreadie, I demand, how they can be accompliſhed, or how long &amp; when we ſhall expect their accompliſhment? There are now almoſt 1600 yeares paſt, ſince they were giuen.<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>or dallie with idle diſtinctions of the Antichrist, and an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, as if any Antichrist might be admitted to stand in competition with our Soveraigne Lord Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> If that diſtinction muſt yet ſtill be obſerved, as well at this time, as in the dayes of S. Iohn; unleſſe the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſher can ſhew ſome other that may be called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, beſides the Pope: I demand, whether it may not be inferred: that The Pope is The Antichriſt, and that everie Papiſt is an Antichriſt. O deare Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, let us at length awake, and <hi>if God be God ſerue him</hi>; if Rome be Babylon, let us flye out of her, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16802:117"/>
if the Pope be Antichriſt, let us utterly forſake him. For to follow both, ſerue both, cleaue to both, or relie upon both, is abſolutely impoſſible. Thirdly, if theſe things be ſo, I aſke in what caſe they be that take parte with Antichriſt, or entertaine him eyther by way of <hi>Obedience, converſation, aſſiſtance, permiſſion, connivence, or howſoever</hi>: ſeeing it is written, that if any man worſhip the Beaſt, the ſame ſhall drinke of the pure wine of the wrath of God. And <hi>what concord can Christ haue with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial?</hi> Fourthly, upon the ſame grounds, I demand what power this Pontifex Max. which is Antichriſt, can haue over Chriſtian Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, or other perſons whatſoever to excommunicate, interdict, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or depriue any of them? Fiftly, I aſke what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie he hath to interpret the Scriptures, or what he hath to doe with them, or to pardon or diſpence with ſinnes, namely inceſt, murther, treaſon, Idolatrie, &amp;c. or to make Canons, Decrees or Decretals to bind Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? Sixthly, ſeeing the Monarchie of the Pope is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly holden of the Divel, by homage actually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſome of them, and aſſented unto by all their Succeſſors, in approving and maintaining their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from, and by them which did it: I demand <hi>whether all that follow the Pope, or take parte with him, do not thereby ſubmit themſelues to the Divell, in approving of that horrible Act; and withall renounce and forſake our onely true and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lord, and Soveraigne Chriſt Ieſus?</hi> And laſtly, all the premiſes conſidered, whether it may ſtand with the policie, ſafetie, or peace of any Chriſtian kingdome ſtate or common wealth, to permit and ſuffer Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and diueliſh practiſes of filthines, infidelitie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, treaſon, Idolatrie, blaſphemie, and ſuperſtition to increaſe amongſt them.

What good the Grecian Emperors, what good the Albigenſes under the E. of Tontons, what the Valdois, Bohemians, and others gotte, by ſubmitting or yeelding to the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and what fayth thoſe Romiſh Catholikes haue held with them: alſo what is come of all the great warres, that Chriſtian Princes haue undertaken by the inſtigation and procurement of the Pope, as namely thoſe of ancient time for Ieruſalem, and thoſe of late in France. Alſo what good hath come to Chriſtendome by all the victories gotten by Romiſh Catholikes againſt the Turkes: haue they enlarged or defended Chriſtendome? haue they not loſt a great part of it? Yet they hold ſome part. True, taking Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in their ſenſe, who admitte none to be Chriſtians, but thoſe that are ſubject to the Pope. But for other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians it is much worſe. For the Grecian Chriſtians, though grievouſly oppreſſed, are ſuffred in ſome ſorte to liue under the Turke, but Proteſtants in no ſort under the Pope. &amp;c.</p>
