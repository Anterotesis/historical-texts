            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nor have I upon these Considerations onely adven tured on the publication of this Tract, but because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in the reviewing of it, I found very many Touches upon Theologicall Arguments, and some Passages who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Nature. Yea, all the Materiall parts of the Treatise doe so nearely concerne the knowledge of our selves, and the Direction of our lives, as that they may be all esteemed Borderers upon that Profession.</p>
            <p>In the perusing and fashioning of it for the Presse, I have found that true in writing, which I had formerly found true in Building; That it is almost as chargeable to repaire, and set right an Old house, as to Erect a New one. For I was willing in the most materiall parts of it, so to lop off Luxuriances of Style, and to supply the Defects of Matter, as that with Candid, favourable, and ingenuous Iudgements, it might receive some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralle acceptation.

Intending therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my weakenesse, to take some view of the inside, and more noble Characters of this Booke, it will not be needfull for me to gaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cover, to insist on the materials or sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conditions of the humane nature, or to commend him in his Anatomie; though even in that respect the Psalmist tells us, that he is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made: for wee commonly see, that as most kind of Plants or Trees exceed us in vegetation and fertilitie; so, many sorts of<note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 76.</note> beasts have a greater activitie and exquisitenesse in their senses than wee. And the reason hereof is, because Nature aiming at a superiour and more excellent end, is in those lower faculties lesse intent and elaborate. It shall suffice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, onely to lay a ground-worke in these lower faculties, for the better notice of mans greater perfections, which have ever some connexion and dependance on them. For whereas the principall acts of mans Soule are either of Reason and Discourse, proceeding from his Vnderstanding; or of Action and Moralitie, from his Will; both these, in the present condition of mans estate, have their dependance on the Organs and faculties of the Body, which in the one precede, in the other follow: To the one, they are as Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to let in and convey; to the other as Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, to performe and execute: To the one,

the whole Body is as an Eye, through which it seeth; to the other a Hand, by which it worketh.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ministrie therefore of the Body unto the Soule, wee shall thus resolve; That the Reasonable part of Man, in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of subsistence which now it hath, depends in all its ordinarie and naturall operations, upon<note place="margin">Solirus de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

objects by conveyance from these bodily instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth the Messengers to the Soule, if they out of any indisposition shall be weakened, the Soule must continue like a <hi>Rasa Tabula,</hi> without any acquired or introduced ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. The Soule hath not immediately from it selfe that strange weakenesse, which is observed in many men, but onely <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>as it is disabled by Earthie and sluggish Organs; which being out of order, are more burthensome than serviceable thereunto.</p>
            <p>There are observable in the Soules of men, considered in themselves, and in reference one to another, two defects; an imperfection, and an inequalitie of operation: the former of these I doe not so ascribe to that bodily weakenesse, whereby the Soule is any way opprest, as if I conceived no internall darknesse in the faculties themselves; since the fall of man working in him a generall corruption, did amongst the rest infatuate the Mind, and as it were smother the Soule with ignorance; so that the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptitude of bodily instruments, is onely a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and improvement of that Native im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. But for the inequalitie and difference of mens understandings in their severall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, notwithstanding it be questioned in the Schooles, Whether the Soules of men have not originally, in their Nature, degrees of perfection and weakenesse, whence these severall degrees of operation may proceed; yet neverthelesse that being granted, I suppose, that principally it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16360:14"/>
from the varietie, tempers, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the instrumentall faculties of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the helpe whereof, the Soule in this estate worketh: for I cannot perceive it possible, that there should have beene, if man had continued in his Innocencie, (wherein our Bodies should have had an exact constitution, free from those distempers to which now by sinne they are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) such remarkable differences betweene mens apprehensions, as wee now see there are: for there should have beene in all men a great facilitie to apprehend the mysteries of Nature, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire knowledge (as wee see in <hi>Adam</hi>) which now wee finde in a large measure granted to some, and to others quite denyed. And yet in that perfect estate (according to the opinion of those who now maintaine it) there would have beene found a substantiall and internall inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie amongst the Soules of men: and therefore principally this varietie comes from the sundry constitutions of mens bodies; in some, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding enablement, for quicknesse of Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in others, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The principall Corruptions which I conceive of the Memorie, are first, too much slightnesse and shallownesse of observation; when out of an impatiencie of staying long, or making any pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ound enquirie into one object, and out of a gluttonous curiositie to seed on many, the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse of the appetite weakeneth the digestion, (for so some have called the Memorie, the Belly of the Soule) and an eagernesse to take in, makes uncarefull to retaine. And this is the reason, why many men wander over all Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without gaining reall improvement, or soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in any: They make not any solemne Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to a particular Coast, and Head of Learning, but view all as it were in <hi>Transitu;</hi> having no sooner begun to settle on one, but they are in haste to visit another. But such men as these (except endowed with an incredible and usuall felicitie of dispatch) are no more able to finde the use, or search the bottome of any Learning, than he who rides Poast, is to make a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Map of his Iourneyes: who, though by much imployment, he may toyle and sweat more in travelling from place to place; yet is hee farre lesse able to discover the nature of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,

temperature of the Aire, Character of the people, Commodities of the Earth, than he, who though not so violent in the motion, is yet more constant in his abode: and though his haste be lesse eager, yet his observations are more serious. <hi>Omnis festinatio coeca est,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca;</hi> Precipitancie and unstablenesse, as well in the motions of the Wit as of the Body, dazeleth and disableth the eyes: And it is true in the Minde, as in the Stomack; too quick digestion doth alwayes more distemper than nourish, and breedeth nothing but Crudities in Learning. Nor can I call that so much Studie, as agitation and restlesnesse of the Minde; which is as impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of true setled labour, as it is of quiet. Now, the reason why such a temper of Minde as this, is corruptive to the Memorie, is first, because Memorie is alwayes joyned with some measure of Love; and wee most of all remember that, which wee most respect: <hi>Omnia quae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So, that sudden vanishing, and broken de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which like the appetite of sick men, are for the time violent, but give presently over; as they argue an eager Love for the present, of what wee<note place="margin">Arill.

               <hi>fastidium</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteeme of that which wee soone forsake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so doe they necessarily inferre weakenesse on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, by how much they make our hopes the stronger. For, as <hi>Seneca</hi> speakes, <hi>Cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Secondly, the body of any one Homogeneall Learning, hath this excellent propertie in it, that all the parts of it doe by a mutuall service relate to, and communicate strength and lustre each to other: so that he who goes through with any Science, doth from every new Branch and Conclusion which he meets with, receive a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clearenesse and more strong impression of his former degrees of Knowledge.

And this was done by those Musicall, Poeticall, and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologicall perswasions; whereby men in their discourses, did as it were paint Vertues and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; giving unto spirituall things Bodies and Beauties, such as might best affect the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yea, God himselfe hath beene pleased to honour this way of setting out higher Notions, in that wee finde some roome in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Mythologies; as that of the Vine, the Fig-tree, and the Bramble, for Riddles, for Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Similitudes, and Poeticall Numbers and<note place="margin">Iudg. 18. 14. 12.

Truth, but are (as I may so speake) the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fancie, having a kind of delightfull libertie in them, wherewith they refresh and doe is it were open and unbind the Thoughts, which otherwise, by a continuall pressure in exacter and more massie reasonings, would easily tyre and despaire.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Latitude of this Facultie, it hath there in a double prerogative above others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one, in the multiplicitie of Operations; another, in the framing of Objects. To the former of these, I reduce the Thoughts; which, by reason of their quicknesse and volubilitie, and withall, their continuall interchanges and successions, are the most numberlesse operations of the Soule of man: where, by Thoughts, I understand those springings and glances of the heart, grounded on the sudden representation of sundry different objects; for when the Mind begins once to be fixt, and standing, I call that rather Meditation than Thought. This multiplicitie of Thoughts is grounded first upon the abundance of their Objects; and next, upon the quicknesse and activitie of Apprehension; that is the matter, this the forme of those Thoughts which I now speake of. The abundance of Objects is seene in this, that it includes all the varieties of <hi>species</hi> belonging to other faculties; as that knowledge which the Schooles call <hi>Philosophia prima,</hi> doth within its owne limits draw in, in some sort, all the severall Objects of particular Sciences. There are Thoughts belonging unto the Will,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16360:22"/>
flying and pursuing Thoughts, Wishings, and Loathings; and there are Thoughts belonging to the Vnderstanding, assenting and dissenting Thoughts, Beleefe and dis-opinion: There are Thoughts likewise proceeding from Anger, firie and revengefull Thoughts; from Envie, knowing and repining Thoughts; from Ioy, sweet and refreshing Thoughts; from Conscience, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and affrightfull Thoughts; and so in all other faculties. And for the quicknesse of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, the motions of the Thoughts shew it, in the concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rence of these two things, suddennesse of journey, and vastnesse of way; while like Lightning they are able to reach from one end of Heaven unto another, and in one light and imperceptible excursion, leave almost no part of the Vniverse untravelled. Now, of these two grounds of multiplicitie in Thoughts, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, namely, the abundance of Objects, is <hi>ab extrinsec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and dispersed over things, (though they are not otherwise the Objects of Thought, than as the Mind reflecteth on the <hi>Phan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>asmata</hi> or images of them in this facultie) but the latter, which is the quicknesse of Apprehension, though it may seeme to be the most peculiar worke of Reason, yet the Imagination hath indeed the greatest interest in it: For, though the Act of Apprehending be the proper worke of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, yet the forme and qualitie of that Act (which properly makes it a Thought in<note place="margin">Vid. A. Gell. lib. 9. c. 1. Aug. de Civ. Dei, lib. 9. c. 4.</note> that strict sense, wherein here I take it) namely, the lightnesse, volubilitie, and suddennesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16360:23"/>
proceeds from the immediate restlesnesse of the Imagination; as is plaine, by the continuall varietie of Dreames and other Fancies, wherein the Facultie is the principall worker. The next thing, is the Latitude of Imagination, in framing of Objects, wherein it hath a propertie of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse beyond other faculties: For Reason, and all other powers, have their fixed and determined limits in Nature; and therefore they alwayes frame themselves to the truth of things, yeelding assent to nothing but what they finde: But the Imagination is a Facultie boundlesse, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of any imposed limits, save those which it selfe maketh. And hence it is, that in matter of perswasion and insinuation, Poetrie, Mythologie, and Eloquence (the Arts of rationall Fancie) have ever (as was observ'd) beene more forcible than those which have been rigorously grounded on Nature and Reason; it being (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves) the naturall infinitenesse of mans Soule. <hi>Aspernari c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now, the libertie of the Imagination in this particular, is three-sold; Creation, as I may so speake, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And here, by the way from the three former, we may take occasion to observe the miserie of mans corrupted Nature; wherein those Faculties which were originally ordained for mutuall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, doe now exercise a mutuall imposture:

For, since it may fall out, that unto the same Facultie, from diversitie of occasions, contrarie operations may proove arguments of worth; a restraint unto one manner of working, is an argument of weaknesse and defect, in that it straitneth and defraudeth the power of those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which it might receive, by a timely application of the other: There may be a time, when the <hi>Fancie</hi> may have libertie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate; but againe, some objects will require a more fixed and permanent act.

            <p>Passions which proceed from Knowledge se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and extrinsecall, are those motions of meerely naturall Agents; which are guided to their generall or particular ends, by the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Power of Him that made them. And this it is which causeth that peremptorie and uniforme order, observed by these kind of Agents in their naturall course, never either swarving or desisting there-from, so farre as the condition of the matter and subject whereon they worke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them; because they are all governed by an immutable, most wise, and most constant Law, proceeding from a Will with which there is no variablenesse nor shadow of changing. And therefore we finde those aberrations and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of Nature, wherein it swerveth from this Law onely, or at least principally in these infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour things; wherein partly from the deficiencie and languishing of secondarie Agents, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the excesses, defects, mutabilitie, and the like exigences of matter, wee finde sundry times error and enormitie in their severall workes and ends: Which, whether it be to set forth the beautie of regular operations (which by defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and confusion will appeare more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; or whether the originall thereof be divine mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>By all which we are given to understand, that when at any time the ordinarie course of Nature is intermitted, when any creature forsakes its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive motion, and falleth into confusion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, there is then admitted a <hi>breach of a Law;</hi> or, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16360:30"/>
and unknit that Bond) hee justly affirmeth it to be in some sort a Reasonable Facultie, not intrinsecally in it selfe, but by way of participation and influence from Reason.</p>
            <p>Now Passion thus considered, is divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the severall references it hath unto its object; which is principally, the Good; and secondarily, the Evill of things; and either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered after a sundry manner: for they may be taken either barely and alone, or under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of some difficultie and danger accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them. And both these againe are to be determin'd with some particular condition of union or distance to the subject; for all objects offend or delight the Facultie, in vertue of their union thereunto; and therefore, according as things are united or distant, so doe they occasion Passions of a different nature in the Mind. The object then may be considered simply in its owne nature, as it precisely abstracteth from all other circumstances, including onely the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conveniencie or disconveniencie which it beareth to the Facultie: and so the Passions are, in respect of Good, Love; in respect of Evill, Hatred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are the two radicall, fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and most transcendent Passions of all the rest; and therefore well called <hi>Pondera</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus animi,</hi> the weight and force, and (as I may so speake) the first springings and out goings of the Soule. Secondly, the object may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as absent from the subject, in regard of reall union (though never without that which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16360:31"/>
the Schooles call <hi>vnio objectiva,</hi> union of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension in the Vnderstanding) without which there can be no Passion: and the object thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, worketh, if it be Good, Desire; if Evill, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>light, and Abomination. Thirdly, it may be considered as present, by a reall contract or union with the Facultie; and so it worketh, if Good, Delight, and Pleasure; if Evill, Griefe and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Againe, as the object beareth with it the circumstances of difficultie and danger, it may be considered, either as exceeding the naturall strength of the power; which implyeth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Good, an Impossibilitie to be attained, and so it worketh Despaire; and in respect of Evill, an Improbabilitie of being avoided, and so it worketh Feare: or secondly, as not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the strength of the power, or at least, those aides which it calleth in; in which regard, Good is presented as Attainable, and so it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Hope; and Evill is presented, either as Avoidable, if it be future, and it worketh Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to breake through it; or as Requitable, if it be past, and so it worketh Anger, to revenge it. Thus have wee the nature and distribution of those severall Passions which wee are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after; of all which, or at least, those which are most naturall, and least coincident with one another, I shall in the proceeding of my Discourse, observe some things, wherein they conduce to the honour and prejudice of Mans Nature: But first, I shall speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the generalitie of Passions; and what

affaires, I shal not make any observation; either of the other, I shall in part touch upon, though not distinctly and asunder, but in a briefe and confused collection of some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>The Order which I shall observe, in setting downe the Honour and Corruption of them in Generall (which Method shall in part be kept in their Particulars) shall be this; first, according to the <hi>Antecedents</hi> of their <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Acts;</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, according to the <hi>Acts</hi> themselves; and thirdly, according to the <hi>Consequents</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>First, touching the <hi>Antecedents</hi> to the Act of <hi>Passion,</hi> they are either the <hi>Outward</hi> Motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as namely, the <hi>Objects,</hi> unto which it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed; and the <hi>Causes,</hi> whereby it is produced: or the <hi>Inward</hi> Root and Principles of the Act, whereby it is wrought and governed.</p>
            <p>For the two former, <hi>Passion</hi> is then sayd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, when it is direct and naturall. And the Corruption is, when it is carryed to an undue <hi>Object,</hi> or proceedeth from an indirect <hi>Cause:</hi> but these are more observable in the particulars, and therefore thither I referre their distinct hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>For the third, the Dignitie of Passion chiefely consists in a <hi>Consonancie</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Reason:</hi> for there is in mans <hi>Faculties</hi> a naturall <hi>subordination,</hi> whereby the actions of the inferior receive their motion and direction from the influence of the higher.

            <p>Which effect of Passions, I have before toucht upon; neither is it alwayes a corrupt effect, but onely then, when there is in the Passion genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive some distemper. In which respect of the Vnderstanding and Will, (both which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise under one Name of Reason) I conceive the corruption to be principally these foure; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture, or seduction; Alienation, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing; Distraction, or consounding; and Precipitancie, or a headlong transporting of Reason.</p>
            <p>Now concerning these, we are first to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that there is in every man a native and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall strugling betweene Apperite and Reason; which yet proceedeth from Corruption, and the Fall of Man, not from Nature entire, as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> contend; who affirme, That the strife and reluctancie betweene Sense and Vnderstanding, ariseth from Physicall and created constitution; and that therefore, that sweet harmonie which was betweene all the Faculties of Man, Animall and Rationall, in his Creation, proceeded from the government of a super-naturall Grace added thereunto: because it being naturall for Sense
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16360:42"/>
to desire sensible, and Spirit spirituall good things, and things sensitive and spirituall being amongst themselves opposite; those desites which are carryed unto them, must needs be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite likewise.</p>
            <p>An Argument as weake, as the Opinion which it defends, is dangerous and prejudiciall to the honour of Mans Creation; as tending to prove, that the first risings and rebellions of Appetite against Reason, and all inordinate desires of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Faculties, till they taint the Will, are not formally sinnes, as having been naturall to <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe in Innocencie, though by infused and supernaturall Grace bridled and suspended. An Opinion, which retaineth that odious scandall which they fasten upon us, more justly and truly on their owne heads, touching making God the Author of Sinne; in that they affirme, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, whereby Sense is carried to its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject inordinately, that is, without the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and assent of Reason, to have been naturall to <hi>Adam;</hi> which yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath so many<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> times called by the expresse name of <hi>Sinne,</hi> in one Chapter.</p>
            <p>And for the Argument which they bring, we answer, That naturally, and from the Law of Creation, there was no formall opposition, but a subordination betweene Spirit and Sense. And therefore, notwithstanding the operations of Appetite are common unto Men and Beasts; yet we may not grant, that they have the same manner of being educed and governed in both
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16360:42"/>
these. For, as the operations of the vegetative Soule, though common to Beasts, Men, and Plants, are yet in either of these severally so restrained, as that they are truly sayd to be the proper and peculiar workes of that specificall forme, unto which they are annexed: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the sensitive Appetite, though generally it be common to Men and Beasts; yet in Men, it was ordained to proceed naturally from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Reason, and therefore may properly be called a humane Appetite, as being determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, restrained, and made conformable unto Mans Nature: so that as long as Man continued entire and incorrupt, there was a sweet harmonie betweene all his Faculties, and such an happie subordination of them each to other, as that every motion of the inferior powers was directed and governed, and therefore might truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be attributed to the superior; but when once Man had tasted of that murthering Fruit, which poysoned him and all his posteritie, then began those swellings, rebellions, and unjoynting of Faculties, which made him as lame in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it did dead in Grace; whence Passions are become now, in the state of corruption, beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sensuall, which were before, by Creation, reasonable and humane: <hi>For man being in honour was without understanding, and is become as the beasts that perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to returne, we are, as I said, to remember, that there is in Man, by reason of his generall corruption, such a distemper wrought, as that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16360:43"/>
there is not onely crookednesse in, but dissention also, and fighting between his parts. And though the Light of our Reason be by Mans Fall much dimmed and decayed, yet the remainders thereof are so adverse to our unruly Appetite, as that it laboureth against us, as the <hi>Philistims</hi> against <hi>Samson,</hi> (or rather indeed as <hi>Dalilah,</hi> for <hi>Samsons</hi> eyes were truly put out, before ever the <hi>Philistims</hi> were upon him) it laboureth, I say, to deprive us of those Reliques of Sight, which we yet retaine.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when a <hi>Passion</hi> in its fulnesse, both of a violence and delight, doth take it up, the more cleare and naked brightnesse of Truth is sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and changed: So that, as the Sunne and Moone, at their rising and setting, seeme farre greater than at other times, by reason of thick Vapours, which are then interposed; so, the <hi>Mind</hi> looking upon things through the Mists and Troubles of <hi>Passion,</hi> cannot possibly judge

of them, in their owne proper and immediate Truth, but according to that magnitude or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which they are framed into, by prejudice and distemper.</p>
            <p>But then, thirdly, if <hi>Reason</hi> will neither be<note place="margin">3.</note>

And this is a most inward and proper Effect of <hi>Passion:</hi> For, as things presented to the <hi>Mind,</hi> in the nakednesse and simplicitie of their owne Truth, doe gaine a more firme Assent unto them, and a more fixed intuition on them; so, on the contrarie side, those things which come mixt and troubled, dividing the intention of the <hi>Mind</hi> between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> cannot obtaine any setled or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie Resolution from the Discourses of <hi>Reason.</hi>

            <p>But we must here withall, take notice of the generall care of the Creator; whereby he hath fastned on all creatures, not onely his private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to satisfie the demands of their owne nature, but hath also stamp'd upon them a generall cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and feeling of Communion, as they are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable parts of the Vniverse or common Body; wherein cannot possible be admitted (by reason of that necessarie mutuall connexion between<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Now, as it hath pleased the infinite Wisdome of God to guide and moderate, by his owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction, the motions of necessarie agents, after the manner declared to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or to the generall end, (which motion may therefore, as I before observed, be called the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Passion of things) so hath it given unto Man a reasonable Soule, to be as it were his Vice-gerent in all the motions of Mans little World.</p>
            <p>To apply then these proportions in Nature to the affection of Love in Man, we shall finde first a Secret, which I will call Naturall; and next, a Manifest, which I call a Morall and more discursive attraction. The first of these, is that naturall sympathie wrought betweene the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and the obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ll farther inquirie after the disposition of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which comes immediately from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, naturall, and sensitive Vertues thereof, whether in shape, feature, beautie, motion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of Sense, I include under the name of Iudiciarie Physiognomie: Which is not a bare delight in the outward qualities, but a farther presumption of the Iudgement; concluding thence, a lovely disposition of that Soule, which animateth and quickneth those outward Graces.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if it be true which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in<note place="margin">Ethic. li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this is the Love of fellow-members, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves.

            <p>And this <hi>Love</hi> is then <hi>Regular,</hi> when it takes up all the <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and all the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> For we <hi>love God, Amore amicitiae,</hi> for the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> and Excellencie which is in himselfe, as being most <hi>lovely;</hi> and <hi>Amore desiderii,</hi> with a desire of being united unto him, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all our <hi>blessednesse;</hi> and <hi>Amore complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> with a <hi>love</hi> of joy and <hi>delight</hi> in him; when the Soule goes to God, like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove to the Arke, and with infinite sweetnesse and securitie reposeth it selfe in him; and lastly, <hi>Amore Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiae,</hi> with an endeavour (so farre as a poore Creature can to an infinite Creator; <hi>for our Good extendeth not unto him</hi>) to bring all praise, service, and honour unto him.</p>
            <p>And thus we are to <hi>love him above all things;</hi> first, <hi>Appretiativè,</hi> setting an higher price upon his Glory and Command, than upon any other thing besides; all Dung, in comparison.

            <p>A third Effect, which I shall observe of <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>Stay,</hi> and immoration of the Mind upon the <hi>Object loved,</hi> and a <hi>diverting</hi> of it from all others: as we observed in <hi>Eumaeus,</hi> when he saw <hi>Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> he threw away the Businesse which he was about before: And the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The reason whereof is that unseparable union, which is in all things between the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> of them: for it being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Truth</hi> to unite and apply <hi>Goodnesse</hi> (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being apprehended as Good, unlesse that Goodnesse be apprehended as <hi>true</hi>) the more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite enjoyeth of this, the deeper inquiry doth it make, and the more compleat union doth it seeke with that: the Heart and the Treasure can seldome be severed; the Eagles will alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to the body; <hi>Davids</hi> Love gave length and perpetuity to his meditation, even all the day.</p>

Which Spirits, being of a limited power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, doe therefore with the same force, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they carry the mind to the consideration of one thing, withdraw it from all other that are he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneall; no determined power of the Soule being able to impart a sufficient activity unto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

independing operations, when the force of it is exhausted by one so strong; and there being a sympathy, and as it were, a league between the faculties of the Soule, all covenanting not to obscure or hinder the Predominant Impressions of one another.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next in order is <hi>Hatred:</hi> of which the Schoole-men make two kinds; an <hi>Hatr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or loathing; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a <hi>pure aversion</hi> or flight of the Appetite from something ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as <hi>Evill,</hi> arising from a dissonancy and repugnancy betweene their natures: and an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Enmity,</hi> which is not a flying, but rather a <hi>pursuing Hatred,</hi> and hath ever some <hi>Love</hi> joyned with it, namely a Love of any Evill which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire may befall the person or thing which wee hate.</p>
            <p>I shall not distinctly handle these asunder, but shall observe the Dignities and Corruptions of the Passion in generall, as it implies a common <hi>disconvenience,</hi> and naturall <hi>Vnconformitie</hi> between the Object and the Appetite.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Object</hi> then of all <hi>Hatred</hi> is <hi>Evill;</hi> and all evill implying an opposition to Good admits of so many severall respects as there are kinds of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="1112" facs="tcp:16360:67"/>And there is first an <hi>Evill</hi> of <hi>Contraricty,</hi> such as is in the qualities of Water unto Fire, or a Wolfe unto a Sheepe, occasioned by that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> Efficiency, which one hath upon the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an <hi>Evill</hi> of <hi>Privation,</hi> which we hate formally and for it selfe, as implying nothing but a <hi>Defect</hi> and Absence of <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, an <hi>Evill</hi> of <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of any creature, oppos'd to its being. For <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> is that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes one of the principle objects of <hi>Love;</hi> Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, or Not being is the chiefest Evill of things, and that which Nature most abhorreth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, an <hi>Evill</hi> of <hi>Relation;</hi> for as things in their owne simple natures <hi>Evill,</hi> may have in them a <hi>Relative Goodnesse,</hi> and so to be desired; as the killing of beasts for the service, and the death of malefactors for the security of men: so things in their absolute being <hi>Good</hi> may have in them a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,</hi> or <hi>Comparative Evill,</hi> and in that sence bee by consequence hated; as our Saviour intimates <hi>He that hateth not father and mother, and his owne life for me, is not worthy of me:</hi> when they prove snares and temptations to draw us from the Love of Christ, they are then to bee undervalued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of him. And therefore we find in the Law if a mans dearest brother or child, or wife, or friend should entice him from God unto Idolatry, he was not to conceale, pitty, or spare him, but his owne hand was to bee first upon him. And thus the Poet hath elegantly expressed the behaviour
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16360:67"/>
of <hi>Aeneas</hi> toward <hi>Dido,</hi> who being inflamed with Love of him, would have kept him from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, unto which by divine guidance he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe to be directed.</p>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>So then we see what qualification is required in the <hi>Object</hi> of a just <hi>Hatred,</hi> that it be Evill, and some way or other offensive, either by defiling or destroying nature: and the Passion is ever then irregular when it declineth from this rule.</p>
            <p>But here, in as much as it is evident that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some evill comes under the Will of God; (<hi>Is there any Evill in a City, and the Lord hath not done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>) and our will is to bee conformable unto his; it may seeme that it ought to fall under our Will too, and by consequence to bee rather loved than hated by us, since wee pray for the fulfilling of Gods Will.</p>
            <p>For resolution of this, wee must first consider, that God doth not love those <hi>Evils</hi> which hee thus <hi>willeth,</hi> as formally, and precisely considered in themselves. And next wee will observe how
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16360:68"/>
farre the Will of God is to bee the rule of our will; whence will arise the cleare apprehension of that truth which is now set downe, that the unalterable <hi>Object</hi> of mans <hi>Hatred</hi> is all manner of <hi>Evill,</hi> not onely that of deformity and sinne, but that also of destruction and misery.</p>
            <p>First then for the Will of God, we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say what himselfe hath sworne, that hee will not the death or destruction of a sinner: and by consequence neither any other evill of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as being a thing infinitely remote from his mercy; he is not delighted in the ruine, neither doth hee find pleasure or harmony in the groanes of any thing which himselfe created: But hee is said to will those Evills as good and just, for the manifestation of his glorious <hi>Power</hi> over all the Creatures, and of his glorious <hi>Iustice</hi> on those, who are voluntarily fallen from him. But now because it is left onely to the Wisedome of God himselfe to know and ordaine the best meanes for glorifying of himselfe in and by his creatures, we are not here hence to assume any warrant for willing evill unto our selves or others, but then onely when the honour of the Creator is therein advanced. And so the Apostle did conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish evill unto himselfe, if thereby the glory of Gods mercy towards his Countrey-men the Iewes might be the more advanced.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is no good Argument, <hi>God willeth</hi> the inflicting of such an <hi>evill,</hi> therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull for my will to decline it: for first the Will of God, whereby hee determineth to worke
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16360:68"/>
this or that evill on particular Subjects, is a part of his <hi>secret Counsell.</hi> Now the <hi>Revealed,</hi> and not the <hi>Hidden Will</hi> of God is the rule of our Wills and Actions: whence it commeth to passe, that it is made a part of our necessary obedience unto God in our wishes or aversations to goe a crosse way to his unrevealed purpose. Peradventure in my sicke bed it is the purpose of God to cast my body into the earth, from whence it was taken; yet for me herein to second the Will of God by an execution thereof upon my selfe, or by a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of those Ordinary meanes of recovery which hee affords, were to despise his mercy, that I might fulfill his Will. Peradventure in my flight a sword will overtake mee, yet I have the warrant of my Saviours example and precept to turne my backe rather than my conscience in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: alwaies reserved, that though I will that, which God willeth, yet my will bee ever <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated</hi> unto his. Wee owe <hi>submission</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Gods purpose</hi> and Counsell, and wee owe <hi>conformity</hi> to the <hi>will</hi> of his <hi>Precept</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; we must submit to the will, whereby God is pleased to worke himselfe, and wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the will, whereby hee is pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to worke. And therefore</p>
            <p>Secondly, though the Will of God were in this case knowne, yet is not our will constrained to a necessary inclination, though it bee to an humble submission and patience in bearing that which the Wisedome and purpose of God hath made inevitable; for as the promises and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16360:69"/>
of Good things from God doe not warrant our slacknesse in neglecting, or our profanenesse in turning from them; so neither doth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and unavoidablenesse of a future evill (as death intended upon us by God) put any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity on our nature to deny it selfe, or to love its owne distresses.</p>
            <p>Of which that we may be the more sure, wee may observe it in him, who as hee was wholly like us in nature, and therefore had the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclinations and aversations with us; so was hee of the same infinite essence with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore did will the same things with him, yet even in him we may observe (in regard of that, which the Scripture saith, was by <hi>the hand and Counsell of God before determined</hi>) a seeming Reluctancy and withdrawing from the Divine Decree. He knew it was not his Fathers Will; and yet, <hi>Father, if thou bee willing, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t this cup passe from me:</hi> he was not ignorant that he was to suffer, and that there was an <hi>Oporte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> a necessity upon it, and yet a second and a third time againe, <hi>Father, if it be possible, let this Cup passe from me.</hi> Consider it as the <hi>Destruction</hi> of his Temple, and <hi>Anguish</hi> of nature, which hee could not (being in all things like unto us) but love; and then <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seat,</hi> Let it passe: but consider it as the <hi>necessary meanes</hi> of procuring pretious blessings for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and of fulfilling the eternall Decree of his Fathers Love, and then, <hi>Not as I, but as thou wilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same may be applied in any manner of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16360:69"/>
evills, notwithstanding we are with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>patience</hi> to sustaine them, or with an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>submission</hi> unto Divine pleasure to wait for them; yet in regard of that <hi>pressure</hi> of nature, which they bring with them (on which the God of Nature hath imprinted a naturall desire of its owne quiet and integrity) so farre forth all <hi>Evill,</hi> not onely may, but must bee <hi>Hated</hi> by every Regular will, upon paine of violating the Law of its Creation.</p>
            <p>And indeed in all this there is not any deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Will</hi> of God, intending that which we abhorre: for as it stands not with the nature of man to hate himselfe, or any good thing of his owne making; so neither doth it stand with the goodnesse of God to hate his Creature, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light barely in the misery or afflictions thereof; but onely in that end of manifesting his glory and righteousnesse, whereunto hee in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his Wisdome and Iustice hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully directed them. And therefore, as to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the Wisedome of God in thus ordering evills unto a good end, were a presumptuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining; so on the other side, not to entertaine those naturall desires of a straightned mind after deliverance from those evills, were to be in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> phrase <hi>too Righteous,</hi> and out of a purpose to answere the ends of Gods Wisedome, to crosse the Law of his Creation.</p>
            <p>So then it is evident that the <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cause</hi> of <hi>Hatred,</hi> is <hi>all</hi> and <hi>onely Evill:</hi> which (however in respect of the <hi>Existence</hi> of it, it bee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:16360:70"/>
in some cases <hi>Good;</hi> for as it is in the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to educe out of confusion order, light out of darkenesse, his owne honour out of mans shame; so is it his <hi>providence</hi> likewise to turne unto the great good of many men those things which in themselves doe onely hurt them) Yet I say this notwithstanding, as it worketh the deformity and disquiet of nature, it is against the created law and in-bred love, which each thing beareth to its owne perfection; and therefore cannot but be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily hated.</p>
            <p>As on the other side, those ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong goods, which we call, in respect of God, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as health, peace, prosperity, good successe, and the like; notwithstanding they commonly prove unto men, unfurnished with those habits of wisedome and sobriety, whereby they should bee moderated, occasions of much evill and dangers; so that their Table is become their snare (as the experience of those latter Romane Ages proveth, wherein their victories over men hath made them in luxury and vilenesse so prodigious, as if they meant to attempt warre with God.) Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I say all this; yet for as much as these things are such as doe quiet, satisfie, and beare convenience unto mans nature, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore justly with thankefulnesse by our selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and out of love desired unto our friends.</p>
            <p>I now proceed from the object or Generall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall cause of hatred, unto some few which are more particular, and which do arise from it.</p>

            <p>Another cause working <hi>Hatred</hi> of a thing in the minds of men, is the <hi>difficulty</hi> and conceited impossibility of obtaining it, if it bee a good thing which wee either doe or ought to desire, which the Casuists call <hi>Acedia,</hi> being a griese of the appetite looking on a <hi>Difficult Good,</hi> as if it were evill because difficult; from whence ariseth

a Torpor and Supine neglect of all the meanes, which might helpe us to it. Thus wicked and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved sinners, conceiving happinesse as unacqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by them, do grow to the Hating of it, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine rancorous affections against those, which perswade them to seeke it, to envie and maligne all such they find carefull to obtaine it; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto licentious resolutions of rejecting all hopes of thoughts of it, &amp; to divert their minds towards such more obvious and easie delight, as<note place="margin">Vid.

            <p>And this is one great cause of the different af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of men towards severall courses of life; one man being of dull and sluggish apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hateth Learning: another by nature quicke and of noble intellectualls wholly applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto it, the <hi>difficulty</hi> perswading the one to <hi>despise</hi> the <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> inducing the other to <hi>conquer</hi> the <hi>difficulties</hi> of it: so one man looking unto the <hi>paine</hi> of a vertuous life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes the <hi>reward;</hi> and another looking unto the <hi>Reward,</hi> endures the <hi>paine.</hi> And wee shall usually find it true, that either <hi>Lazinesse,</hi> fearing disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or <hi>Love</hi> being disappointed and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with difficulties which it cannot conquer, doth both beget a kind of Hatred and dislike of that which did either <hi>deterre</hi> them from seeking it, or <hi>deceive</hi> them when they sought it.

            </p>
            <p>And the reason is first, because injurie is the way to make a man, who is wronged, an enemy; &amp; the proper affection, which respecteth an enemy is Hatred. Againe, he who is wronged, if equall or above him that hath done the wrong, is then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and <hi>Oderunt quos metuunt,</hi> it is usuall to hate those whom we feare: if inferiour, yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and sight of him doth upbraid with guilt, &amp; affect with an unwilling &amp; unwelcome review of the sinne, whereby he was wronged; and Pride scornes reproofe, and loves not to be under him in Guilt, whom it overtops in Power: for Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence doth alwaies give a kind of superiority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the person that is wronged; besides, Hatred is a kind of Apologie for wrong: For if a man can perswade himselfe to hate him whom he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, he will begin to beleeve that hee deserved the injury which was offered unto him; every man being naturally willing to find the first induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his sinne, rather in another than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:16360:73"/>The next cause (which I shall observe) is <hi>Feare,</hi> I meane slavish Feare: for as Love excludeth Feare; so Feare begetteth Hatred; and it is ever seene: <hi>Qui terribiles sunt, timent:</hi> they that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others doe feare them, as well knowing that they are themselves hated: for as <hi>Aristotle</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Nemoquem metuit, amat;</hi> no man loves him whom he feares: which is the same with that of Saint <hi>Iohn, Love casteth out Feare:</hi> not a <hi>Reverend,</hi> submissive, awsull <hi>feare;</hi> not a <hi>cautelous,</hi> vigilant and obedient <hi>feare;</hi> not a <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>Admiration,</hi> nor a <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>Subjection;</hi> but a <hi>feare</hi> of <hi>slavery</hi> and of Rebellion, all flashes of Horrour, all the tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and shipwracks of a torne mind, all the tremblings of a tormented spirit; briefely all evill and hurtfull feare. And this I beleeve is one principall reason of that malice and contempt of godlinesse, which shewes it selfe in the lives of Atheisticall and desperately wicked men, which as it ariseth out of the corruption of nature, so is it marveilously enraged by the fearefull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that siery vengeance, which their pale and guilty consciences doe already preoccupate; for as their conscience dictates, that they deserve to be hated by God; so their stubbornesse and malice concludes that they will hate him againe; <hi>Let us eate and drinke, for toomorrow we shall dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be a double root of this <hi>Feare</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward. The <hi>outward</hi> is the cruelty and oppression which we suffer from the potent, and thereupon the lesse avoidable malice of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hated (as it was the speech of <hi>Caligula, Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:16360:73"/>
               <hi>dum metuant</hi>) And here in our Aversation (if it observe that generall rule of goodnesse in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Subordination to Reason and Piety) is, not onely allowable, but naturall, while it extends it selfe no further than the Evil which we wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully suffer. For I cannot but think that the spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and scourges, the thornes and buffets, the reed and knees of those mocking and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Iewes were so many drops of that full Cup, which He, who knew no sinne, was so deepely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to have passe from him.</p>
            <p>But then next, the <hi>inward</hi> root of Feare is the <hi>guilt</hi> and burthen of an uncleane and uncovered Conscience, for Pollution and weakenesse is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, must needs be fearefull. And therefore that inference of <hi>Adam</hi> had truth in it, <hi>I was afraid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was naked:</hi> for having disrobed himselfe of Originall righteousnesse, hee was thereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the curse and summons of an offended ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.

               <hi>Feare</hi> which is caused by a secret <hi>guilt</hi> of minde, is of all others most corrupt and rancorous, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an hatred of the Authors or Executioners of Iustice; of the equity and justnesse of whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, we are from within convinced; such as is the malice and blasphemy of malefactors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iudge, and of Devils and damned men against God and his righteous judgments, which yet they cannot but acknowledge that they most worthily doe endure: for it is the nature of proud and stubborne creatures (as was before observed) <hi>Odisse quos laserint,</hi> first to wrong God, and then to hate him.</p>
            <p>Another particular cause of this passion may be a <hi>Disparity</hi> of Affections and Desires: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there bee many times <hi>Hatred</hi> where there is <hi>Similitude</hi> (as those beasts and birds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hate one another, which feed upon the same common meat, as the Philosopher obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth)<note place="margin">Hist.

            <p>Now the <hi>Corruptions</hi> herein are to be attended according to the Nature of that <hi>disparity</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the passion is grounded; which sometimes is

               <hi>Morall,</hi> wherein it is laudable to hate the viti ous courses, in which any man differres from us, or we our selves from the right rule of Life; so that the passion redound not from the quality to the person, nor breake out into an endeavour of his disgrace and ruine, except it bee in such a case, when our owne dignity or safety, which wee are bound more to regard, being assaulted, is in danger to be betrayed, unlesse prevented by such a speedy Remedy. Sometimes this <hi>Disparity</hi> may be in actions <hi>Civill,</hi> and with respect to soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: and then as the opposition, which hatred dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth, may be principally seene in two things; <hi>Opposition</hi> of a mans <hi>Hopes,</hi> and of his <hi>Parts</hi> and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, by crossing the one, and undervalewing the other: So corruption may easily proceed from two violent and unreasonable grounds, <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Selfe-love;</hi> the one pursuing its hopes, the other reflecting upon its worth.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Proceed now unto the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Passion in the <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of its Acts: which must bee observed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Evill</hi> of the Object: for if that be <hi>unchangeable,</hi> there is required a continual <hi>Permanency</hi> of the Passion in regard of the disposition of the Mind: or if it be <hi>Importuna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> and Affaulting, there is required a more frequent <hi>repetition</hi> of the Act. The same likewise is to bee said of the <hi>Quality</hi> of it; for if the Evill be of an Intense and more Invincible nature, our Hatred must arme us the more: if more Low and remisse, the Passion may bee the more negligent.</p>
            <p>Hero then is a fourefould direction of the Quantities and Qualities of our Hatred, and it will hold proportion in the other passions. First the unalterablenesse of the Evill, warrants the continuance of our hatred. Secondly, the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and insinuation of it warrants the Reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hatred. Thirdly, and fourthly, the greatnesse and the Remission of it requires a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable intention and moderation of hatred.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:16360:77"/>
We may instance for the three former in sinne, so much the worst of Evils, by how much it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion from the best of Goods.</p>
            <p>First then <hi>Sinne</hi> is in its owne formall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted nature, <hi>Vnchangeable,</hi> though not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the subject, in whom it dwelleth; for a Creature now bad, may by the mercy of God bee repaired and restored againe; but this is not by a changing, but by a forsaking of Evill, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of it, not by a new molding it into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frame. Sinne then remaineth in its owne Nature unchangeable and alwaies evill, and the reason is because it is a Transgression of a <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law,</hi> and a Remotion from an <hi>unalterable Will:</hi> Sinne then is to bee hated with a continuall and peremptory hatred. But in other things there is according to the nature of their evils required a conditionall and more flexible dislike, they being evils that have, either some good annexed unto them; or such as are of a mutable nature. And therefore wee see that in most things the variety of Circumstances doth alter the good or evill of them, and so makes the passions thereabout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant, alterable likewise. Otherwise men may naturally deprive themselves of those contents and advantages, which they might receive by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable use of such indifferent things as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly for inconveniences now removed, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. And in <hi>Morality</hi> likewise much dammage might be inferred, both to private persons and to the publique by nourishing such private enmities and being peremptory in continuing those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:16360:77"/>
differences, which, though happily then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained upon reasonable grounds, may yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards prove so much the more harmefull, by how much the more danger is to be feared from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper of a growne and strong, than of a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and lighter passion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Againe as no evill altogether so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as <hi>Sinne,</hi> so is there nothing so much to be opposed with a <hi>Multiplicity</hi> and Reiteration of our hatred in regard of its <hi>importunity</hi> and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, that as there is an impudence in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, so there may be a proportionable resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the withstanding of it: Some Evils there may be, which require onely a present and not a customary exercise of this passion. Present I say when the Object is offensive and not customary; because as the Object, so the Passion likewise may be unusuall. Sinne onely is of all other evils the most urging and active, furnished with an infinite number of st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>atagems and plausible impostures to insinuate into natures (though best armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such assaults; and therefore here onely are necessary such reiterated acts, as may keepe us ever on our guard, that we be not unprepared for a surprize.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then for the <hi>Quantity</hi> of an Evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is not in any thing so <hi>intense</hi> as in <hi>Sinne</hi> whither wee consider it in its owne Nature, as a Rebellion against the highest good, or in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; either in regard of the diffusion of it, it being an overspreading pollution, or of the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, both in Guilt and Punishment: In
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16360:78"/>
these respects our <hi>Hatred</hi> of it cannot be too deep or rooted: whereas other evils are not so intense in their nature, nor so diffusive in their Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, nor so Destructive in their Consequents; and therefore do not require an unlimited Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but one governed according to the Exigence of Circumstances.</p>
            <p>And here I shall take notice of one or two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars touching the manner of corruption in this particular. As first when a man shal apply his <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Prosequution,</hi> or ill willing against that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which is the proper object onely of <hi>Aversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> for some things there are onely of conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall evills, which hurt not by their own absolute being, but by their particular use or presence, which being offensive onely in their applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requires a particular forbearance, not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violence to their natures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a Corruption in regard of Intension<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sophoc. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ax.</note> is either when the passion admits not of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of Love, when yet the object admits of an admixtion of good; or when the hatred is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute against onely relative Evills. There is not any man betwixt whose naturall faculties and some particular courses or objects, there is not some manner of antipathy and disproportion (it being the Providence of divine dispensation so variously to frame and order mens fancies, as that no man shall have an Independance or selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> say unto the other members I have no need of you; but there should bee such a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Ministry and assistance amongst men, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:16360:78"/>
whereby might bee ever upheld those essentiall vertues of humane society, <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> no mann being able to liue without the aide of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; nor to upbraid others with his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now in this case, if any man, who either out of the narrownesse and incapacity, or out of the reluctancy and antipathy of his owne mind, is indisposed for some courses of life or study, shall presently fall to a professed vilifying of them, or to an undervalewing of Persons, who with a more particular affection delight in them, or to a desire of the not being of them, as things utterly unusefull, because hee sees not what use himselfe can have of them, he doth herein disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as much absurdity in so peremptory a dislike as a blinde man should doe in wishing the Sunne put out, not considering that hee himselfe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth benefit at the second hand from that very light, the beauty whereof hee hath no immediate acquaintance withall.</p>
            <p>For as too excessively to doate on the fancie of any particular thing may prove harmefull, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Poeticall fable of <hi>Midas,</hi> whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable desire to have every thing that he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turned to gold, starved him with hunger; and so what hee out of too excessive loue made his Idoll, became his ruine; (as many men need none other enemy to undoe them than their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.) So on the other side, the extreame <hi>Hatred</hi> of any thing may be equally inconvenient; as we see intimated in that other fable of the servants, who when they had, out of an extreme malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:16360:79"/>
the poore Cock, at whose early crow, their covetous master every day roused them unto their labour, killed him, and so (as they thought) gotten a good aduantage to their lazinesse, were every day by the vigilancy of their master, whose Couetousnesse now began to crow earlier than his Cock, called from their sleepe sooner than they are before; till at length they began to wish for that, which the rashnesse and indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hatred had made away. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we goe about any thing out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Passion, it is a great point of Wisedom, first to consider whither we our selves may not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be the first men, who shall wish it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done againe.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Hatred worketh <hi>Confidence</hi> and some Presumption and good assurance of our owne, or some assisting strength against evils. Which ariseth first out of the former: for <hi>Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousnesse</hi> or Furniture against the onset of evil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make the mind more resolute in its owne defence, than if it were left naked without Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Againe, of all others, this is one of the most <hi>confident Passions,</hi> because it moves not out of sudden perturbations, but is usually seconded and backt with Reason, as the Philosopher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves;<note place="margin">Rb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>r. l. 2. c. 4.</note> and ever the more <hi>Counsell,</hi> the more <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> Besides, being a deepe and severe Passion, it proportionably calleth out the more strength to execute its purposes. There is no Passion, that intendeth so much evil to another, as <hi>Hatred; An-ger</hi> would onely bring <hi>Trouble;</hi> but <hi>Hatred, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe;</hi> Anger would onely <hi>Punish</hi> and Retaliate, but Hatred would <hi>Destroy;</hi> for as the Philosophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> notes, it seeketh the <hi>not being</hi> of what it Hates. A man may be Angry with his friend, but hee hates none but an enemy; and no man can will so much hurt to his friend, as to his enemy. Now the more hurt a passion doth intend, the more strength it must call out to execute that intention; and ever the more <hi>strength</hi> the more <hi>Confidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly it worketh some manner of <hi>Victory</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the evill hated: for <hi>Odium semper sequitur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:16360:81"/>
               <hi>animi elatione,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, It ever ariseth out of pride and height of mind <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Injury ever comes from some strength, and is a kind of Victory. For so farre forth as one is able to hurt another, he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him. And this effect holds principally true in morall and practick courses; wherein I think it is a generall Rule: Hee in some measure loves an evill, who is overcome by it: for conquest in this nature is on the Will, which never chooseth an object till it love it. There onely we can have perfect conquest of sinne, where will be a perfect hatred of it. Here, in the best, there is but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat restauration of Gods Image: the body of nature and the body of finne are borne, and must die together.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it hath a good effect in regard of the evill hated in reasonable Creatures, namely the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the person, in whom that evill was. For as countenance and incouragement is the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterer; so <hi>Hatred</hi> and contempt serveth sometimes as Phisick to purge out an evill. And the reason is because a great part of that goodnesse, which is apprehended to be in sinne, by those that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it, is other mens approbation. Opinion puts valew upon many uncurrent Coynes, which passe rather because they are receiued, than because they are warrantable. And therefore if a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally desirous of credit see his courses general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disliked, he can hardly so unnature himselfe, as still to to feed on those vanities, which hee seeth doe prouoke others unto loathing, though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16360:82"/>
it is not a perswasions of mens, but of Gods hatred of sinne, which doth worke a genuine and thorow Resormation.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to observe those Effects, which are corrupt and hurtfull: and here wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p>First, the rule of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose maxime it is, that <hi>Hatred</hi> is alwaies <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> against the <hi>whole kinde</hi> of its object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so then all the actions and effects of this Passion are corrupt, which are not <hi>Generall,</hi> but admit of private Reservations and Indulgences. For since tho nature and extent of the passion is ever considered with reference to its object, there must needs bee irregularity in that affection, when it is conversant about an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme nature with a various and differing moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this is manifestly true in that, which I made the principall object of a right hatred, <hi>Sin.</hi> In which, though there is no man, which finds not himselfe more obnoxious and open to one kind than another (it being the long experienced policie of the Devill to observe the diverse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of mens natures, constitutions, callings, and imployments; and from them to proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quality of his insinuations upon the will;) insomuch that a man may here in happily deceive himselfe with an opinion of loathing some evils, with which, either his other occasions suffer him not to take acquaintance, or the difficulty in compassing, disgrace in practising, or other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices perswade to a casuall dislike thereof, yet I say it is certaine, that if a mans <hi>Hatred</hi> of <hi>Sinne</hi> be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16360:82"/>
not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an <hi>Vniversall</hi> and transcendent Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against all sinne, even those which his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall relations make more proper unto him, if hee doth still retaine some privy exceptions, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and covered delights, be his pretences to others, or his perswasions to himselfe what they will, this is rather a personated than a true hatred a meteor of the braine, than an affection of the Soule. For as in the good, so in the ill of things; notwithstanding there seeme to be many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties and dissimilitudes (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) <hi>Scelera dissident,</hi> that sinnes do disagree; yet indeed there is in that very contrariety such an agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God (as in <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> against <hi>Christ</hi>) as admits not of any, in order unto God, but a gathered and united passion. And hence is that of Saint <hi>Iames, Hee that offendeth in one is guilty of all;</hi> because in that one hee contemneth that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Authority which forbad all. There are no tearmes of consistence betweene love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred divided upon the same uniforme Object. It is not the materiall and blind performance of some good worke, or a servile and constrained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the more bright and convicting parts of the Law, that can any more argue, either our true love to the Precept, or our hatred to the Sinne, than a voluntary patience under the hand of a Chirurgion can prove, either that we delight in our owne paine, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Abhorre our owne flesh. It is not Gods Witnesse within us, but his Word without us; not the Tyrannie of Conscience, but the goodnesse of the Law that doth kindly and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:16360:83"/>
genuinely restraine the violence, and stop the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our defiled nature. Or though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Feare may prevent the exercise and sprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, nothing but Love can pluck up the root of sinne.

            <p>Another corrupt Effect of <hi>Hatred</hi> is a sinister and crooked suspition, whereby with an envious and criticall Eye we search into the actions and purposes of another; and according as is the sharpnesse of our owne wits, or the course of our owne behaviour and practices, we attribute unto them such ends as were haply never framed but in the forge of our owne braines: Evill men

               </gap>riwise to have an humour of casting the worst glosses upon the Actions of another Man, where there is not palpable dissimulation, argues as great a want of Love. Wee seach for Evill in our selves to <hi>expell</hi> it; but wee search for evill in another to <hi>finde</hi> it. There is scarse a more hatefull quality in the eyes of God or Man, than that of the Herodians, to lye in wait to catch an innocent man, and then to accuse him.</p>
            <p>Another Effect which proceedeth from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <hi>Hatred,</hi> is proud and insolent carriage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee contemne the quality, or undervalue and villifie the Merit of a person. For though the Apostle hath in this respect of Pride and Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, opposed Knowledge unto Love: <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth;</hi> yet the opposition holdeth not there onely: For there is <hi>Tumor Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> as well as <hi>Tumor Cerebri;</hi> as well a stubborne as a learned Pride, a Pride against the Person, as against the weaknesse of our Brother, a Pride whereby wee will not stoope to a yeelding and reconciliation with him, as whereby wee will not stoop to the Capacitie and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of him; that is, the swelling of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and this of Knowledge.

And the reason I take it is, because Griefe is either for the Evill of another, and so it is ever the Effect of Love; or for the Evill which lyeth upon our selves, and so is the cause of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16360:91"/>
Humilitie; neither of which are agreeable with Hatred, whose property ever it is to conceive in it selfe some worth and excellency, by which it is drawne to a Contempt and Insolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another Man. And therefore as it was Pride in Men and Angels, which wrought the first Hatred between God and them; so the most proper and unseparable Effect of this hatred ever since is Pride.</p>
            <p>The last Corruption of this Passion is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, Contention</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> as the wise Man telleth us, <hi>Hatred stirreth up strife.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 12.</note> that worthy Effect of Love, which is contrary to this of Hatred, is called <gap reason="foreign">

Desires which are in their executions Turbid, or in their continuance Permanent, are no more likely to lead unto some farther end, than either a misty and darke, or a winding and circular way is to bring a Man at last unto his journeyes end; whereof the one is dangerous, the other vaine.

            <p>Lastly, there is one Corruption more in these <hi>unlimited Desires,</hi> they make a man <hi>unthankfull</hi> for<note place="margin">Sen. de Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Profession and Argument in a matter of greater consequence, <hi>I forget those things which are behind, and reach forth unto those things which are before.</hi> And secondly, though a man should looke backe; yet the thoughts of such a benefit would be but sleight and vanishing, because the Mind finding present content in the liberty of a roving Desire, is marvellous unwilling to give permanent entertainment unto thoughts of another Nature, which likewise (were they entertained) would be rather thoughts of murmuring than of thankful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fulnesse: every such man being willing rather to conceive the benefit small, than to acknowledge the vice and vastnesse of his owne Desires.</p>
            <p>The next rule which I observed for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:16360:109"/>
of these Passions, do respect those <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and more glorious Objects of Mans Felicity: And herein,</p>
            <p>1 Our <hi>Desires</hi> are not to be <hi>Wavering</hi> and In constant, but Resolute and full of Quicknesse and Perseverance: First, because though we be poore and shallow vessels; yet so narrow and almost shut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up are those passages, by which wee should give admittance unto the matter of our true happines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea so full are we already of contrary qualities, as that our greatest vehemency wil not be enough, either to empty our selves of the one, or to fill our selves with the other. And therefore the true <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> of this Nature are in the Scripture set forth by the most patheticall and strong similitudes of <hi>Hunger</hi> and <hi>Thirst;</hi> and those not common neither; but by the pant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Secondly, overy desirable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the higher it goes, is ever the more united within it selfe, and drives the faster unto an unity: It is the property of Errours to be at variance; whereas <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> and all the parts thereof doe mutually strengthen and give light unto each other: So likewise in things <hi>Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. l. 6. c. 12.</note> observed a connextion betweene all his morall vertues, whereby a man that hath one, is naturally drawne to a desire of all the rest: for the minde being once acquainted with the sweetnes of one, doth not onely apprehend the same sweetnesse in the others, but besides findeth it selfe not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently possest of that which it hath, unlesse it bee thereby drawne to procure the rest: all whose properties it is by an excellent mutuall service to give light and lustre, strength and validity, and in some sort greater Vnity unto each other.</p>
            <p>And lastly for the highest and divinest good; the truth of Religion, that is in it selfe most of all other One, as being a Beame of that Light and Revelation of that Will, which is Vnity it selfe. And therefore though we distinguish the Creed into twelve Articles, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them all but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> one Faith, as having but one Lord<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 5.</note> for the Object and End of them. Now then where the parts of good are so united, as that the one draweth on the other, there is manifestly required united desire to carry the soule thereunto.</p>
            <p>II. The last Rule which I observed was that our Desires ought not to bee faint and sluggish, but industrious and painefull, both for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us to avoid and withstand all oppositions and difficulties, which we are every where likely to meet withall in the pursuit of our happinesse; and also for the wise and discreet applying of the severall furtherances requisite thereunto. And indeed that is no True, which is not an Operative
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:16360:110"/>
Desire: a Velleity it may be, but a Will it is not. For what ever a man will have, hee will seek in the use of such meanes, as are proper to procure it. Children may wish for Mountaines of gold, and <hi>Balaam</hi> may wish for an happy death, and an A theist may wish for a soule as earthly in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as in Affection; but these are all the eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations rather of a Speculative fancie, than of an industrious affection. True desires as they are right in regard of their object, so are they labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in respect of their motion. And therefore those which are idle and impatient of any paines, which stand like the Carman in the Fable, crying to <hi>Hercules</hi> when his Wuine fluck in the mud to helpe it out, without stretching out his owne hands to touch it, are first unnaturall desires, it being the formall property of this Passion to put the Soule upon some motion or other. And therefore wee see wheresoever Nature hath given it, she hath given likewise some manner of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or other to serve it. And secondly they are by consequence undutifull and disobedient Desires, in that they submit not themselves unto that Law, which requireth that wee manifest the life and strength of our Love by the quicknesse and operation of it in our Desires. And lastly, such Desires are unusefull and fruitlesse: for how can an object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which standeth in a fixed distance from the Nature, which it should perfect, be procured by idle and standing affections? The desires of the sluggard (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) slay him, because his<note place="margin">Pro. 21. 25: 13. 4.</note> hands refuse to labour. These affections must
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:16360:110"/>
have life in them, which bring life after them: Dead desires are deadly desires.</p>

            <p>Other Objects there are of a wider nature than those, which concerne the Body; and they are <hi>both the Morall and Contemplative</hi> Actions of the Mind; To both which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath attributed<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 10. c. 7.</note> principally this passion; but more specially to the latter, whose object is more pure and whose Acts lesse laborious, as residing in that part of the Soule, which is most elevate from sense: and therefore most of all capable of the purest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest and unmixed Delights. Now every thing is the more free, cleare, independant; spirituall, by how much it is the more unmixed. And these are the choisest perfections, whereby the Soule may be filled with joy. It is true indeed, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the contemplations of the mind have annexed unto them both Griefe and Anxiety; but this is never naturall to the act of Knowledg, which is alwaies in its owne vertue an impression of Pleasure: But it ariseth either out of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of the Object, which dazleth the power; or out of the weaknesse and doubtings of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which hath not a cleare light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; or out of the admixtion and sleeping them in the Humours of the Affections, whereby men mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

            <p>
               <hi>Contemplation</hi> addes unto the Soule a double Delight: First, from it's owne property, it being the proper and naturall agitation of mans minde, insomuch that those things which wee abhorre to know experimentally, our curlous and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative nature desires to know speculatively. And
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:16360:114"/>
therefore the Devils first temptation was drawne from the knowledge as well of evill as good, for he knew that the minde of Man would receive content in the understanding of that, which in it's owne nature had no perfection in it.</p>
            <p>But then secondly, in the Object of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Contemplation ministreth a farther Ioy, in that it doth in some sort pre-unite our Soules and our Blessednesse together: and this is partly the reason why <hi>Aristotle</hi> so much advanceth his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative before his practique Felicity: For though this in regard of it's immediate reference unto Communion, be of a more spreading and diffusive Nature; yet certainly, in that sweetnesse of content, that serenity of Soule, that exaltation of thoughts which we receive from those noble motions of the higher Mind, the other doth farre in pleasure and satisfaction surpasse all active happinesse. And hence we see in the parts of Mans Body, those which are (if I may so speake) more contemplative, have precedence to those that are more practique. The parts of Vision are before the parts of Action; the right eye is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right hand. Thus we may observe in God himselfe (notwithstanding in him there can bee neither accession nor intermission of Delight) yet by way of expression to us ward, he did not in the creation of the World so much ioy in his <hi>fiat,</hi> as in his <hi>vidit;</hi> not so much when he gave his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures their <hi>Nature,</hi> as when he saw their <hi>Goodnesse:</hi> Nature being the Object of <hi>Power;</hi> but Goodnes the Object of <hi>Delight;</hi> and therefore the day of

his rest was more holy than the dayes of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that being appointed for the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as these were for the production of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>And as Contemplation by way of <hi>Prescience,</hi> when it looketh forward on good things hoped: So also by way of <hi>Memory,</hi> when it looketh back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and receiveth evill things escaped, doth minister matter of renewed Ioy. No Man looketh<note place="margin">Arist. Rbet. l. 1. c. 10.</note> on the Sea with more comfort, than he who hath escaped a shipwracke. And therefore when Israell saw the Egyptians dead on the Sea shore, the fear of whom had so much affrighted them before, they then sang a Song of Triumph. Past troubles doe season, and as it were ballace present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as the Snow in Winter increaseth the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spring.</p>
            <p>But in this particular of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the excellency of it, there may be Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Excesse (For in those matters of Delight, except they be such as are dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to our corrupt Nature, I meane divine things, wee seldome erre in the other extreme.) And that is, when wee doe not divide our selves between our parts, and let every one execute his proper function, so to attend upon meere mentall notions, as to neglect the practicall part of our Life, and withdraw our selves from the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and regard of humane society, is as wicked in Religion, as it would be in Nature monstrous to see a fire burne without light, or shine without heate (aberrations from the supreme Law being

in divine things impious as they are in naturall prodigious.)</p>
            <p>And therefore that vowed sequestration and voluntary banishment of Hermits and Votaries from humane society, under pretence of devoting themselves to Contemplation, and a fore-enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Light of God, is towards him as un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For <hi>Expectation</hi> of a thing makes the Minde feed upon it before hand, as young Gallants who spend upon their estates before they come to them, and by that meanes make them the lesse when they come. As sometimes it happeneth with choice and delicate stomackes. That the sight and smell of their meate doth halfe cloy and satiate them before they have at all tasted any of it: so the long gazing upon that which we Desire by <hi>Expectation</hi> doth as it were deflowre the Delight of it before fruition. Whereas on the other side, as the Poet expresseth it.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:16360:123"/>
Evill I say either formally, as in sinne, or paine, present, or feared: or privatively, such as is any good thing which we have lost, or whereof we doe despaire, or have beene disappointed. And this is in respect of its object as the former Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, either <hi>Sensitive</hi> or <hi>Intellectuall.</hi> Sensitive is that anguish and distresse of Nature which lyet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> upon the body. A Passion in this sense little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the advancement of Nature, being all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies joyned with some measure of its decay, but onely as it serves sometimes for the better forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it against the same or greater evils, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition as of corporeall delights, by custome to grow burdensome and distastefull, so of paines to become easie and familiar.</p>
            <p>The other and greater <hi>Griefe</hi> is <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> which in <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> phraise is, <hi>A wounded spirit;</hi> so much certainely the more quicke and piercing, by how much a spirit is more vitall then a body, besides the anguish of the soule, findes alwayes, or workes the same sympathy in the body, but outward sorrowes reach not ever so farre, as the spirituall and higher part of the soule. And therefore we see many men out of a mistake, that the distresse of their soules hath beene wrought by a union to their bodies, have volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily spoiled this, to deliver and quiet that.</p>
            <p>The causes of this Passion, are as in the former, whatsoever hath in it power to disturbe the mind by it's <hi>union</hi> thereunto. There are then two <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in respect of the <hi>Object,</hi> that it be <hi>Evill</hi> and <hi>Present. Evill</hi> first, and that not onely <hi>formally</hi> in it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:16360:123"/>
selfe; but <hi>apprehensively</hi> to the understanding. And therefore wee see that many things which are in their Nature <hi>Evill;</hi> yet out of the particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper of the Mind, and deceitfulnesse in them, may prove pleasant thereunto. And this is the chiefe Corruption of this Passion, I meane the misplacing, or the undue suspending of it: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though strictly in its owne property, it be not an advancement of Nature, nor addes any perfection; but rather weakens it; yet in regard of the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which it beares either to a superior Law, as testifying our Love unto the Obedience, by our griefe for the breach thereof: or to our consequent Carriage and Actions, as governing them with greater Wisedome and Providence, it may bee said to adde much perfection to the mind of man, because it serves as an inducement to more caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous living.</p>
            <p>The next Condition in respect of the Object, is, that it be <hi>Present,</hi> which may fall out either by <hi>Memory,</hi> and then our <hi>Griefe</hi> is called <hi>Repentance:</hi> or Fancy and <hi>Suspition,</hi> and so it may be called <hi>Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> of Mind: or by <hi>Sense</hi> and present union, which is the principall kind, and so I call it <hi>Anguish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, nothing can properly and truly worke <hi>Griefe,</hi> by ministry of <hi>Memory,</hi> when the Object or Evill is long since past; but those things which doe withall staine our Nature, and worke impressions of permanent deformity.

            <p>And the reason is because <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is better knowne, when it is in an nearer view of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and more unite thereunto. And the more we have of the knowledge of goodnesse, the more we have of the Desire of it, if any part be absent. Besides all greedinesse is attractive, and therefore the more we know of it, the faster we hasten to it. And it is the nature of good to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the sense of the remainders of evill. So that, though the number of our defects be lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the degrees of that good we have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto, yet the burthen and molestation of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16360:131"/>
them is increased, and therefore the more posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion we have of good, the greater is our wearine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> of evill, and the more Nature sceleth her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the more doth she desire her restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The next condition in the Object of our <hi>Hope</hi> is <hi>possibility,</hi> for though the will sometimes being inordinate may be tickled with a desire of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, under an implicit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> condition, if they were not so, yet no hope whither regular or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt can respect it's object under that apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It worketh two passions most repugnant to this, hatred and despaire, the one being a proud opposition, the other a dreadfull flight, from that good, in which the mind perceiveth an impossibility of attaining it. Now the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of possibility is nothing else but a conceit of the convenience and proportion, betweene the true <hi>meanes</hi> unto an end hoped, and the <hi>strength</hi> of those <hi>powers</hi> which are to worke or bestow them; or if they be such ends as are wrought without any such meanes, by the bare and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of the worker', it is an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of convenience, betwixt the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of him that bestoweth it.</p>
            <p>Here then because I finde not any arguments of large discourse in the opposite passion, (unlesse we would passe sró natural or morall unto Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall handling thereof) we may observe what manner of <hi>despair</hi> is only regular &amp; allowable, I mèan that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in matters of importance drives us
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16360:131"/>
out of our selves, or any presumption and opinion of our own sufficiency. But that despaire which riseth out of a groundlesse unbeliefe of the <hi>Power,</hi> or distrust of the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> of a superiour Agent (especially in those things which depend upon the Will and Omnipotency of God) hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble corruption in it, both in that it defiles, and in that it ruines Nature: <hi>defiles,</hi> in that it conceives basely of God himself, in making our guilt more omnipotent than his Power, and sinne more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than he is good: <hi>ruines,</hi> in that the minde is thereby driven to a flight and damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all the proper means of recovery.</p>
            <p>Of this kind of <hi>Despaire,</hi> there are three sorts: The one <hi>Sensual,</hi> arising out of an excessive love of Good, Carnal, and Present; and out of a secure contempt of Good, Spiritual, and Future.

Now in what man soever we finde these two unsupplyed, there is the root and fundamentall ground of Hope; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing for the defects of other conditions, the creature may be carried to the quite opposite Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of an apprehension of an inevitable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto evill, and utter banishment from the fountaine of good. So then of those three estates of man; the estate of <hi>Fruition,</hi> which is their <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> and rest; the estate of <hi>Travell,</hi> which is the day
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16360:133"/>
of worke, and the estate of <hi>damnation,</hi> which is the <hi>night</hi> of despaire: In the first we have the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment; in the third the finall overthrow; in the second the exercise of our Hopes:) because in that alone our <hi>Indigence</hi> may by Gods fulnesse be filled, and our <hi>Impotence</hi> by his Will and Power supplyed. In which respect, all men have roome for Hope to enjoy <hi>God</hi> their last <hi>Good;</hi> though not a hope of <hi>Confidence,</hi> assurance, and <hi>Expectation,</hi> which is peculiar only unto the godly (who alone have a present interest in his promises;) yet such a generall Hope as may well suffice to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The next cause of Hope is <hi>Experience</hi> and knowledge, both in the nature of the thing hoped for, and of the means conducing to the attain ment thereof.

There is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Feare; a Feare of Sinne and Shame; an Intellectuall Feare of <hi>Admiration,</hi> when the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Object dazleth our Eye; a Feare of <hi>Reverence;</hi> an <hi>Astonishing</hi> Feare, by reason of the <hi>Newnesse;</hi> and an <hi>Oppressing</hi> Feare, by reason of the <hi>Neerenesse</hi> and Inavoydablenesse of the Evill sea red. It is a Griefe, Trouble, Flight, Aversation of some approaching Evill apprehended, either as destructive, or as burthensome to our nature, and not easily resistable by our strength: For the qualification of the Object thereof, because it is in all circumstances like that of Hope (save in the Evill of it) I shall therefore forbeare to touch it, and shall onely in briefe consider the Dignities and Defects thereof in its Causes and Effects.</p>
            <p>Fear is an humbling &amp; debasing Passion, which
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16360:150"/>
alwaies importeth some manner of servitude and subjection in whom it resideth; So then as in the former Passion of <hi>Hope</hi> I noted the fundamentall cause thereof to be <hi>Weaknesse</hi> and <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> and <hi>Subjection;</hi> whereof the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a disability in us to resist, the other a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to undergoe an evill.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that wee feare the displeasure of Great men; or the Power of Vnjust men; or the Competition of Popular and Plausible men; or<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Rubor est virtutis color,</hi> that Shame and Vertue have the same colour (which makes it seeme a companion rather of Perfection than of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; yet indeed it is rather a signe of a mind ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously disposed in restifying the quicke appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensivenesse of its own defects, than any Adjunct of Vertue it selfe.</p>
            <p>So then the Roots of this Passion are <hi>Weaknesse</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> both together; so that where either
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16360:151"/>
condition is wanting, there is not any proper ground of Feare, and therefore wee see sundry times strength takes off the yoake of Obedience, not only in the civill government of men, but in the naturall government of creatures by men, to whom by the law of Creation they were all made subject; yet the strength of many of them hath taught them to ferget their originall Subjection, and in stead of Fearing, to terrifie man their lord; and when ever we tame any of them, and reduce them to their first condition: this is not so much an act of our <hi>Dominion,</hi> wherby we awe them, as of our <hi>Reason,</hi> whereby we deceive them; and we are beholding more therein to the working of our Wit, than to the prerogative of our Nature; and usually every thing which hath knowledg enough to measure its owne abilities; the more it hath of <hi>Strength,</hi> the lesse it hath of <hi>Feare;</hi> that which <hi>Solomon</hi> makes the strongest, the Apostle makes the fittest to expell Peare, to wit, Love.</p>
            <p>So likewise on the other side, <hi>Immunity from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> in the midst of Weaknesse removes <hi>Feare.</hi> Of this we may give an instance in guilty persons, who notwithstanding their Weaknesse; yet when once by the priviledge of their Sanctuary or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their Iudge they are freed from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, though not from the Offence; their former Feares doe presently turne into Ioy and Gratulations: and that is the reason why Good men have such Boldnesse, Confidence, and Courage, that they can bid defiance unto Death; because though they be not quite delivered from
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16360:151"/>
the Corruption; yet they are from the Curse and Condemnation of Sinne, though by reason of their Weaknesse they are not delivered from the mouth; yet they are from the teeth and stings of Death; though not from the Earth of the Grave; yet from the Hell of the Grave; though not from Sinne; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Where first two things are to be granted, one concerning the Body, and the other the Mind. The first is, that the Spirits being of the most strong, subtle, and quicke motion, are the principall Instruments of Entercourse, either in Negotiation to, or Service from Reason: the other, that the Mind being of a Spirituall and Elevating Nature, retaines then the perfectest power of Operation, when it least of all suffers the Incursion of grosser Passions, which yet I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not of all manner of Ministry and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of Appetite, with Reason (as if the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motions of inferiour powers did not serve to sharpen the Counsels of the higher) but onely of Invasion and Tyranny.</p>
            <p>Which granted, wee may observe all the three former causes of Weaknesses in an Extremity of <hi>Feare.</hi> For first there is a Confused and Vnser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable mixture of <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Reason:</hi> The <hi>Passion</hi> with too much outrage and assault breaking in, and distracting the advices of <hi>Reason,</hi> which is

Secondly, there is <hi>Tumult</hi> and Disorder amongst the Spirits, which is <hi>Civill Dissention.</hi> Thirdly, there is a Retyring of them to the principall Castle or Fort, the Heart, whereby the Outward Quarters are left Naked and Vngarrison'd; which though it be a strengthning of the Better, yet it is a Weakning of the Major part, and this answereth unto Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying or Vacuity.

For a neglect of worth and good parts (unlesse, as sometimes it falleth out, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Basenesse and Ignorance) is an injury from Worth also: but a Neglect, and despising men already downe, is an injury from stomacke and height of mind; wherein the party offended cannot labour so much to cleere it selfe from the Imputation, as to revenge it selfe for it.</p>
            <p>Another reason why <hi>Weaknesse</hi> the better dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a man to Anger, may be, because such men are most <hi>Tender</hi> to feele an injury, most <hi>Suspitious</hi> to feare it, and most <hi>Interpreting</hi> to over-judge it. All which being circumstances of aggravation to increase a wrong, are likewise good means to adde degrees and heat unto our Passion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to give a reason of both these two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer causes together, it may be a Disappointment and Frustrating of Expectation: For men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and worth, expect rather Approbation and Imitation than Contempt. And men weake and defective, expect Compassion to cover, and not Pride to mocke, and so double their wounds: and both these are in some sort debts of Nature,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:16360:176"/>
it being the Law of Reason to honour Merit, as it is the Law of Mercy to cover Nakednesse: and for both I am sure it is the Law of Charity, as not to vaunt or be puffed up in our selves: so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rejoyce or thinke evill of another: and we may well conceive Anger will be strong, when it thinks it selfe lawfull.</p>
            <p>Vnto this particular of <hi>Weaknesse</hi> wee may also reduce that which the Grammatian hath obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on <hi>Virgil, Plus Irarum advenit, cum in manus non potest venire, cui irascimur.</hi> Anger is increased when it cannot reach the thing with which it is angry. And therefore the chaining up of Woolves and Mastives enrageth them, because it restraineth them; which the Poet hath excellently described.<note place="margin">

            <p>The last Qualification of the Subject, whereby he is made more Inclinable to this Passion, is a suspitious, apprehensive, and interpreting fancy, ready to pick out injury where it cannot be justly found; and (that its Anger may be imployed) to frame occasions unto it selfe.

               <hi>Curiosus.</hi> He which is too wise in his judgement on other mens Errours, will be easily too foolish in the nourishing of his owne Passion: and its commonly seen in matters of censure and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more sight and reason goes out, the lesse useth to abide within. Now is it hard for a man,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16360:177"/>
if he be peremptorily possessed with this opinion; yet he is a common subject of others contempt, to find out, either in defects of Nature, or rudenes of custome, habit, education, temper, humour or the like, some probable ground or other for excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which yet when it is further inquired into, will prove rather strangenesse than injury.</p>
            <p>And this is generally a Corruption of Anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, because it is hereby oftentimes unjust, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fastning it selfe there where it was justly neglected: for we may ever observe that Suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceeds from Guilt, and none are more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of being neglected than those that deserve it: as it is observed of some reproachfull speeches, which a Senatour was accused to have uttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the honour of <hi>Tiberius: Quia ver a erant dicta credebantur.</hi> His suspitious mind was persuaded that they had been spoken, because hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious that they had been acted; and therefore (as was before noted) it was the custome under such men to avoid all manner of Curiosities, and search into things done by them, which might easily be subject unto sinister judgement; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to affect Ignorance with Security, than to be ruined with wisedome. And next it is corrupt, because it is rash and hasly, being led by a halfe judgement, the worst guide to a headlong and blind Passion.</p>
            <p>The next degree of causes is of those which qualifie the <hi>Agent,</hi> or him that worketh the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and there may be amongst many other, which cannot be reckoned, these generall ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:16360:177"/>First <hi>Basenesse,</hi> which works a double cause of Anger: One for an injury of Omission, in negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting those respects which are required in men of meane and inferiour ranke towards their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: Another for a positive enquiry in the evill exercised against them. And many times the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alone is a cause of Anger, without the later: For this distance of persons doth quite alter the nature of our Actions, insomuch that those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, which are commendable and plausible toward our equals, are rude and irreverend toward those that are above us: and this is that which makes the wrath of God in the Scripture to bee set out so terrible unto us: because of the infinite distance between the Vnmeasurable Glory of the Maker of the World, and the basenesse of sinners; and therefore the comparison which useth to bee made for the defence of Veniall sinnes, that it is altogether unlikely that God, infinitely more merciful than men, should yet be offended at that which a mans neighbour would pardon him for, as a foolish angry word, or the stealing of a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or the like, is without reason: because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man there is a Community both in nature and weaknesse; and therefore,</p>

            <p>The next Quality in the Injurer, which may raise this Passion is Impudence, either in words or carriage. And the reasons hereof may be:</p>
            <p>First, because as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes, all Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is joyned with some Contempt, which is the Fundamentall and Essentiall Cause of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because all Impudence is bold, stiffe and contentious, which are all incitements to this Passion. For as Shame being a Degree of Feare works an acknowledgement of our owne weaknesse; and therefore a submission to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer<note place="margin">

            <p>Thirdly, those things which we Impudently do, we do willingly likewise. And therefore wee shall observe in the Scripture how reigning sins that is, those which are done with greedine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>se of the appetite, and full consent of the will, are set forth by the names of Stubbornnesse, Rebellion, whorish Fore-head, Brasse, and Yron. Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more aggravate a wrong then this, that it proceeded from the will of man. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are,</p>
            <p>First, because a mans <hi>Power</hi> is in his <hi>Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:16360:178"/>
Passions and other blind Agents, when they work ungoverned, are our Imperfections, and not our Power; and therefore the easier borne withall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to a Plenary, Spontaneous Action, (such as I take most of Impudence to be) there are required <hi>Antecedenter,</hi> Deliberation, Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Assent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Consequenter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Resolution, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, and Constancy. All which, as they take away the two principall conditions required unto Lenity; Consession and Repentance: so likewise doe they adde much to the weight of an injury, because an actition which is thus exercised, is a worke of the whole Man, and imployes a perfect consent thereunto: so a perfect and compleat en mity toward the person offendeth thereby. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others are but the wrongs of some part, such as are of those of the wil, led by an ignorant; or those of Passion, led by a traduced Vnderstanding; and they too not of a part regular, but of an Vnjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Paralyticke part, which followes not the motion of a stayed reason; and therefore as they proceed from more disorder in our selves, so doe they worke lesse in the party offended.</p>
            <p>Another thing which may raise and nourish this Passion, is any degree of <hi>neer Relation</hi> between the parties; whether it be Naturall by Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity; or Morall, by Society, Liberality, or any<note place="margin">

For as it is prodigious in the Body Naturall to see one member wrong and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke another: so in Vnions Civill or Morall, it is strangely offensive to make a divulsion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are more angry for the neglect offered us

            <p>And the reason why this difference between men neerly referring each other should worke a greater Anger between them, is: First, because herein we may finde that which before I observed as a furtherance to this Passion, Disappointment, and frustrating of Expectation: For in this case, we expect Sympathy &amp; not Division. Secondly, because all Anger is a kind of dis-joyning or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion of things before joyned: there therefore, where is the greatest Vnion, must needs bee the strongest and most violent separation; as in the Body, the Divulsion of Soule is more horrible than of an Arme, or some other member; because the one is an Essentiall, the other onely an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall Vnion: and so it is with those who are by bloud or friendship made one; as the dividing of them is more strange and violent, so doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a stronger Passion.</p>
            <p>Another cause of this Passion in respect of the Injurer, may be a too great Freedome and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet use of speech; especially if it be in way of correction and rebuke: For as <hi>Solomons</hi> speech is true, <hi>Mollis responsio frangit Iram,</hi> a soft answer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies wrath: so on the contrary it is true likewise, <hi>Dura Correptio unit Iram;</hi> that an harsh rebuke knits it. Anger is by nothing more nourished than by much speaking, though not in the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y that speaketh; because Speech is to Anger, like Teares
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:16360:179"/>
to Griefe, a spending and venting of it, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in another, unto whom we minister farther matter of offence. To which purpose, is that speech of <hi>Syracides. Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heape not wood upon his fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Cause, which I shall observe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Difference, whether it be in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or in Inclinations: because this must needs be ever joyned with some undervaluing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans choice and judgement; which if it be not seasoned with much sobriety, will easily induce a man to beleeve, that it proceeds not from Zeale to Truth, but from a humour of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Wherewith many men are so farre pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, that one must hardly dare to speake the truth in their company for feare of endangering it and them. Like <hi>Chry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The last cause which I shall note of this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is in him, who offends us, his very Abilities, when we see them neglected: for this provokes to more displeasure, then naked impotency. Weaknesse, when it miscarries, is the object of Pitty: but strength, when it miscarries, is the object of Anger.</p>

Now the only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which caused S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austin</hi> herein to haesitate, seemeth to have been the difficulty of traducing <hi>Originall sinne</hi> from the Parents to the Children. For saith he (writing unto S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierome</hi> touching the Creation of the Soule) If this Opinion doe not oppugne that most fundamentall faith of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne,</hi> let it then be mine, but if it doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it, let it not be thine.</p>
            <p>Now since that Opinion which denieth the <hi>Traduction,</hi> seemeth most agreeable to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance of the soule, I shall here produce some few reasons for the <hi>Creation,</hi> and solve an argument or two alledg'd for the <hi>Traduction</hi> of the Soule, reserving notwithstanding unto my selfe, and others, the liberty and modesty of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austins</hi> haesitation, which also I finde allowed<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 5.</note> by the Holy Ghost himselfe.</p>
            <p>Two things there are of certainty in this point. 1. That the soule is not any corporeall Masse or substance measurable by quantity, or capable of substantiall augmentation. 2. That
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:16360:186"/>
the <hi>Traduction</hi> of one thing out of another, doth connotate these two things, That the thing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced doth derive Being from the other, as from its original principle; &amp; that this derivation be not any other manner of way, but <hi>Ratione semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ali, &amp; per modum decisionis,</hi> by a seminall way, and the decision, seperation, or effluxion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the other: which things being laid, The Arguments against <hi>Traduction</hi> are these.</p>
            <p>First, the testimonies of Holy Scripture, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God the <hi>Father of spirits,</hi> as our naturall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent the <hi>Father of our bodies, Iob</hi> 33. 4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Esa</hi> 57. 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 22. 27. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 1. which though they doe not according to the judgement of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Aug.</hi> conclude the point by infallible consequence, yet doe they much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the probability of this Opinion.</p>
            <p>2. To have Being by <hi>Traduction,</hi> is, when the soule of the Child is derived from the soule of the Parent, by the meanes of Seed: but the Seed of the Parent cannot reach the Generation of the soule, both because the one is a Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the other a Spirituall substance, uncapable of Augmentation, or Detriment. Now that which is <hi>spirituall,</hi> cannot be produced out of that which is corporeall: neither can any Seed be discinded or issue out from the soule, being <hi>substantia sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lex, &amp; impartibilis,</hi> a substance simple, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.</p>
            <p>3. That which is <hi>separable</hi> from the body, and can subsist and work without it, doth not depend in its Being or making upon it; for if by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:16360:187"/>
of the Body the soule be generated, by the corruption of the Body it would be corrupted; for every thing that is generable, is corruptible. But the Soule can subsist and work without the Body; therefore it doth not from corporeall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration derive its Being.</p>
            <p>4. If the Soule be seminally traduced, it must he either from the body, or from the soule of the Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not from the Body, for it is impossible for that which is not a body, to be made out of that which is a Body, no cause being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an effect out of its owne spheare, and more noble than it selfe; not from the soule, because that being a spirituall and impartible substance, can therefore have nothing severed from it by way of substantiall seed unto the constitution of another soule.</p>
            <p>5. If there be nothing taken from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of which the soule is formed, then it is not traduced by naturall generation: but there is nothing taken from the Parents, by which the soule is formed; for then in all Abortions and miscarrying Conceptions, the seed of the Soule would perish, and by consequence the soule it selfe would be corruptible, as having its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from corruptible seed.

And so <hi>Lactamius</hi> (whom I doe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to finde numbred amongst the Authors that affirme the Traduction of the soule, by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and the Author of the Dialogue amongst the works of <hi>Hierome</hi>). It may be questioned (saith he) whether the soule be generated out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, or both. Neither of all three is true; Because the seed of the Soule is not put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body by either, or both of these. A Body may be borne out of their Bodies, because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be out of both contributed; but a Soule cannot be borne out of their Soules, in as much as from so spirituall and incomprehensible a substance nothing can issue forth or be severed for that use.

And if it were not in the loynes of <hi>Adam,</hi> then neither did it sinne in his loynes; whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle expresly telleth us, that by one Man sinne came into the world, and that in one all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that not only by imputative participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by naturall Propagation, deriving an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haerent habituall pollution, which cleaveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably to the soule of every man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the world, and is the fruit of <hi>Adams</hi> loynes.</p>
            <p>Unto which Argument to omit the different resolutions of other men touching the pollution of the Soule by the immediate contact of the flesh, and the Parents attinging the ultimate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Body, upon which naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Union of the Soule, (God being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to work ordinarily according to the exigence of second causes, and not suffering any of them to be in vain for want of that concurrence, which he in the vertue of a <hi>first and supreame cause</hi> is to contribute unto them.) I shall set downe what I conceive to be the Truth in this point.</p>
            <p>First then, it is most certaine that God did not implant <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> not take away <hi>Originall righteousnesse</hi> from Man, but man by his Praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation<note place="margin">Aug. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:16360:188"/>Secondly, Originall injustice as it is a sinne, by the default and contraction of Man, so it is also a punishment by the ordination, and disposition of Divine Justice. It was mans sinne to cast away<note place="margin">Aug. contr. Iul. l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> the Image of God; but it is Gods just judgement (as hee hath that free dispensation of his owne Gifts) not to restore it againe in such manner as at first he gave it unto that nature which had so rejected and trampled on it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In this <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> there are two things considerable, The <hi>Privation</hi> of that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, which ought to be in us; and the <hi>lust</hi> or <hi>Habituall concupiscence,</hi> which carrieth Nature unto inordinate motions. The <hi>Privation</hi> and want of Originall justice is meritoriously from <hi>Adam,</hi> who did voluntarily deprave, and reject that Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall rectitude which was put into him, which therefore God out of his most righteous and free disposition is pleased not to restore unto his Nature in his posterity againe. In the <hi>habituall lust</hi> are considerable these two things <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> The sinfull <hi>disorder</hi> of it, And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne by it. Consider it is as a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Adams</hi> first Praevarication; and so, though it be not efficiently from God, yet it falls under the Order of his Justice, who did most righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously forsake <hi>Adam,</hi> after his wilfull fall, and leave him in the Hand of his owne Counsell, to transmit unto us that Seminary of sinne which himselfe had contracted.</p>
            <p>But if we consider it <hi>as a sinne,</hi> we then say that the <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> cause of it, is <hi>lapsed nature</hi>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:16360:189"/>
               <hi>whole and entire</hi> by Generation and Seminall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction derived upon us. But the <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ter cause</hi> is that, from which wee receive and derive this Nature. <hi>Nature</hi> I say first <hi>fallen;</hi> for unto Nature Innocent belonged Originall Righteousnesse, and not Originall sinne.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Nature derived</hi> by ordinary generation as the fruit of the loynes, and of the womb. For though Christ had our Nature, yet hee had not our sinne.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Nature whole and entire.</hi> For neither part (as some conceive) is the Totall spring and fountain of this sinne. For it is improbable that any staine should be transfused from the Body to the Soul, as from the foule vessell to the cleane water put into it. The Body it selfe being not Soly and alone in it selfe corrupt and sinfull; else, all Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortions and miscarrying conceptions should be subject to damnation. Nothing is the seat of sin which cannot be the seat of Death the wages of sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Originall sinne</hi> therefore most probably see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to arise by <hi>Emanation,</hi> partiall in the parts, totall in the whole; from Mans <hi>Nature as guilty, forsaken,</hi> and <hi>accursed</hi> by God for the sinne of <hi>Adam.</hi> And from the parts not considered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in themselves, but by vertue of their concurrence and <hi>Vnion,</hi> whereby both make up one compounded Nature. Though then the Soule be a partiall subject or seat of Originall sinne; yet wee have not our sinne and our soule from one Author; because sinne followes not
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:16360:189"/>
the <hi>part,</hi> but the <hi>Nature</hi> whole and entire. And though we have not from our Parents <hi>Totum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> yet we have <hi>totam naturam,</hi> wee have our whole nature, though not every part of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Even as <hi>whole Christ</hi> was the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> who therefore by vertue of the Communication of properties in Christ, is justly called <gap reason="foreign">

Our next <hi>Parents,</hi> the instrumentall and <hi>immediate</hi> cause of this sinne in us, not by way of Physicall Emission or Transmigration of sinne from them to us, but by secret <hi>contagion,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaks.<note place="margin">Contr.

               <hi>Spirituality</hi> of the soule; as first, the <hi>manner</hi> of its <hi>working,</hi> which is <hi>immateriall</hi> by conceiving objects, as <hi>universall,</hi> or otherwise purified from all grosnesse of matter, by the Abstraction of the <hi>Active understanding,</hi> whereby they are made in some sort proportionall to the nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect Passive, into which the species are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, its in <hi>dependance</hi> on the body, in that manner of working; for though the operations of the soule require the concurrence of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsense</hi> and <hi>imagination,</hi> yet that is by way only of conveyance from the <hi>object,</hi> not by way of assistance to the elicite and immediate act. They only present the <hi>species,</hi> they doe not qualifie the <hi>perception. Phantasmata</hi> are only <hi>objecta operation is;</hi> the objects they are, not <hi>instrumenta operandi,</hi> the instruments of the soules working. The <hi>Act of understanding</hi> is immediatly from the soule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least concurrences of the body there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto, although the things whereon that act is fixed and conversant, require, in this estate, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily organs to represent them unto the soule; as light doth not at all concurre to the act of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which solely and totally floweth from the visive faculty, but only serves as an extrinsecall assistance for qualification of the <hi>Medium</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

that must be seene. And this reason <hi>Aristotle</hi>
               <note place="margin">lib. 3. de Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>a. cap. 5.</note> hath used to prove, that the understanding, which is principally true of the whole soule, is not mixt with any body, but hath a nature altogether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers there-from, because it hath no bodily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, as all bodily powers have, by which it is enabled to the proper acts that belong unto it. And hereon is grounded another reason of his, to prove the <hi>Soule immateriall,</hi> because it depends not on the body in its operations, but educeth them immediately from within it selfe, as is more manifest in the <hi>Reflexion</hi> of the soule, upon its owne nature, being an operation (as hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 6.</note> speaketh) <hi>seperable there-from,</hi> the soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only <hi>actus informans,</hi> a forme informing, for the actuating of a body, and constitution of a compound substance, but <hi>actus subsistens</hi> too, a forme subsisting; And that <hi>per se,</hi> without any necessary dependance upon matter. It is an act, which worketh as well in the body, as whereby the body worketh.</p>
            <p>Another reason of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the same place, is the difference betweene <hi>Materiall</hi> and <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall powers.</hi> For (saith he) all bodily cognosci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculties doe suffer offence and dammage from the too great excellency of their objects, as the eye from the brightnesse of the Sunne, the eare from the violence of a sound, the touch from extremity of heat or cold, and the lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. But the <hi>understanding</hi> on the contrary side is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the worthiest contemplations, and the better enabled for lower enquiries. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:16360:192"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> placeth the most compleat happinesse of man, in those heavenly intuitions of the minde, which are fastned on the divinest and most remote objects; which in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is nothing else, but a fruition of that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall vision (which, as farre as Nature goes, is call'd the <hi>contemplation of the first cause</hi>) and an eternall satiating the soule with beholding the Nature, Essence, and glory of God.</p>
            <p>Another reason may be drawn from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Vnderstandings Objects,</hi> which have so much the greater conformity to the soule, by how much the more they are divine and abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <hi>Hoc habet animus argumentum suae divinitatis,</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca) quòd illum divina delectam.</hi> This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of its divinenesse hath the minde of man, that it is delighted with divine things; for if the soule were corporeal, it could not possibly reach to the knowledge of any, but materiall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and those that were of its owne Nature; otherwise we might as well see Angels with our eyes, as understand any thing of them in our minds. And the ground of this reason is, that axiome in Philosophy, that all reception is <hi>ad modum recipientis,</hi> according to the proportion and capacity of the receiver. And that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are spirituall and divine, have greatest proportion to the soule of man, is evident in his Understanding and his will, both which are in regard of truth or good unsatisfiable, by any materiall or worldly objects, the one never rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in enquiry, till it attaine the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:16360:193"/>
the other never replenished in desire till it be admitted unto the perfect possession of the most divine and spirituall good: to wit, of him who is the first of Causes, and the last of Ends.</p>

            <p>Another reason may be the same which was alledged for the <hi>spirituality</hi> of the soule, namely <hi>independance in operation,</hi> and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in <hi>Being</hi> upon the body. And that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependance
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:16360:194"/>
is manifest, First, because the acts of the soule are educ'd immediately in it selfe, without the Intercedence of any organ whereby sensitive faculties work. Secondly, because the soule can perceive and have the knowledge of truth of <hi>universals,</hi> of <hi>it selfe,</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> can assent, discourse, abstract, censure, invent, contrive, and the like; none of which actions could any wayes be produced by the Intrinsecall concurrence of any materiall faculty. Thirdly, because in <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Extasies,</hi> the soule is (as it were) drawne up above and from the body, though not from <hi>informing</hi> it, yet certainely from borrowing from it any assistance to the produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its operation.

For that which hath not only beene observed and honour'd by those who have scarce had any forme of a civill Regiment amongst them, but even generally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto by the opinions and practice of the whole world, is not a Law of Policie and civill Institution, but an inbred and secret Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dictated by the consciences of men, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, without and above any humane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Nor else is it possible for Legall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and the closest and most intricate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of Humane Policy so much to entangle the hearts of men (of themselves enclinable to liberty) nor to fetter their consciences, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by only to bring them to a regular conformity unto all government for feare of such a God, to whose Infinitnesse, Power and Majestie they As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent by none but a civill Tradition. It must be a visible character of a Deitie acknowledged in the Soule, an irresistible Principle in Nature, and the secret witnesse of the heart of man, that must constraine it unto those sundry religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (observed among all Nations) wherein even

Is not our heart made the Naturall center of feares and sorrowes? and our Minds, as it were, Hives to entertaine numberlesse swarmes of stinging and thorny Cares? Are wee not Vassals and Slaves to many distempered passions? Have not our very Contents their terror, and our Peace distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance? Are not all our Comforts, wherewith wee strive to glut and stuffe our selves here, the glorious Vanities, and golden delusions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senages of the world? And how miserable must their miseries be, whose very happinesse is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy? And for Reason, what comfort could wee finde in it, when it would alwayes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting unto us the consideration of an eternall losse of all our contentments, and still affright us with the dark and hideous conceit of Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Mortality and Corruption makes Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonablenesse a Priviledge; And in this case the Beasts would be so much the more happy than Man, by how much the lesse they know their owne wretchednesse. An Atheist would be in this life farre happier than he is, if he could bring himselfe to have as little Reason as he hath Religion.</p>
            <p>Another Reason may be taken from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mans reasonable Faculties. To every Power in Man, as God hath assigned a peculiar operation, so likewise hath hee given it Objects of equall extent thereunto, which are therefore able to accomplish its naturall desires, whereby
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:16360:197"/>
it fasteneth on them. And for this cause from the Nature of the Objects, wee easily rise to know the Nature both of the Faculties and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for from the Essence flowes naturally the Faculty, from the Faculty is naturally educed the Operation, which requires naturally Objects proportionall, convenient, satisfactory, and of equall extent. Where therefore no mortall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject beares full convenience, nor is able to satiate and quiet the Faculty, there it and the Essence, from which it flowes, are both immortall. Now we see sensitive Powers finde in this life full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as the Sight from all the Variety of Colours, the Eare of sounds, and the like: only the Reasonable Parts, the Understanding, and the Will can never be replenished in this estate of Mortality.

It is naturall for gaining of Knowledge to hasten un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that whereby we loose both it and our selves? and to labour for such a purchase, which like lightning is at once begun and ended, yea indeed sooner lost than gotten? Certainly were man not conscious of his owne immortality, there

            <p>Another Reason may be framed after the same manner, as was that to prove the <hi>Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Soule from the manner of its operation. And it is grounded on those two ordinary Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes in Philosophy, That <hi>every thing is received according to the quality of the Receiver,</hi> and that <hi>every thing hath the same manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ssence, as it hath of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Now the Soule of Man can easily receive impressions and conceits of immortality, and discourse thereupon: therefore also it is in its owne Essence and nature immortall. Wee see even betweene things meerely corporeall, as the <hi>Object</hi> and the sensitive <hi>Organ,</hi> how small a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion works incapacity. Much more must it be found in so great a difference as would be betweene immortality of Objects and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soule that worketh on them. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not picture an Angel or Spirit, nor make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ateriall stamp in a piece of wax, since a <hi>corporeall</hi> substance is capable of none but corporeall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. And therefore wee see that even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Bodies, the more pure and subtile they are, the more are they exempted from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the quickest and most spirituall sense, the sight. Now the mind of man in Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is but as wax to the seale, or as a Table and Picture to an Object which it represents: which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:16360:199"/>
is the ground of that Paradox in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that in understanding the Soule is (as it were) made the Object that is understood. Because, as the Wax, after it is stamped, is in some sort the very Seale it selfe that stamp'd it, namely <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> by way of Image and resemblance; so the Soule, in receiving the species of any Object, is made the picture and image of the thing it selfe. Now the understanding, being able to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend immortality (yea indeed apprehending e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corporeall substance, as if it were immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, I meane by purging it from all grosse mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and corruptible qualities) must therefore needs of it selfe be of an immortall Nature. And from the latter of those two Principles, which I spake of, namely, that the quality of the <hi>Being</hi> may be gathered from the Nature of the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Aristotle</hi> inferres the <hi>separability</hi> and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of the understanding on the Body, in the third <hi>de Animâ</hi> afore-named: For the Soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to work without the concurrence of any bodily Organ to the very act it selfe (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed) must needs also be able to subsist by its owne nature, without the concurrence of any matter to sustaine it. And therefore hee saith in the same place, that <hi>the understanding</hi> is <hi>separable, uncompounded, impassible;</hi> all arguments of <hi>immortality.</hi> Other reasons are produced for the proofe hereof, taken from the causes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which is wrought either by Contraries working and eating out Nature; or by Defect of the Preserving cause, as light is decayed by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:16360:199"/>
of the Sunne; or thirdly by corruption of the subject whereon it depends. None whereof can be verified in the Soule. For first, how can any thing be contrary to the Soule, which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth perfection from all things? for <hi>Intellectus omnia intelligit,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> yea wherein all Contraries are reconciled and put off their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position?

Secondly, God, who is the only Efficient of the Soule (being else in it selfe simple and indivisible, and therefore not capable of death, but only of Annihilation) doth never faile, and hath himselfe promised never to bring it unto nothing. And lastly, the Soule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not, as doe other Formes, either in Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Being, on the Body, being not only <hi>Actus informans,</hi> but <hi>subsistens</hi> too, by its owne abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute vertue.</p>

And for the first estate of Mans Body, we conclude in a word: that it was partly Mortall, and partly Immortall: <hi>Mortall</hi> in regard of possibility of Dying, because it was affected with the mutuall Action and Passion of corruptible elements: for which reason it stood in need of reparation and recovery of it selfe by food, as being still <hi>Corpus Animale,</hi> and not <hi>Spirituale,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, a Naturall, but not a Spirituall Body.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:16360:202"/>
a thinne, Aereall, Invisible Body (as some have collected) since Christ saith of his Body, after he was risen, <hi>Videte, Palpate.</hi> Wheresoever it is, it hath both its quantity, and all sensible qualities of a Body Glorified with it. It is a strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is not there, where it is not sensible; And therefore the Doctrines of <hi>Vbiquity,</hi> and Transubstantiation, as they give Christ more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is pleased to owne, an Immensity of Body; so doe they spoyle him of that, which hee hath beene pleased for our sakes to assume; Extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Compacture, Massinesse, Visibility, and other the like sensible Properties, which cannot stand with that pretended miracle whereby they make Christs Body (even now a Creature, and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ours in substance, though not in qualities of Corruptibility, Infirmity, Ignominie, Animality) to be truly invested with the very immediate properties of the Deity. True indeed it is, that the Body of Christ hath an efficacie and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all parts of the world, it worketh in Heaven with God the Father by <hi>Intercession;</hi> amongst the blessed Angels by <hi>Confirmation;</hi> in Earth, and that in all ages, and in all places amongst Men, by Justification, and Comfort; in Hell amongst the Devils and Damned, by the Tremblings and Feares of a condemning and convicting Faith. But Operation requireth only a presence of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, not of Substance. For doth not the Sunne work wonderfull effects in the bowels of the Earth, it selfe notwithstanding being a fixed Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in the Heaven? And why should not the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:16360:203"/>
Sunne of Righteousnesse work as much at the like distance, as the Sunne of Nature? Why should he not be as Powerfull Absent, as he was Hoped? Or why should the Not presence of his Body make that uneffectuall now, which the Not existing could not before his Incarnation? Why should we mistrust the Eyes of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that saw him in Heaven, at such a Distance of place, when <hi>Abraham</hi> could see him in his own bowels through so great a Distance of Time?</p>
            <p>That Speech then, that the Body shall be a Spirituall Body, is not to be understood in either of those former senses: but it is to be understood first of the more immediate Union and full <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation</hi> of the vertue and vigour of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our Bodies, quickning and for ever sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them without any Assistance of Naturall or Animall qualities, for the repairing and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of them in recompence of that, which by labour and infirmity, and the naturall oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Elements, is daily diminished.

And they are such as may be either ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally collected from the Manifestation of his <hi>Works,</hi> or more particularly from his <hi>Word.</hi> These, which referre unto <hi>his Works,</hi> are his <hi>Power</hi> in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Ruling them; his <hi>Wisedom</hi> in Ordering
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:16360:205"/>
and Preserving them; his <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of them: and of these it pleaseth him at the first to bestow some few degrees upon mans Soule.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Attribute of <hi>Power,</hi> most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is that those great parts of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> are incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicably belonging unto him as his owne Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Royall. Insomuch that it were desperate blasphemy to assume unto our selves the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of them. Yet in many other proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods works, there is some Analogie and Resemblance in the Works of Men. For first, what are all the motions and courses of <hi>Nature,</hi> but the Ordinary works of God? All formes and intrinsecall Motive Principles are indeed but his Instruments; for <hi>by him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> And of all other works, mans only imitate <hi>Nature:</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes of the Works of <hi>Art,</hi> which peculiarly belong unto Man (all other Creatures being carried by that naturall instinct, which is Intrinsecally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their condition, without any manner of Art or variety.) The Resemblances of Nature in the Works of Art are chiefly seene in these two Proportions: First, as Nature doth nothing in Vaine, but in all her Works aymes at some End, the <hi>Perfection,</hi> or the <hi>Ornament,</hi> or the <hi>Conservation</hi> of the Universe (for those are the three ends of Nature subordinate to the Maine, which is, the Glory of the Maker) so likewise are the works of Art all directed by the Understanding to some
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:16360:205"/>
one of those ends; either to the perfection of Men, such are all those, which informe the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and governe the life: or to his Conservation, as those directed to the furthering of his welfare, and repairing the decayes, or shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the weaknesses of Nature: or lastly to his Ornament, such as are those Elegancies of Art, and Curiosities of Invention, which, though not necessary to his Being, yet are speciall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his delight, either Sensitive or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall.</p>
            <p>The second Resemblance, is betweene the Manner and Progresse of their Workes: for as the Method of nature is to proceed, <hi>ab imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus ad Perfectiora,</hi> and <hi>per determinata Media ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But this, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t limits Mans dignity, as well as commends it, I for beare to speake of. Though even herein also we doe seeme to imitate God, who in his great worke of Creation did proceed both by successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>To come therefore nearer, it is observable, that in the first Act of Gods power, in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Framing of the World, there was No thing here below created properly, immediatly, and totally, but the Chaos and Masse, or the

Hereby, saith hee, the Soule of man is made most Beloved of God,<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 10</note> and his minde, which is Allied unto God, is it selfe Divine, and, of all other parts of Man, most Divine. And this made the Serpent use that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation only, as most likely to prevaile, for compassing that Cursed and miserable project of Mans ruine. By meanes of which Fall, though Man blinded his understanding, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that it is as true now, as eyer, that Man is by Nature a Curious and inquiring Creature, of an Active and restlesse Spirit, which is never quiet, except in Motion, winding it selfe into all the Pathes of Nature; and continually traversing the World of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. There are two maine Desires naturally stamped in each Creature; a Desire of <hi>Perfecting,</hi> and a Desire of <hi>Perpetuating</hi> himselfe. Of these <hi>Aristotle</hi> attributeth in the highest degree, the latter unto each living Creature, when he saith, that of all the works of living Creatures, the most naturall is to Generate the like: and his<note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Anim. c. 4.</note> Reason is <gap reason="foreign">

hereby that Immortality (the Principall end (as hee there supposeth) of all naturall Agents) which in their owne Individuals they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, they procure by deriving their Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a continued off-spring and succession. But (though in regard of life it hold true of all) Man notwithstanding is to be exempted from the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of this Assertion. And of himselfe that other desire of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which is principally the desire of Knowledge (for that is one of the principall advancements of the Soule) should not only in a Positive sense, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Entrance to his Metaphysicks, but in a Superlative degree be verified, that He is by nature desirous of Knowledge.

And the reason of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Man and other Creatures in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is: First, Because Man hath not such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary use of that former desire, as others have, in regard of his owne Immortality, which takes away the Necessity of Propagation to sustaine his Nature. And secondly, because Knowledge, the Perfection of the Soule, is to Man (as I may so speake) a kinde of <hi>generation,</hi> being of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to exempt the Person, endued therewith, from all injurie of Time, and making him to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and out-live his owne Mortality. So that when the Body hath surrendred unto each Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the World those Elements and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

whereof it was compos'd, and hath not so much as Dust and Cinders left to testifie that Being, which once it had, then doth the Name lie wrapped in the Monuments of Knowledge, beyond the reach of Fate and Corruption.</p>
            <p>The Attributes of God, which are manifested more especially in his Word, though sundry, yet (as farre forth as they had ever any Image in Man) may be comprized in this more Generall one of <hi>Holinesse.</hi> Whereby I understand that Absolute and Infinite Goodnesse of his Nature, which is in him most Perfect, Pure, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Of which, though Man according to that measure, as it was unto him communicated, was in his great Fall utterly rob'd and spoyl'd, as not being able in any thing to resemble it, or to retaine any the least Prints of those Pure and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impressions of Originall Righteousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet still there remaines, even in depraved and Polluted Nature fome shadowes thereof: There is stil the <hi>Opus Operatum</hi> in many Actions of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, though the Obliquity of the Heart, and Ignorance of the true end, whether it should be directed, take away the Goodnesse and the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity thereof. The top and highest pitch of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture toucheth the hemme and lowest of Grace. We have in us the Testimonies, though not the Goodnesse of our first estate; the Ruines of a Temple to be lamented, though not the holy Places thereof to be Inhabited. It is true indeed those great endowments of the most severe and illightned Heathen, were indeed but glorious
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:16360:209"/>
miseries and withered Vertues, in that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a depraved Nature, and aymed at sinister and false ends: yet withall both the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of them proves their praecedent losse (which also the Heathen themselves espied in their distinction of Ages into Golden and Iron times:) And likewise the pursuit and practice of them (though weak, imperfect, corrupt) imply manifestly that there was much more an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Aspiring of Nature in her perfection to be like her Maker in an absolute and universall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now in this Rectitude and Perfect Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the Soule in this divine Habit of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Justice did man most eminently beare the Image and Signature of God on him. And therefore notwithstanding we continue still Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, Spirituall, Reasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we are said to have defaced that Image in us by our heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Pollution. And hee alwayes recovereth most thereof, who in the greatest measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth the ruines, and vindicateth the Lapses of his decayed estate, unto that prime Originall Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wherein he was Created.</p>
            <p>These are the Dignities of the Soule conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wholy in it selfe.

How do they force their Understandings, which in their owne worthiest objects, those deepe and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:16360:209"/>
Divine Contemplations, are as drowzie as <hi>Endy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion,</hi> to spend and waste themselves in proud, luxurious, vanishing Inventions? How doe they enthrall that Supreame and Architectonicall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in Mans little World, his Will, to the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of slavish appetite, and sensuall desires? as if they served here but as Cookes to dresse their owne Bodies for the Wormes? Strange is it that Man, conscious to himselfe of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and of an Heroicall and Heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that hath received such immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of God, and is the very Modell of all Natures Perfections, should so much degrade himselfe, as to doat only on that part, which is the vassall and slave of Death. If there were no other mischife which sinne did the Soule but to debase it, even that were argument sufficient for noble spirits to have it in detestation. For man being in honour, and which understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow it followes to speak of the parts or principall powers of the Soule, which are the <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and the <hi>Will.</hi> Concerning the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Dignity thereof, though it may partly be perceived in the <hi>Latitude</hi> and excellent Variety of its <hi>Objects,</hi> being the whole world of things (for <hi>Ens &amp; Intelligibile</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall,<note place="margin">Arist. de Anim. lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; omnia intelligit,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:16360:210"/>
the understanding) yet principally it proceeds from the <hi>Operations</hi> of it both <hi>Ad extra</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Objects,</hi> and <hi>ad intra</hi> in respect of <hi>the Will.</hi> The one is a <hi>Contemplative,</hi> the other a more <hi>Practique</hi> office, whereby the speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the former are accommodated unto any either Morall or Civill Actions. Those which respect the Objects, are either Passive, or Active Operations. <hi>Passive</hi> I call those first Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and apprehensions of the Soule, whereby it receiveth the <hi>simple</hi> species of some Object from immediate Impression thereof by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Soule; as when I understand one Object to be a Man, another a Tree, by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration and Assistance of the Eye, which presents the Species of either.</p>
            <p>Another sort of Passive Operations (that is of such as are grounded on Impressions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Objects) are <hi>mixed Operations</hi> of Compounding, Dividing, Collecting, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, which wee call <hi>Discourse.</hi> Of all which to speake according to their Logicall Nature, would be impertinent. Their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie chiefly stands in the End whereunto they move and serve, which is <hi>Knowledge;</hi> of the which, I shall therefore here speak a few things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowledge</hi> is the Assimilation of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">Aquin. part. 1. q. 14. a. 2.</note> unto the things which it understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by those Intelligible Species which doe Irr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:16360:211"/>
glasse, doe there work the Image of the Sunne: so the species and resemblances of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convayed on the Understanding, doe there work their owne Image. In which respect the<note place="margin">Aristot. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim. lib. 3. cap. 4. &amp; 5.</note> Philosopher saith, That the Intellect becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth All things by being capable of proper impressions from them: As in a Painters Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wee call that a face, a hand, a foot, a tree, which is the lively Image and Representation of such things unto the eye.</p>
            <p>There is not any Desire more noble, nor more Naturall unto a Man (who hath not like <hi>Saul</hi> hid himselfe amongst the stuffe, and lost himselfe in the Low and perishing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for Lust) than is this <hi>Desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> Nature dictating to every Creature to be more intent upon its Specificall than upon its Genericall perfection.

And therefore, though whatsoever hath Truth in it, be the Object of the Understanding; yet the Coexistence of the Soule with the Body, in this present Estate, restraines and Limits the Latitude of the Object, and requires in it, not onely the bare Nature and Truth, but such a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof, as may make it fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation and Impression by the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Sense. So that as in the True perception of the Eye (especially of those <hi>Vespertiliones,</hi> to which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Understanding in this estate of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:16360:220"/>
with the Body) there is required a mixture of Contraries in the Ayre; it must not bee too light, lest it weaken and too much disgregate or spread the sense; nor yet too dark, lest it contract and lock it up: But there must bee a kinde of middle Temper; cleerenesse of the Medium for conveyance, and yet some degrees of Darknesse for quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Object. Even so also the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of mans Vnderstanding must participate of the two contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ries, <hi>Abstraction and Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi> Abstraction first, in proportion to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the Vnderstanding, which is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. And Materiality too, in respect of the Sense, on which the Vnderstanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in this estate, as on the Medium of Conveyance, and that is Corporall. So that where ever there is Difficulty and Vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Operation in the Vnderstanding, there is a double defect and disproportion: first in the Power, whose Operations are restrained and limited for the most, by the Body: and then in the Object, which hath not a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mixture of those two qualities, which should proportion it to the Power. This is plaine by a familiar similitude; an Aged man is not able to read a small Print, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Assistance of Spectacles to make the Letters by a refraction seeme greater. Where first wee may descry an Imperfection in the Organ; for if his Eyes were as cleare
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:16360:221"/>
and well-dispos'd as a young mans, hee would be able by his Naturall Power, without Art, to receive the Species of small Letters. And next, there is an Imperfection and deficiencie in the Letters; for if they had the same Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and fitnesse in themselves, which they seeme to have by Refraction through the Glasse, the weaknesse of his power might haply have sufficient strength to receive them without those Helps. So that alwayes the Uncertainty of <hi>Opinion</hi> is grounded on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie of the Vnderstanding to receive an Object, and on the <hi>Disproportion</hi> of the Object to the Nature of the Vnderstanding.</p>

But I shall enquire rather after the more Immediate and Secondary Causes; some whereof, amongst sundry others, I take to be these:</p>
            <p>1 A first and most speciall one is the Abuse of Principles: For the Vnderstanding must have ever somthing to rest it selfe upon: and from the conformity of other things, thereunto to gather the certainty and evidence of its Assents. For it is the nature of mans minde, since it had at first it selfe a beginning to abhorre all manner of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>á Parte-Ante</hi> (I meane in Ascending and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution) as well of Sciences and Conclusions, as of Entities and Natures, as I before noted. And therefore as the Vnderstanding is not quieted in Philosophicall inquiries about created things, till it have according to their severall differences ranged them severally within the compasse of some Finite Line, and subordinated the Inferiors of every kinde, <hi>Sub an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="485" facs="tcp:16360:223"/>
and Aeviternity that way; yet upward in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of Truth into its Causes and Originals, the Vnderstanding is altogether Impatient of proceeding in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> and never rests till it finds a <hi>Non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now the Abuses of Principles, is either by <hi>Falsifying</hi> and casting absurd Glosses upon them within their owne limits; as when Philosophicall Errours are falsly grounded upon Philosophicall Axiomes, which is <hi>Error Consequentia,</hi> or <hi>Illationis,</hi> an Errour in the Consequence of one from the other: or else by transferring the Truth of them beyond their owne bounds, into the Territories (as I may so speake) of another Science, making them to encroach and to uphold Conclusions contrary to the nature of their Subject; which is <hi>Error Dependentia,</hi> or <hi>Subordinationis,</hi> an Errour in the Dependance of one on the other. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it hath been alwaies either the subtilty or modesty of errour to shrowd it self under truth; &amp; that it might make its fancies the more plausible, to fasten them upon undenyable grounds, &amp; by a

of men were any way transported with the false Delight, either of Pleasure, Profit, Pompe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, Fame, Liberty, or any other worldly and sensuall Objects. In which particular of theirs, I observe a preposterous and unnaturall course; like that of the Atheist in his Opinion of the Soule and Deity: For whereas in Nature and right Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, the Determinations of the Vnderstanding concerning Happines should precede the pursuit of the Will: they on the contrary side, first love their Errour, and then they prove it; as the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Atheist leads him first to a Desire, and wish that there were no God (because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> we easily beleeve what we will willingly desire. And the reason is, because every man (though by Nature he love Sinne) yet he is altogether impatient of any checke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction thereof; either from others, or himselfe; and therefore be his Errours never so palpable, his Affections never so distempered, his Minde never so depraved and averse from the Rules of Reason, he will notwithstanding easily persuade himselfe to thinke he is in the right course, and make his Iudgement as absurd in defending, as his Will and Affections are in embracing vitious Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, <hi>Viti a nostra, quia amamus, defendimus.</hi> When
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:16360:229"/>
once our Minds are by the violence and insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affection transported into any crooked course, Reason will freely resigne it selfe to bee perverted, and the discourse of the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will quickely bee drawne to the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of either; So easie it is for men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, when they have once made themselves obey.</p>
            <p>And another reason hereof is, because as a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy distempered and affected in any part, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those vitall ones, which diffuse their vertue into the whole, the Weaknesse spreads, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runnes all the other, though remotest from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So likewise the violent motion of partiall and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appetites <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>which do any waies miscarry by the delusion of Objects, which they fasten upon, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately derive themselves upon the higher pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For as where the Vnderstanding is regular, the chiefe Dominion thereof, is over-Affection. And therefore we see alwaies, that men of the most stayed and even Iudgements, have the most unresisted power in the government of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So on the other side; when the Affections are strongly enclined to any, either enormous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Morality; or Object in Nature, the first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty whereon they strive to transferre their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in the Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since without the Assent and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:16360:229"/>
Approbation thereof, they cannot enjoy it with such freedome from distractions and feare, as if they were warranted thereto by the Sophistry and Disputes of that Power. Thus as it is usuall with men of deceitfull palates (as before I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) to conceive in every thing they taste the same disagreeing rellish, wherewith their mouth is at that time distempered: So it is with mens Minds prepossessed with any particular fancy: <hi>Intus Existens prohibet alienum.</hi> They cannot see it in its own proper colours, but according as their Conceipts are any way distempered and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the violence of their Affection. And hence in Naturall Philosophy sprang that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aristoxenus</hi> the Musitian (which I spake of before) that the Soule of Man consisted in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and in an apt Concord, <hi>Velut in Cantu &amp; Fidibiu,</hi> between the parts; and <hi>Tully</hi> intimates the reason I speake of very prettily: <hi>Hic ab artificio suo non recessit:</hi> this man knew not how to leave his owne Art; &amp; more expresly of the same in another place: <hi>Ita delactatur suis Cantibus, ut etiam ad ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum transferre con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>5 Another reason, which I conceive of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Vnderstanding by Errour, is Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity and Pushing it forward to the Search of things clasped up and reserved from its Inquiry.

The former only is properly <hi>Invention;</hi> the other a Consequent thereof, <hi>Tradition:</hi> but both much making to the honour of the Faculty. For the former, I shall forbeare any large discourse touching the particular Dignities thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing so manifestly seen in Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Practises, dispatches in the maintaining of Societies, erecting of Lawes, government of Life; and generally, whatsoever enterprize a man fastens upon, this one Faculty it is, that hath been the Mother of so many Arts; so great Beauty and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:16360:231"/>
Ornament amongst men, which out of one world of things have raised another of Learning.</p>
            <p>The Corruptions then which I conceive of this part of Invention, are,</p>
            <p>First, a Despaire and Distrust of a mans owne Abilities: For as Corruption and Selfe Opinion is a maine Cause of Errour: so Dissidence and Feare is on the other side a wrong to Nature, in abusing those Faculties which she gave for enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with Sloath and Dulnes. <hi>Multis rebus inest Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca) non ex naturâ suâ, sed ex debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te nostrâ:</hi> and so likewise, <hi>Multie rebus inest difficultas; non ex natura sua, sed ex opinione nostrâ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Many things seem hard &amp; involved, not because they are so, but because our suspition so misconceives them. Thus as in an affected and ill disposed Body, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>very light Weaknes is more felt than a more violent distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, where the Constitution is stronger. So with fearfull and despairing wits, every Inquiry is esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, not according to the nature of the Object, but according to the Disopinion &amp; slender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt which they have of their own Abilities. <hi>Non calcant spina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, sed habent.</hi> It were but ridiculous for a Blind man to complaine of dark weather, when the fault is not in the Aire, but in the Eye.</p>
            <p>Another prejudice to this Faculty, is that which I observed before on another Occasion, an Over-Reverend Opinion of those who have gone before us. For when men shall so magnifie the Gifts of others, that they sleight and neglect their owne; when out of a prejudicate Conceipt that the Antients have sufficiently perfected the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:16360:232"/>
Body of more serious Learnings, they shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Wits (capable of greater imploiments) in degenerate and unusefull Studies; Knowledge must needs be hindred from attaining that Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which by their owne Inventions it might be raysed. Thus as it fals out amongst men of thirstlesse Minds in their Fortunes: <hi>Divitiarum abundantia inter Causa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> paupertat is est.</hi> Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusenesse out of their present store, with a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to recover and new make their Estates, drawes them quickly beyond their Fortunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as it was in the like case amongst the Romanes in those times of Publique Luxury, and Effeminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the valour of their Auncestors procuring unto them large wealth, and securing them from forreigne hostility, did also by the means of that Wealth and Ease soften and melt their valour, so that their Weaknesse was principally occasioned by the invincible spirit of their Predecessors: So it is in the matter of Learning, when we spend our time onely in the Legacies that our Fathers have left us, and never seeke to improve it by our owne Inventions, the Large measures of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we receive from them, is by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous use made an occasion of a Large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Ignorance in other inquiries, where in their Labours offer greater Assistance, than discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. There was not I perswade my selfe amongst the Ancients themselves, a greater means of disclosing so large a measure of Truth, than the Freedome of their owne Opinions. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Liberty was often the occasion of
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:16360:232"/>
many prodigious Births; yet this disadvantage was coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>; all which might haply have been undi scovered, had men laboured only in Traditions, and contented themselves with Learning upon Trust. And those more Errours being still exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were lesse pernicious than fewer beleeved. And even of them I make no question but there hath been good use made by those that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into Truth. For first, there are very few Errours that have not some way or other Truth annexed unto them, which haply might not otherwise have been observed. It is an Errour in that man which shall presume of Gold hid in his Land, to dig and turne it up for no other end, but to find his Imaginary treasure; yet that stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and softning of the Ground is a means to make it the more fertile. Lastly, this use may bee made even of Errours, when discovered in the In quiry after Truth, that they let us know what it is not: and it is speedier to come to a Positive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion by a Negative Knowledge, than a naked Ignorance: as hee is sooner likely to finde out a place, who knowes which is not the way, than hee that only knows not the way.</p>

Thus a Picture, though it be never so much in the frame abused, crackt, spotted, or made any other way unvaluable; yet if the resemblance which it beares, be expresse and lively, we still call it a true Picture: whereas if that be a false and deceitfull resemblance (be all other adventitious Ornaments never so exquisite) wee still accompt it False and Corrupt: So it is with the Speech of man, which though of never so great Weaknesse and Insufficiency in other respects; yet if it retain that one property of shaping it selfe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of the Mind, and make levell and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable the words with the thoughts, it may still be said to be (though not a good) yet in some respect a Regular Speech, in that it is conformable to the first institution: But be all other Excellencies never so great; yet if it be a false Image of our Intentions, Nature is diverted from her prime End, and the Faculty quite depraved, as for saking its originall office: and indeed, other Morall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Tongue do necessarily presuppose this adequation and conformity to the thoughts, which I speake of, without which they are but Hipocrisie, and come within the compasse of the noted Corruption, a Lye: for every Hipocrite is a

            <p>First it may be Vnconformable to the Law of right Reason, as in all manner of vitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory Speeches.

Abuse of it is the more dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare the worth of it, by shewing what it is: For I take not Wit in that common Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby men understand some sudden flashes of Conceipt, whether in Stile or Conference, which like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>otten wood in the darke, have more Shine than Substance; whose Vse and Ornament are like themselves Swift and Vanishing; at once both Admired and Forgotten: but I understand a setled, constant, habituall sufficiency of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, whereby it is inabled in any kinde of Learning, Theory, or Practise, both to sharpnes in Search, subtilty in Expression, and dispatch in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. As for that other kinde seen in Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, Declamatory Discourses, Epigrams, and other the like sudden issues of the braine, they are feats only and sleights, not Duties and Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Wit, which serve rather for Ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Vse: and are onely the Remission of the Mind and Vnbending of the thoughts from more severe Knowledge: as walking for recreation is rather Exercise than Travell, although by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the motion, or length of the way there may ensue Sweat and Wearinesse.</p>
            <p>Now for the Corrupters of the Wit, though there be diverse; yet none so immediate and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as it selfe, if alone: For Wit, though it bee Swift, yet is often Blind. And therefore the faster it hastens in Errour, the more dangerous it is to it selfe. And hence it is, that as Learning was never more bound to any, than those men, who have been emment in this Faculty, if they
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:16360:238"/>
swayed it by Moderation and Prudence: So none have been more pernicious and violent Oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Truth, than men best furnished with Acutenesse, when they turned the use of it to the strengthning of their owne Fancies, and not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to Iudgement and Examination. As the fattest Soiles in Greece caused the greatest trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and the Beauty of <hi>Helena,</hi> the ruine of Troy. Wit like Wine is a good remedy against the poison of the Minde; but being it selfe poisoned, it doth kill the sooner. There ought to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> for the right disposing of our Inventions, a mutuall reference and service between Wit and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is a vexation of Mind to discerne what is right and profitable, and have no inablement to attaine it: and that is Iudgement without Wit. And to have a facility of compassing an End, and a working and restlesse fancy, without direction to fasten it on a fit Object, is the onely course to multiply Errour, and to be still in Motion, not as in a path, but as in a Maze or Circle, where is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall toyle, without any proficience or gaine of Way; and this is Wit without Iudgement. They ought therefore, I say, to be mutuall Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutors each to other. Wit is the Spurre to stirre up and quicken the Vnderstanding: and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Bridle to sway and moderate Wit: Wit is the Hand and Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Execution and Motion; but Iudgement is the Eye for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Direction. Lastly, Wit is the Sayle and Oare to further the progresse in any Inquiry; but Iudgement is the Ballace to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:16360:239"/>
Poise, and the Steere to guide the course to its intended End.</p>
            <p>Now the manner of the Iudgements Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in directing either our Practise or Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation is by a discourse of the Mind, whereby it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>educeth them to certaine Grounds and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whereunto they ought chiefly to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. And from hence is that Reason which <hi>Quintilian</hi> observes, why shallow and floating Wits seeme oftentimes more fluent than men of greater sufficiencies: For, saith he, those other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of every sudden flash or Conceipt, without any Examination; but <hi>apud Sapientes est <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The maine Corruption of Iudgement in this Office, is Prejudice and Prepossession. The Duty of Iudgement is to discerne between Obliquities and right Actions, and to reduce all to the Law of Reason. And therefore tis true in this, as in the course of publique Iudgements: That respect of persons, or things, blind the Eyes, and maketh the Vnderstanding to determine according to Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not according to Truth Though indeed some Passions there are, which rather hood-winke then distemper or hurt the Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the false determination thereof cannot bee well called a Mistake, but a Lye: Of which kind flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the principall, when the Affections of Hope and Feare debase a man, and cause him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble his owne opinion.</p>

So neither can it see the right way it ought to take for procuring that Good without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:16360:240"/>
of a <hi>Conducting</hi> power. As it hath not Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discover an <hi>End:</hi> So neither hath it Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to judge of the right <hi>Means,</hi> whereby that may be attained. So that all the Acts of the Will necessarily presuppose some precedent guiding Acts in the Vnderstanding, whereby they are pro portioned to the Rules of right Reason. This Operation of the Vnderstanding is usually by the Schoole-men called <hi>Imperium,</hi> or <hi>Mandatum,</hi> a Mandate or Command; because it is a <hi>Precept,</hi> to which the will ought to be obedient. For the Rules of Living and Doing well, are the Statutes (as it were) and Dictates of right Reason. But yet it may not hence be concluded that the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hath any Superiority, in regard of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Will; though it have Priority in regard of Operation. The Power of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing over the Will, is onely a Regulating and Directing, it is no Constraining or Compulsive Power. For the Will alwaies is <hi>Domina s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts then of right Reason are not therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, because they are proposed by way of Man date; but therfore they are in that manner propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, because they are by Reason apprehended to be the Commands of a Divine Superior Power. And therefore in the breach of any such Dictates we are not said properly to offend our Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:16360:240"/>
but to sinne against our Law giver. As in Civill Policy, the offences of men are not against inferiour Officers; but against that soveraigne Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which is the Fountaine of Law, and under whose Authority all subordinate Magistrates have their proportion of government. Besides, <hi>Ejus est imperare, Cujus est punire:</hi> For Law and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being Relatives, and mutually connotating each the other, it must necessarily follow, that from that power only canbe an imposition of law, from which may be an Infliction of Punishment.</p>
            <p>Now the Condition under which the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is both to apprehend and propose any either end, or means convenient to the Nature of the Will, and of Sufficiency to move it, are that they have in them <hi>Goodnesse, Possibility;</hi> and in the end (if we speak of an utmost one) <hi>Immortality</hi> too. Every true Object of any Power, is that which beareth such a perfect Relation of convenience &amp; fitnes therunto, that it is able to accomplish all its desires. Now since <hi>Malum</hi> is <hi>Destruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>vum</hi> all Evill is Destructive. It is impossible that by it selfe, without a counterfeit and adulterate face, it should ever have any Attractive Power over the Desires of the Will. And on the other side, since <hi>Omne bonum,</hi> is <hi>Perfectivum;</hi> since Good is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and apt to bring reall satisfaction along with it, most certainly would it be desired by the Will, were it not that our Vnderstandings are clouded and carried away with some crooked misapprehensions; and the Will it selfe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in its owne Inelinations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="520" facs="tcp:16360:241"/>But yet though all mans Faculties are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, that he is not able as he ought, to will any Divine and Perfect Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet so much he retains of his Perfection, as that he cannot possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any thing, which he apprehends as absolutely disagreeable &amp; destructive to his Nature; since all Naturall Agents ayme still at their owne Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And therefore impossible it is, that either Good should be refused, without any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Disconvenience; or Evill pursued, without any appearance of Congruity or Satisfaction. That it may appeare therefore how the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing doth alwaies propose those Objects, as Good to the Will, which are notwithstanding, not only in their owne Nature, but in the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the Vnderstanding it selfe knowne to be evill. And on the contrary, why it doth propose good Objects, contrary to its owne Knowledge, as Evill. We may distinguish two opposite condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill:</hi> For first, all Evill of Sin, (though it have Disconvenience to mans Nature, as it is <hi>Destructive;</hi> yet) on the other side, it hath agreement thereunto, as it is crooked and <hi>corrupt.</hi> As continuall drinking is most convenient to the distemper of an Hydropticke Body, though most disconvenient to its present welfare. Now then as no man possessed with that disease, desires drinke for this end, because he would dye, though he know that this is the next way to bring him to his Death; but only to give satisfaction to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Appetite: So neither doth man follow exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and crooked courses, onely that hee may
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:16360:241"/>
therby come to Destruction (though he is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of that issue) but onely to give way to the propension of his depraved Nature. In the same manner likewise <hi>Goodnes,</hi> though it have the most absolute <hi>Convenience</hi> to man, as it is <hi>Perseclive,</hi> &amp; in respect of his finall advancement thereby; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this I take to be the maine reason, why men of corrupt and irregular desires, oftentimes fasten Delight on those Objects which they know to be Evill, and are quite averse from those which yet they assent unto as Good.</p>
            <p>To which I may adde another, namely, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of a Corrupt Will to yeeld unto it selfe all <hi>Present Satisfaction,</hi> and not to suffer it selfe to be swayed with the Preoccupation of a <hi>Future Estate:</hi> Insomuch that the small content which mans Nature receiveth from the Actuall fru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion of some instant-conceited Good, prevailes more to draw on Appetite, then the fearfull Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ensuing Misery, can to deterre from it. And the present irksomnesse of Pious Duties, have
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:16360:242"/>
more power to divert the corrupt Minde from them; then the Fore-conceipt of Eternall blisse can have to allure the Mind unto a Delight in them. Hence then it appeares, what I understand by that first condition, wherewith Reason is to propose any End or Means to the Will, that it may be desired; namely, <hi>Sub Ratione Boni,</hi> under the Condition of Good, not alwayes True and Morall; but somtimes as it is so apprehended by a depraved Vnderstanding, <hi>Sub conceptu Convenientia:</hi> as it beares Conformity to the present Crooked Estate of mans Will: a <hi>Deprâved</hi> Vnderstanding I say, and not alwaies properly and precisely a <hi>Darkened</hi> Vnderstanding; <hi>Depraved</hi> by Neglect and <hi>Inconsiderablenesse;</hi> not darkned by Ignorance and <hi>Blindnesse.</hi> For there may bee an Irregular Will with a Iudgement rightly informed by Truth. Otherwise there could not be any offence of Presumption and Knowledge. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to consider that there is in a Well-stayed <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> a double Act in the directing of the <hi>Will.</hi> The one respecteth the Nature and Quality of the <hi>Object:</hi> the other, more peculiarly the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Time:</hi> the one is properly <hi>Knowledge;</hi> the other <hi>Circumspection,</hi> arising out of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more close pressing of the Object, which is knowne as Good to the Will, against Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of Sensitive Desires, which aime onely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Fruition of pleasure <hi>present.</hi> First, the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding proposeth to the Will <hi>Felicity,</hi> as an Absolute and Eternall <hi>Good,</hi> which cannot but be desired. Next, it proposeth <hi>means</hi> for the attaining
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:16360:242"/>
of it; namely, the practise of these Precepts, which are revealed unto us as necessary for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing the End desired. The <hi>Will</hi> being, besides its own Corruption, transported by the Sensitive Appetite, finds great Irksomnesse in those <hi>means.</hi> A re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>raint of al those present Ioyes, Delights, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, which it instantly pursues: it percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that great trouble is to be expected, many Prejudices and Difficulties to be grapled with; a severe hand to be held over Passions; a narrow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to be observed towards Mutinous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Eruptions of the Minde, fewer inable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for advancing our Fortunes, and infinite other the like bars of present contentment; which withdraw the Will, and make it renounce courses so severe and disagreeable to the Liberty it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Hereupon comes the second Act of the Vnderstanding, <hi>Efficacy</hi> and Weight of <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereby it compares the Circumstances of that Difficulty of Good to the Will in regard of the small time, they shall continue; with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent and unspeakable Good, that will in the end ensue there from, and also with the unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Torments that follow the vilenesse of present Pleasures. Whence the Will is made more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable (by the Assistance of greater Power than its owne) to goe along rather through Thornes with Vertue, than with adulterate and painted pleasures to daunce towards ruine.</p>
            <p>Now of these two, the defect of the former works properly a <hi>Blinded</hi> Vnderstanding; but the Defect of the Latter, namely, an Insufficiency
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:16360:243"/>
and Inefficacy of pondering the Circumstances, and pressing the endlesse Consequence of Good or Evill, works properly a <hi>Depraved</hi> Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in regard of Practicall or Applicative Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. As a man walking in some deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation by a Ditch; though his Eyes be open to see a present danger before him, yet may happly fall into it; not out of <hi>Blindnesse,</hi> but out of <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratenesse,</hi> as not fixing his conceipt thereon; but being wholly possessed with other thoughts. In like manner, the Vnderstanding being taken up by the Imposture of the Affections, with the conceit of <hi>present Good,</hi> or <hi>present Ill</hi> in any Object, and thereby being diverted from a serious Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, after the true Rectitude and Obliquity therof, suffers the Will fearfully to plunge it self in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and misery.</p>
            <p>Another Condition, under which and <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> are to be proposed by the Will, is <hi>Sub rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ono Eossibilis,</hi> as a good <hi>Possible.</hi> For if once the Vnderstanding discover Impossibility in any Object, the Will cannot fasten any desire upon it: Since all Appetite is only terminated by that which can replennish and satiate the Power. Now all Satisfaction is by Fruition; all Fruition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily presupposeth a Possibility of Acquiring: So that where this is taken away, the Will is left Hopelesse, and therefore Desirelesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see that the neerer any things comes to Impossibility, the more averse is the Will of most men from it: as is plaine in these things that are perplexed and difficult to ateaine. And if
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:16360:243"/>
here the wish of him in the Poet be objected:</p>
            <q>O mihi praeteritos refer at fi Iupiter ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <lg>
                  <l>O that <hi>Iove</hi> would me restore,</l>
                  <l>The yeares that I have liv'd before.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>It may be answered that this was a Wish only, and not a Will. Since that which a man willeth, he doth really endeavour to obtaine.</p>
            <p>The last Condition (which is restrained onely to the utmost end of mans desire) is that it bee proposed, <hi>Sub ratione Immortalis,</hi> as an <hi>Immortall Good.</hi> The Endlesnesse of Happinesse is that only which maketh it a perfect End. For the Mind of man naturally is carried to an <hi>Immortality</hi> of <hi>Being;</hi> and therefore also consequently to an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> of <hi>Happinesss;</hi> it being a necessary Desire of all Naturall Agents, to attaine a Perfection proportionate to the measure of their Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So then mans End must not be only <hi>Good,</hi> but <hi>for ever Good, Totally</hi> and <hi>Eternally:</hi> not onely a Fulnesse of <hi>Ioy</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of it; but a Fulnesse of <hi>Perpetuity</hi> in the Continuance. Most <hi>perfect</hi> in proportion in the <hi>Spirituality;</hi> most <hi>infinite</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Immortality</hi> of mans Soule. The Frailty and Languishing of any Good, and a Foresight of the losse thereof, with the ablest Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ds doth much weaken the Desire of it. And the reason is, because Providence and Forecast is a certaine companion of the humane Nature; and he which is most a man, is most carefull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:16360:244"/>
the advancement of his <hi>Future</hi> Estate. It is beastiall to fasten only upon <hi>Present Good;</hi> this being a maine difference between the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the Sensuall Appetite, that this respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth only the present Ioy that is at hand; but that being secretly conscious of its owne Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, fastens it selfe upon the remotest times, yea outrunnes all time, and suffers it selfe to bee ever swallowed up with the Meditation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an Endlesse Happinesse. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 1.</note> the reason that <hi>Aristotle</hi> brings against his Masters <hi>Ideas,</hi> argues an Vnderstanding lesse Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in this particular than <hi>Plato's</hi> was, when hee saith that Eternity doth no more perfect the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Good, than Continuance doth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of White. For though it be true, that it is not any Essentiall part of <hi>Goodnesse</hi> in it selfe; yet it is a necessary and principall condition to make Goodnesse, <hi>Happines;</hi> that is, an Adequate Obiect to mans Desires; there is not then the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between Eternity and Good, as there is between Continuance and White: For Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance is altogether Extrinsicall and Irrelative in respect of White; but the Happinesse of man hath an Intrinsicall Connection with Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, because mans Vtmost and Adequate Good must be proportioned to the Nature of his Minde (for that is no perfect Good that doth not every way replennish and leave nothing behind it that may be desired) So that man himselfe being End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, can have none End able to limit his desires, but an Infinite and Immortall Good; which hee
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:16360:244"/>
may enjoy without any anxiety for After-Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I dare say there is not an A theist in the world, who hath in his Life be-beasted himselfe by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Desires onely on Transitory and Perisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goods, that would not on his death-bed count it the best bargain he ever made to change Souls, with one of those whose Diligence in providing for a Future Happinesse, hee hath often in his beastly Sensuality impiously derided.</p>
            <p>Now of these two Directions of the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the Will, in desiring the End or Means, the Corruption is for the most part more grosse and palpable in Assistance to the <hi>Means,</hi> than in the Discovery of the <hi>End;</hi> and farre oftner fayles the Will herein than in proposing an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to fix its Desires upon. For we may continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally observe, how a world of men agree all in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and wishes about the same Supreme and Immortall Happinesse, the Beatificall Vision; Every <hi>Balaam</hi> fastens on that; and yet their means unto it are so jarring and opposite, that a looker on would conceive it impossible that there should be any Agreement in an End, where is such nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Discord in the wayes to it. The reason which I conceive of this difference, is the severall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which the true End and the true Means thereunto beare unto the Will of man. For it is observable, that there is but one Generall Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Errour about the right End, namely the Ignorance thereof. For being once truly delivered to the Vnderstanding, it carries such a proportion to the nature of the Will (being a most perfect
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:16360:245"/>
fulfilling of all its wishes) that it is impossible not to desire it; but the disproportion betweene man and the right means of a true End is farre Greater. For there is not only Errour in the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of them, but reluctance in other practique Faculties, proceeding from their generall Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in this Estate, and nayling the Affection on the present Delight of Sensuall Objects. First, for the Vnderstanding, I observe therein a double Hinderance concerning these <hi>Means: Ignorance</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ignorantia &amp; Difficultas. Aug.</note> and <hi>Weaknesse;</hi> the one respects the Examination of them; the other, their Presentation or Inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Wil. For the former of these, there seemes to bee an equall difficulty between the End and the Means, as proceeding in both from the same Root. But in this very convenience there is a great difference; for the Ignorance of the End is farre more preventable (considering the Helps we have to know it) than of the Means. Not but that there are as powerfull Directions for the Knowledge of the <hi>Means,</hi> as of the <hi>End;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are in their <hi>Number</hi> many, and in their <hi>Nature</hi> repugnant to mans Corrupt Minds. There is therfore more Wearinesse, and by consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more Difficulty in the Inquiry after them, than after the <hi>End,</hi> because that is in it selfe but <hi>One;</hi> and besides, beares with it (under the generall Notion of <hi>Happinesse</hi>) such an absolute Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to mans Nature, as admits of no Refusall or Opposition: Insomuch that many that know Heaven to be the End of their Desires, know yet scarse one foot of the way thither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="529" facs="tcp:16360:245"/>Now besides this <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>means</hi> is gotten, there are many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices to be expected before a free Exercise of them. For (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes) amongst all the Conditions required to Morall Practise, <hi>Knowledge</hi> hath the least sway. It hath the lowest place in Vertue, though the highest in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>There is secondly in the Vnderstanding <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> whereby it oftentimes connives at the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motion of the Will, &amp; with drawes it from Examining with a piercing and fixed Eye, with an Impartiall and Bribelesse Iudgement, with Efficacy and weight of Meditation, the severall Passages of all our Actions, with all the present and consequent Inconveniences of crooked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. It were a vaste labour to runne over all the Oppositions, which vertuous means, leading to an Happy End, doe alwayes finde in the severall Faculties of man: how the Will it selfe is stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and froward; the Passions Rebellious, and Impatient of Suppression; the Senses and Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Appetite thwart and wayward, creeping alwayes like those under-Coelestiall Orbes into another motion, quite contrary to that which the <hi>Primum Mobile:</hi> Illightened Reason should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre upon them. Sufficient it is, that there is a Disproportion between the means of Happinesse, and the generall Nature of Corrupt man. For all Goodnesse is necessarily adjoyned with Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Streightnesse (in that it is a Rule to direct our Life) and therefore a <hi>Good</hi> man, is
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:16360:246"/>
called an <hi>Vpright</hi> man; one that is every where Even and Strait. To which <hi>Aristotle</hi> perhaps had one Eye, when hee called his Happyman, a <hi>Foure-square</hi> man, which is every where smooth, stable, and like himselfe. But now on the other side, mans Nature in this Estate of Corruption, is a Distorted and Crooked Nature; and therfore altogether unconformable to the Goodnesse which should as a Cannon, direct it to the true and principall End it aymeth at. And this is the reason, why so many men are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the close and narrow passage of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. For crooked and reeling Movers neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily require more Liberty of way, more broad courses to exerise themselves in: as wee see in naturall Bodies, a crooked thing will not bee held within so narrow bounds as that, which is strait.</p>

            <p>The Dignities whereof are to bee gathered from the Offices of it, and from the Properties of it.</p>
            <p>The maine Offices are three; <hi>Direction, Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Consolation,</hi> whereof the two last alwayes presuppose the first with a contrary Qualification of Breach and Observance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Direction</hi> of Conscience consists in a Simple Discourse: or (as I may so speake) in a <hi>Direct Ray</hi> of Vnderstanding, gathering Morall or Divine Conclusions from a presupposed habit

of Principles, either from the reliques of our Originall Knowledge naturally imprest, or by concurrence of Religion and Theologicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts spiritually iuspired into the Practique Iudgement or hearts of men. The observance of which Conclusions it imposeth upon all those Executive Powers, which each particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion doth most immediately concerne upon paine of hazarding our owne Inward Peace, with that sweet repose and security of Minde which followes it; and also (as the Heathen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The two latter of those Offices consist in a <hi>Reflection</hi> of that former discourse upon mens Actions, and according as is discovered in them, either an observance or neglect of those imposed Duties: the heate of that Reflection is either Comfortable or Scorching. Now of these two; that of Conviction is nothing else but a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that Equivocall killing promise made by the Serpent to our seduced Parents; I meane an Opening of their Eyes, to know with despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Sorrow the Good they had irrecoverably foregone; and with feare, shame and horrour, the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:16360:247"/>
Evill which they plunged themselves and their whole posterity into. This one Act it is which hath so often confuted that Opinion of <hi>Aristotl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The chiefe Dignity hereof consisteth in <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> whereby it diffuseth into the whole man, from a secret assurance of divine favour (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can throughly calme the Conscience, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>rties of the Conscience (whereby I understand the Ministeries, which it never fayles to execute in man) are as I conceive, principally three; <hi>Watchfulnesse, Memory, Impartiality.</hi> It keeps alwaies Centin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>and like a Register, records all our good and ill actions. Though the Darknesse of the Night may hide us from others, and the Darknesse of the Mind seem to hide us from our selves; yet still hath Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence an Eye to looke in secret on whatsoever we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> doe, whether in regard of Ignorance or Hardnesse. Though in many men it sleep in regard of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet it never sleeps in regard of Observation and Notice: it may be Hard and Seared, it can never be Blind. That writing in it which seemes
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:16360:248"/>
Invisible and Illegible, like letters written with the juice of Lemmon, when it is brought to the fire of Gods Iudgement, will be most cleere. And for the next (if we observe it) there is nothing so much fastened in the Memory, as that which Conscience writes: all her Censures are written with Indelible Charact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All or most of our Knowledge forsakes us in our Deaths; Wit, Acutenesse, variety of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, habits of Sciences; our Arts, Policies, Inventions, all have their period and fate: onely those things which Conscience imprinteth, shall be so far from finding any thing in death to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate &amp; raze them out, that they shall be thereby much more manifest; whether they be impressions of Peace or Horrour. The Testimoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort (if true) are fastened in the Heart with such an Hand as will never suffer them finally to bee taken out: and if they be Accusatory and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, the Heart is so Hard, and they so Deep, that there is no way to get them out, but by brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Then thirdly it is a most Bribelesse Worker, it never knows how to make a false report of any of our w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>yes. It is (if I may so speake) Gods Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, that writes not Annals, but Iournals; the Words, Deeds, Cogitations of Houres and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never was there so absolute a Compiler of Lives, as Conscience. It never comes with any prejudice or acceptation of persons, but dares

speake truth as well of a Monarch, as of a Slave. <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour shall feele as great a fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his breast, as he dare wrap the poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in to light him to his Lust. There is scarse one part in man, but may be seduced, save his Conscience. Sense oftentimes conceives things which are not; Appetite and Imagination can transport the Will, and themselves both may be drawne by perswasion contrary to their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions; this onely deales faithfully with him, whose witnesse it is, though it bee to the confusion of it selfe and him, in whom it lodgeth. It may I know erre sometimes and mistake; but it can never by any Insinuation be bribed to contradict its owne Iudgement, and register White for Blacke.</p>
            <p>The Corruption of Conscience arises prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from two Extremes; the one occasioned by <hi>Ignorance;</hi> the other by <hi>Sinne</hi> (for I oppose these two here, as concurring to the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Conscience after a different manner) The o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e is when the want of due Knowledge drawes the Conscience, to sinister determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either in Practise or Forbearance. The other when evill Habits and Actions defile the Conscience. Now both these containe under them sundry Degrees of Corruption.</p>
            <p>From Ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, comes a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

course, as whereunto it hath no warrant upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainting it selfe from either.</p>
            <p>Then from the other Root there comes: First, a <hi>Dead,</hi> Secure and Sleeping Conscience by Common and Customary Sinnes. A <hi>Pale,</hi> Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Affrighted Conscience by Atheisticall and Vnnaturall Sinnes:</p>

And the Restraint when the Will is desirous to obey the Dictates of Reason, or of Grace; and Lust by her tyranny overbeares the Soule, and leads it captive to the Law of Sinne, so that a man cannot do the things which he would.

               </gap>mbracing of those means, and inclining towards them with a double Act. The one an Act of <hi>Consent,</hi> whereby wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the means dictated, as <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>possible:</hi> the other, an Act of <hi>Election,</hi> whereby, according to the different weight of Reasons, we adhere unto one <hi>Medium</hi> more than unto another, either as more proper, or as more seasible. Thirdly, because the Means do not bring us unto the End by being <hi>Chosen,</hi> but by being <hi>Executed.</hi> Hereupon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another Act of <hi>Mandate</hi> to all the Faculties interested in the Execution of those Means, to apply and put forth their forces with vigor and constancy, till the End be at the last by the due Execution of those Means attained and enjoyed.</p>

            <p>First of the <hi>Habits</hi> of the Reasonable Soule, and they are either <hi>Rationall</hi> only, and in the <hi>Minde,</hi> as the Habits of Wisedome, of Principles, of Conclusions, of Art and Prudence; or besides that <hi>Vertuous</hi> and Vitious, conversant about Good or Evill Morall. Which are first the Habits of <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Principles,</hi> called <hi>Synteresis;</hi> and next the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:16360:257"/>
of <hi>particular Vertues,</hi> whereby the Will is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and facilitated unto well doing. Vnto the felicity of all which are required these foure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Rectitude</hi> disposing the Will to render unto God, unto our selves, and unto all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that which is theirs, and which of right wee owe unto them.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Prudence,</hi> discovering that which is in this manner <hi>Right,</hi> Iudging of it, and directing unto it.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Fortitude,</hi> enabling the Will firmely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in her vertuous purposes, according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of Practicall Prudence, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the labour it must undergoe, the delaies it must sustaine before it can obtaine the End, and the difficulties, impediments, discouragements it shall meet withall.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Temperance,</hi> suppressing and subduing those Sensuall Appetites, which would stagger, inter rupt, divert us from these constant Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Next, because all <hi>Habits,</hi> as I said, are directed to the facility and determining of <hi>Actions,</hi> wee should thereby be led on to the consideration of <hi>Humane Actions, Fortuitous, Violent, Naturall, Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Involuntary, Mixed.</hi> As also, to the grounds of the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> or <hi>Illnesse</hi> of <hi>Actions,</hi> taken first from the <hi>Rule</hi> of them unto which they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Secondly, from the <hi>Principles</hi> of them, from whence they are to proceed, to wit, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and Faith to see, <hi>Will</hi> to purpose, <hi>Love</hi> to doe,

subjection, to obey strength, to finish and fulfill what vertue leads us unto. Thirdly, from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and measure of their perfection. And lastly, from the ends unto which they should be directed.</p>
            <p>By which consideration, we should be led to take a view of the right end, and <hi>ultimate felicity,</hi> unto which all these actions should leade and carry us; not as the causes of it, but as the way, and Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents unto it.</p>
            <p>But these pertaining to a nobler science, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the limits of the <hi>subject</hi> which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to speake of, I shall follow <hi>Plinies</hi> counsell, and looke backe to the title of my Booke: Which having (as well as my weaknesse was able) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to goe through, It now cals upon me to goe no further.</p>
