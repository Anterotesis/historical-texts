         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HAving when I was at
<hi>Paris</hi> last Spring, met
with a little Book of Letters,
call'd <hi>L' Intregue de Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
&amp; Silvia,</hi> I had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
fancy, besides my
inclinations to translate 'em
into English, which I have
done as faithfully as I cou'd,
only where he speaks of the
ingratitude of <hi>Caesario</hi> to the
King, I have added a word
or two to his Character that
might render it a little more
parallel to that of a modern
<pb facs="tcp:56143:3"/>
Prince in our Age; for the
rest I have kept close to the
French.</p>
                  <p>The Letters art soft and
amorous, and besides my
esteem and obligation to
you, I think it no where so
proper to address so much
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ender passion, as to a man
whom Heaven and Nature
has so well form'd both for
dispencing and receiving of
Love as your self, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all in your person that
is acceptable to women and
desir'd by men, and when
you please can make your
self as absolutely the joy
of the one as the envy of
<pb facs="tcp:56143:3"/>
the other; to this is join'd
a Vertue, such as I believe
the World has rarely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
in a Man of your
Youth, Fortune and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
you have all the
power of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ebauchery
of the Age, without the
will, you early saw the
Follies of the Town, and
the greatness of your mind
disdaining that common
Road of living, shun'd the
foppish practice; your well-judging
pride chose rather
to be singular, and sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retire, than heard with
that noisie Crowd, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
fit out business e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb facs="tcp:56143:4"/>
to stock the Town
with Wit and Lampoons,
and the Stage with Fops,
Fools and Cowards: if I
might give my real judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you are above flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and one can almost
say no good or generous
thing that one cannot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
in you, no Vertue you
cannot lay a claim to; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
your modesty hides
from the World, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more you have which
envy will not confess; for
that just value you set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your self by shunning
the publick haunts, Cabals
and Conversations of the
<pb facs="tcp:56143:4"/>
Town, in spight of all your
Wit and Goodness gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for malice to revenge
it self on you a thousand
little ways; witness a late
mistaken story of an Amour
of yours, so often urg'd
with heat, and told so much
to your disadvantage, by
those who have not the hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>piness
of knowing your true
principles of honour, your
real good nature, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
justice, or sense of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
to be such, as not
to be capable of so base, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unmanly a practice,
and so needless and poor a
design: For my part, Sir, I
<pb facs="tcp:56143:5"/>
am vain and proud of the
belief that I have the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and honour to know and
understand your Soul, (did
I not too well the story also)
and am well assur'd it has
not a grain, not a thought
of so foolish a principle, so
unnecessary and dishonest:
and I dare affirm that since
the imposition of the late Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Plot upon the Town,
there has not so ridiculous
and nonsensical a History past
for authentick with unthin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
man; but you shou'd
give 'em leave to rail, since
you have so vast advantages
above 'em.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:56143:5"/>
Sir, I wou'd fain think
that in the Character of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
there is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of your self as to
his Person, and that part of
his Soul that was possest with
Love: he was a French Whigg,
'tis true, and a most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Traytor, and there, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
confess, the comparison fails
extremely; for sure no man
was ever so incorrigible so
hardned in Torism as your
self, so fearless, so bold, so
resolute, and confirm'd in
Loyalty; in the height of
all dangers and threatnings,
in the blessed Age of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and the hopeful Reign
<pb facs="tcp:56143:6"/>
of evidences, you undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed
held forth for the royal
cause, with such force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and undeniable sense as
those that were not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
at least were startled;
and I shall never forget the
happy things I have heard
you say on that glorious
subject, with a zeal so fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
yet so modest and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
your argument, so solid,
just, so generous and so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hearty, as has begot you
applauses and blessing round
the board: a thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
a History I cou'd
wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

acts of Loyalty; but that
<pb facs="tcp:56143:6"/>
even your Enemies allow,
and I will spare it here, and
only say you are an honour
and a credit to the Cause
that's proud to own you.</p>
                  <p>In this you are far distan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to my amorous Hero; but at
least for my own satisfaction,
and that I may believe <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
truly happy, give me
leave to fansie him such a
person as your self, and then
I cannot fail of fansying him
too, speaking at the fee: of
<hi>Silvia,</hi> pleading his right of
love with the same softness
in his eyes and voice, as you
can do when you design
to conquer; whene'er you
<pb facs="tcp:56143:7"/>
spread your nets for Game,
you need but look abroad,
fix and resolve, though you,
unlike the forward youth of
this Age, so nicely pursue
the quarry; it is not all, or
any Game you fly at, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Bird that comes to net
can please your delicate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
though you are young
as new desire, as beautiful
as light, as amorous as a
God, and wanton as a <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi>
that smiles, and shoots,
and plays, and mischiefs all
his fond hours away: Pray
Heaven you be not reserv'd
like our Hero for some Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
'tis an ill sign when so
<pb facs="tcp:56143:7"/>
much beauty passes daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded,
that your love is
reserved to an end as mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as that of our <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you'll be out of
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Letters of a Whigg to me
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> but to make you amends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sir, pray take notice <hi>Silvia</hi>
is true Tory in every part,
if but to love a Whigg be not
crime enough in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to pall your appetite, and
for which even her youth
and beauty cannot make an
attonement; commodity,
which rarely fails in the
<pb facs="tcp:56143:8"/>
Trade of love, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was so low a Market for
beauty of both Sexes, yet
he that's fortified and stor'd
like happy you, need never
fear to find his price; for
wit and good humour bear
still a rate, and have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
value, while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is rated by opinion and
is at best but a curious pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
where one and the
same dull silent Charms
make up the day, while the
other is always new, and
(to use your own expression)
is a Book where one turns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a new leaf every minute,
and finds something diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb facs="tcp:56143:8"/>
in eternal new discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
it elevates ones Spirits,
charms the Soul, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
ones stock; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one has a longer date of
hearing than seeing, and the
eyes are sooner satiated than
the ear; therefore do not
depend too much on beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty,
'tis but a half conquest
you will make when you
shew the Man only, you
must prove him too; give
the soft Sex a sight of your
fine Mind as well as your
fine Person; but you are a
lazy Lover, and ly fallow
for want of industry, you
rust your stock of hoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ded

love, while you gaze only
and return a single sigher;
believe me, Friend, if you
continue to fight at that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
weapon, there will be no
great store of wounds given
or taken on either side; you
must speak and write if you
wou'd be happy, since you
can do it so infinitely to
purpose; who can be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
without Love? for me,
I never numbred those dull
days amongst those of my
life, in which I had not my
Soul fill'd with that soft pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
to Love! why 'tis the
only secret in nature that
restores Life, to all the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
<pb facs="tcp:56143:9"/>
and charms of living;
and to me there seems no
thing so strange, as to see
people walk about, laugh,
do the acts of Life, and
impertinently trouble the
world without knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of that soft, that
noble passion, or without
so much as having an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

There is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ashore hour
past through the swift hand of

time, since I was all despairing
raging Love, jealous, fearful,
and impatient; and now,
now that your fond Letters
have dispers'd those Damons,
those tormenting Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and given a little respit,
a little tranquility to my
Soul; like States luxurious
grown with ease, it ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
rebells against the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
power that made it
great and happy; and now
that Traytor Honour heads the
mutiners within; Honour
whom my late mighty fears
had almost famisht and
brought to nothing, warm'd
and reviv'd by the new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
flame, makes War
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56143:41"/>
against Almighty Love! and
I, who but now nobly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for Love! by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
natural to my Sex, or
rather my fears, am turn'd
over to Honour's side: So the
despairing man stands on the
Rivers Bank, design'd to
plunge into the rapid stream,
till coward fear seizing his
timerous soul, he views around
once more the flow'ry Plains,
and looks with wishing eyes
back to the Groves, then
sighing stops, and cry's I was
too rash, forsakes the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
shore, and hasts away.
Thus indiscreet was I; was
all for Love, fond and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
Love! but when I saw
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56143:42"/>
it with full Tide flow in upon
me, one glance of Glorious
Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes me again
retreat. I will—I am resolv'd
—And must be brave! I
can't forget I'm Daughter to
the great <hi>Beralti,</hi> and Sister to
<hi>Mertilla,</hi> a yet unspotted
Maid, fit to produce a race of
Glorious Hero's! and can
<hi>Philander</hi>'s Love set no higher
value on me than base poor
prostitution! is that the price
of his heart?—Oh how I hate
thee now! or wou'd to
Heav'n I cou'd.—Tell me
not thou charming Beguiler,
that <hi>Mertilla</hi> was to blame,
was it a fault in her, and will
it be vertue in me; and can I

make me Mistress of it: No,

Oh Perfidious!—Let me not

surpasses all! there is an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

who has preserv'd him, and

Title, and indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
even competent parts
for so vast a trust or so Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a rule: One who never

in his Principles and

Ingratitude to his Majesty,
for so many Royal Bounty's,
Honours, and Glories heap'd

to set, any honest generous
heart against him; what is it
bewitches you so? is it his

'tis not enough that we tell
those we Love all they

to tell 'em too, every secret
that we know; and conceal
no part of that Heart one has
made at present to the person

and Man was only born robust
and strong to secure 'em on
those Thrones they are

Glorious Woman! was born

Conqueress, and wear with

proud I shou'd be to see the

elevated, so adorn'd with
Crowns and Scepters at her

see her smiling on the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Crown, distributing her
Glories to young waiting
Princes; there dealing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56143:85"/>
and there a Coronet.
Heavens! methinks I see the
lovely Virgin in this State, her
Chariot slowly driving
through the multitude that
press to gaze upon her, she
drest like <hi>Venus</hi> richly gay and
loose, her Hair and Robe
blown by the flying Winds,
discovering a Thousand

ye Envying Power she is, and yet
the sacred and inestimable treasure
was offer'd a trembling victim to
the o'rejoy'd and fancy'd Deity,

and toyles of Loves long Sieges, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht

all the numerous Host of Womens

fall just fainting before the surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Gates, unable to receive the

<hi>Demon,</hi> malicious at my Glory,
seiz'd my vigor? What God, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of my mighty joy, render'd me
ashameful object of his Raillery?
Snatcht my (till then) never failing
power, and left me dying on thy
Charming Bosom. Heavens, how
I lay! Silent with wonder, rage
and extasy of Love, unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
or rail or storm, or seek for
ease but with my sighs alone, which
made up all my breath; my mad
desires remain'd, but all unactive
as Age or Death it self, as cold and
feeble, as unfit for joy, as if my
Youthful fire had long been past,
or <hi>Silvia</hi> had never been blest with
Charms. Tell me thou wondrous
perfect Creature, tell me, where
lay the hidden Witchcraft? Was
<hi>Silvia's</hi> Beauty too Divine to mix
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56143:105"/>
with Mortal Joys? Ah no, 'twas
Ravishing but Humane all. Yet
sure 'twas so approaching to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as chang'd my Fire to Awfull
Adoration, and all my wanton
heat to reverend Contemplation.
—But this is nonsense all, 'twas
something more that gave me
rage, despair and torments insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable:
No, 'twas no dull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
tame Divinity, but mortal
killing Agony, unlucky disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
unnatural impotence.
Oh I am lost, enchanted by some
Magick Spell: Oh what can <hi>Silvia</hi>
say? What can she think of my
sond passion? She'll swear 'tis all
a cheat, I had it not. No, it could
not be, such Tales I've often heard,
as often laught at too; of disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Lovers; wou'd <hi>Silvia</hi> wou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

recompence, the full reward,
the Heaven for all my sufferings,
do I lye gazing only and no more?

Oh my eternal shame!—
Curse on my Youth, give me ye
Powers Old Age, for that has some
excuse, but Youth has none: 'tis
Dullness, Stupid Insensibility:

Oh <hi>Silvia,</hi> I have reflected on all
the little circumstances that might
occasion this distaster, and damn
me to this degree of coldness, but
I can fix on none: I had 'tis true

coming through the Garden, I saw

fear'd to be mistaken in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

Imagin'd it him; nor was I mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
when I heard his voice calling
in low tone—<hi>Melinda.</hi>—At which
I mended my pace, and e're he got
half way the Garden recover'd the
Door, and softly unlocking it, got
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56143:106"/>
in unperceiv'd and fasten'd it after
me, well enough assur'd that he
saw not which way I vanisht:
however it fail'd not to alarm me
with some fears on your dear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that disturb'd my repose,
and which I thought then not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to impart to you, and which
indeed all vanisht at the sight of
my Adorable Maid: When enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy Apartment, I beheld thee
extended on a Bed of Roses, in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which, if possible, by their
wanton loose negligence and
gaiety augmented thy natural
Charms: I trembling sell on my
Knees by your Bed-side, and gaz'd
a while, unable to speak for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of joy and love: You too
were silent, and remain'd so, so
long that I ventur'd to press your
Lips with mine, which all their
eager kisses could not put in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so that I fear'd you fainted;
a sudden fright that in a moment
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56143:107"/>
chang'd my Feaver of Love into
a cold Ague fit; but you reviv'd
me with a Sigh again, and fired
me anew, by pressing my hand,
and from that silent soft incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
I by degrees ravisht
a thousand Blisses; yet still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your tempting charming
kisses, you would cry—Oh my
<hi>Philander</hi> do not injure me,—Be
sure you press me not to the last
joys of Love;—Oh have a care
or I am undone for ever; restrain
your roving hands,—Oh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would they wander,—My
Soul, my joy, my everlasting
Charmer, Oh whether would you
go.—Thus with a Thousand
Cautions more, which did but
raise what you design'd to calm,
you made me but the madder to
possess: not all the Vows you bad
me call to mind, could now restrain
my wild and head-strong passion;
my raving raging (but my soft)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56143:107"/>
desire: No <hi>Silvia,</hi> No, it was not
in the power of feeble flesh and
blood to find resistance against so
many Charms; yet still you made
me swear, still I protested, but still
burnt on with the same torturing
flame, till the vast pleasure ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

became a pain: To add to this,
I saw (Yes <hi>Silvia</hi> not all your Art
and Modesty could hide it) I saw
the Ravishing Maid as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
as I; she burnt with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
fire, with equal Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Not all her care could keep
the Sparks concealed, but it broke
out in every word and look; her
trembling tongue, her feeble faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voice betray'd it all, sighs in
terrupting every syllable; a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment
I never saw till then
dwelt in her Charming Eyes,
that contradicted all her little
Vows; her short and double
breathings heav'd her Breast, her
swelling snowy breast, her hands
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56143:108"/>
that grasp'd me trembling as they
clos'd, while she permitted mine
unknown, unheeded to traverse
all her Beauties, till quite forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all I'd faintly promised, and
wholly abandoning my soul to joy,
I rusht upon her, who all fainting
lay beneath my useless weight, for
on a sudden all my power was fled
swifter than Lightning hurryed
through my infeebled veins, and
vanisht all: Not the dear lovely
Beauty which I prest, the Dying
Charms of that fair face and eyes,
the Clasps of those soft Arms, nor
the bewitching accent of her voice
that murmur'd Love half smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>her'd
in her Sighs, nor all my
Love, my vast, my mighty passion,
could call my fugitive vigor back
again: Oh no, the more I look—
The more I touch'd and saw, the
more I was undone. Oh pity me
my too too lovely Maid, do not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56143:108"/>
revile the faults which you alone
create. Consider all your Charms at
once expos'd, consider every sense
about me ravisht, o'recome with
joys too mighty to be supported:
No wonder if I fell a shameful
sacrifice to the fond Deity, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how I waited, how I strove,
and still burnt on and every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
touch still added fuel to the
vigorous Fire; which by your
delay consum'd it self in burning.
I want Philosophy to make this
out, or faith to fix my unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on any chance or natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
but this my Charming
<hi>Silvia</hi> I am sure, that had I lov'd
you less, I'd been less wretched:
Nor had we parted <hi>Silvia</hi> on so ill
terms, nor had I left you with an
opinion so disadvantagious for <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander,</hi>
but for that unhappy noise
at your Chamber door, which
alarming your fear, occasion'd
your recovery from that dear
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56143:109"/>
trance, to which Love and soft de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
had reduc'd you and me from
the most tormenting silent Agony
that disappointed joy ever possest
a fond expecting heart with. Oh
Heavens to have my <hi>Silvia</hi> in my
power, Favour'd by silence, night,
and safe retreat! then, then, to lye
a tame cold sigher only, as if my
<hi>Silvia</hi> gave that Assignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by stealth, undrest, all loose
and languishing, fit for the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
business of the Night, only to
hear me prattle, see me gaze, or
tell her what a pretty sight it was
to see the Moon shine through
the dancing Boughs. O Damn
my harden'd dullness,—But no
more,—I am all fire and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at the thought,—But I was
saying, <hi>Silvia,</hi> we both recover'd
then when the noise alarm'd us.
I long to know whether you think
we were betray'd, for on that
knowledge rests a mighty part of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56143:109"/>
my destiny, I hope we are not, by
an accident that befell me at my
going away, which (but for my
untimely force of leaving my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Silvia,</hi> which gave me pains
insupportable) would have given
me great diversion. You know our
fear of being discover'd, occasioned
my disguise, for you found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
I should depart, your fear
had so prevail'd and that in <hi>Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi>
Night Gown and Head dress;
thus attir'd with much ado, I went
and left my soul behind me, and
finding no body all along the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
nor in my passage from your
apartment into the Garden, I was
a thousand times about to return
to all my joys; when in the midst
of this almost ended dispute, I saw
by the light of the Moon (which
was by good fortune under a
Cloud and could not distinctly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the sight) a man taking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me with cautious speed,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56143:110"/>
which made me advance with the
more haste to recover the Grove,
believing to have escap'd him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Covert of the Trees; for
retreat I could not without betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which way I went; but just at
the entrance of the Thicket, he
turning short made up to me, and
I perceiv'd it <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Count,
who taking me for <hi>Melinda</hi> who it
seems he expected, caught hold
of my Gown as I would have
pass'd him, and Cry'd, Now <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda</hi>
I see you are a Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
—Come retire with me into
the Grove where I have a present
of a heart and something else to
make you, that will be of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to you than that of <hi>Alexis</hi>
though something younger.—I
all confounded knew not what to
reply, nor how, lest he should find
his mistake, at least if he he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
not who I was: Which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
gave him occasion to go on,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56143:110"/>
which he did in this manner;
What not a word <hi>Melinda,</hi> or do
you design I shall take your silence
for consent? If so, come my pretty
Creature, let us not lose the hour
Love has given us; at this he
would have advanc'd, leading me
by the hand which he prest and
kist very amorously: Judg my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
<hi>Silvia</hi> in what a fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
your <hi>Lysander</hi> was then in.
What should I do? to go had disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
him worse than I was with
thee before; not to go, betray'd me:
I had much adoe to hold my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and unwilling to speak,
while I was thus imployed in
thought, <hi>Monsieur</hi>—Pulling me
(eager of joys to come,) and I
holding back, he stop'd and cry'd,
sure <hi>Melinda</hi> you came not hither
to bring me a Denial. I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
whispering,—Softly, Sir
for Heavens sake (sweetning my
voice as much as possible) consider
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56143:111"/>
I'm a Maid, and would not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
for the world. Who can
discover us? reply'd my Lover,
what I take from thee shall never
be mist, not by <hi>Alexis</hi> himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Wedding Night;—Come
—Sweet Child come:—With
that I pull'd back and whisper'd—
Heavens, would you make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
of me?—Says he—A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
what wouldst thou be a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin?
Then I reply'd as before—
I am no Whore, Sir,—No crys
he, but I can quickly make thee
one, I have my Tools about me
Sweet-heart, therefore let's lose
no time but fall to work: this last
raillery from the brisk old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
had in spight of resolution
almost made me burst out into
loud Laughten, when he took
more gravity upon him, and cry'd
—Come, come <hi>Melinda,</hi> why all
this foolish argument at this hour
in this place, and after so much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56143:111"/>
Courtship, believe me I'l be
kind to thee for ever; with that he
clapt fifty Guinnies in a Purse into
one hand, and something else that
shall be nameless into the other,
presents that had both been worth
<hi>Melinda's</hi> acceptance: All this
while was I studying an evasion, at
last to shorten my pleasant adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
looking round, I cry'd softly,
are you sure, Sir, we are safe—For
Heavens sake step towards the
Garden door and see, for I would
not be discover'd for the world,—
Nor I cry'd he—But do not fear
all's safe:—However see (whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
I) that my fear may not
disturb your joys. With that he
went toward the House, and I slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into the Grove got immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
into the Meadow, where
<hi>Alexis</hi> waited my coming with
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> so I left the expecting
Lover I suppose ranging the Grove
for his fled Nimph, and I doubt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56143:112"/>
will fall heavy on poor <hi>Melinda,</hi>
who shall have the Guinneys
either to restore or keep as she and
the angry Count can agree: I
leave the management of it to her
wit and conduct.</p>
                        <p>This account I thought necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to give my Charmer, that she
might prepare <hi>Melinda</hi> for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
who understanding all that
passed between us, may so dispose
of matters, that no discovery may
happen by mistake, and I know my
<hi>Silvia</hi> and she can find a thousand
excuses for the suppos'd <hi>Melinda's</hi>
flight. But my Adorable Maid, my
business here was not to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my Adventure only, nor
of my ravings, but to tell my <hi>Silvia</hi>
on what my life depends; which
is, in a permission to wait on her
again this insuing night; make no
excuse, for if you do, by all I adore
in Heaven and Earth, I'll end my
life here where I receiv'd it. I'll

my guilty blushing face? Thou
hast undone my eternal quiet,
Oh thou hast ruin'd my everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
repose, and I must never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look abroad again: Curse on
my face that first debauch'd my
Vertue, and taught thee how
to Love! Curse on my tempting
youth, my shape, my Air, my Eyes,
my Voice, my Hands, and every
charm that did contribute to my
fatal love, a lasting Curse on all—
But those of the adorable <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and those—even in this raging
Minute, my furious passion dares
not approach with an indecent
thought: No, they are sacred all,
Madness it self would spare 'em,
and shouldst thou now behold me
as I sit, my Hair dishevel'd, Ruffl'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56143:115"/>
and disorder'd, my Eyes bedewing
every word I write, when for each
Letter I let fall a tear; then (prest
with thought) starting, I dropt my
Pen, and fall to rave a new, and
tear those Garments, whose loose
negligence help'd to betray me to
my shameful ruine, wounding my
breast, but want the resolution
to wound it as I ought; which
when I but propose, Love stays the
thought, raging and wild as 'tis,
the Conqueror checks it, with
whispering only <hi>Philander</hi> to
my soul; the dear Name calmes
me to an easiness, gives me the
Pen into my trembling hand, and
I pursue my silent soft complaint:
Oh! shouldst thou see me thus, in
all these sudden different change
of Passions, thou wouldst say
<hi>Philander</hi> I were mad indeed;
Madness it self can find no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
motions: And I would calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask thee, for I am calm again,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56143:116"/>
how comes it my adorable <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
that thou canst possess a
Maid with so much Madness? who
art thy self a miracle of softness,
all sweet and all serene, the most
of Angel in thy composition that
ever mingled with humanity;
the very words fall so gently from
thy tongue,—are utter'd with a
Voice so ravishingly soft, a tone
so tender and so full of Love,
'twould charm even frenzy, calm
rude distraction, and wildness
wou'd become a silent Listener;
there's such a sweet serenity in
thy face, such innocence and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in thy eyes, should desart Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages,
but gaze on thee, sure they
would forget their native forest
wildness, and be inspir'd with
easy-Gentleness: Most certainly
this God-like power thou hast.
Why then? Oh tell me in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony
of my soul, why must those
charms that bring Tranquility
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56143:116"/>
and peace to all, make me alone a
wild, unseemly raver? Why has
it contrary effects on me? Oh! all
I act and say is perfect madness:
Yet this is the least unaccountable
part of my most wretched Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
—Oh! I must ner'e behold

nor ever more believe thy dear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding

this;—What to yield,—To
yield my Honour! Betray the
secrets of my Virgin wishes—My
new desires; my unknown shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
flame;—Hell and Death!
Where got I so much confidence?
Where learnt the harden'd and
unblushing folly? To wish was
such a fault, as is a crime unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
to own; to shew desire is
such a sin in vertue as must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
reproach from all the world;
but I, unlucky I, have not only

I yield to thy Armes,—I'll

more than rage that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that thought: some Magick
Spell that in the midst of all my
sense of Shame keeps me from
true repentance; this angers me,
and makes me know my Honour
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56143:117"/>
but a fantom: Now I could curse
again my Youth and Love; but
Oh! when I have done, alas <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
I find my self as guilty as
before; I cannot make one firm
resolve against the, or if I do, when
I consider thee, they weigh not
all one lovely Hair of thine. 'Tis
all in vain the Charming Cause
remains <hi>Philander</hi>'s still as lovely
as before, 'tis him I must remove
from my fond Eyes and heart,
him I must banish from my touch,
my smell, and every other sense,
by Heaven! I cannot bear the
mighty pressure, I cannot see his
Eyes, and touch his Hands, smell
the perfume every Pore of his
breaths forth, tast thy soft kisses,
hear thy Charming Voice, but I
am all on flame: NO, 'tis these I
must exclaim on, not my Youth,
'tis they debauch my soul, no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
propensity in me to yield, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56143:118"/>
to admit of such destructive fires,
Fain I would put it off, but 'twill
not do, I am the Aggressor still;
else, why is not every living Maid
undone, that does but touch or
see thee? Tell me why? No, the
fault's in me, and thou art inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
—Were but my Soul less

I came, and all the Women en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

—But thou <hi>Philander</hi> hast made
me take new measures, I now
can think of nothing but of thee,
I loath the sound of Love from

makes my soul impatient,
and does not only dull me
into Melancholly, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes
me out of all humour,
out of all patient sufferance, and
I am never so well pleas'd when

and curse my Character

it permits me not to prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is worth the worlds injoyment,
I hate to dress, I hate to be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the noise of Equipage and
Crowds, and would be more
content to live with thee in some

one moments conversation
with <hi>Philander:</hi> Maist thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and loath me, a Curse the
greatest that I can invent, if this
be any thing but real honest truth.
No, no <hi>Philander,</hi> I find I never
lov'd till now, I understood it not,
nor knew not what those Sighs
and Pressings meant which others
gave me; yet every speaking
glance thy Eyes put on inform
my soul what 'tis they plead and
languish for: If you but touch
my hand, my breath grows faint
and short, my blood glows in my
face, and runs with an unusual
warmth through every vein, and
tells my heart what 'tis <hi>Philander</hi>
ailes, when he falls sighing on my
Bosom; oh then I fear. I answer
every look, and every sigh and
touch, in the same silent but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56143:120"/>
Language, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

Foolish Maids, true Love

'tis false, for now I Love, and know

as never any Woman can equal

there's an intrinsick value in thy

and yet I say I own, for
I may own it, now Heaven and
you are Witness of my shame,
I own with all this love, with all
this passion, so vast, so true and
so unchangeable, that I have
Wishes, new unwonted Wishes;
at every thought of thee, I find
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56143:121"/>
a strange disorder in my blood,
that pants and burns in every
Vein, and makes me blush, and
sigh, and grow impatient, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
and angry; but when I
know it the effects of Love, I'm
reconcil'd, and wish and sigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
but when I sit and Gaze
upon thy Eyes, thy Languishing
thy Lovely dying Eyes; play
with thy soft white hand, and
lay my glowing Cheek to thine.
—Oh God! What Language
can express my transport, all that
is tender, all that is soft desire
seizes every trembling Limb,
and 'tis with pain conceal'd.—
Yes, yes <hi>Philander,</hi> 'tis the fatal
truth, since thou hast found it,
I confess it too, and yet I love
thee dearly; long, long it was
that I essay'd to hide the guilty
flame, if Love be guilt; for I
confess I did dissemble a coldness
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56143:122"/>
which I was not Mistress of:
there lyes a Womans Art, there
all her boasted Vertue, it is but
well dissembling, and no more.
—But mine alas is gone, for

that should secure my Honour,
thou hast betray'd and left it
quite defenceless. Ah what's a
Womans Honour when 'tis so
poorly guarded: No wonder that
you conquer with such ease,
when we are only safe by the

where is it? I have lost it all;
'tis irrecoverably lost: yes, yes,
ye charming perjur'd man, 'tis

me.—</p>
                        <p>What though I lay extended

<hi>Philander,</hi> must you take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?
Must you be perjur'd
because I was tempting? 'Tis
true, I let you in by stealth by
night, whose silent darkness fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

Awful light had been a looker

and so feebly I upbraided you,

for thou hast no excuse in store

that I am hated, loath'd,—
I cannot bear that thought,—
Or if I do, it shall only serve to

would not depart without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

Question. Ah, <hi>Philander!</hi> why
do you press a heart too ready to
yield to Love and you! alas, I
fear you guess too well my answer,
and your own Soul might save me
the blushing trouble of a reply.
I am plung'd in past hope of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and since my fate has poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me out for ruine, I cannot fall
more gloriously. Take then, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
to your dear Arms a Maid
that can no longer resist, who is
disarm'd of all defensive power:
She yields, she yields, and does
confess it too; and sure she must
be more than mortal that can hold
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56143:125"/>
out against thy charms and vows.
Since I must be undone and give
all away, I'll do it generously,
and scorn all mean reserves: I will
be brave in Love, and lavish all;
nor shall <hi>Philander</hi> think I Love
him well unless I do. Take, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Victor, then, what your
own merits, and what Love has
give you; take, take at last the
dear reward of all your sighs and
tears, your vows and sufferings.
But since, <hi>Philander,</hi> 'tis an Age

those dear silent hours, thou knowst
I dare not give thee admittance:
I do conjure thee go to <hi>Cesario<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

whom I find too pressing, not to

that every thing alarms my fears;
oh! satisfie 'em then and go, 'tis

affairs, and render your self time

which is where you last night wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and 'twill be at least eight at

you to my arms. Come in your
Chariot, and do not heat your self
with riding; have a care of me
and my life in the preservation of
all I love. Be sure you go, and
do not, my <hi>Philander,</hi> out of a

I have never yet acquainted our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

a lover, one that has lain by thy
unhappy Sister's side so many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
years, by whom he has a dear
and lovely off-spring, by which he
has more fixt himself to thee by
relation and blood: Consider this,
oh fond heedless girl! and suffer
not a momentary joy to rob thee
of the eternal fame, me of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

repose, and fix a brand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our noble house, and so undoe
us all.—Alas, consider after an
action so shamefull, thou must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
thy self in some remote cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the world, where honesty
and honour never are heard of: No
thou canst not shew thy face, but
'twill be pointed at for something
monstrous: for a hundred ages
may not produce a story so leudly
infamous and loose as thine. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
(fond as you are) you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the sole joy of being belov'd
by him, will attone for those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and reproaches you will
meet with in the censuring world:
But Child, remember and believe
me, there is no lasting faith in sin;
he that has broke his Vows with
Heaven and me, will be again per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
to Heaven and thee, and all
the world!—he once thought
me as lovely, lay at my feet, and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56143:132"/>
sigh'd away his soul, and told such
pityous stories of his sufferings,
such sad, such mournfull tales of
his departed rest, his broken heart
and everlasting Love, that sure I
thought it had been a sin not to
have credited his charming perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
in such a way he swore, with
such a grace he sigh'd, so artfully
he mov'd so tenderly he look'd
Alas, dear Child, then all he said
was new, unusual with him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

by any but your eyes: Alas,
he had been my captive, my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whining slave, disdain to put
him on your fetters now; alas,
he can say no new thing of his
heart to thee, 'tis love at second
hand, worn out, and all its gaudy
luster tarnish't; besides, my Child,
if thou hadst no religion binding
enough, no honour that could stay
thy fatal course, yet nature should
oblige thee, and give a check to
the unreasonable enterprise. The
griefs and dishonour of our noble
Parents, who have been eminent
for vertue and piety, oh suffer 'em
not to be regarded in this censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
world as the most unhappy
of all the race of old nobility; thou
art the darling child, the joy of all,
the last hope left, the refuge of
their sorrow; for they, alas, have
had but unkind stars to influence
their unadvis'd off-spring: no want
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56143:133"/>
of vertue in their education, but
this last blow of fate must strike
'em dead: Think, think of this,
my Child, and yet retire from
ruine; haste, fly from destruction
which pursues thee fast; haste,
haste, and save thy parents and a
sister, or what's more dear, thy
fame; mine has already receiv'd
but too many desperate wounds,
and all through my unkind Lord's
growing passion for thee, which
was most fatally founded on my
ruine, and nothing but my ruine
could advance it; and when my
Sister, thou hast run thy race, made
thy self loath'd, undone and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
as hell, despis'd, scorn'd and
abandoned by all, lampoon'd, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
diseas'd; this faithless man,
this cause of all will leave thee too,
grow weary of thee, nauseated by
use, he may perhaps consider what
sins, what evils, and what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56143:134"/>
and shames thou'st brought
him to, and will not be the last
shall loath and hate thee: For
though youth fansie it have a
mighty race to run of pleasing
vice and vanity, the course will
end, the goal will be arriv'd to at
the last, where they will sighing
stand, look back and view the
length of pretious time they've
fool'd away; when travers'd o'er
with honour and discretion, how
glorious were the journey, and

whose Arms I fell dead,
shame on me, dead—and the first
thought my Soul conceiv'd when
it return'd, was, not to dy in jest.
I answer'd your commands, and
hastned to the Grove, where—
by all that's sacred, by thy self I
swear (a dearer oath than heaven
and earth can furnish me with) I did
resolve to die; but oh, how soon my

dire despair, to fury and revenge;
for there I saw <hi>Foscario,</hi> my young
my fair, my rich and powerfull
Rival, he hasted through the Grove
all warm and glowing from the
fair false ones arms; the blushes
which thy eyes had kindled were
fresh upon his cheeks, his looks
were sparkling with the new blown
fire his heart so briskly burnt with,
a glad, a peacefull smile drest all
his face, trick'd like a Bridegroom;
while he perfum'd the air as he past
through it—none but the man
that loves and dotes like me is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to express my sense of rage: I
quickly turn'd the Sword from my
own heart to send it to his eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

his Sword, which I wou'd fain have

have died, but he refused to arm
his hand a new against the man that
had not took advantage of him,
and thus we parted: Then 'twas

by Heaven, I do adore thee so, I
still shou'd love thee on; shou'd I
have seen thee clasp him in thy

I shou'd forgive thee; for I swear

was form'd of nothing but of love,
and all that love, and all that soul
is <hi>Silvia's,</hi> but yet since thou hast
fram'd me an excuse, be kind and
carry it on—to be deluded well,
as thou canst do't, will be the

shall not find the cheat: I'll come
then—and lay my self at thy

gave an account to <hi>Monsieur,</hi> my

that I fear'd is fallen upon me,
I have been arraign'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
three Judges, severe as the

But, Oh Heavens! had you seen

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56143:159"/>
at my fortitude, my courage
and my resolution, and all from
Love! For surely I had died, had
not thy love, thy powerfull love
supported me; through all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
of life and fate, that can
and will support me; in the midst of
all their clamours and their rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
I had from that a secret and
a soft repose within, that whisper'd
me, <hi>Philander</hi> loves me still; discar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and renoune'd by my fond Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Love still replies, <hi>Philander</hi>
still will own thee; thrown from
thy Mother's and thy Sister's arms,
<hi>Philander</hi>'s still are open to receive
thee: And though I rave, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

think that I am the fatal cause,
who makes so sad confusion in our
Family: for, oh 'tis pitious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
my Sister's sighs and tears, my
Mother's sad despair, my Father's
raging and his weeping, by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56143:159"/>
turns: Yet even these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
objects, that wou'd move
the most obdurate stubborn heart
to pity and repentance, render
not mine relenting; and yet I'm
wondrous pitifull by nature, and
I can weep and faint to see the sad
effects of my loose wanton love,
yet cannot find repentance for
the dear charming sin; and yet,
shoud'st thou behold my Mother's
languishment, no bitter words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from her lips, no tears fall
from her down-caft eyes, but si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and sad as death she sits, and
will not view the light; shoud'st
thou, I say, behold it, thou woud'st
if not repent, yet grieve that thou
hadst lov'd me: Sure love has quite
confounded nature in me, I cou'd
not else behold this fatal ruine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
revenging it upon my stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
heart, a thousand times a-day
I make new vows against the God

of Love, but 'tis too late, and I'm
as often perjur'd—Oh, shou'd
the Gods revenge the broken vows
of Lovers, what Love-sick man,
what maid betray'd like me, but
wou'd be damn'd a thousand times
for every little love-quarrel, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
kind resentment makes us swear
to love no more, and every smile,
and every flattering softness from
the dear injurer, make us perjur'd:
Let all the force of vertue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
interest joyn with my suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Parents to perswade me to
cease to love <hi>Philander,</hi> yet let him
but appear, let him but look on me
with those dear charming eyes, let
him but sigh, or press me to his
fragrant cheek, fold me—and cry
—ah, <hi>Silvia,</hi> can you quit me—
no, you must not, you shall not,
nay, I know you cannot, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you are mine—there is
such eloquence in those dear words
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56143:160"/>
when utter'd with a voice so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and so passionate, that I believe
'em irresistable—alas, I find'em
so—and easily break all the feebler
vows I make against thee; yes, I
must be undone, perjur'd, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn,
incorrigible, unnatural,
disobedient, and any thing, rather
than not <hi>Philander</hi>'s—turn then,
my Soul, from these domestick,
melancholy objects, and look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
look for forward for a while on
charming prospects; look on <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
the dear, the young, the
amorous <hi>Philander,</hi> whose very
looks infuse a tender joy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Soul, and chase all cares,
all sorrows and anxious thoughts
from thence, whose wanton play
is softer than that of young fledg'd
Angels, and when he looks and
sighs, and speaks, and touches, he
is a very God: Where art thou,
oh thou miracle of youth, thou

who accordingly came to him

drest like a youth, to secure her
self from a discovery. They staid
not long to caress each other,
but he taking the welcome Maid
in his Arms, with a transported
joy bore her to a small Vessel,
that lay ready near the <hi>Beach,</hi>
where with only <hi>Brilljard</hi> and
two Men Servants, they put to
Sea, and past into <hi>Holland,</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the nearest Port; where
after having refresht themselves
for two or three days, they past
forward towards the <hi>Brill. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
still remaining under that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
disguise; but in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from Town to Town, which
is sometimes by Coach, and other
times by Boat, they chanc'd one
day to incounter a young <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
of a more than Ordinary
Gallantry, (for that Country so
degenerate from good manners
and almost common Civility,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56143:196"/>
and so far short of all the good
qualities that made themselves
appear in this young Noble Man.
He was very handsom, well made,
well drest, and very well attended;
and whom we will call <hi>Octavio,</hi>
and who, young as he was, was
one of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi>
he spoke admirable good French,
and had a vivacity and quickness
of Wit unusual with the Natives
of that part of the World, and
almost above all the rest of his
Sex: <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> having
already agreed for the Cabin of
the Vessel that was to carry them
to the next Stage, <hi>Octavio</hi> came
too late to have any place there
but amongst the common crow'd;
which the Master of the Vessel,
who knew him was much troubl'd
at, and addrest himself as civilly as
he cou'd to <hi>Philander</hi> to beg permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for one Stranger of quality
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56143:197"/>
to dispose of himself in the Cabin
for that day: <hi>Phillander</hi> being well
enough pleas'd, so to make an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with some of power of
that Country, readily consented,
and <hi>Octavia</hi> enter'd with an address
so graceful and obliging, that at
first sight he inclin'd <hi>Phillanders</hi>
heart to a friendship with him,
and on the other side the lovely
person of <hi>Phillander,</hi> the quality that
appear'd in his face and mein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
<hi>Octavio</hi> to become no less
his admirer. But when he salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Silvia,</hi> who appear'd to him
a youth of quality, he was
extreamly charm'd with her pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
gayety, and an unusual Air
and life in her address and motion,
he felt a secret joy and pleasure
play about his Soul he knew not
why; And was almost angry that
he felt such an emotion for a youth,
tho the most lovely that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56143:197"/>
saw: After the first comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they fell into discourse of
a thousand indifferent things; and
if he were pleas'd at first sight
with the two Lovers, he was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charm'd by their conversation;
especially that of the amiable
youth; who well enough pleas'd
with the young Stranger, or else
hitherto having met nothing so
accomplisht in her short Travels,
and indeed despairing to meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such; she put on all her gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and charms of Wit, and made
as absolute a Conquest as 'twas
possible for her suppos'd Sex to
do over a man, who was a great
admirer of the other; and surely
the lovely Maid never appear'd
so charming and desirable as that
day; they din'd together in the
Cabin, and after dinner repos'd
on little Matresses by each others
side, where every motion, every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56143:198"/>
Limb as carelessly she lay, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
a thousand Graces and more
and more inslam'd the now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
Lover; she cou'd not
move<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor smile, nor speak, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any charm about her, but had
some peculiar Grace that begun
to make him uneasie; and from
a thousand little Modesties both
in her blushes and motions he
had a secret hope she was not
what she seem'd, but of that Sex
whereof she discover'd so many
softnesses and beauties; tho to
what advantage that hope wou'd
amount to his repose, was yet a
disquiet he had not consider'd
nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elt: Nor cou'd he by any
fondness between them or indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of love, conceive how
the lovely Strangers were alied;
he only hop'd, and had no
thoughts of fear, or any thing
that cou'd check his new begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

flame. While thus they
past the after-noon, they ask'd a
thousand questions. Our Lovers
of the Country and manners,
and their security and civility
to Strangers; to all which <hi>Octavio</hi>
answer'd as a man, who wou'd
recommend the place and persons
purely to oblige their stay; for
now self interest makes him say
all things in favour of it; and of
his own friendship, offers them
all the service of a Man of power,
and who cou'd make an interest
in those that had more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
much he protested, much he
offer'd, and yet no more than he
design'd to make good on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
which they receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an acknowledgment, that plainly
discover'd a generosity and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
above the common rate of
Men; so that finding in each other
occasions for Love and friendship,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56143:199"/>
they mutually profest it, and nobly
entertain'd it. <hi>Octavio</hi> told his Name
and quality, left nothing unsaid that
might confirm the Lovers of his
sincerity. This begot a confidence in
<hi>Phillander,</hi> who in return told him
so much of his Circumstances as

but that being refus'd as too

see them plac'd in some one, which
he thought might be most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their quality; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
the trouble, but he prest too
eagerly to be deny'd, and he condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
them to a Merchants house
not far from his own, so Love
had contriv'd for the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement

persue, be the fair object of what

well enough recomended em to

thought it justice to leave em to

there: Nor was he at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd

his hopes, a thousand advantages
above all other men: but when

on his Charming youth
and Conversation, and every Grace

grew inflam'd, disorderd, restless,
angry, and out of Love with his
own attractions; consider'd every
Beauty of his own person and
found 'em, or at least thought 'em
infinitly short of those of his now

that he cou'd not hate nor did his

to Women. Tho in a Country
of much Freedom. Every day
she apear'd in the Toure, she fail'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56143:202"/>
not to make a conquest on some
unguarded heart of the fair Sex,
nor was it long ere she receiv'd
<hi>Billet Deux</hi> from most of the most
accomplish'd who could speak and
write <hi>French.</hi> This gave them a
pleasure in midst of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
exile; and she fail'd not
to boast her conquests to <hi>Octavio,</hi>
who every day gave all his hours
to Love, under the disguise of
Friendship, and every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
new wounds, both from
her conversation and beauty, and
every day confirm'd him more
in his first belief, that she was a
Woman: and that confirm'd his
Love. But still he took care to
hid his passion with a gallantry
that was natural to him, and to
very few besides; and he manag'd
his eyes, which were always full
of Love so equally to both, that
when he was soft and fond it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56143:203"/>
appear'd more his natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
than from any particuler
cause, and that you may believe
that all the arts of gallantry, and
graces of good managment were
more peculiarly his, than anothers,
his Race was illustrious, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
from that of the Princes
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and great birth will shine
through, and shew it self in spight
of education and obscurity, but
<hi>Octavio</hi> had all those additions
that render a man truly great and
brave, and this is the character of
him that was next undone by
our unfortunate and fatal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
At this rate for sometime
they liv'd thus disguis'd under
feign'd names. <hi>Octavio</hi> omitting
nothing that might oblige 'em in
the highest degree, and hardly
any thing was talk'd of but the
new and beautiful Strangers;
whose conquest in all places over
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56143:203"/>
the Ladys are well worthy, both
for their rarity and comody
to be related intirely by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a Novel. <hi>Octavio</hi> every
day saw with abundance of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the little revenges of Love
on those Womens hearts who had
made before little conquests over
him, and strove by all the gay
presents he made young <hi>Fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
(for so they call'd <hi>Silvia,</hi>)
to make him appear unresistable
to the Ladies, and while <hi>Silvia</hi>
gave them new wounds, <hi>Octavio</hi>
fail'd not to receive 'em too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the crow'd, till at last he
became a confirm'd slave to the
lovely unknown; and that which
was yet more flrange she capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
the Men no less than the
Women, who often gave her <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinades</hi>
under her Window with
Songs fitted to the Courtship of
a Boy, all which added to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56143:204"/>
their diversion; but fortune had
smil'd long enough and now grew
weary of obliging, she was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to undeceive both Sexes and
let 'em see the Errors of their love;
for <hi>Silvia</hi> fell into a Feaver so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
that <hi>Phillander</hi> no longer
hop'd for her recovery, in so much
that she was oblig'd to own her
Sex and take Women Servants out
of decency, this made the first disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of who and what they were,
and for which every body languisht
under a secret grief. But <hi>Octavio</hi>
who now was not only confirm'd
she was a Woman, but that she
was neither wife to <hi>Phillander,</hi>
nor cou'd in almost all possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ever be so: That she was his
Mistress, gave him hope that she
might one day as well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by him; and he found her
youth, her Beauty, and her quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
merited all his pains of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56143:204"/>
Courtship: And now there
remains no more than the fear of
her dying to oblige him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to a discovery of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
too violent now by his new
hope to be longer conceal'd, but
decency forbids he shou'd now
persue the dear design; he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and made Vows for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
visited her and found
<hi>Phillander</hi> the most deplorable
object that despair and love
cou'd render him, who lay eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
weeping on her bed, and
no Counsel or perswasion cou'd
remove him thence; but if by
chance they made him sensible
'twas for her repose, he wou'd
depart to ease his mind by new
torments, he wou'd rave and tear
his delicate hair, sigh and weep
upon <hi>Octavio</hi>'s bosome, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times begin to unfold the
story already known to tha
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56143:205"/>
generous Rival; despair, and hopes
of pitty from him, made him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all; and one day, when by
the advice of the Physitian he
was forc'd to quit the Chamber
to give her rest, he carried <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
to his own, and told him from
the beginning all the story of
his Love with the charming <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>
and with it all the story of
his Fate: <hi>Octavio</hi> sighing (tho
glad of the opportunity) told him
his affairs were already but too
well known, and that he fear'd
his safety from that discovery,
since the States had oblig'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to harbour no declar'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the French King: At
this news our young unfortunate
shew'd a rsentment that was so
moving, that even <hi>Octavio,</hi> who
felt a secret joy at the thoughts
if his departure, cou'd no longer
refrain from pity and tenderness,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56143:205"/>
even to a wish that he were less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
and never to part from
<hi>Silvia;</hi> but soon love grew again
triumphant in his heart, and all he
cou'd say was that he wou'd afford
him the aids of all his power in this
incounter, which with the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
of a Lover, whose life
depended on it, he receiv'd and
parted with him, who went to
learn what was decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
concerning him. While <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
return'd to <hi>Silvia</hi> the most
dejected Lover that ever Fate
produc'd; where he had not sigh'd
away above an hour but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Billet by <hi>Octavio's</hi> Page
from his Lord; he went to his
own apartment to read it, fearing
it might contain something too
sad for him to be able to hold his
temper at the reading of, and
which wou'd infallibly have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
the repose of <hi>Silvia,</hi> who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56143:206"/>
shar'd in every cruel thought of
<hi>Phillanders;</hi> when he was alone
he open'd it, and read this.</p>

aproacht. Ah! will you not suffer

only let me bear my treasure

some part of it, where pity and
compassion is no crime. Where
men have tender hearts, and have

Politicks are not all the business

                        <p>Perhaps, my Lord, you'l wonder
I plead no weightier Argument
for my stay than Love, or the
griefs and tears of a languishing
Maid: But oh! they are such tears
as every drop wou'd ransom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
and nothing that proceeds

to her, to me, and your Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

hence. For shou'd she look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad

appear in her natural and proper
beauty, alas they were undone.
Reproach not (my Lord) the
weakness of this confession, and
which I make with more Glory
than cou'd I boast my self Lord
of all the Universe: if it appear a
fault to the more grave and wise,
I hope my youth will plead some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

say 'twas his Destiny, but say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that it put no stop to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to Glory; rather it set

the greatest testimony I can now
render of it, is to warn you of
your aproaching danger. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
your departure, for there is no
safety in your stay. I just now heard
what was decreed against you
in councel, which no pleading nor
Eloquence of Friendship had force
enough to evade. Alass, I had but
one single voyce in the number,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56143:214"/>
which I sullenly and singly gave,
and which unregarded past. Go
then, my Lord, haste to some
place where good breeding and
humanity reigns. Go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Silvia,</hi> in providing for
your own safety; and believe
me, till she be in a Condition
to persue your Fortunes, I will
take such care that nothing
shall be wanting, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
here, in order to her
following after you. I am, alas
but too sensible of all the pains
you must indure by such a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
for I am neither insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
nor uncapable of love,
or any of its violent effects:
Go then, my Lord, and preserve
the lovely Maid in your flight,
since your stay and danger
will serve but to hasten on her
death: Go, and be satisfied she
shall find a protection sutable to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56143:214"/>
her Sex, her innocence, her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and her quality, and that
where-ever you fix your stay, she
shall be resign'd to your Arms
by my Lord,</p>

                  <p>After this Letter, finding no
hopes; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a dire necessity of departing,
he told <hi>Briljard</hi> his misfortune,
and ask'd his Counsel in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of affairs. <hi>Brilljard</hi>
(who of a Servant was become
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56143:215"/>
a Rival) you may believe, gave
him such advice as might remove
him from the object he ador'd.
But after a great deal of dissembl'd
trouble, the better to hide his joy,
he gave his advice for his going
with all the arguments that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
reasonable enough to <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
And at every period urg'd that
his life being dear to <hi>Silvia,</hi> and on
which hers so immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
he ought no longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
but haste his flight, to all
which councell our Amorous
<hi>Hero,</hi> with a soul ready to make
its way thro' his trembling body,
gave a sighing unwilling assent.
'Twas now no longer a dispute,
but was concluded he must go,
but how was only the question.
How shou'd he take his farewel,
how shou'd he bid adieu, and
leave the dear object of his
soul in an estate to hazardous,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56143:215"/>
he form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d a thousand sad Ideas to
torment himself with; fancying
he shou'd never see her more, that
he shou'd hear that she was dead,
tho now she appear'd on this
side of the Grave, and had all the
signs of a declining disease. He
fancy'd absence might make her
cold and abate her passion to him,
that her powerful beauty might
atract adorers, and she being but a
Woman, and no p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt Angel, but
her form, 'twas not expected she
shou'd want her Sexes frailties.
Now he cou'd consider how he
had won her, how by importunity
and opportunity she had at last
yielded to him, and therefore
might to some new Gamster, when
he was not by to keep her heart
in continual play: Then 'twas
that all the despair of jealous love,
the throbs and piercing of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
passion seiz'd his timorous and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56143:216"/>
tender hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, he fancy'd her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in some new Lovers Arms,
and ran o're all the soft enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had had with her; and
fancy'd with tormenting thought,
that so another wou'd posses her:
till rackt with tortures he almost
fainted on the <hi>Repose</hi> on which
he was set: But <hi>Brilljard</hi> rous'd
and indeavour'd to convince him:
Told him he hop'd his fear was
needless, and that he wou'd take
all the watchful care imaginable
of her conduct, be a spy upon her
vertue, and from time to time
give him notice of all that shou'd
pass: Bid him consider her qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and that she was no common
Mistriss whom hire cou'd lead
astray, and that if from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of her passion, or her more
severe fate she had yeilded to the
most Charming of men, he ought
as little to imagine she cou'd be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56143:216"/>
again a Lover, as that she cou'd
find an object of equal beauty
with that of <hi>Phillander.</hi> In fine, he
sooth'd and Flatter'd him into so
much ease, that he resolves to take
his leave for a day or two under
pretence of meeting and consulting
with some of the rebell party;
and that he wou'd return again
to her by that time it might be
imagin'd her feaver might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and <hi>Silvia</hi> in a condition to
receive the news of his being gone
for a longer time, and to know
all his affairs. While <hi>Brilljard</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
all things necessary for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<hi>Phillander</hi> went to <hi>Silvia.</hi>
From whom, having been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
two tedious hours; she
caught him in her Arms with a
transport of joy; reproach'd him
with want of Love, for being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
so long. But still the more
she spoke soft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighing words of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56143:217"/>
Love, the more his Soul was
seiz'd with melancholy. His sighs
redoubl'd and he cou'd not refrain
from leting fall some tears upon
her bosom—Which <hi>Silvia</hi>
perceiving with a look and a
trembling in her voyce, that
spoke her fear, she cry'd, oh <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander!</hi>
these are unusual marks
of your tenderness. Oh tell me,
tell me quickly, what they
mean. He answer'd with a sigh,
and she went on—'Tis so, I
am undone, 'tis your lost vows,
your broken faith you weep,
Yes, <hi>Phillander,</hi> you find the flower
of my beauty faded, and what you
lov'd before you pity now, and
these be the effects of it. Then
sighing, as if his Soul had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
on her neck, he cry'd by
heaven, by all the powers of
Love, thou art the same dear char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that thou wert, then pressing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56143:217"/>
her body to his bosom, he sigh'd a
new as if his heart were break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
—I know (says she) <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
there's some hidden cause
that gives these sighs their way,
and that dear face a paleness. Oh
tell me all; for she that cou'd
abandon all for thee, can dare the
worst of Fate, if thou must quit
me—Oh <hi>Phillander,</hi> if it
must be so, I need not stay the
lingering death of a feable Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
I know a way more noble
and more sudden. Pleas'd at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
which all most destroy'd
his jealousie and fears, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times he kist her, mixing
his grateful words and thanks
with sighs, and finding her fair
hands (which he put often to
his mouth) to increase their fires,
and her pulse to be more high and
quick, fearing to relapse her into
her (abating) feaver he forc'd a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56143:218"/>
smile, and told her, he had no
griefs, but what she made him
feel, no torments but her sickness,
nor sighs but for her pain, and
left nothing unsaid, that might
confirm her he was still more
and more her Slave; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his design in favour of
her health, he ceas'd not vowing
and protesting till he had settled
her in all the tranquillity of a
recovering beauty. And, as since
her first Illness he had never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from her Bed, so now
this night he strove to appear in
her Arms with all that usual
Gayety of Love that her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wou'd permit, or his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
cou'd feign, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ign
her a sleep at day-break
(with a force upon his Soul that
cannot be conceiv'd) but by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Lovers, he stole from her Arms
and retiring to his chamber
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56143:218"/>
he soon got himself ready
for his flight and departed. We
will leave <hi>Silvia</hi>'s ravings to be

my kind absence has taught me
to allow and bear without much

throw my self at her

for on that knowledg depends a

of my necessity of offending,
which none can so well relate as

not carry himself to her, who
had omitted no day, scarce any

not to the charming <hi>Silvia,</hi> but he
sound, in that which <hi>Philander</hi>
had writ to him, an Aire of
coldness altogether unusual with
that passionate Lover, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
short in point of tenderness to
those he had formerly seen of
his, and from what he had heard
him speak; so that he no longer
doubted (and the rather because he
hop'd it) but that <hi>Philander</hi> found
an abatement of that heat, which

he cou'd not conceal

he knew her Love was too quick

but he with reason
thought, that when she shou'd

slight she had put on her, her pride

sure he disguises the Lover: I
wonder the mask shou'd be put

he so frankly discover'd the

'Tis a mistery I wou'd sain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

not impute the lessen'd zeal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

you need no arguments to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

towards him, she found him
great, rich, powerful, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
without designing on him,
and tho she knew her Soul free
from all Passion, but that for <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi>
nevertheless she blusht and
was angry, that he had thoughts
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56143:224"/>
no more advantagious to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of those charmes, which she
wisht might appear to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
her Sex: It being natural
to Women to desire Conquests,
tho they hate the conquer'd; to
glory in the tryumph, tho they
despise the Slave. And believ'd,
while <hi>Octavio</hi> had so poor a sense
of her beauty as to believe it cou'd
be forsaken, he would adore it
less; And first to satisfie her pride
she left the softer business of her
heart to the next tormenting hour,
and sent him this careless answer
by his Page, believing if she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
too angry it might look as if
she valu'd his opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dissembled her thoughts, as
women in those cases ever do,
who when most angry seem the
most Galliard, especially when
they have need of the friendship of
those they flatter.</p>

French Ladies are not so nicely ty'd
up to the formalities of vertue, but
we can hear Love at both ears,
and if we receive not the addresses
of both, at least we are perhaps
vain enough, not to be displeas'd,
to find we make new conquests.
But you have made your attacque
with so ill conduct, that I shall
find force enough without more
aids to repulse you. Alas, my
Lord! did you believe my heart
was left unguarded when <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
departed? No, the careful
charming Lover left a thousand lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods
to defend it, of no less pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56143:225"/>
who laugh at all your little arts
and treacheries, and scorn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
their Empire to any feable
Cupids you can draw up against
'em. Your thick foggy air breeds
<hi>Loves</hi> too dull and heavy for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
slights, nor can I stoop to them.
The Flemish Boy wants arrows
keen enough for hearts like mine,
and is a Bungler in his Art, too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and remiss, rather a heavy <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>How poorly have you paid your
self, my Lord, (by this pursuit of
your discover'd Love) for all the

me? How well you have explain'd,
you can be no more a Lover than
a Friend, if one may judg the first

                           <hi>Philander</hi> went, or you had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd

lov'd indeed, because I should have
seen you durst, and should have
believ'd it true, because it ran
some hazards for me, the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it would have reconcil'd me
then to the temerity of it, and the
greatest demonstration you cou'd
have given of it, woud have been
the danger you wou'd have ran
and contemned; and the preferance
of your passion above any other
consideration. This, my Lord, had
been generous, and like a Lover,
but poorly thus to set upon a single
Woman in the disguise of a Friend,
in the dark silent melancholy hour
of absence from <hi>Philander,</hi> then to

                        <p>YEs, <hi>Philander,</hi> I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Letter, and but I
found my name there, shou'd have
hop'd it was not meant for <hi>Silvia:</hi>
Oh! 'tis all cold—Short—Short
and cold as a dead Winters day. It
chill'd my blood, it shiver'd every
vein. Where, oh where hast thou
lavish'd out all those soft words so
natural to thy Soul, with which
thou us'd to charm; so tun'd to
the dear musick of thy voice? What
is become of all the tender things,
which, as I us'd to read, made little
nimble pantings in my heart, my
blushes rise, and tremblings in my
bloud, adding new fire to the poor
burning Victim! Oh where are all
thy pretty flatteries of Love, that
made me fond, and vain, and set a
value on this trifling Beauty? Hast
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56143:227"/>
thou forgot thy wondrous Art of
loving? Thy pretty cunings, and
thy soft deceivings? Hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
'em all? Or hast forgot indeed
to love at all? Has thy industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
passion gather'd all the sweets,
and left the rifled flower to hang
its wither'd head, and die in shades
neglected, for who will prize it now,
now, when all its perfumes fled.
Oh my <hi>Philander,</hi> oh my charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fugitive! wast not enough,
you left me like false <hi>Theseus</hi> on
the shore, on the forsaken shore,
departed from my fond my clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Arms; where I believ'd you
safe, secure, and pleas'd; when
sleep and night, that favour'd you
and fuin'd me, had render'd 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of their dear loss? Oh was it
not enough, that when I found
'em empty and abandon'd, and
the place cold where you had lain,
and my poor trembling bosom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56143:228"/>
of that I dear load it bore,
that almost expired with my first
fears; Oh if <hi>Philander</hi> lov'd he
wou'd have thought that cruelty
enough, without the sad addition
of a growing coldness: I wak'd,
I mist thee, and I call'd aloud, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander!</hi>
my <hi>Philander!</hi> But no <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
heard; then drew the close
drawn Curtains, and with a hasty
and busie veiw, survey'd the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
over, but Oh! in vain I veiw'd,
and call'd yet louder, but none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to my assistance, but <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
and <hi>Briljard</hi> to torture me with
dull excuses, urging a thousand
feign'd and frivolous reasons to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my fears: But I, who lov'd,
who doated even to madness, by
nature soft, and timerous as a
Dove, and fearful as a Criminal
escap'd, that dreads each little
noise, fancy'd their eyes and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
looks confest the treasons of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56143:228"/>
their hearts and tongues, while
they, more kind than true, strove
to convince my killing doubts:
Protested, that you would return
by night, and feign'd a likely
story to deceive, Thus between
hope and fear I languisht out a day,
Oh Heavens! a tedious day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Philander,</hi> who wou'd have
thought, that such a dismal day
shou'd not with the end of its reign
have finish'd that of my life, but
then <hi>Octavio</hi> came to visit me, and
who till then I never wisht to see,
but now I was impatient for his
coming, who by degrees told me
that you were gone—I never ask'd
him where, or how, or why, that
you where gone was enough
to possess me of all I fear'd your
being apprehended, and sent into
<hi>France,</hi> your delivering your self
up, your abandoning me; all, all,
I had an easie faith for, without
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56143:229"/>
consulting more than That, Thou
wert gone,—that very word yet
strikes a terrour to my Soul, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
my trembling hand, and I
must wait for reinforcements from
some kinder thoughts. But, Oh!
from whence shou'd they arrive?
from what dear present felicity, or
prospect of a future, tho never so
distant, and all those past ones,
serve but to increase my pain; they
favour me no more, they charm
and please no more, and only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves to my memory to
compleat the number of my sighs
and tears, and make me wish that
they had never been, tho even
with <hi>Philander!</hi> Oh, say, thou Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of my panting Soul, How
hast thou treated <hi>Silvia,</hi> to make
her wish, that she had never
known a tender joy with thee: Is't
possible she shou'd repent her lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee, and thou shou'dst give
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56143:229"/>
her cause! Say, dear false Charmer,
is it? But O, there is no lasting
Faith in sin!—Ah—What have
I done? How dreadful is the Scene
of my first debauch, and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
that never to be regain'd
prospect of my Virgin innocence,
where I fate inthron'd in awful ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
crown'd with shining honour,
and adorn'd with unsullied reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till thou, O Tyrant <hi>Love!</hi>
with a charming usurpation, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all my glories; and which I
resign'd with greater pride and joy
than a young Monarch puts 'em
on. Oh, why then do I repent?
as if the vast, the dear expence of
pleasures past were not enough to
recompence for all the pains of
Love to come? But why, O why
do I treat thee as a Lover lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Thou art not, canst not,
no, Ile not believe it, till thou
thy self confess it. Nor shall the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56143:230"/>
omission of a tender word or two
make me believe thou hast forgot
thy vows. Alas it may be I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
thy cares, thy hard fatigues
of Life, thy presant ill circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(and all the melancholy effects
of thine and my misfortunes) for
coldness and declining Love. Alas,
I had forgot my poor, my dear
<hi>Philander</hi> is now oblig'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
for Life, as well as Love; thou
perhaps (fearing the worst) art
preparing Eloquence for a Council
Table, and in thy busie and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginations, haranguing it to
the grave Judges, defending thy
innocence, or evading thy guilt:
Feeing Advocates, excepting Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and confronting. Witnesses,
when thou shou'dst be giving sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to my fainting love-sick
heart: Sometimes in thy labouring
fancy the horrour of a dreadful
Sentence for an ignominious death
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56143:230"/>
strikes upon thy tender Soul with
a force that frights the little God
from thence, and I am perswaded
there are some moments of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
nature, wherein your <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
is even quite forgotten, and this
too she can think just and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
without reproaching thy heart
with a declining passion, especially
when I am not by to call thy fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
up, and divert thy more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
hours: But Oh, for those
soft minutes thou hast design'd for
Love, and hast dedicated to <hi>Silvia,
Philander</hi> shou'd dismiss the dull
formalities of rigid business, the
pressing cares of dangers, and have
given a loose to softness. Cou'd
my <hi>Philander</hi> imagine this short
and unloving Letter sufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone
for such an absence? And has
<hi>Philander</hi> then forgotten the pain
with which I languish'd, when but
absent from him an hour; how
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56143:231"/>
then can he imagine I can live,
when distant from him so many
Leagues, and so many days? while
all the scanty comfort I have for
life is, that one day we might meet
again; but where, or when, or
how—thou hast not love enough
so much as to divine; but poorly
leavest me to be satisfied by <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
committing the business of thy
heart, the once great importance
of thy Soul, the most necessary
devoires of thy life, to be supply'd
by another. Oh <hi>Philander,</hi> I have
known a blessed time in our reign
of Love, when thou wou'dst have
thought even all thy own power of
too little force to satisfie the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul of <hi>Silvia:</hi> Tell me, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladner,</hi>
hast thou forgot that time?
I dare not think thou hast, and yet
(O God) I find an alteration, but
Heaven divert the Omen: Yet
something whispers to my Soul,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56143:231"/>
I am undone! Oh where art
thou my <hi>Philander?</hi> Where's thy
heart? And what has it been
doing since it begun my Fate?
How can it justifie thy coldness,
and thou this cruel absence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
accounting with me for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
parting hour? My Charming
Dear was wont to find me busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for all my lonely absent ones?
and writ the softest Letters—
Loading the Paper with fond
Vows and Wishes, which e're I had

read) her doubts and fears; he
being thus instructed by her self
in the way how to deceive her
on, like Fortunetellers who
gather peoples Fortune from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and then return it back for

he saw indeed a change! glad to
improve her fear, and feigns a
sorrow almost equal to hers:
<hi>'Tis evident,</hi> says he, <hi>'Tis evident,
that he's the most ungrateful of his

Brilljard, <hi>if he be false—If the
dear Man be perjur'd, take, take
kind Heaven! the life you have
preserv'd, but for a greater proof
of your revenge</hi>—And at that
word she sunk into his Arms,
which he hastily extended as she
was falling, both to save her from
harm and to give himself the
pleasure of grasping the lovely'st
body in the World to his Bosome,
on which her fair face declin'd
cold, dead and pale, but so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
was the pleasure of that
dear burden, that he forgot to
call for, or to use any aid to
bring her back to life, but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
with his love and eager
passion he took a thousand joys,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56143:233"/>
he kist a thousand times her Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm
lips, suckt her short sighs, and
ravisht all the sweets her Bosome
(which but guarded with a loose
Night Gown) yielded his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
touches. Oh, Heaven who
can express the pleasures he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
because no other way he
ever cou'd arrive to so much dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
'twas all beyond his hope,
loose were her Robes, insensible

insolent, he rov'd, he kist, he
gaz'd, without controul, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all respect of persons or of
place, and quite despairing by fair
means to win her, resolves to take
this luckey opportunity; the
door he knew was fast, for the
Counsel she had to ask him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
of no lookers on, so that
at his enterance she had secur'd
that pass for him her self, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near her Bed, when she fell
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56143:234"/>
into his Arms, at this last daring
thought, he lifts her thither and
lays her gently down, and while
he did so, in one Minute, ran o're
all the killing joys he had been
witness to, which she had given
<hi>Philander;</hi> on which he never
paws'd but urg'd by a <hi>Cupid</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
malicious and wicked,
he resolves his cowardly Conquest,
when some kinder God awaken'd
<hi>Silvia,</hi> and brought <hi>Octavio</hi> to the
Chamber door, who having been
us'd to a freedom which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to none but himself with
<hi>Antonett</hi> her woman, waiting for
admittance, after having knockt
twice softly, <hi>Brilljard</hi> heard it,
and redoubl'd his disorder, which
from that of Love grew to that
of surprise; he knew not what
to do, whether to resuse answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or to re-establish the revive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sense of <hi>Silvia;</hi> in this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56143:234"/>
of perplexing thought, he
fail'd not however to set his hair
in order, and ajust him, tho there
were no need of it, and steping
to the door (after having
rais'd <hi>Silvia,</hi> leaning her head on
her hand on her bed side,) he
gave admittance to <hi>Octavio;</hi> but
oh Heaven, how was he surpriz'd
when he saw it was <hi>Octavio?</hi> his
heart with more force than before
redoubl'd its beats, that one might
easily perceive every stroke by
the motion of his Cravate, he
blusht, which to a complexion
perfectly fair, as that of <hi>Briljard</hi>
(who wants no Beauty either in
face or person) was the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable,
add to this his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and you may easily imagine
what a suger he represented himself
to <hi>Octavio:</hi> Who almost as much
surpriz'd as himself to find the
Goddess of his Vows and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56143:235"/>
with a young <hi>Endimion</hi> a lone,
a door shut too, her Gown loose
(which from the late fit she was
in and <hi>Briljards</hi> rape upon her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som)
was still open and discover'd
a World of unguarded Beauty,
which she knew not was in view,
with some other disorders of her
head Cloaths, gave him in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a thousand false apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Antonett</hi> was no less surpriz'd,
so that all had their part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement,
but the innocent <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
whose Eyes were beautifi'd
with a melancholly calm, which
almost fet the generous Lover at
ease, and took away his new fears,
however he cou'd not chuse but
ask <hi>Briljard</hi> what the matter was
with him, he look so out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and trembled so, he told
him, how <hi>Silvia</hi> had been, and
what extream frights she had
possest him with, and told him
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56143:235"/>
the occasion, which the lovely
<hi>Silvia</hi> with her eyes and sighs as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to, and <hi>Brilljard</hi> departed;
how well pleas'd you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,

one convenient principle of the

just enough, nor does a Woman

meet with any reproach,
of this humour was our <hi>Attonett</hi>
who persu'd her Lover out half

by all the feable Arts of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
Sex to get from him, while
on the other side, he believing
she might be of use in the farther
discovery he desir'd to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Octavio</hi> and <hi>Silvia;</hi> not
only told her she her self was
the Object of his wishes, but
gave her a substantial proof on't,
and told her his design, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her Honour for security that
she wou'd be secret, the best
Pledge a man can take of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
After she had promis'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
all things to him she departed
to her affairs, and he to giving
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56143:236"/>
his Lord an account of <hi>Silvia,</hi> as
he desir'd, in a Letter which came
to him with that of <hi>Silvia,</hi> and
which was thus,</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Philander to Briljard.</head>
                        <p>I Doubt not but you will wonder
that all this time you have
not heard of me, nor indeed can I
well excuse it, since I have been in
a place, whence with ease I cou'd
have sent every Post, but a new
affair of Gallantry has engag'd my
thoughtful hours, not that I find
any passion there that has abated
one sigh for <hi>Silvia,</hi> but a mans
hours are very dull, when undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by an intrigue of some kind
or other, especially to a heart
young and gay as mine is, and
which would not if possible bend
under the fatigues of more serious
thought and business; I shou'd not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56143:237"/>
tell you this, but that I wou'd
have you feign all the dilatory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
that possible you can to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Silvia</hi>'s coming to me, while I
remain in this Town, where I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to make my abode but a short
time, and had not staid at all, but
for this stop to my journey, and I
scorn to be vanquish'd without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
my revenge, 'tis a sally of
Youth, no more—a flash that
blazes for a while, and will go out
with enjoyment. I need not bid
you keep this knowledge to your
self, for I have had too good a
confirmation of your faith and
friendship to doubt you now, and
believe you have too much respect
for <hi>Silvia</hi> to occasion her any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.
I long to know how she
takes my absence, send me at large
of all that pasles, and give your
Letters to <hi>Octavio,</hi> for none else
shall know where I am, or how to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56143:237"/>
send to me: Be careful of <hi>Silvia,</hi>
and observe her with diligence, for
possibly I should not be extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
afflicted to find she were
inclin'd to love me less for her
own ease and mine, since Love is
troublesome when the height of it
carries it to jealousies, little quarrels,
and eternal discontents, all which
beginning Lovers prize, and pride
themselves on every distrust of the
fond Mistress, since 'tis not only a
demonstration of love in them, but
of power and charmes in us, that
occasion it, but when we no longer
find the Mistress so desirable, as
our first wishes form her, we value
less their opinion of our persons,
and only endeavour to render it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to new Beauties, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
it for new Conquests, but
you <hi>Briljard,</hi> have been a Lover,
and understand already this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
I need say no more then,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56143:238"/>
to a man who knows so well my
Soul but to tell him I am</p>
                        <closer>
                           <signed>His constant Friend
<hi>Philander.</hi>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>This came as <hi>Briljards</hi> Soul cou'd
wish, and had he sent him word
he had been chosen King of <hi>Poland</hi>
he cou'd not have receiv'd the
news with so great joy, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a welcom. How to manage
this to his best advantage was the
business he was next to consult, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
returning an answer; now he
fancied himself sure of the lovely
prize, in spight of all other oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
<hi>For</hi> (says he, in reasoning
the case) <hi>if she can by degrees ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
to a coldness to</hi> Philander, <hi>and
consider him no longer as a Lover, she
may perhaps consider me as a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or shou'd she receive</hi> Octavio<hi>'s
addresses, when once I have found
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56143:238"/>
her feable I will make her pay me
for keeping of every secret.</hi> So ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way he entertain'd a hope,
tho never so distant from Reason
and probability; but all things
seem possible to longing Lovers,
who can on the least hope resolve
to out wait even Eternity (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
in expectation of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
blessing, and now with more
than usual care he resolv'd
to dress and fet out all his
Youth and Beauty to the best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
well born, he wanted no Arts
of dressing, nor any advantage of
shape or Mein, to make it appear
well: Pleas'd with this hope, his
art was now how to make his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
without appearing to have
design'd doing to. And first to
act the Hypocrite with his Lord
was his business; for he consider'd
rightly, if he should not represent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56143:239"/>
                     <hi>Silva</hi>'s sorrows to the life, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to make him sensible of 'em,
he shou'd not after be credited if
he related any thing to her disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
for to be the greater Enemy
you ought to seem to be the greatest
Friend. This was the policy of
his heart, who in all things was
inspir'd with phanatical notions.
In order to this, being alone in
his Chamber, after the defeat he
had in that of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s, he writ this
Letter.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>Briljard to Philander.</head>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>YOu have done me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to make me your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
in an affair, that does not
a little surprize me: Since I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
after <hi>Silvia,</hi> no mortal
Beauty cou'd have touch'd your
heart, and nothing but your own
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56143:239"/>
excuses cou'd have suffic'd to have
made it reasonable: and I only
wish, that when the fatal news
shall arrive to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s ear (as for
me it never shall) that she may
think it as pardonable as I do; but
I doubt 'twill add abundance of
grief, to what she is already possest
of, if but such a fear shou'd enter
in her tender thoughts. But since
'tis not my business, my Lord, to
advise or counsel, but to obey, I
leave you to all the success of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Love, and will only give you
an account how affairs stand here,
since your departure.</p>
                        <p>That Morning you left the <hi>Brill,</hi>
and <hi>Silvia</hi> in Bed, I must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
your more serene thoughts
with telling you, that her first
surprise and griefs at the news
of your departure, were most
deplorable, where raging madness
and the softer passion of Love,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56143:240"/>
complaints of grief and anger,
sighs, tears, and cries were so
mixt together, and by turns so
violently seiz'd her, that all about
her wept and pitty'd her; 'twas
sad, 'twas wonderous sad my Lord
to see it: Nor cou'd we hope her
Life, or that she wou'd preserve
it if she cou'd, for by many ways
she attempted to have releas'd
her self from pain by a violent
Death, and those that strove to
preserve that, cou'd not hope she
wou'd ever have return'd to sense
again, sometimes a wild extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Raving wou'd require all
our aid, and then again she would
talk and rail so tenderly—and
express her resentment in the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
softest words that ever mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
utter'd, and all of her <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
till she has set us all a
weeping round her, sometimes
she'd sit as calm and still as death,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56143:240"/>
and we have perceiv'd she liv'd
only by sighs and silent Tears
that fell into her bosom, then on
a suddain wildly gaze upon us
with Eyes that even then
had wonderous Charms, and
frantickly survey us all, then cry
aloud, where is my Lord <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander?</hi>
—Oh, bring me my
<hi>Phillander, Brilljard,</hi> Oh <hi>Antonett,
where have you hid the Treasure of
my Soul,</hi> then weeping floods of
Tears, wou'd sink all fainting in
our Arms. Anon with trembling
words and sighs she'd cry,—
<hi>but Oh my dear</hi> Phillander <hi>is no
more, you have surrendered him
to</hi> France—<hi>Yes, yes, you've gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him up, and be must dye,
Publickly dye, be led a sad Victim
thro the joyful crowd—reproacht
and fall ingloriously</hi>—Then
rave again and tear her 'lovely
hair, and Act such wildness,—so
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56143:241"/>
moving and so sad, as even infected
the pittying beholders, and all we
cou'd do was gently to perswade
her grief, and sooth her raveing
Fits, but so we swore, so hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we vow'd that you were safe,
that with the aid of <hi>Octavio,</hi> who
came that day to visit her, we
made her capable of hearing a
little reason from us: <hi>Octavio</hi>
kneel'd and beg'd she wou'd but
calmly hear him speak, he pawn'd
his Soul, his honour, and his life <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
was as safe from any inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
either from <hi>France</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Enemy as he, as she, or
Heaven it self; in sine, my Lord,
he Vow'd, he swore, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till the with patience heard him
tell your Story, and the necessity
of your absence, this brought
her temper back and dry'd her
Eyes, then sighing answer'd him
—<hi>that if for your safety you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56143:241"/>
were fled, she wou'd forgive your
cruelty and your absence, and
indeavour to be her self again:</hi>
But then she wou'd a thousand
times conjure him not to deceive
her faith, by all the friendship
that he bore <hi>Philander,</hi> not to
possess her with false hopes, then
wou'd he swear a new, and as
he swore, she wou'd behold him
with such charming sadness in her
Eyes, that he almost forgot what
he wou'd say, to gaze upon her
and to pay his Pitty? But if
with all his power of Beauty and
of Rhetorick he left her Calm,
he was no sooner gone, but she
return'd to all the Tempests of
despairing Love, to all the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of faithless passion, wou'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sleep, nor eat nor suffer, day
to enter; but all was sad and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as the vault that held the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesian</hi>
Matron, nor suffer'd she
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56143:242"/>
any to approach her but her Page,
and Count <hi>Octavio,</hi> and he in midst
of all was well receiv'd, not that I
think my Lord she seign'd any part
of that close retirement to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with any freedom, that
did not become a Woman of
perfect Love and Honour, tho'
I must own, my Lord, I believe
it impossible for him to behold
the Lovely <hi>Silvia</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a passion for her, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
his Friendship to you may
put upon his heart or Tongue,
I know not, but I conclude him
a Lover, tho without success,
what effects that may have upon
the heart of <hi>Silvia</hi> only time can
render an account of: And whose
conduct I shall the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
observe from a curiosity na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to me, to see, if it may be
possible for <hi>Silvia</hi> to love again
after the adorable <hi>Phillander,</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56143:242"/>
which levity in one so perfect
wou'd cure me of the Disease of
Love, while I liv'd amongst the
fickle Sex: But since no such
thought can yet get possession of
my belief I humbly beg your
Lordship wou'd entertain no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
that may be so fatal to
your repose and to that of <hi>Silvia,</hi>

Having writ this, he read it
over; not to see whether it were
wity or Eloquent, or writ up
to the sence of so good a Judge
as <hi>Philander,</hi> but to see whether
he had cast it for his purpose; for
there his Master-piece was to be
shewn; and having read it, he
doubted whether the relation of
<hi>Silvia</hi>'s griefs were not too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and whether they might
not serve to revive his fading love
which were intended only as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of his own pitty,
and compassion, that from thence
the deceiv'd Lover might with
the more ease entertain a belief
in what he hinted of her Levity
when he was to make that out,
as he now had but toucht
upon it, for he wou'd not have it
thought the business of malice
to <hi>Silvia,</hi> but duty and respect to
<hi>Philander:</hi> That thought reconcil'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56143:243"/>
him, to the first part without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
and he fancy'd he had
said enough in the latter, to give
any man of Love and Sence a
Jealousie which might inspire a
young Lover in persute of a new
Mistress, with a revenge that
might wholly turn to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
for now every ray gave him
light enough to conduct him to
hope, and he believ'd nothing too
difficult for his Love, nor what
his invention cou'd not conquer,
he fancy'd himself a very <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
already, and almost promis'd
himself the Charming <hi>Silvia,</hi>
with these thoughts he feals up
his Letters and hastes to <hi>Silvia's</hi>
Chamber for her Further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
having in his politick
transports forgotten he had left
<hi>Octavio</hi> with her. <hi>Octavio,</hi> who no

his Melancholly Eyes, where love

apparent, while she believing he

Octavio answer'd, <hi>Yes Madam, but

her with all the Eloquence of

view, alone receive a man into her
Chamber, and make fast the door
upon 'em, which when (from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity)
was open'd he found
her all ruffled, and almost fainting
on her Bed, and a young blushing
youth start from her Arms with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56143:246"/>
trembling Limbs, and a heart that
beat time to the Tune of active love,
faultering in his speech, as if scarce

of her falling into a swound,
in which she continu'd a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

it she blusht with a secret fear,
that in that Trance some free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
might be taken which she
durst not confess, but while she
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56143:248"/>
spoke our still more passionate
Lover devour'd her with his eyes,
fixt his very Soul upon her
Charms of speaking and looking,
and was a thousand times (urg'd
by transporting passion) ready to
break all her dictates, and vow
himself her Eternal Slave, but he
fear'd the result, and therefore
kept himself within the bounds of
seeming friendship, so that after
a thousand things she said of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
he took his leave to go
to Din<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out he saw <hi>Brilljard</hi> enter; who,
as I said, had forgot he left <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
with her; but in a moment
recollecting himself, he blusht at
the apprehension, that they might
make his disorder, the subject of
their Discourse, so what with
that, and the sight of the dear
object of his late disappointed
pleasures, he had much ado to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56143:248"/>
assume an assurance to approach;
But <hi>Octavio</hi> past out and gave
him a little release. <hi>Silvia's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
was almost equal to his,
for she lookt on him as a Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but how to find that Truth,
which she was very curious to
know, she call'd up all the Arts
of Women to instruct her in, by
threats she knew 'twas vain,
therefore she assum'd an Artifice,
which indeed was almost a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to her heart, that of gilting
him out of a secret which she
knew he wanted generosity to
give handsomely, and meeting
him with a smile, which she
forc'd, she cry'd, <hi>How now</hi> Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,

for your heart but grief and fear,

And while she spoke this she held
him by the wrist, and found on
the suddain his pulse to beat more
high, and his heart to heave his
bosom with sighs, which now he
no longer took care to hide; but
with a transported joy he cry'd

I ought to treat as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

and that almighty love that sets the

the heart, where that reigns, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
it self the more absolutely
there, but, my Lord, Iavow mine a
Love of that good Nature, that can
indure the equalsway of friendship,
where like two perfect Friends
they support each others Empire
there, nor can the glory of one
Eclipse that of the other, but both
like the notion we have of the
Deity, tho two distinct passions
make but one in my Soul, and
tho friendship first enter'd 'twas
in vain I call'd it to my aid, at the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56143:264"/>
first soft invasion of <hi>Silvia's</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and you my charming friend,
are the most oblig'd to, pitty me,
who already knows so well the
force of her beauty I wou'd fain
have you think, I strove at first
with all my reason against the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risistible
lustre of her eyes. And
at the first assaults of Love, I
gave him not a welcome to my
bosome, but like slaves unus'd to
fetters, I grew sullen with my
chains, and wore 'em for your sake
uneasily. I thought it base to
look upon the Mistress of my
friend with wishing eyes; but
softer Love soon furnisht me with
arguments to justifie my claim,
since Love is not the choice but the
face of the Soul, who seldom regards
the object lov'd as 'tis, but as it wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to have it be, and then kindfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
makes it soon the same. Love
that Almighty Creator of something
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56143:265"/>
from nothing, forms a Wit,
a Hero, or a Beauty, Vertue,
good Humour, Honour, any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence,
when oftenimes there's
neither in the Object, but where
the agreeing world has fixt all
these, and 'tis by all resolv'd,
(whether they love or not) that
this is she, you ought no more
<hi>Philander</hi> to upbraid my Flame;
than to wonder at it; it is enough
I tell you that 'tis <hi>Silvia,</hi> to justifie
my passion! nor is't a Crime that
I confess, I love! since it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rob <hi>Philander</hi> of the least
part of what I 've vow'd him, or
if his nicer Honour will believe
me guilty of a fault, let this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone

his Rival. Ah</hi> Silvia answer'd he,
<hi>how malicious is your Wit, and how
active to turn its pointed mischief
on me, had I not writ, you wou'd
have said I durst not, and when I
make a declaration of it, you call it
only a slight piece of Gallantry! but</hi>
Silvia <hi>you have wit enough to try
it a thousand ways, and power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make me obey; use the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of both; so you recompence me
at last with a confession that I was
at least found worthy to be numbred
in the crow'd of your adorers. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
reply'd, <hi>he were a dull Lover
indeed, that wou'd need instructions
from the Wit of his Mistress to give
her proofs of his passion, what ever
opinion you have of my sense, I have
too good a one of</hi> Octavio's <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56143:266"/>
that when he's a Lover he'le
want aids to make it appear, till
then we'le let that argument alone
and consider his address to</hi> Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
She then read over the Letter
he had writ, which she lik'd very
well for her purpose, for at this
time our young Dutch <hi>Hero</hi> was
made a property of, in order to her
revenge on <hi>Philander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> She told
him <hi>he had said too much both
for himself and her.</hi> He told her, <hi>he
had declar'd nothing with his Pen;
that he wou'd not make good with
his Sword. Hold Sir,</hi> said she, <hi>and
do not imagine from the freedom you
have taken in owning your passion
to</hi> Philander. <hi>that I shall allow it
here; what you declare to the world
is your own Crime, but when I hear
it, 'tis no longer yours but mine, I
therefore conjure you, my Lord, not to
charge my Soul with so great a sin
against</hi> Philander, <hi>and I confess to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56143:267"/>
you I shall be infinitely troubl'd to be
oblig'd to banish you my sight for ever.</hi>
He heard her and answer'd with a
sigh, for she went from him to
the Table and seal'd her Letter
and gave it him to be inclos'd to
<hi>Philander,</hi> and left him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on her last words which he
did not lay to heart, because he
fancy'd she spoke this as women
do that will be won with indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
he in standing up as she
went from him, saw himself in
the great glass, and bid his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
answer his heart, which from
every view he took, was reinforc'd
with new hope, for he was too
good a judge of Beauty not to find
it in every part of his own Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
person, nor cou'd he imagine
from <hi>Silvia</hi>'s eyes, (which were
naturally soft and languishing,
and now the more so from her
fears and jealousies) that she
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56143:267"/>
meant from her heart the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours
she exprest: Much he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
for his short time of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
much to her Sexes modesty,
much from her quality, and very
much from her Love, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
it must be only time and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduity,
opportunity, and obstinate
passion, that was only capable of
reducing her to break her faith
with <hi>Philander,</hi> he therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
by all the good dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
the advantage of lavish gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to render his person agreeable
and by all the Arts of Gallantry
to charm her with his conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when he cou'd hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
bring in love, he fail'd not
to touch upon it as far as it wou'd
be permitted, and every day had
the vanity to fancy he made some
advances, for indeed every day
more and more she found she
might have use for so considerable
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56143:268"/>
a Person, so that one may very
well say, never any past their time
better than <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Octavio,</hi> tho
with different ends, all he had now
to fear was from the answer <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
Letter shou'd bring for
whom he had in spight of Love,
so intire a friendship that he
even doubted whether, (if <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
cou'd urge reasons potent
enough) he shou'd not chuse to
dye and quit <hi>Silvia</hi> rather then
be false to friendship; one Post
past, and another, and so eight
successive ones, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
one word of answer to
what they sent, so that <hi>Silvia,</hi>
who was the most impatient of
her Sex, and the most in Love
was raving and acting all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance
of despair, and even <hi>Oct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avio</hi>
now became less pleasing,
yet he fail'd not to Visit her eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56143:268"/>
and to say all that a fond Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or a faithful friend might urge
for her relief: at last <hi>Octavio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this following Leter.</p>

                        <p>YOu have shew'd <hi>Octavio</hi> a
freedom so generous, and
so beyond the usual Measures of
a Rival, that 'twere almost inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

greater merit and deserves her

power, and do not wonder at
thy fate! for 'tis as natural for
her to Conquer, as 'tis for youth
to yield, oh she has fascination in
her Eyes! a spel upon her tongue,
her Wit's a Philter, and her air
and motion all snares for heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
hearts; her very faults have
Charmes, her pride, her peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and her disdain, have unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted

it every day—and every Night
she sweeps the Toore along, and
shews the Beauty, she inslaves

how oft with Pride and

to rave and rail at her; to curse
her Charms, her fair inviting and
perplexing Charmes, and bully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every Gazer; by Heaven I
cou'd not spare a smile, a look!
and she has such a lavish freedom
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56143:269"/>
in her humour, that if thou
chance to love as I have done—
'twil surely make thee mad, if
she but talkt aloud, or put her
little affectation on, to shew the
wondering crowd what she cou'd
do, if she design'd to shew the
force of Beauty; oh God! how
lost in rage, how mad with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
was my fond breaking
heart, my eyes grew fierce, and
Clamorous my Tongue! and I
have scarce contain'd my self from
hurting, what I so much ador'd!
but then the subtil Charmer, had
such Arts to slatter me to peace
again—to clasp her lovely arms
about my neck—to sigh a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dear confirming vows into
my Bosom, and kiss, and smile,
and swear—and talk away my

no humane, fancy, can present
the joy of the dear reconciling
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56143:270"/>
moment, where little quarrels rais'd
the rapture higher, and she was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
new. These are the wondrous
pains, and wondrous pleasures,
that Love by turns inspires; till
it grows wise by time and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then the God assumes a
serious gravity, injoyment takes off
the uneasie keeness of the passion,
the little jealous quarrels raise no
more, quarrels the very Feathers
of Loves darts, that send 'em
with more swiftness to the heart;
and when they cease, your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
lessen too, then we grow
reasonable, and consider; we love
with prudence then; as Fencers
fight with foyls; a sullen brush
perhaps sometimes or so; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that can touch the heart,
and when we are arriv'd to love
at that dull easie rate, we never

the aids of flatterers, and dear
dissimulation (that help meet to
the luke warme Lover) to keep
up a good Character of constancy
and a right understanding.</p>
                        <p>Thus, <hi>Octavio,</hi> I have ran thro'
both the degrees of Love; which
I have taken so often, that I am
grown most learn'd and able in
the Art: My easie heart is of the
Constitution of those whom fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
sickness renders apt to take
relapses from every little cause,
or wind, that blows too fiercely
on 'em, it renders it self to the
first effects of new surprizing
Beauty, and finds such pleasure,
in beginning passion, such dear
delight of fancying new injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that all past loves, past
Vow, and obligations, have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to bind no more; no pitty,
no remorce, no threatning dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
invades my amorous course;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56143:271"/>
I scowre along the slow'ry plains
of Love, view all the charming

it self all gay and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious!
and long to lay me down,
to stretch and bask in those dear
joys that fancy makes so ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
nor am I one of those dull
whining slaves, whom quallity
or my respect can awe into! a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Cringer, and no more! no,
Love, Youth, and ost success has
taught me boldness and Art, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and cunning to attaque, to
search the feeble side of femal
weakness, and there to play Loves
Engines, for Women will be won,

now, what this discourse, this

tends to? Then since I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

and am dying,—for a new
Beauty. To you, <hi>Octavio,</hi> you that
have liv'd twenty dull tedious
years, and never understood the
Mystery of Love, till <hi>Silvia</hi> taught
you to adore; this change may
seem a wonder, you that have
lasily run more than half your
youths gay course of life away;
without the pleasure of one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler

Miser hoord your sacred store, or
scantily have dealt it but to one,

and gravely will reproach me
with inconstancy,—but use me
like a friend and hear my story.</p>
                        <p>It happen'd in my last days
journey, on the road I overtook
a man of quality, for so his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56143:272"/>
confest, we joyn'd and
fell into discourse of many things
indifferent, till from a Chain of
of one thing to another, we
chanc'd to talk of <hi>France,</hi> and
of the Factions there, and I soon
found him a <hi>Caesarian;</hi> for he
Grew hot with his concern for
that Prince, and fiercely own'd
his int'rest, this pleas'd me, and I
grew familier with him; and I
pleas'd him so well, in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
for <hi>Coesario,</hi> that being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
at <hi>Collen,</hi> he invites me
home to his Pallace, which he
beg'd I would make use of as
my own, during my stay at
<hi>Collen.</hi> Glad of the opportunity I
obey'd; and soon inform'd my
self by a Spanish Page (that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on him) to whom I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd,
he told me it was the Count
of <hi>Clarinau,</hi> a Spaniard born and
of quality, who for some disgust
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56143:272"/>
at Court retir'd hither; that lie
was a person of much gravity
a great polititian, and very rich;
and tho well in years was lately
married to a very Beautiful young
Lady, and that very much against
her consent: A Lady whom he
had taken out of a Monastery,
where she had been pentioned
from a Child, and of whom he
was so fond and jealous, he never
wou'd permit her to see or be
seen by any Man, and if she
took the Air in her Coach, or
went to Church, he oblig'd her to
wear a Veil. Having learnt thus
much of the Boy, I dismiss'd him
with a present; for he had already
inspir'd me with curiosity, that
prologue to love, and I knew not
of what use he might be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
a curiosity that I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to satisfie, tho I broke all
the laws of hospitality, and even
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56143:273"/>
that first Night I felt an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
that gave me some won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
in fine, three days I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
out in a disorder that was
very near alied to that of Love.
I found my self magnificently
lodg'd, attended with a formal
Ceremony, and indeed all things
were as well as I cou'd imagine,
bating a kind opportunity to
get a sight of this young Beauty:
now half a Lover grown, I sight
and grew opprest with thought,
and had recourse to Groves, to
shady walks and Fountains, of
which the delicate Gardens afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
variety, the most resembling
nature, that ever Art produc'd,
and of the most Melancholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
fancying there in some luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky

I already so much ador'd in <hi>Idea:</hi>
Which still I form'd just as my
fancy wisht, there, for the first

I past into a Thicket near a little
Rivulet, that purl'd and murmur'd

as I soon did, that the Song was
sung by Madam the Countess of

and the tell tale leaves combin'd

while thus she hotly did pusue
her Conquest, and I stood fixt on

amongst the thick Grown
Leaves, and thro' their Mystick
windings soon perceiv'd the good
old Count of <hi>Clarinau,</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Muttering and mumbling to

to guard this lovely Treasure,
and which, she having left alone
in the Thicket, and had retir'd
but at an awful distance had most
extreamly disoblig'd her Lord.
I only had time enough in this
little moment, to look with eyes
that ask'd a thousand pitties, and
told her in their silent Language
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56143:277"/>
how loath they were to leave the
Charming Object, and with a

fair One, nimble as lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
silent as a shade: To my

that was the utmost that I cou'd
perswade my heart to do; you
may believe my dear <hi>Octavio,</hi> I
did not bless the Minute that
brought old <hi>Clarinau</hi> to that dear
recess, nor him, nor my own fate,
and to compleat my torment I
saw him (after having gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
her for being alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her Woman) yes I saw him,
fall on her neck, her lovely Snowy
neck, and loll, and kiss, and hang
his tawny wither'd Arms on her
fair Shoulders, and press his nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
load upon <hi>Calista's</hi> Body,
(for so I heard him name her)
while she was gazing still upon
the empty place, whence she had
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56143:277"/>
seen me vanish, which he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is't thou gazest on, turn to thy none
old man and buss him soundly—</hi>
when putting him by with a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
that half made amends for
the injury he had done me by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
<hi>Ah my Lord, cry'd she, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
now, just there I saw a lovely

For <hi>Antonett</hi> was waiting at

how much he does adore you,

who has read many a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

the rest he us'd to say the
soul was all compos'd of Love. I
us'd to ask him him then, if it were
form'd of so soft Materials, how it
came to pass that we were no oftner
in love, or why so many were so long
before they lov'd, and others who
never lov'd at all? No queston but
he answer'd you wisely, <hi>said Silvia
carelessly and sighing, with her
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56143:293"/>
thoughts but half attentive.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and so he did, <hi>cry'd Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett,</hi>
at least I thought so then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I loved a little. <hi>He said,</hi> Love
of it self was unactive, but 'twas
inform'd by Object, and then too
that Object must depend on fancy
(for Souls, tho all love, are not to
love all) now fancy, <hi>he said,</hi> was
sometimes nice, humourous, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick,
which is the reason we so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
love those of no merit, and despise
those that are most excellent; and
sometimes fancy guides us to like
neither, he us'd to say Women were
like Misers, tho they had always
love in store, they seldom car'd to
part with it, but on very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'rest
and security, <hi>Cent per Cent,</hi>
most commonly heart for heart at
least, and for security he said we
were most times too unconscionable,
we ask'd Vows at least, at worst
Matrimony—<hi>Half angry,</hi> Silvia
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56143:294"/>
                     <hi>cry'd</hi>—and what's all this to my
loving against? Oh <hi>Madam,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Antonett,</hi> he said a Woman was
like a Gamester, if on the winning
hand, hope, int'rest, and vanity made
him play on, besides the pleasure of
the play it self; if on the losing,
then he continu'd throwing at all
to save a stake at last, if not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all; so either way they find
occasion to continue the game. But oh,
<hi>said</hi> Silvia <hi>sighing,</hi> what shall that
Gamester set, who has already play'd
for all she had, and lost it at a cast?
Oh <hi>Madam, reply'd Antonett,</hi> The
young and fair find Credit every
where, there's still a prospect of a
return, and that Gamester that plays
thus upon the tick is sure to lose
but little, and if they win, 'tis all
clear gains. I find, <hi>said Silvia,</hi> you
are a good manager in love; you
are for the frugal part of it. Faith
Madam, <hi>said Antonett,</hi> I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56143:294"/>
of that opinion, that love and
int'rest always do best together, as
two most excellent ingredients in
that rare Art of preserving of
Beauty. Love makes us put on all
our Charms, and int'rest gives us
all the advantage of dress, without
which Beauty is lost, and of little
use. Love wou'd have us appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
new, always gay, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
and money alone can render
us so, and we find no Women want
Lovers so much as those who want
Petticoats, Iewels, and all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
trifles of Gallantry. Of this
last opinion I find you your self to
be; for even when <hi>Octavio</hi> comes,
on whose heart you have no design,
I see you dress to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and put on many, to like one:
Why is this but that, even unknown to
your self, you have a secret joy and

then sigh out a trembling word;
in which there was contain'd

were not to be number'd among the

and for the Love of change

this little Love of Novelty and

this humour put her on
the rack at every thought or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that he might break his Chains
and having laid the last Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to be her Slave for ever, and
treated him with all the haughty

fail'd not to feel 'em the most

on her self most intollerable pains,
such as doubting Lovers feel after
long hopes and confirm'd joys,

meant to brave the worst of

and seal'd it, but <hi>Octavio</hi> came in
to the Chamber, and with such
an Air, with such a Grace, and
mien he approach'd her—with all
the languishment of soft trembling
Love in his face, which with the
addition of the dress he was that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56143:304"/>
day in, (which was extreamly
rich and advantagious, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
such as pleases the Vanity
of Women.) I have since heard
the Charming <hi>Silvia</hi> say, in spight
of all her tenderness for <hi>Philander;</hi>
she found a a soft emotion in her
Soul, a kind of pleasure at his
approach, which made her blush
with some kind of anger at her
own easiness. Nor cou'd she
have blusht in a more happy sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for <hi>Octavio</hi> saw it, and it
serv'd at once to add a Luster to
her paler Beauty, and to betray
some little kind sentiment, which
possest him with a joy that had
the same effects on him: <hi>Silvia</hi>
saw it; and the care she took to
hide her own, serv'd but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
her blushes, which put her
into a confusion she had much ado
to reclaim; she cast her Eyes to
Earth, and leaning her Cheek on
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56143:305"/>
her hand, she continu'd on her
seat without paying him that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Ceremony she was wont to
do. While he stood speechless for
a moment gazing on her with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
satisfaction, when she to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
a formality as well as she
cou'd, rose up and cry'd (fearing
he had seen too much) Octavio <hi>I
have been considering after what
manner I ought to receive you, and
while I was so, I left those Civilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
unpaid which your quality, and
my good manners ought to have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
you. Ah Madam,</hi> reply'd he
sighing, <hi>if you wou'd receive me
as I merited and you ought, at
least you wou'd receive me as the
most passionate Lover that ever A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
you. I was rather believing,
said Silvia, that I ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
you as my Foe: Since you
conceal from me so long what you
cannot but believe I am erxteamly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56143:305"/>
impatient of hearing, and what so
neerly concerns my repose.</hi> At this
he only answering with a sigh,
she pursu'd, <hi>Sure,</hi> Octavio, <hi>you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
me:</hi> Philanders <hi>answer to
the Letter of your confessing Passion
has not so long been the subject of
our discourse and expectation, but you
guess at what I mean? Octavio,</hi> who
on all Occasions wanted not wit,
or reply, was here at a loss, what
to answer: Notwithstanding he
had consider'd before what he
wou'd say: but let those in love
fancy, and make what fine speeches
they please, and believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
furnisht with abundance
of eloquent Harangues at the
sight of the dear Object they
lose 'em all, and love teach 'em a
dialect much more prevailing
without the expence of duller
thought: And they leave unsaid
all they had so sloridly form'd
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56143:306"/>
before, and sigh a thousand things
with more success: Love like Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry
cannot be taught, but unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
flows without painful
study, if it be true; 'tis born in
the Soul, a Noble inspiration not
a Science! such was <hi>Octavio</hi>'s, he
thought it dishonourable to be
guilty of the meaness of a Lye,
and say he had no answer: He
thought it rude to say he had
one and wou'd not shew it <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via:</hi>
And he believ'd it the height
of ungenerous baseness to shew it.
while he remain'd this moment si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
<hi>Silvia,</hi> who's love, jealousie,
and impatience indur'd no delay,
with a malicious half smile,
and a tone all angry, scorn
in her Eyes, and passion on her
Tongue, she cry'd—<hi>'Tis, well</hi>
Octavio, <hi>that you so early let me know
you can be false, unjust, and faithless,
you knew your power, and in pitty
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56143:306"/>
to that Youth and easiness you found
in me, have given a Civil warning
to my heart. In this I must confess,</hi>
continu'd she, <hi>you have given a
much greater testimony of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for</hi> Philander, <hi>than your Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for</hi> Silvia, <hi>And, I suppose, you
came not here to resolve your self of
which you should prefer, that was
decided e're you arriv'd, and this
visit I imagine was only to put me
out of doubt: A piece of Charity
you might have spar'd.</hi> She ended
this with a scorn, that had a
thousand Charmes, because it
gave him a little hope; and he
answer'd with a sigh, <hi>Ah Madam,
how very easie you find it to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoughts disadvantagious of
me: And how small a fault your
Wit and cruelty can improve to a
Crime. You are not offended at my
friendship for</hi> Philander. <hi>I know
you do not Vallue my Life, and my
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56143:307"/>
repose so much, as to be concern'd who,
or what, shares this heart, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores
you; No, it has not merited
that Glory; Nor dare I presume to
hope, you shou'd so much as wish my
Passion for</hi> Silvia, <hi>shou'd surmount
my</hi> Friendship to Philander. <hi>If I
did,</hi> reply'd she with a scorn, <hi>I
perceive I might wish in vain:</hi>
Madam, answer'd he, <hi>I have too
Divine an opinion of the justice of
the Charming</hi> Silvia <hi>to believe I
ought, or cou'd make my approaches
to her heart by ways so base and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous,
the result of even tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Treason is to hate the Traytor.
Oh, you are very nice,</hi> Octavio, re
plyed Silvia, <hi>in your Functilio to</hi>
Philander, <hi>but I perceive you are
not so tender in those you ought to
have for</hi> Silvia? <hi>I find Honour in
you men, is only what you please to
make it, for at the same time you
think it ungenerous to betray</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56143:307"/>
                     <hi>you believe it no breach
of</hi> Honour <hi>to betray the eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of</hi> Silvia? <hi>You have promis'd</hi>
Philander <hi>your friendship, you have
avow'd your self my Lover, my
Slave, my Friend, my every thing,
and yet not one of these has any
tye, to oblige you to my interest,
pray tell me,</hi> continued She, <hi>when
you last writ to him, was it not in
order to receive an answer from him?
And was not I to see that answer?
And here you think it no dishonour
to break your word or promise; by
which I find your false Notions, of
Vertue and Honour, with which you
serve your selves, when int'rest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
or self Love makes you think
it necessary. Madam,</hi> replyed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavio,
<hi>you are pleas'd to persue your
anger, as if indeed I had disobeyed
your command, or refus'd to shew
you what you Imagine I have from</hi>
Philander: <hi>Yes, I do</hi> replyed she
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56143:308"/>
hastily; <hi>and wonder why you shou'd
have a greater friendship for</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
<hi>than for</hi> Silvia, <hi>especially if
it be true that you say, you have
joyned Love to friendship; or are
you of the opinion of those that cry
they cannot be a Lover and a friend
of the same Object. Ah Madam,</hi>
cry'd our perplext Lover, <hi>I beg
you to believe, I think it so much
more my Duty and inclination to
serve and obey</hi> Silvia <hi>than I do</hi>
Philander, <hi>that I swear to you,
Oh, Charming Conqueress of my Soul,
if</hi> Philander <hi>have betrayed</hi> Siliva,
<hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e has at the same time betray'd</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavio,
<hi>and that I wou'd revenge it
with the loss of my Life: In injuring
the adorable</hi> Silvia, <hi>believe me,
lovely Maid, he injures so much
more than a Friend, as Honour is
above the inclination; if he wrong
you, by Heaven he cancels all! he
wrongs, my Soul, my Honour, Mistress
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56143:308"/>
and my Sister:</hi> Fearing he had
said too much, he stopp'd and
sight at the word Sister, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
down his Eyes, blushing with
shame and anger, he continu'd,
<hi>Oh, give me leave to say a Sister,
Madam, least Mistress had been too
daring and presumptious, and a Title
that wou'd to justifie my quarrel
half so well, since 'twou'd take the
Honour from my just resentment and
blast it with the scandal of self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest
or jealous revenge. What you say</hi>
replyed she, <hi>deserves abundance of
acknowledgement; but if you wou'd have
me believe you, you ought to hide
nothing from me, and he methinks
that was so daring to confefs his
Passion to</hi> Philander, <hi>may, after that,
venture on any discovery: In short</hi>
Octavio, <hi>I demand to see the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you have from</hi> Philander, <hi>for
possibly—</hi> said she, sweet'ning her
Charming face into a Smile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56143:309"/>
                     <hi>I shou'd not be displeas'd to
find I might with more freedom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your Addresses, and on the
coldness of</hi> Philanders <hi>reasoning may
depend a great part of your Fate, or
Fortune: Come, come, produce your
credentials, they may recommend
your heart more effectually than all
the fine things you can say, you know
not how the least appearance of a
slight from a Lover, may advance
the Pride of a Mistress, and Pride
in this affair will be your best Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate.</hi>
Thus she insinuated with
all her female Arts, and put on
all her Charms of Looks and
smiles, sweetned her mouth, sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
her Voyce and Eyes, assuming
all the tenderness and little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
her subtil Sex was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, while he lay all ravisht
and almost expiring at her Feet;
sometimes transported with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
Joys in the possession of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56143:309"/>
dear slatterting Charmer, he was
ready to unravel all the Secrets
of <hi>Philanders</hi> letter; but Honour
yet was even above his Passion
and made him blush at his first
hasty thought; and now he
strove to put her off, with all
the Art he cou'd, who had so
very little in his Nature, and
whose real Love and perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
had set him above the little
evasions of Truth, who scorn'd in
all other cases the baseness and
cowardize of a Lye: and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful
now was the little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
cheat, which he knew not
how to manage well, that 'twas
soon discover'd to the Wity, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and angry <hi>Silvia:</hi> So that
after all the rage a passionate Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
cou'd express, who belive'd
her self injur'd by the only two
persons in the World from whom
she expected most Adoration? she
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56143:310"/>
had recourse to that Natural and
softning aid of her Sex, her Tears,
and haviug already reproach'd <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavio</hi>
with all the malice of a
defeated Woman, she now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
it in so moving a manner,
that our <hi>Hero</hi> cou'd no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
unconquer'd by that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
way of Charming, but unfixt
to all he had resolv'd gave up, at
least, apart of the secret, and
own'd he had a Letter from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi>
and after this confession
knowing very well he cou'd not
keep her from the sight of it; no
tho an Empire were render'd her
to buy it off; his Wit was next
imploy'd how he shou'd defend
the sense of it, that she might
not think <hi>Philander</hi> false. In Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this, he, forcing a Smile,
told her, that <hi>Philander</hi> was the
most malicious of his Sex, and
had contriv'd the best Stratagem
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56143:310"/>
in the world to find whether <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
still lov'd, or <hi>Octavio</hi> retain'd
his friendship for him; <hi>And but
that,</hi> continued he, <hi>I know the
Nature of your curious Sex to be
such, that if I shou'd perswade you
not to see it, it wou'd but the more
inflame your desire of seeing it, I
wou'd ask no more of the Charming</hi>
Silvia, <hi>than that she wou'd not oblige
me to shew, what wou'd turn so
greatly to my own advantage: if I
were not too sensible, 'tis but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
me, that</hi> Philander <hi>has taken
this method in his answer. Believe
me Adorable</hi> Silvia, <hi>I plead against
my own Life, while I beg you not
to put my honour to the test, by
commanding me to shew this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that I joyn against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'rest
of my own Eternal repose while
I plead thus:</hi> she hears him with
a hundred changes of countenance.
Love, rage, and Jealousie swell in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56143:311"/>
siercer Eyes, her breath beats short,
and she was ready to burst into
speaking before he had finisht
what he had to say; she calls up
all the little discretion and Reason
Love had left her to manage her
self as she ought in this great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion?
she bit her Lips and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
her rising sighs; but he soon
saw the storm he had rais'd and
knew not how to stand the shock
of its fury, he sighs, he pleads in
vain, and the more he indeavours
to excuse the Levity of <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the more he rends her heart,
and sets her on the Rack; and
concluding him false, she cou'd
no longer contain her rage but
broke out into all the fury that
madness can inspire, and from one
degree to another wrought her
Passion to the height of Lunacy:
She tore her Hair and bit his
hands, that indeavour'd to restrain
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56143:311"/>
hers from violence, she rent the
Ornaments from her fair Body,
and discover'd a thousand Charms
and Beauties, and finding now that
both his strength and reason was
too weak to prevent the mischiefs
he found he had brought on her,
he calls for help: When <hi>Briljard</hi>
was but too ready at hand;
with <hi>Antonelt</hi> and some others,
who came to his assistance; <hi>Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,</hi>
who knew nothing of the
occasion of all this, believ'd it the
second part of his own late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
and fancy'd that <hi>Octavio</hi>
had us'd some violence to her,
upon this he assumes the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Lord, and secretly that
of a Husband or Lover, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
the innocent <hi>Octavio</hi> with
his brutallity they fell to such
words as ended in a challenge the
next morning for <hi>Briljard</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
a Gentleman, Companion
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56143:312"/>
to his Lord; and one whom <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
cou'd not well refuse, this
was not carried so silently but
<hi>Antonett</hi> busie as she was about
her raving Lady heard the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
and <hi>Octavio</hi> quitted
the Chamber almost as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd
as <hi>Silvia,</hi> whom, with
much ado, they perswaded him
to leave, but before he did so he
on his knees offer'd her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and implor'd her to receive
it. So absolutely his Love had
vanquisht his Nobler part, that of
honour; but she at tending nomoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
but those of her own Rage,
had no ragard either to <hi>Octavio</hi>'s
proffer or his Arguments of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
so that he went away with
the Letter, in all the extremity
of disorder; this last part of his
submission was not seen by <hi>Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard;</hi>
who immediately le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answer to his Challenge; so
that <hi>Silvia</hi> was now left with her
Woman only, who by degrees
brought her to more calmness;
and <hi>Briljard</hi> impatient to hear the
reproaches, he hop'd she wou'd
give <hi>Octavio</hi> when she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to reason, being curious of
any thing that might redound to
his disadvantage, whom he took
to be a powerful Rival, return'd
again into her Chamber: But in
heu of hearing what he wisht;
<hi>Silvia</hi> being recover'd from her
Passion of madness, and her Soul
in a state of thinking a little with
reason; she misses <hi>Octavio</hi> in the
crow'd, and with a Voyce, her
rage had infeebl'd to a Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
she cry'd—surveying care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
those about her, <hi>Oh where's</hi>

give me comfort. Madam,</hi> replyed
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56143:313"/>
Antonett, <hi>he is gone, while he was
here, he kneel'd and pray'd in vain,
but for a word, or look, his Tears
are yet remaining wet up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n your
Feet, and all for one sensible reply,
but rage had deafen'd you; what has
he done to merit this? Oh</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonett
cry'd <hi>Silvia—'Twas what
he wou'd not do that makes me
rave, run, hast and fetch him back—
But let him leave his Honour
all behind; Tell him he has too
much consideration for</hi> Philander,
<hi>and none for my repose. Oh, fly</hi>

Angels wou'd not be so welcome—
Why stand ye still, have I no

Then running hastily to the
Chamber Door, she call'd her
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56143:313"/>
Page to whom she cry'd—<hi>Hast,
hast, dear youth, and find</hi> Octavio
<hi>out, and bring him to me instantly:
Tell him I dye to see him.</hi> The
Boy glad of so kind a Message,
to so liberal a Lover, runs on his
Errant while she returns to her
Chamber, and indeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
her senses against <hi>Octavio's</hi>
coming as much as possible she
cou'd: She dismisses her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
with different apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
sometimes <hi>Briljard</hi> believ'd
this was the second part of her
first raving, and having never
seen her thus, but for <hi>Philander</hi>
concludes it the height of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and Passion for <hi>Octavio,</hi> but
because she made so publique a
Declaration of it he believ'd he
had given her a Philter, which
had rais'd her flame so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the bounds of modesty and
discretion; concluding it so, he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:56143:314"/>
knew the usual essects of things
of that Nature, and that nothing
cou'd alay the heat of such a love
but possession, and easily deluded
with every fancy that slatter'd
his love; mad, starke mad by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way to obtain the last bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with <hi>Silvia,</hi> he consults with
<hi>Antonelt</hi> how to get one of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>'s
Letters out of her Ladies
Cabinet, and feigning many frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
reasons, which deluded the
Amorous Maid; he perswaded
her to get him one, which she

                        <p>BY this time, oh Charming
<hi>Silvia</hi> give me leave to hope
your Rage is abated, and your

hear a little from the most unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of men, whom you have
reduc'd to this miserable Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of losing either the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Object of his Soul, or his
Honour: If you can preser a
little curiosity that will serve but,
to afflict you before either that
or my repose. What esteem ought
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56143:315"/>
I to believe you have for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Octavio;</hi> and if you hate

can love me now; and how much
below that hope shall the expos'd

he shall pretend to that Glory
without his Honour: Believe me,

my life, and my intire For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
at your least command to
serve you; but to render you a
devoyr that must point me out the
basest of my Sex, is what my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
must resist in spight of all the
violence of my Love, and I thank
my happyer Stars that they have
given me resolution enough rather
to fall a Sacrifice to the last, then
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56143:315"/>
be guilty of the breach of the

thought and pleasure of my Soul,
and least it shou'd by the force
of those Divine Ideas which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
surround it, be sooth'd
and slatter'd from its Noble
Principles, I will to morrow put
my self out of the hazard of
Temptation, and divert if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by absence to the Compagne,
those soft importunate betrayers
of my Liberty; that perpetually
solicit in favour of you: I dare not so

                  <p>This Letter to any other less
secure of her own power than
was our fair Subject, wou'd have
made them impatient and angry:
But she found that there was
something yet in her power, the
dispensation of which cou'd soon
recal him from any resolution he
was able to make of absenting
himself: Her Glass stood before
her, and every glance that way
was an assurance and security to
her heart; she cou'd not see that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56143:316"/>
Beauty and doubt its power
of perswasion; She therefore took
her Pen, and writ him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
being in a moment furnisht
with all the Art and subtilty that
was necessary on this occasion.</p>

                        <p>THo I have not Beauty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to command your
heart; at least allow me sense e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to oblige your belief, that
I fancy and resent all that the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contains which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
me, and that I am not of
that sort of Women, whose want
of youth or Beauty renders so
constant to pursue the Ghost of
a departed Love: It is enough
to justifie my Honour, that I
was not the first Agressor. I find
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56143:317"/>
my self persu'd by too many
Charmes of Wit, Youth, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
to bury my self beneath
the willows, or to whine away
my youth by murmuring Rivers,
or betake me to the last refuge
of a declining Beauty, a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stary:
no my Lord, when I have
reveng'd and recompenc'd my
Self for the injuries of one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
with the joys a thousand
imploring Lovers offer, it will
be time to be weary of a world
which yet every day presents me
new joys; and I swear to you,
<hi>Octavio,</hi> that it was more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
what I ow'd your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that I desir'd a convincing
proof of <hi>Philanders</hi> false-hood,
than for any other reason, and
you have too much Wit not to
know it; for what other use
cou'd I make of the Secret; if he
be false he's gone, unworthy of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56143:317"/>
me, and impossible to be retriev'd,
and I wou'd as soon dye my sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
Garments and wear them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
again, as take to my imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a reform'd Lover, the Native
first Luster of whose passion is
quite extinct, and is no more the
same; no, my Lord, she must be
poor in Beauty that has recourse
to shifts so mean; if I wou'd
know the Secret by all that's
good it were to hate him hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and to dispose of my Person
to the best advantage; which
in honour I cannot do, while I
am unconvinc'd of the falseness of
him with whom I have exchang'd
a thousand Vows of fidellity, but
if he unlink the Chain I am at
perfect liberty, and why by this
delay you shou'd make me lose my
time, I am not able to conceive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you fear I shou'd then take
you at your word, and expect the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56143:318"/>
performance of all the Vows of
Love you have made me.—If
that be it—My Pride shall be
your security, or if other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
you expect, set the Price
upon your Secret, and see at what
rate I will purchase the liberty it
will procure me, possibly it may
be such as may at once infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize
me, and revenge me on the

                  <p>She Seals this Letter with a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and giving it to <hi>Antonett</hi> to
give the Page, believing she had
writ what wou'd not be in vain
to the quick sighted <hi>Octavio: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonett</hi>
takes both that and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which <hi>Octavio</hi> had sent and
left her Lady busie in dressing her

head, and went to <hi>Briljard's</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who thought every moment
an Age till she came; so vigorous
he was on his new design: That
which was sent to <hi>Octavio</hi> being
seal'd with a wet Wafer he neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opens, as 'twas easie to do,
and read and Seal'd again, and
<hi>Antonett</hi> deliver'd it to the Page.
After receiving what pay <hi>Briljard</hi>
cou'd force himself to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her; some flatteries of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembl'd
love; and some cold
Kisses, which even imagination
cou'd not render better, She return'd
to her Lady, and he to his Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
which was to counterfeit
a Letter from <hi>Octavio:</hi> She ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in hers given him a hint,
by bidding him set a price upon
the Secret, which he had heard
was that of a Letter from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
with all the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it, from the faithless <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonett</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:56143:319"/>
whom Love had betray'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and after blotting much paper to
try every Letter through the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet,
and to produce them like
those of <hi>Octavio,</hi> which was not
hard for a Lover of ingenuity;
he fell to the business of what he
wou'd write, and having finisht
it to his liking, his next trouble
was how to convey it to Her;
for <hi>Octavio</hi> always sent his by
his Page, whom he cou'd trust.
He now was certain of love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em? For tho he often had
perswaded <hi>Antonett</hi> to bring him
Letters, yet she cou'd not be
wrought on till now to betray
her trust: And what he long ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
he found too true on
both sides, and now he waited
but for an opportunity to send it
seasonably, and in a lucky mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.
In the mean time <hi>Silvia</hi>
adorns her self for absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56143:319"/>
and disposing her self in
the most charming, careless, and
tempting manner she cou'd devise,
she lay expecting her coming Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
on a repose of rich Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery
of Gold on blew Sattin,
hung within side with little A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
Pictures of <hi>Venus</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in her Chariot naked to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donis,</hi>
she imbracing, while the
youth more eager of his rural sports
turns half from her, in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of pursuing his Dogs, who
are no their Chace: Another of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mida</hi>
who is dressing the sleeping
warrior up in wreaths of Flowers,
while a hundred little Loves are
playing with his guilded Armour;
this puts on his Helmet too big for
his little head that hides his whole
face; another makes a Hobby horse
of his Sword and Lance, another
fits on his breast piece, while three
or four little <hi>Cupi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to heave and help him to hold
it an end, and all turn'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimes
of the <hi>Hero</hi> into redicule.
These and some other of the like
nature adorn'd the Pavillion of
the languishing Fair One, who lay
carelesly on her side; her Arm
leaning on little Pillows, of Point
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and a Book of Amours
in her other hand. Every noise
alarm'd her with trembling hope
that her Lover was come, and I
have heard she said she verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
that acting and feigning
the Lover possest her with a
tenderness against her knowledge
and Will; and she found some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in her Soul than a
bear curiosity of seeing <hi>Octavio</hi>
for the Letters sake: But in Lieu
of her Lover, she found her self
once more approacht with a Billet
from him; which brought this.</p>

withstand your Charms, I confess
my frailty, and fall before you,

own I am ready to believe all
your dear Letter contains, and
have vanity enough to wrest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
hopeful word to my own
int'rest, and in favour of my own
Heart: What will become of
me, if my easie faith shou'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flatter me, and I with shame
shou'd find it was not meant to
me, or if it were, 'twas only to
draw me from a Virtue which has
been hitherto the Pride and

of my name, my Comfort and
refuge in all extreams of Fortune:
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56143:321"/>
The eternal Companion, Guide
and Counsellor of all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
Yet this good you only
have power to rob me of,
and leave me expos'd to the scorn
of all the laughing World: Yet
give me Love! give me but
hope in lieu of it, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to devest my self of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you will say <hi>I</hi> ask too
mighty a rate for so poor a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret?
But even in that, there lies
one of my own, that will more
expose the feebleness of my Blood
and Name, than the discovery
will me in particular, so that I
know not what I do, when I give
you up the knowledge you desire.
Still you will say all this is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce
its value, and raise the
Price: And oh, I fear you have
taught my soul every quality,
it fears and dreads in yours, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56143:321"/>
learnt it to chasser for every
thought, if I cou'd fix upon the rate
to sell it at: And I with shame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I wou'd be Mercenary, cou'd
we but agree upon the Price:
But my respect forbids me all
things, but silent hope, and that
in spight of me, and all my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
will predominate? for the

Saw the Page arrive with the

he gave her what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

receiv'd this with so much

'twas sufficient to fill her Soul
with a thousand agitations, but
when she wou'd be angry the

                     </gap> him to
this boldness stop'd her rage:
When she wou'd take it ill, she
consider'd his knowledge of her
lost fame, and that took off a great
part of her resentment on that
side; and in midst of all she was
raving for the knowledge of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>

in much disorder, full of thought
and no conclusion; she is asham'd
to consult of this affair with <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett,</hi>
and knows not what to fix on:
The only thing she was certain
of, and which was fully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputably
resolv'd in her Soul,
was never to consent to so false an
Action, never to buy the secret
at so dear a rate; she abhors <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
whom she regards no more
as that fine thing which before
she thought him, and a thousand
times she was about to write
her despight and contempt, but
still the dear secret staid her hand,
and she was fond of the torment:
At last <hi>Antonett,</hi> who was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to know the cause of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
ask'd her Lady if <hi>Octavio</hi>
wou'd not come: <hi>No</hi> replyed <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>

replyed <hi>Antonett, what has he done

For he was a great benefactor to</hi>

as deserves death from my Hand:</hi>
This she spoke in rage, and walk'd

<hi>Silvia, but askes me such a

of <hi>Antonett</hi>'s jogg'd a thought
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:56143:326"/>
that ran on to one very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious,
at least her present and
first apprehension of it was such:
And she turn'd to <hi>Antonett</hi> with
a face more gay than it was the
last minute, and cry'd. <hi>Prithee
good Wench tell me, what sort of
man wou'd soonest incline you to a
yielding? if you command me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
to be free with your Lordship,</hi>
reply'd <hi>Antonett, I must confess
there are too sorts of men that
wou'd most villainou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly incline me;
the first is he that wou'd make my
fortune best: The next he that wou'd
make my pleasure; the young, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or rather the well bread, and good
humour'd: But above all the Man
of Wit: But what wou'd you say</hi>
Antonett, replyed <hi>Silvia, if all
these made up in one man shou'd
make his Addresses to you? Why
then most certainly Madam,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Antonett; I shou'd yield him

my Honour, aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r a reasonable siege.</hi>
This tho' the wanton young
maid spoke possibly at first more
to put her Lady in good humour
than from any inclination she had
to what she said, yet after many
arguments upon that subject, <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
cunning enough to pursue her
design, brought the business more
home, and told her in plain terms
that <hi>Octavio</hi> was the man who had
been so presumptious as to ask so
great a reward as the possession
of her self for the secret she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd;
and after a thousand little
subtilties, having made the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Girle confess with blushes,
she was not a Maid; she insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
into her an opinion that
what she had done already (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other motive than that
of Love, as she confest in which
int'rest had no part,) wou'd make
the trick the easier to do again,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56143:327"/>
especially if she brought to her
Arms a person of Youth, Wit,
Gallantry, Beauty, and all the
Charming qualities that adorn
a man, and that besides she shou'd
find it turn to good account, and
for her secresies, she might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon it, since the person to
whose im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>races she shou'd submit
her self, shou'd not know but
that she her self was the Woman,
so that says <hi>Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ia, I will have all
infamy, and you the reward every
way with unblemisht Honour,</hi> while
she spoke the willing M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>id gave
an inward pleasing attention, tho
at first she made a few faint
modest scruples; Nor was she
less joy'd to hear it shou'd be <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
whom she knew to be rich,
and very handsome, and she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
found the humour of
inconstancy cease her, and <hi>Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
appear'd a very Husband
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56143:327"/>
Lover in comparison of this new
Brisker man of quality; so that
after some pro's and Con's the
whole matter was thus concluded
on between these two young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
who neither wanted Wit,
nor Beauty; and both cro'd over
the contrivance, as a most diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
piece of little Malice, that
shou'd serve their present turn,
and make 'em sport for the future
The next thing that was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
was a Letter which was
to be sent in answer, and that
<hi>Silvia</hi> being to write with her
own hand, begot a new doubt,
in so much as the whole business
was at a stand: For when it came
to that point that she her self
was to consent, she found the
project look with a face so foul,
that she a hundred times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
and unresolv'd. But <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
fill'd her Soul, revenge was
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56143:328"/>
in her view, and that one thought
put her on new resolves to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the design, let it be never
so base and dishonourable: <hi>Yes,</hi>
cry'd she at last, <hi>I can commit no
action, that is not more just, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
and honourable, than that
which</hi> Octavio <hi>has done to me,
who uses me like a common Mistris
of the Town, and dares ask, me that
which he knows, he durst not do if
he had not mean, and abject
thoughts of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his buseness deserves
death from from my hand if I had
courage to give it him, and the least
I can do is to deceive the deceiver.
Well then give me my Scrutore,</hi>
says she, so sitting down she writ
this, not without abundance of
of guilt and confusion, for yet
a certain Honour, which she had
by birth check'd the cheat of her
Pen.</p>

her anger against him was too

imaginable, and the greater
the Love appear'd, the greater
wou'd be the revenge, when he

he shou'd) how like a false friend
she had treated him: This reason
or any at that time wou'd have
serv'd <hi>Antonett,</hi> whose heart was
set upon the new adventure, and
in such haste she was (the night
coming on a pace) to know how
she shou'd dress, and what more
was to be done, that she only
went out to call the Page, and
meeting <hi>Briljard,</hi> (who watcht e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

he ask'd her what that was,

she (when he snatcht it hastily

he blest himself, his Wit, his Stars

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56143:331"/>
of what he had to do in Order
to this dear appointment: He
finds in her Letter, that in the

the Letter from <hi>Philander:</hi> I told

his Lord was going five

to Madam the Countess of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinau:</hi>

extremities she has recourse to

was to hear Love at both her

it or not, but to hear all as a
remedy against loving one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,

in that Climate, the Air Naturally

his love was extream, and that
he had no power over his heart,
that Honour, Fame, Int'rest, and
whatever else might oppose his

all the Conquest he cou'd get of

ask'd their business: When the

he made a shift to get to a Wax

read it; and was not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
at the contents, believing
she was persuing the business of
her Sex and Life, and Jilting him
on; (for such was his opinion of

daily use when he came, and
Muster'd up so much Courage

read the Letter again, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

he might grow weary off;
but a new Lover, who had for
six months incessantly lain at her
feet, imploring, dying, vowing,
weeping, sighing, giving, and
acting all things the most passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of men was capable of, or that
love cou'd inspire, for him to be
at last admitted to the possession
of the ravishing Object of his
Vows and Soul, to be laid in her
Bed; nay in her very Arms (as
She imagin'd he thought) and
then, even before gathering the
Roses he came to pluck, before
he had begun to compose, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
his Nosegay: To depart the
happy Paradise with a disgust,
and such a disgust, as first to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him to dissemble sickness, and
next fall even from all his Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities:
Was a contempt she was
not able to bear: especially from
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56143:354"/>
him who of all men living she
design'd to make the greatest
property of, as most fit for her
revenge, of all degrees and sorts:
But when she reflected with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(which she seldom did, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Love or rage blinded that)
she cou'd not conceive it possible
that <hi>Octavio</hi> cou'd be fall'n so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
from all his Vows and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
but on some very great
provocation: Sometimes she thinks
he tempted her to try her Vertue
to <hi>Philander,</hi> and being a perfect
Honourable friend, hates her for her
Levity, but she considers his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
and his unwearied industry,
and believes he wou'd not at that
expence have bought a knowledg
which cou'd profit neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or <hi>Philander;</hi> then she believes
some disgustful Scent or something
about <hi>Antonett</hi> might disoblige
him; but having call'd the Maid

any thing past between her and
<hi>Octavio;</hi> she again told her Lady
the whole truth, in which there
cou'd be no discovery of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

kiss'd her bosom, and found her
touches soft, her breath and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

cou'd be; and now lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

she cou'd not tell what to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
at last she being wholly

in <hi>Octavio,</hi> (for too often we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
as we hope) she concludes
that <hi>Antonett</hi> has told him all the
cheat she put upon him: This
last thought pleas'd her, because
it seem'd the most probable, and
was the most favourable to her
self; and a thought, that if true
cou'd not do her any injury

a little to rights, and she grew

was, as now she doubted not, a

She therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves

a Beauty that one wou'd
have thought had had the power
to have cur'd the fond disease of self
conceit and foppery, since love they
say's a remedy against those faults
of youth, but still my vanity
was powerful in me, and even
this Beauty too: I thought it not
impossible to vanquish, and still
drest on, and took a mighty care
to shew my self—a Blockhead,
curse upon me, while you were
laughing at my industry, and
turn'd the fancying fool to ridicule:
Oh, he deserv'd it well; most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous

yes I still love! only this
wretchedness is fix'd to it, to see
those Errors which I cannot shun;
my love's as high, but all my wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
gone; my Passion still remains
entire and raving, but no desire,
I burn, I dye, but do not wish
to hope, I wou'd be all despair,
and like a Martyr, am vain and
proud even in suffering. Yes,
<hi>Silvia</hi>—When you made me
wise, you made me wretch'd too?
before, like a false Worshipper, I
only saw the Gay, the gilded side
of the deceiving Idol, but now
'tis fall'n—discovers all the cheat
and shews a God no more: and
'tis in Love as in Religion too,
there's nothing makes their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries

harmless, and innocent, as 'tis

Jealousies creats; a little soft dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation's
needful, for where

<hi>Octavio,</hi> either in Love or
friendship like that of doubt;
and I confess my self guilty of

by my silence the last Post, but
having business of so much greater
concern to my heart than even wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

having affairs of the same nature
there; our circumstances and the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of our hearts then being so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling,
methinks, I have as great
an impatience to be recounting to
you the story of my Love and
Fortune, as I am to receive that of
yours, and to know what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you have made in the heart
of the still charming <hi>Silvia!</hi> tho
there will be this difference in the
relations; mine, when ever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it, will give you a double sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
first from the share your
friendship makes you have in all
the pleasures of <hi>Philander,</hi> and
next that it excuses <hi>Silvia</hi> if she
can be false to me, for <hi>Octavio;</hi> and
still advances his design on her
heart: but yours, when ever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, will give me a thousand
pains which 'tis however, but just
I should feel, since I was the first
breaker of the solemn League and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56143:364"/>
Covenant made between us:
which yet I do by all that's sacred
with a regret, that makes me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
with some repentance in all
those moments wherein I do not
wholly give my soul up to Love,
and the more beautiful <hi>Calista;</hi> yes
more, because new.</p>
                        <p>In my last, my dear <hi>Octavio,</hi>
you left me pursuing, like a Knight
Errant, a Beauty inchanted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
some invisible Tree, or Castle,
or Lake, or any thing inaccessable,
or rather wandering in a Dream
after some glorious disappearing
fantom: and for some time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
I knew not whether I slept or
wak'd, I saw daily the good old
Count of <hi>Clarinau;</hi> to whom I
durst not so much as ask a civil
question towards the satisfaction of
my soul; the Page was sent into
<hi>Holland</hi> (with some Express to a
Brother in Law of the Counts) of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56143:364"/>
whom before I had the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of a fair young wife to
the old Lord his Master, and
for the rest of the Servants they
spoke all Spanish, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
a word we understood each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so that 'twas impossible to
learn, any thing farther from
them: and I found I was to owe
all my good Fortune to my own
industry, but how to set it a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I cou'd not devise; at last it
happen'd, that being walking in the
Garden which had very high Walls
on three sides, and a large fine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
on the other, I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that 'twas in that part of the
house, my fair new Conqueress
resided, but how to be resolv'd I
cou'd not tell, nor which way
the Windows lookt that were to
give the light, forwards that
part o'th' Garden there was none,
at last I saw the good old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56143:365"/>
come trudging through the
Garden fumbling out of his Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
a Key, I stept into an Arbor
to observe him, and saw him open
a little door that led him into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Garden, and locking the door
after him vanisht; and observing
how that side of the Apartment
lay, I went into the street and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a large compass, found that
which fac'd that Garden, which
made the fore part of the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I made a story of some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
I had for some upper rooms
and went into many houses, to
find which fronted best the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and still dislik'd something
till I met with one so directly to
it, that I cou'd, when I got a story
higher, look into the very Rooms,
which only a delicate Garden par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from this by street: there 'was I
fixt, and learnt from a young Dutch
woman that spoke good France,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56143:365"/>
that, that was the very place I
lookt for; the Apartment of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
the Countess of <hi>Clarinau:</hi>
She told me too, that every day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Dinner the old Gentleman
came thither, and sometimes a
nights: and bewail'd the young
Beauty, who had no better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
than what an old wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
Spaniard of threescore and
ten, cou'd give her: I found this
young woman apt for my purpose,
and having very well pleas'd her
with my conversation, and some
little presents I made her, I left
her in good humour, and resolv'd
to serve me on any design, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to my lodging I found old
<hi>Clarinau</hi> return'd, as brisk and gay
as if he had been carest by so fair
and young a Lady, which very
thought made me rave, and I had
abundance of pain to withold my
rage from breaking out upon him,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56143:366"/>
so jealous and envious I was of
what now I lov'd and desir'd, a
thousand times more than ever;
since the relation my new young
female friend had given me: who
had wit and beauty sufficient to
make her judgment impartial:
however I contain'd my jealousie
with the hopes of a suddain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
for I fancy'd the business
half accomplisht in my knowledg
of her residence. I feign'd some
business to the old Gentleman, that
wou'd call me out of town for a
week to consult with some of our
party, and taking my leave of him
he offer'd me the Complement of
Money, or what else I should need
in my affair, which at that time
was not unwelcome to me, and
being well furnisht for my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.
I took Horse without a
Page or Footman to attend me,
because I pretended my business
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56143:366"/>
was a secret, and taking a turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Town in the Evening, I
left my horse without the gates
and went to my secret new quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
where my young Friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceceiv'd
me with the joy of a
Mistress, and with whom indeed
I cou'd not forbear entertaining
my self very well, which ingag'd
her more to my service, with the
aid of my liberallity; but all this
did not allay one spark of the fire
kindled in my Soul for the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Calista;</hi> and I was impatient
for Night, against which time I
was preparing an Ingine to mount
the Battlement, for so it was that
divided the Garden from the
Street, rather than a Wall: All
things fitted to my purpose, I
fixt my self at the Window<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lookt directly towards her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes;
and had the satisfaction to
see her leaning there, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56143:367"/>
on a Fountain that stood in
the midst of the Garden, and cast
a thousand little streams into the
Air, that made a melancholly noise
in falling into a large Alablaster
Cistern beneath: Oh how my
heart danc'd at the dear sight'
to all the tunes of Love; I had
not power to stir or sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to remove my eyes, but languisht
on the window where I leant half
dead with Joy and transport; for
she appear'd more Charming to
my view: undrest and fit for
Love! Oh, my <hi>Octavio,</hi> such are
the pangs which I believe thou
felt at the approach of <hi>Silvia,</hi> so
beats thy heart, so rise thy sighs,
and Wishes; so trembling, and so
pale at every view, as I was in this
lucky Amorous moment! and
thus I fed my Soul till Night
came on, and left my Eyes no
Object, but my heart,—a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

dear Idea's: And now I sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd
out, and with good success,
for with a long engine which
reacht the top of the Wall I fixt
the end of my Ladder there, and
mounted it, and sitting on the
top brought my Lader easily up
to me, and turn'd it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other side; and with abundance
of ease descended into the Garden
which was the finest I had ever
seen; for now as good luck wou'd
have it, who was design'd to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
me: The Moon begun to
shine so bright as even to make me
distinguish the Colours of the
Flowers that drest all the Banks
in ravishing order, but these were
not the Beauty I came to possess,
and my new thoughts of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my self and managing my
matters, now took off all that
admiration that was justly due
to so delightful a place, which art
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56143:368"/>
and Nature had a greed to render
Charming to every sense, thus
much I consider'd it, that there
was nothing that did not invite
to love; a thousand pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses

to the fountain that fac'd

its brink view'd the whole apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which appear'd very mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent:
Just against me I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

her walk with the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman;

and still I kept my self
at such a distance, to have 'em
in my sight, but slid along the
shady side of the walk where I
cou'd not be easily seen, while
they kept still on the shiny part:
She led me thus through all the
Walks, through all the Maze of
Love; and all the way I fed my
greedy Eyes upon the melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Object of my raving desire;
her shape, her gate, her motion,
every step, and every movement
of her hand and head, had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
grace; a thousand times I
was tempted to approach her, and
discover my self, but I dreaded
the fatal consequence, the old
Woman being by, nor knew I
whether they did not expect the
Husband there; I therefore with
impatience waited when she
wou'd speak, that by that I might
make some discovery of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny

And only shadow'd with some tall
Trees that rank'd themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

that happy fantom of which she

I fear'd my Fate: And to give
any offence; while I was amidst

<hi>Dormina</hi> snoring as fast as cou'd

Soul in that happy moment, which
I fancy'd the most blest of my
life, made me tremble all over,
and with unassur'd steps, I softly
persu'd the Object of my new

her, and fearing to fright her,
and cause her to make some noise
that might alarm the sleeping
<hi>Dormina,</hi> I slackt my pace, till
in a Walk, at the end of which

remain'd; and suffer'd her to go
on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'twas a Walk of Grass, broad
and at the end of it a little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Greens; into which she
went and sate down, looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, and methought she
look't full at me; so that finding
she made no noise, I softly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
the door of the Arbour,
at a convenient distance, she then
stood up, in great amaze as she
after said, and I kneeling down

in an humble posture; cry'd,—
Wonder not, oh Sacred Charmer

to lay me fainting at her Feet;
nor did she answer any thing to
what I had said, but with sighs
suffer'd her hand to remain in

her Breast heav'd with nimble

Lover heard: I told you before
she had from her infancy been
bred in a Monastery, kept from
the fight of men, and knew no

But in the very purity of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
she appear'd like the first
born Maid in Paradice, generously
giving her Soul away to the great

Lord of all, the new form'd man,
and nothing of her hearts dear
thoughts did she reserve, (but
such as modest Nature shou'd
conceal) yet, if I touch't but on
that tender part where Honour
dwelt; she had a sense to nice,
as 'twas a Wonder, to find so vast
a store of that mixt with so soft
a passion. Oh what an excellent

man has taught her Arts to keep
her Empire, by being himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant?
all I cou'd ask of Love
she freely gave, and told me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

she con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Gown, my busie hands find pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to her Breasts, and give, and
take a thousand nameless Joys;
all but the last, I reapt; that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
was still deny'd; tho she
were fainting in my trembling
Arms, still she had watching sense
to guard that Treasure: Yet in
spight of all, a thousand times I
brought her to the very point of
yielding, but oh she begs and
pleads with all the Eloquence of
love! tells me that what she had
to give she gave, but wou'd not
violate her Marriage Vow: No,
not to save that life she found in
danger with too much Love, and
too extream desire; she told me
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56143:375"/>
that I had undone her quite, she
sight and wisht, that she had seen
me sooner, e're Fate had render'd her
a Sacrifice to the imbraces of old
<hi>Clarinau;</hi> she weept with Love,
and answer'd with sob, to every
Vow I made: thus by degrees
she wrought me to undoing, and
made me mad in Love: 'Twas
thus we past the Night; we told
the hasty hours and curst their
coming: we told from ten to
three? and all that time seem'd
but a little Minute: Nor wou'd
I let her go, who was as loath
to part, till she had given me
leave to see her often there; I
told her all my story of her
Conquest, and how I came into
the Garden: She ask'd me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
if I were not afraid of old
<hi>Clarinau,</hi> I told her no, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but of his being happy
with her, which thought I cou'd
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56143:375"/>
not bear; she assur'd me I had so
little reason to envy him, that he
rather deserv'd my compassion,
for that her aversion was so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
to him; his person, years,
his temper, and his diseases were
so disagreeable to her, that she
cou'd not dissemble her disgust,
but gave him most evident proofs
of it too frequently; ever since
she had the misfortune of being
his Wife; but that since she had
seen the Charming <hi>Philander,</hi> (for
so we must let her call him too)
his Company and Conversation
was wholly insupportable to her;
and but that he had ever us'd to
let her have four Nights in the
Week her own, wherein he never
disturb'd her repose, she shou'd
have been dead with his nasty
entertainment; She vow'd she
never knew a soft desire, but for
<hi>Philander</hi> she never had the least
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56143:376"/>
concern for any of his Sex be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
and till she felt his touches—
took in his kisses, and suffer'd his
dear imbraces; she never knew
that Woman was ordain'd for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Joy with man, but fancy'd it
design'd in its Creation for a poor
Slave to be opprest at pleasure
by the Husband, dully to yield
obedience and no more: But I
had taught her now she said to
her Eternal ruin, that there was
more in Nature than she knew,
or ever shou'd, had she not seen
<hi>Philander;</hi> she knew not what
dear name to call it by, but
something in her Blood; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that panted in her heart,
glow'd in her Cheeks and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht
in her looks, told her she
was not born for <hi>Clarinau;</hi> or
love wou'd do her wrong: I
sooth'd the thought, and urg'd
the Laws of Nature, the power
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56143:376"/>
of Love, necessity of Youth,—
And the Wonder that was yet
behind, that ravishing somthing,
which not love or kisses cou'd make
her guess at; so beyond all soft
imagination that nothing but a
tryal cou'd convince her; but
she resisted still, and still I plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all the subtillest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Love, words mixt with
kisses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sighing mixt with Vows
but all in vain, Religion was my
Foe, and Tyrant Honour guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all her Charms; thus did we
pass the Night till the young
Morn advancing in the East forc'd
us to bid adieu: Which oft we
did, and oft we sigh'd and kist,
oft parted and return'd, and sigh'd
again, and as she went away, she
weeping cry'—wringing my
hand in hers, pray Heav'n <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
this dear interview, do
not prove fatal to me, for, oh, I
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56143:377"/>
find frail Nature weak about me,
and one dear minute more wou'd
forfeit all my Honour. At this
she started from my trembling
hand, and swipt the Walk like
Wind so swift and suddain, and
left me panting, sighing, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dying, with mighty Love
and hope, and after a little time
I scal'd my Wall, and return'd
unseen to my new Lodging. It
was four days after, before I
cou'd get any other happiness
but that of seeing her at her win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
vvhich vvas just against mine
from which I never stirr'd, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to eat or sleep, and that she
saw with joy, for every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I had a Billet from her;
which we contriv'd that Happy
Night shou'd be convey'd me
thus—It was a By<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lodg'd, and the other side was
only the dead wall of her

Garden, where early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
she us'd to walk, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Billet ready, she put it
with a Stone into a little Leathern
purse, and tost it over the wall,
where either my self from the
Window or any young friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
waited for it, and that way
every Morning and every Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
she receiv'd one from me;
but 'tis impossible to tell you the
innocent Passion she exprest in
them, innocent in that there was
no Art, no fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>est her hearts
soft wishes. At last, (for I am tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in a relation of what gave
me so much pleasure in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment)
at last, I say, I receiv'd
the happy invitation to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Garden as before, and
Night advancing for my purpose
I need not say that I deliver'd
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56143:378"/>
my self upon the place appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which was by the Fountain
side beneath her Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
towards which I cast, you
may believe, many a longing
look: The Clock struck ten, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven,
and then twelve, but no
dear Star appear'd to conduct me
to my happiness, at last I heard
the little Garden door (against
the Fountain) open; and saw <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lista</hi>
there wrapt in her Night
Gown only; I ran like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to her Armes, with all the
transports of an eager Lover,
and almost smother'd my self in
her warm rising Breast, for she
taking me in her Arms. Let go
her Gown, which falling open left
nothing but her Shift, between
me and all her Charming Body:
But she bid me hear what
she had to say before, I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther, she told me she was
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56143:378"/>
forc'd to wait till <hi>Dormina</hi> was
a sleep, who lay in her Chamber,
and then stealing the Key she
came softly down to let me in.
<hi>But,</hi> said she, <hi>since I amall undrest,
and cannot walk in the Garden
with you, will you promise me on Love
and Honour, to be obedient to
all my Commands, if I carry you
to my Chamber, for</hi> Dormina<hi>'s
sleep are like death it self; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
least she chance to awake, and
shou'd take an occasion to speak to
me, 'twere absolutely necessary, that I
were there? for since I serv'd her
such a trick the other Night, and
let her sleep so long she will not let me
walk late.</hi> A very little argument
perswaded me to yield to any
thing to be with <hi>Calista</hi> any
where; so that both returning
softly to her Chamber, she put
her self into Bed, and left me
kneeling on the Carpet: But
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56143:379"/>
'twas not long that I remain'd
so; from the dear touches of
her hands and breast, we came
to kisses, and so equally to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfullness
of all we had promis'd
and agreed on before, and broke all
Rules, and Articles, that were
not in the Favour of Love; so
that stripping my self by degrees,
while she with an unwilling force
made some feeble resistance, I
got into the Arms of the most
Charming Woman that ever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
made; she was all over perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
I dare not tell you more;
let it suffice she was all that
luxurious man cou'd wish, and
all that renders woman fine and
ravishing. About two hours thus
was my Soul in rapture, while
sometimes she reproacht me, but
so gently, that 'twas to bid me
still be false and perjur'd if these
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56143:379"/>
were the effects of it; <hi>if disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

                           </gap>, <hi>be still Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thee, and thou still disobeying:</hi>
While thus we lay with equal
ravishment, we heard a murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
noise at distance, which we
knew not what to make of, but
it grew still louder and louder,
but still at distance too; this first
Alarm'd us, and I, was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
perswaded to rise; but I heard
a door unlock at the side of the
Bed; which was not that by
which I enter'd, for that was at
the other end of the Chamber
towards the Window. <hi>Oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
said the fair frighted trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,
<hi>here is the Count of</hi> Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau:
For he always came up that
way, and those Stairs by which
I ascended was the back stairs, so
that I had just time to grope my
way towards the door without
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:56143:380"/>
so much as taking my Cloaths

turn'd upon him, and at once
have hinder'd him from entring,
with my Sword in my hand,
and secur'd him from ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing
my pleasure any more,
but she implor'd I wou'd not,
and in this minutes dispute he
came so near me, that he toucht

not being acquainted very well
with the Chamber, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen my way, I lighted in my
passage on <hi>Dormina's</hi> pallate Bed,
and threw my self quite over her,
to the Chamber door, which
made a damnable clattering, and
a waking <hi>Dormina</hi> with my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe,
she set up such a

the Old Count, who was just ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

in a Candle from his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had lighted it at his
Flamboy: So that hearing the
noise, and knowing it must be
some Body in the Chamber, he
lets fall his Candle in the fright,
and call'd his Footman in with
the Flamboy, draws his Tolledo,
which he had in his hand, and
wrapt in his Night Gown;
with three or four woollen Caps
one upon the top of another,
ty'd under his tawny Leathern
Chops, he made a very pleasant
figure, and such an one as had

of the same disease still. <hi>Octavio</hi>
then call'd his Page, and sent him
home for the Note <hi>Briljard</hi> had
sent him, and all appear'd as

with a great many reproaches
for shewing her Ladies Letters,

By this Ride, I believe the gentle

Name prefix'd before this, will
make as many various Opinions of
it, as they do Characters of your

have been the business of so much
Discourse, and which according
to the Relator's Sence or good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

that so lavishly deals out
those agreeable Attractions,
Squandering away that Youth
and Time on many, which
might be more advantageously
dedicated to some one of the
Fair; and by a Liberty (which
they call) not being <hi>Discreet</hi>
enough, robb 'em of all the
Hopes of Conquest over that
Heart which they believe can
fix no where; they cannot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress
you into Tameness, or if
you sometimes appear so, they
are still upon their Guard with
you; for like a Young Lyon,
you are ever apt to leap into
your Natural Wildness; the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb facs="tcp:56143:403"/>
of your Soul disdaining

not being made for Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
so rough and fatigueing,
as those your active Mind
would impose upon it. Your
Lordship is placed in so Glorious
a Station (the Son of so Great
a Father) as renders all you do
more perspicuous to the World,
than the Actions of common
Men already; the advantages of
your Birth have drawn all
Eyes upon you, and yet more on
those coming Greatnesses, to which
you were born; if Heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
your Lordship amidst the
<pb facs="tcp:56143:403"/>
too vigorous Efforts, and too
dangerous Adventures, which
a too brisk Fire in your Noble
Blood, a too forward desire of
gaining Fame daily exposes you to;
and will, unless some force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
your too impatient Bravery,
shorten those Days which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has surely designed for more
Glorious Actions; for according
to all the Maxims of the Iudging

of Youth accomplish, and perfect
the Riper Years. 'Tis this that

the Consideration and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a few more Years will
<pb facs="tcp:56143:404"/>
regulate it to that just degree,
where the noble and generous
Spirit should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, your Lordship will find the
fatal Effects of great Courage
without Conduct, Wit without
<pb facs="tcp:56143:404"/>
Discretion, and a Greatness of
Mind without the steady Vertues
of it; so that from a Prince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ador'd by all, by an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that too often attendss the
Great and Young, and from the
most exhalted Height of Glory,
mis-led by false notions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and falser Friends, fell
the most pityed Object, that ever
was abandoned by Fortune. I
hope no One will imagine I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this as a Parallel between
your Lordship and our mistaken
brave Vnfortunate, since your
Lordship hath an unquestioned
and hereditary Loyalty, which
nothing can deface, born from a
Father, who has given the
World so evident Proofs, that
<pb facs="tcp:56143:405"/>
no fear of threatned danger can
separate his useful Service, and
Duties from the Interest of his
Royal and God-like Master, which
he pursues with an undaunted For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
in disdain of Phanatical
Censures, and those that want
the Bravery to do a just Action,
for fear of future Turns of State.
And such indeed is your true <hi>Man
of Honour;</hi> and as such I doubt
not but your Lordship will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit

AMOURS
OF
PHILANDER and SILVIA.</head>
                  <p>OCTAVIO the Brave, the
Generous, and the Amorous,
having left <hi>Silvia</hi> absolutely
resolv'd to give her self to that doting
fond Lover, or rather to sacrifice her
self to her Revenge, that unconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Unfortunate, whose Passion
had expos'd him to all the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Effects of it, return'd to his
own House, wholly transported with
his happy Success. He thinks on
nothing but vast coming Joys: Nor
did one kind Thought direct him
back to the evil Consequences of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56143:407"/>
what he so hastily pursu'd; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
not on her Circumstances, but
her Charms; not on the Infamy
he should espouse with <hi>Silvia,</hi> but
of those ravishing Pleasures she was
capable of giving him: he regards
not the Reproaches of his Friends;
but wholly abandon'd to Love and
youthful Imaginations, gives a Loose
to young Desire and Fancy, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes
him with a thousand soft Ideas:
He reflects not that his gentle and
easy Temper, was most unfit to
joyn with that of <hi>Silvia,</hi> which
was the most haughty and humorous
in Nature; for tho' she had all the
Charms of Youth and Beauty, that
are conquering in her Sex, all the
Wit and Insinuation that even sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
Youth and Beauty, yet to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her Character impartially, she
had also abundance of disagreeing
Qualities mixt with her Perfections.
She was Imperious and Proud, even
to Insolence; Vain and Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
even to Folly; she knew her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56143:407"/>
Vertues and her Graces too well,
and her Vices too little; she was
very Opinionated and Obstinate, hard
to be convinced of the falsest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but very positive in her
fancied Judgment: Abounding in
her own Sense, and very critical on
that of others: Censorious, and too
apt to charge others with those
Crimes to which she was her self
addicted, or had been guilty of: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morously
inclin'd, and indiscreet in
the Management of her Amours,
and constant rather from Pride and
Shame than Inclination; fond of
catching at every trifling Conquest,
and lov'd the Triumph tho' she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Slave. Yet she had Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
too, that balanc'd her Vices,
among which we must allow her to
have lov'd <hi>Philander</hi> with a Passion,
that nothing but his Ingratitude
could have decay'd in her Heart,
nor was it lessen'd but by a Force
that gave her a thousand Tortures,
Racks, and Pangs, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56143:408"/>
cost her her less valu'd Life;
for being of a Temper nice in Love,
and very fiery, apt to fly into Rages
at every Accident that did but touch
that tenderest Part, her Heart; she
suffered a world of Violence and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of Rage and Grief by turns:
at this Affront and Inconstancy of
<hi>Philander.</hi> Nevertheless she was now
so discreet, or rather Cunning, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
her Resentment the best she
could to her generous Lover, for
whom she had more Inclination than
she yet had leisure to perceive, and
which she now attributes wholly to
her Revenge; and considering <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
as the most proper Instrument
for that, she fancies, what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a growing Tenderness from the
sense of his Merit, to be the Effects
of that Revenge she so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and thirsted after; and tho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
she dissembled a Calm; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she was all Fury and Disorder,
all Storm and Distraction: She
went to Bed rack'd with a thousand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56143:408"/>
thoughts of dispairing Love; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
all the Softness of <hi>Philander</hi>
in their happy Enjoyments came in
view, and made her sometimes weep,
and sometimes faint with the dear
lov'd Remembrance; sometimes his
late Enjoyments with <hi>Calista,</hi> and
then she rav'd and burnt with fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Rage: But oh! at last she found
her Hope was gon, and wisely fell
to argue with her Soul. She knew
Love would not long subsist on the
thin Diet of Dispair, and resolving
he was never to be retriev'd who
once had ceas'd to Love, she strove
to bend her Soul to useful Reason,
and thinks on all <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
his Vows, his Assiduity, his
Beauty, his Youth, his Fortune, and
his generous Offer, and with the
Aid of Pride resolves to unfix her
Heart, and give it better Treatment
in his Bosom: To cease at least to
love the false <hi>Philander,</hi> if she could
never force her Soul to hate him:
And tho' this was not so soon done
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56143:409"/>
as thought on, in a Heart so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest
as that of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s, yet there
is some Hope of a Recovery, when
a Woman in that Extremity will but
think of listening to Love from any
new Adorer; and having once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to pursue the Fugitive no
more with the natural Artillery of
their Sighs and Tears, Reproaches
and Complaints, they have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to every thing that may soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
chase from the Heart those
Thoughts that oppress it: For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not inclin'd to hurt it self,
and there are but very few who find
it necessary to die of the Disease of
Love. Of this sort was our <hi>Silvia,</hi>
tho' to give her her due, never any
Person who did not indeed die, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
languished under the Torments
of Love, as did that charming and
afflicted Maid.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Silvia</hi> remain'd in these
eternal Inquietudes, <hi>Antonett</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quitted her Chamber, takes this
Opportunity to go to that of <hi>Brilljard,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56143:409"/>
whom she had not visited in two
days before, being extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at his Design which she now
found he had on her Lady; she had
a mind to vent her Spleen, and as the
Proverb says, <hi>call W—re first. Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
long'd as much to see her, to
rail at her for being privy to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>'s
Approach to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Bed, as
he thought (she imagin'd) and not
giving him an account of it, as she
us'd to do, of all the Secrets of her
Lady. She finds him alone in his
Chamber, recover'd from all but
the Torments of his unhappy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.
She approach'd him
with all the Anger her sort of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
could inspire (for Love in a
mean unthinking Soul, is not that
glorious thing it is in the Brave)
however she had enough to serve
her Pleasure, for <hi>Brilljard</hi> was young
and handsome, and both being bent
on Railing, without knowing each
others Intentions, they both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flew into high Words; he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56143:410"/>
her with her Infidelity,
and she him with his. <hi>Are not you,</hi>
said he (growing more calm) <hi>the
falsest of your Tribe, to keep a Secret
from me that so much concern'd me? is
it for this I have refus'd the Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

out-noyse her, <hi>You thought because
your Deeds were done in Darkness,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56143:410"/>
they were conceal'd from a Lovers
Eyes; no thou young Viper, I saw,
I heard, and felt, and satisfi'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sense of this thy Falshood, when</hi>
Octavio <hi>was conducted to</hi> Silvia<hi>'s Bed
by thee. But what,</hi> said she, <hi>if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of</hi> Octavio <hi>I conducted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
Traytor to love</hi> Brilljard? <hi>Who
then was false and perjur'd?</hi> At this
he blush'd extreamly, which was
too visible on his fair Face. She
being now confirm'd she had the

the Truth of what I say, and I
have been but too well acquainted with
that Body of yours,</hi> weeping as she
spoke, <hi>to mistake it for that of</hi> Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio.
<hi>Softly dear</hi> Antonett, reply'd he,
<hi>—nay now your Tears have calm'd
me;</hi> and taking her in his Arms,
sought to appease her by all the
Arguments of seeming Love and
Tenderness; while she yet wholly
unsatisfied in that Cheat of his of
going to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Bed, remain'd still
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56143:411"/>
pouting and very frumpish. But
he that had but one Argument left,
that on all Occasions serv'd to
convince her, had at last Recourse
to that, which put her in good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and hanging on his Neck she
kindly chid him for puting such a
Trick upon her Lady. He told her,
and confirm'd it with an Oath, That
he did it but to try how far she was
Just to his Friend and Lord, and
not any Desire he had for a Beauty
that was too much of his own
Complexion to charm him, 'twas
only the Brunet and the Black, such
as her self, that could move him to
Desire; thus he shams her into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Peace. <hi>And why,</hi> said she, <hi>were
you not satisfied that she was False,
as well from the Assignation as the
Tryal. Oh no,</hi> said he, <hi>you Women
have a thousand Arts of Gibing, and
no Man ought to believe you, but put
you to the Tryal. Well,</hi> said she,
<hi>when I had brought you to the Bed,
when you found her Arms stretch'd out
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56143:411"/>
to receive you, why did you not retire
like an honest Man, and leave her to
her self? Oh fy,</hi> said he, <hi>that had
not been to have acted</hi> Octavio <hi>to the
Life, but would have made a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Ay,</hi> said she, <hi>that was your
Aim to have acted</hi> Octavio <hi>to the
Life, I believe, and not to discover
my Lady's Constancy to your Lord,
but</hi> I <hi>suppose you have been sworn at
the But of</hi> Hedleburgh, <hi>never to kiss
the Maid when you can kiss the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress:</hi>
But he renewing his Caresses
and Asseverations of Love to her,
she suffered herself to be convinc'd
of all he had a mind to have her
believe. After this she could not
contain any Secret from him, but
told him she had something to say
to him, which if he knew, would
convince him she had all the Passion
in the World for him: He presses
eagerly to know, and she pursues to
tell him, 'tis as much as her Life is
worth to discover it, and that she
lies under the Obligation of an Oath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56143:412"/>
not to tell it; but Kisses and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
prevails, and she crys—<hi>What
will you say now if my Lady may
Marry one of the greatest and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Persons in all this Country?
I should not wonder at her Conquests</hi>
(reply'd <hi>Brilljard) but I should wonder
if she should Marry. Then cease your
Wonder,</hi> reply'd she, <hi>for she is to
morrow to be married to Count</hi> Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,
<hi>whom she is to meet at nine in
the Morning to that end, at a little
Village a League from this place.</hi> She
spoke, and he believes; and finds it
true by the raging of his Blood,
which he could not conceal from
<hi>Antonett,</hi> and for which he feigns a
thousand Excuses to the Amorous
Maid, and charges his Concern on
that for his Lord: At last (after
some more Discourse on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
he pretends to grow sleepy,
and hastens her to her Chamber,
and locking the Door after her, he
began to reflect on what she had
said, and grew to all the Torment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56143:412"/>
of Rage, Jealousie, and all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairs
of a passionate Lover: And
tho' his Hope was not Exstreme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet as Lovers do, he found, or
fancy'd a Probability (from his Lords
Inconstancy, and his own right of
Marriage) that the Necessity she
might chance to be in of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Assistance in a strange
Country, might some happy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or other render him the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
he so long had waited for from
<hi>Silvia;</hi> for he ever design'd, when
either his Lord left her, grew cold,
or should happen to die, to put in his
Claim of Husband. And the soft
familiar way, with which she eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
liv'd with him, incourag'd
this Hope and Design; nay she had
often made him Advances to that
happy Expectation. But this fatal
Blow had driven him from all his
fancy'd Joys, to the most wretched
Estate of a desperate Lover. He
traverses his Chamber wounded with
a thousand different Thoughts, mixt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56143:413"/>
with those of preventing this Union
the next Morning. Sometimes he
resolves to fight <hi>Octavio,</hi> for his
Birth might pretend to it, and he
wanted no Courage; but he is afraid
of being overcome by that gallant
Man, and either loosing his Hopes
with his Life, or if he kill <hi>Octavio,</hi>
to be forc'd to fly from his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or die an ignominious Death.
Sometimes he resolves to own <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
for his Wife, but then he fears
the Rage of that dear Object of his
Soul, which he dreads more than
Death it self: So that tost from one
Extream to another, from one Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to a hundred, he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to fix upon any thing. In this
Perplexity he remain'd till Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd;
that Day that must advance
with his undoing, while <hi>Silvia</hi> and
<hi>Antonett</hi> were preparing for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
concluded on the last Night.
This he heard, and every Minute
that approach'd gave him new Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
so that now he would have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56143:413"/>
given himself to the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for a kind Disappointment: He
was often ready to go and throw
himself at her Feet, and plead against
her Enterprize in hand, and to urge
the unlawfulness of a double Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
ready to make Vows for the
Fidelity of <hi>Philander,</hi> tho' before
so much against his own Interest,
and to tell her all those Letters from
him were forg'd: He thought on
all things, but nothing remain'd
with him, but Dispair of every
thing. At last the Devil and his
own Subtilty, put him upon a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
tho' base, yet the most likely
to succeed in his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>He knew there were many Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the States
themselves were divided in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and a thousand Jealousies and
Fears were eternally spread amongst
the Rable; there were Cabals for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Interest, that of the <hi>French</hi> so
prevailing, that of the <hi>English,</hi> and
that of the Illustrious <hi>Orange,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56143:414"/>
others for the States; so that it was
not a Difficulty to move any Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and pass it off among the
Crowd for dangerous Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Brilljard</hi> knew each Division,
and which way they were inclin'd,
he knew <hi>Octavio</hi> was not so well
with the States as not to be easily
rendred worse; for he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
a Creature and Favourite of the
Prince that they conceiv'd abundance
of Jealousies of him which they durst
not own. <hi>Brilljard</hi> besides knew a
great Man, who having a Pique
to <hi>Octavio,</hi> might the sooner be
brought to receive any ill Character
of him: To this sullen Magistrate
he applies himself, and deluding the
Credulous busie old Man with a
thousand circumstantial Lies, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to him that <hi>Octavio</hi> held a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with the <hi>French</hi> King to
betray the State; and that he Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball'd
to that end with some who
were look'd upon as <hi>French</hi> Rebels,
but indeed were no other than Spies
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56143:414"/>
to <hi>France.</hi> This coming from a Man
of that Party, and whose Lord was
a <hi>French</hi> Rebel, gain'd a perfect
Credit with the old Sr. <hi>Politi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> so
that immediately hasting to the State-House
he lays this weighty Affair
before them, who soon found it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
and if not true, at least they
fear'd, and sent out a Warrant for
the speedy apprehending him; but
coming to his House, tho' early,
they found him gone, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
which way he took, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
pursu'd him, and found his
Coach at the Door of a <hi>Caberett,</hi> too
Obscure for his Quality; which
made them apprehend this was some
place of Rendezvouz, where he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
met with his Trayterous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociators:
They send in, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
inquire who he waited for, or
who was with him, and they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
he stay'd for some Gentlemen
of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, for he had
ordered <hi>Silvia</hi> to come in mans
Cloaths, that she might not be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56143:415"/>
known; and had given Order below,
that if two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen came
they should be brought to him. This
Information made the Scandal as
clear as Day, and the Messenger no
longer doubted of the Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Warrant, tho' he was
loath to serve it on a Person whose
Father he had serv'd many Years.
He waits at some distance from the
House unseen, tho' he could take a
View of all; he saw <hi>Octavio</hi> come
often out into the Balcony and look
with longing Eyes towards the
Road that leads to the Town; he
saw him all rich and gay as a young
Bridegroom, lovely and young as
the Morning that flattered him with
so fair and happy a Day; at last he saw
two Gentlemen alight at the Door,
and giving their Horses to a Page
to walk a while, they ran up into
the Chamber where <hi>Octavio</hi> was
waiting, who had already sent his
Page to prepare the Priest in the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
Church to marry them. You
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56143:415"/>
may imagine with what Love and
Joy the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avished Youth approach'd
the Idol of his Soul, and she who
beholds him in more Beauty than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet she thought he had appear'd,
pleas'd with all things he had on,
with the gay Morning, the flowry
Field, the Air, the little Journey, and
a thousand diverting things, made
no Resistance to those fond Imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that prest her a thousand times
with silent Transport, and falling
Tears of eager Love and Pleasure,
but even in that moment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
she forgot <hi>Philander,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
all the Satisfaction so soft a
Lover could dispence: While they
were mutually thus exchanging
Looks, and almost Hearts, the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
came into the Room, and as
civilly as possible told <hi>Octavio</hi> he
had a Warrant for him to secure
him as a Traytor to the State, and
a Spy for <hi>France.</hi> You need not
be told the Surprize and Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he was in; however he obey'd:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56143:416"/>
The Messenger turning to <hi>Silvia,</hi>
cry'd Sr. Tho' I can hardly credit
this Crime that is charged to my
Lord, yet the finding him here with
two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen gives me some
more Fears that there may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it; and it would do well, if
you would deliver your selves into
my Hands for the farther clearing this
Gentleman. The foolish grave Speech
of the Messenger had like to have
put <hi>Octavio</hi> into a loud Laughter, he
addressing himself to two Women,
for two Men: But <hi>Silvia</hi> reply'd,
Sir, I hope you do not take us for so
little Friends to the gallant <hi>Octavio,</hi>
to abandon him in his Misfortune;
no, we will share it with him, be it
what it will. To this the generous
Lover, blushing with kind Surprize,
bow'd, and kissing her Hand with
Transport, calling her his charming
Friend; and so all three being guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
back in <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Coach, they
return to the Town, and to the
House of the Messenger, which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56143:416"/>
made a great Noise all over, that
<hi>Octavio</hi> was taken with two <hi>French</hi>
Jesuits plotting to fire <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
and a thousand things equally Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.
They were all three lodg'd
together in one House, that of the
Messenger, which was very fine, and
fit to entertain any Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
while <hi>Brilljard,</hi> who did not
like that part of the Project, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
him of a thousand ways
how to free her from thence; for he
design'd as soon as <hi>Octavio</hi> should be
taken to have got her to have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Town under pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken upon Suspicion of holding
Correspondence with him, because
they were <hi>French;</hi> but her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
herself up, had not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
all his Design, but had made
it unsafe for him to stay. While he
was thus bethinking himself what
he should do, <hi>Octavio's</hi> Uncle, who
was one of the States, extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
at the Indignity put upon his
Nephew and his sole Heir, the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56143:417"/>
of his Heart and Eyes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
that this Informer may be
secur'd; and accordingly-<hi>Brilljard</hi>
was taken into Custody, who giving
himself over for a lost Man, resolves
to put himself upon <hi>Octavio's</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
by telling him the Motives that
induc'd him to this violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Course. It was some days
before the Council thought fit to call
for <hi>Octavio,</hi> to hear what he had to
say for himself in the mean time, he
having not had Permission yet to
see <hi>Silvia;</hi> and being extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of that Happiness, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
himself that the Messenger
having been in his Fathers Service,
might have so much Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t for the
Son as to allow him to speak to that
fair Charmer, provided he might be
a Witness to what he should say:
He sends for him, and demanded of
him where those two fair Prisoners
were lodg'd who came with him in
the Morning; he told him, in a very
good Apartment on the same Floor,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56143:417"/>
and that they were very well Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated,
and seem'd to have no other
Trouble but what they suffered for
him. I hope my Lord, added he
—your Confinement will not be
long, for I hear there is a Person taken
up, who has confest he did it for a
Revenge on you. At this <hi>Octavio</hi>
was very well pleased, and asked
him who it was; and he told him a
<hi>French</hi> Gentleman belonging to the
Count <hi>Philander,</hi> who about six
Months ago was obliged to quit the
Town as an Enemy to <hi>France.</hi> He
soon knew it to be <hi>Brilljard,</hi> and
comparing this Action with some
others of his lately Committed, he
no longer doubts it the Effects of
his Jealousie. He ask'd the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
if it were impossible to gain so
much Favour of him, as to let him
visit those two <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, he
being by while he was with them:
The Keeper soon granted his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and reply'd—There was no
Hazzard, he would not run to serve
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56143:418"/>
him; and immediately, putting back
the Hangings, with one of those
Keys he had in his Hand, he opened
a Door in his Chamber that led into
a Gallery of fine Pictures, and from
thence they past into the Apartment
of <hi>Silvia:</hi> As soon as he came in
he threw himself at her Feet, and she
received him, and took him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Arms with all the Transports
of Joy a Soul (more than ever pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with Love for him) could
conceive; and tho' they all appear'd
of the Masculine Sex, the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
soon perceiv'd his Error, and
beg'd a thousand Pardons. <hi>Octavio</hi>
makes hast to tell her his Opinion of
the cause of all this Trouble to both;
and she easily believ'd, when she
heard <hi>Brilljard</hi> was taken, that it
was as he imagin'd, for he had
been found too often faulty not to
be suspected now: This Thought
brought a great Calm to both their
Spirits, and almost reduc'd them to
their first soft Tranquillity, with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56143:418"/>
which they began the day: For he
protested his Innocence a thousand
times, which was wholly needless,
for the generous Maid believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he spoke, he could not be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Sin of Treachery. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
his Vows to her of eternal
Love, and that he would perform
what they were so unluckily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
of doing this Morning, and
that tho' possibly by this unhappy
Adventure his Design might have
taken Air, and have arrived to the
Knowledge of his Uncle, yet in spite
of all Opposition of Friends, or the
Malice of <hi>Brilljard,</hi> he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
his Glorious Design of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, tho' he were forc'd for it
to wander to the farthest parts of the
Earth with his lovely Prize. He
begs she will not disesteem him for
this Scandal on his Fame, for he
was all Love, all soft Desire, and
had no other Design than that of
making himself Master of that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Treasure in the World; that of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56143:419"/>
the possessing the most charming,
the all ravishing <hi>Silvia:</hi> In return,
she paid him all the Vows that
could secure an In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idel in Love,
she made him all the indearing Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
a Heart could wish, wholly
given up to tender Passion, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he believes, and is the
gayest Man that ever was blest by
Love. And the Messenger who was
present all this while, found that
this Caballing with the <hi>French</hi> Spies,
was only an innocent Design to give
himself away to a fine young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And therefore fully convinc'd
he, was guilty of no other Crime,
he gave them all the Freedom they
desired; and which they made use
of to the most Advantage Love could
direct or Youth inspire. This Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
with <hi>Octavio</hi> begot a Pity
and Compassion in the Heart of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
and that grew up to Love, for
he had all the Charms that could
inspire it; and every Hour was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
new Fire to her Heart, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56143:419"/>
at last burnt into a Flame, such
Power has mighty Obligation on a
Heart that has any grateful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And yet when she was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
anights from <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
thought on <hi>Philander's</hi> Passion for
<hi>Calista,</hi> she would Rage and Rave,
and find the Effects of wondrous
Love, and wondrous Pride, and be
even ready to make Vows against
<hi>Octavio:</hi> But those were Fits that
seldomer seiz'd her now, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fit was like a departing Ague,
still weaker than the former, and
at the sight of <hi>Octavio</hi> all would
vanish, her Blushes would rise and
discover the soft Thoughts her Heart
conceived for the approaching Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and she soon found that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Error of the Impossibility of
Loving more than once. It was
four days they thus remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being call'd to the Councel, and
every day brought its new Joys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it: They were never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder,
never interrupted with any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56143:420"/>
Visit, but once for a few Moments
in a day by <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Uncle, and
then he would go into his own
Apartment to receive him: He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to baile him out; but <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
who had found more real Joy
there than in any part of the Earth
besides, eva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d the Obligation, by
telling his Uncle he would be oblig'd
to nothing but his Innocence for
his Liberty: So would get rid of
the fond old Gentleman, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew a Passion but for his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Nephew, and return with as
much Joy to the Lodgings of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
as if he had been absent a Week,
which is an Age to a Lover; there
they sometimes would play at Cards,
where he would lose considerable
Summs to her, or at Hazard, or
be studying what they should do
next to pass the Hours most to her
Content; not but he had rather have
lain eternally at her Feet, gazing,
doating, and saying a thousand fond
things, which at every View he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56143:420"/>
took were conceived in his Soul:
And tho' but this last Minute he
had finish'd saying all that Love
could Dictate, he found his Heart
oppress'd with a vast store of new
Softness, which he languish'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
in her ravishing Bosom: But
she, who was not arrived to his
pitch of Loving, diverts his softer
Hours with Play sometimes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile
with making him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her into the Gallery, which was
adorn'd with pleasant Pictures, all
of <hi>Hempskerk's</hi> hand, which afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great Variety of Objects very
Drole and Antique, <hi>Octavio</hi> finding
something to say of every one that
might be of Advantage to his own
Heart; for whatever Argument was
in dispute, he would be sure to
bring it home to the Passion he had
for <hi>Silvia;</hi> it should end in Love
however remotely begun: So
strange an Art has Love to turn all
things to the Advantage of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56143:421"/>'Twas thus they pass'd their time,
and nothing was wanting that lavish
Expence could procure, and every
Minute he advances to new Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and unspeakable Delights, but
still such as might hitherto be allow'd
with Honour; he sighs, and wishes,
he languishes and dies for more, but
dares not utter the Meaning of one
Motion of Breath, for he lov'd so
very much that every Look from
those fair Eyes that charm'd him,
aw'd him to a Respect that rob'd
him of many happy Moments a
bolder Lover would have turn'd to
his Advantage, and he treated her
as if she had been an unspotted
Maid; with Caution of Offending,
he had forgot that general Rule, That
where the sacred Laws of Honour
are once invaded, Love makes the
easier Conquest.</p>
                  <p>All this while you may imagine
<hi>Brilljard</hi> indured no little Torment,
he could not on the one side de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what the <hi>States</hi> would do
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56143:421"/>
with him, when once they should
find him a false. Accuser of so great
a Man, and on the other side he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
a thousand Pains and Jealousies
from Love; he knew too well the
Charms and Power of <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
what Effects Importunity and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
have on the Temper of
feeble Woman: He found the <hi>States</hi>
did not make so considerable a
matter of his being Impeach'd as to
confine him strictly, and he dies with
the Fears of those happy Moments
he might possibly enjoy with <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
where there might be no Spies
about her to give him any kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence;
and all that could afford
him any glimps of Consolation, was,
That while they were thus confin'd
he was out of Fear of their being
married. <hi>Octavio's</hi> Uncle this while
was not Idle, but taking it for a
high Indignity his Nephew should
remain so long without being heard,
he mov'd it to the Councel, and
accordingly they sent for him to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56143:422"/>
State-House the next Morning, where
<hi>Brilljard</hi> was brought to confront
him; whom, as soon as <hi>Octavio</hi> saw,
with a scornful Smile, he cry'd—
<hi>'Tis well,</hi> Brilljard, <hi>that you who durst
not fight me fairly, should find out
this nobler way of ridding your self
of a Rival; I am glad at least, that
I have no more honourable a Witness
against me. Brilljard,</hi> who never
before wanted Assurance, at this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
was wholly Confounded;
for it was not from any Villainy in
his Nature, but the absolute Effects
of mad and desperate Passion, which
put him on the only Remedy that
could relieve him; and looking on
<hi>Octavio</hi> with modest Blushes, that
half pleaded for him, he cry'd—
<hi>Yes my Lord, I am your Accuser, and
come to charge your Innocence with the
greatest of Crimes, and you ought to
thank me for my Accusation; when
you shall know 'tis regard to my own
Honour, violent Love for</hi> Silvia, <hi>and
extream Respect to your Lordship,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56143:422"/>
has made me thus sawcy with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
Fame. How,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,
shall I thank you for accusing
me with a Plot upon the State? Yes
my Lord,</hi> reply'd <hi>Brilljard; and yet
you had a Plot to betray the State,
and by so new a way, as could be found
out by none but so great and brave
a Man.—Heavens,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
inrag'd, <hi>this is an Impudence,
that nothing but a Traytor to his own
King, and one bred up in Plots and
Mischiefs, could have invented; I betray
my own Country?—Yes my Lord,</hi>
cry'd he (more briskly than before,
seeing <hi>Octavio</hi> colour so at him)
<hi>to all the Loosness of unthinking Youth,
to all the Breach of Laws both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Divine, if all the Youth
should follow your Example, you would
betray Posterity it self; and only mad
Confusion would abound: In short, my
Lord, that Lady who was taken with
you by the Messenger, was my Wife:</hi>
And going to wards <hi>Silvia,</hi> who was
struck as with a Thunderbolt, he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56143:423"/>
seiz'd her Hand, and Cry'd,—
while all stood gazing on—<hi>This
Lady Sir I mean—she is my Wife,
my lawful married Wife.</hi> At this
<hi>Silvia</hi> could no longer hold her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
within its Bounds, but with
that other Hand he had left her,
she struck him a Box on the Ear,
that almost stagger'd him, coming
unawares, and as she struck she cry'd
aloud, <hi>Thou liest base Villain—
and I'll be reveng'd;</hi> and flinging her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
out of his Hand, she got on the
other side of <hi>Octavio,</hi> while the
whole Company remained confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at what they saw and heard.
<hi>How,</hi> cry'd out old <hi>Sebastian,</hi> Uncle
to <hi>Octavio, a Woman, this? By my
Troth, sweet Lady, if you be one,
methought you were a very pretty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</hi>
And turning to <hi>Brilljard,</hi> he
cry'd—<hi>Why, what Sir, then it
seems all this Noise of betraying the
State was but a Cuckold's Dream. Hah!
and this wonderful and dangerous Plot,
was but one upon your Wife Sir; hah
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56143:423"/>
—was it so? Marry Sir, at this
rate, I rather think 'tis you have a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of betraying the State—you
cuckoldly Knaves that bring your
handsome Wives to seduce our young
Senators from their Sobriety and
Wits. Are these the Recompences,</hi>
reply'd <hi>Brilljard, you give the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in lieu of restoring me my
Right, am I reproach'd with the most
scandalous Infamy that can befal a
Man. Well Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Sebastian,
this is all you have to charge this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
with?</hi> At which he bow'd
and was silent—and <hi>Sebastian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd—
<hi>If your Wife, Sir, have a
mind to my Nephew, or he to her, it
should have been your Care to have
forbid it, or prevented it, by keeping
her under Lock and Key, if no other
way to be secured; and Sir, we do not
sit here to relieve Fools and Cuckolds;
if your Lady will be Civil to my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
what's that to us: Let her
speak for herself; What say you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?—
I say,</hi> reply'd <hi>Silvia, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56143:424"/>
this Fellow is mad and raves; that
he is my Vassal, my Servant, my
Slave; but, after this, unworthy of
the meanest of these Titles.</hi> This she
spoke with a Disdain that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
show'd the Pride and Anger
of her Soul—<hi>La you Sir,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Sebastian, you are discharg'd your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys
Service; 'tis a plain case she has
more mind to the young Count than
the Husband, and we cannot compel
People to be honest against their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</hi>
And coming down from
the Seat where he sate, he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Octavio</hi> a hundred times, and
told the Board, he was extreamly
glad they found the mighty Plot
but a Vagary of Youth, and the
Spleen of a Jealous Husband or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or whatsoever other malicious
thing; and desired the angry Man
might be discharged since he had so
just a Provocation as the loss of a
Mistriss. So all laughing at the Jest,
that had made so great a Noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Grave and Wise, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56143:424"/>
freed 'em all: And <hi>Sebastian</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Nephew, that the next
Cuckold he made, he would make
a Friend of him first, that he might
hear of no more Complaints against
him. But <hi>Octavio</hi> very gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd:
<hi>Sir, you have infinitely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
the Character of this Lady,
she is a Person of too great Quality
for this Raillery; at more Leisure
you shall have her Story.</hi> While he
was speaking this, and their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
were making, <hi>Silvia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with Shame, Indignation,
and Anger, goes out, and taking
<hi>Octavio's</hi> Coach that stood at the
Gate, went directly to his House,
for she resolved to go no more
where <hi>Brilljard</hi> was. After this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian</hi>
fell seriously to good Advice,
and earnestly besought his Darling
to leave off those wild Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that had so long made so great
a Discourse all the Province over,
where nothing but his splendid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Treats, Balls, and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficences
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56143:425"/>
of Love, was the Business
of the Town, and that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
to tell him of it, and had
hitherto justified his Actions, tho
they had not deserved it; and he
doubted this was the Lady to whom
for this six or eight Months he
heard he had so intirely dedicated
himself: He desires him to quit this
Lady, or if he will pursue his Love,
to do it discreetly, to love some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
Woman, and not injure his
Neighbours; to all which he blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and bowed, and silently seem'd
to thank him for his grave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
And <hi>Brilljard</hi> having received
his Discharge, and Advice how he
provoked the Displeasure of the
<hi>States</hi> any more, by accusing of great
Persons, he was ordered to ask <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>'s
Pardon, but in lieu of that,
he came up to him and challenged
him to fight him for the Injustice
he had done him, in taking from
him his Wife; for he was sure he
was undone in her Favour, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56143:425"/>
that Thought made him mad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to put himself on this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Extravagancy: However this
was not so silently managed but
<hi>Sebastian</hi> perceived it, and was so
inraged at the young Fellow for this
second Insolence, that he was again
confined, and sent back to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
where he swore he should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the utmost of the Law: And
the Council breaking up, every one
departed to his own Home. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was Man Ravished with excess
of Joy as <hi>Octavio</hi> was, to find <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
meet him with extended Arms
on the Stare-Case, whom he did not
imagine to have found there, nor
knew he how he stood in the Heart
of that Charmer of his own, since
the Affront she had received in the
Court from those that however did
not know her, for they did not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
this was that Lady, Sister
to <hi>Philander,</hi> of whose Beauty they
had heard so much, and her Face
being turn'd from the Light, the old
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56143:426"/>
Gentlemen did not so much consider
or see it. <hi>Silvia</hi> came into his House
the back way, through the Stables
and Garden, and had the good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be seen of none of his Family,
but the Coach-man who brought her
home, whom she conjur'd not to
speak of it to the rest of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
and unseen of any body she
got into his Apartment, for often
she had been there at Treats and
Balls with <hi>Philander.</hi> She was all
alone, for <hi>Antonett</hi> stay'd to see
what became of her false Lover,
who, after he was seized again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to her Lodging the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate
Woman in the World, for
having lost her Hopes of <hi>Brilljard,</hi>
to whom she had ingaged all that
Honour she had. But when she
missed her Lady there, she accused
herself with all the Falshood in the
World, and fell to repent her Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.
She sends the Page to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at <hi>Octavio</hi>'s House, but no
body there could give him any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56143:426"/>
so that the poor amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Youth returning without Hope,
indur'd all the Pain of a hopless Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
for <hi>Octavio</hi> had anew charm'd
his Coach-man: And calling up an
ancient Woman who was his House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
who had been his Nurse, he
acquainted her with the short Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Passion for <hi>Silvia,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
her to give her attendance on
the treasure of his Life; he bid her
prepare all things as magnificent as
she could in that Apartment he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
her, which was very rich and
gay, and towards a fine Garden:
The Hangings and Beds all glorious,
and fitter for a Monarch than a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
the finest Pictures the World
afforded, Flowers in-laid with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and Ivory, guilded Roofs, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Wainscot, Tables of Plate, with
all the rest of the moveables in the
Chambers of the same, all of great
value, and all was perfumed like an
Altar, or the Marriage-Bed of some
young King. Here <hi>Silvia</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56143:427"/>
to lodge, and hither <hi>Octavio</hi>
conducted her; and setting her on a
Couch while the Supper was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ready, he sits himself down by
her, and his heart being ready to
burst with Grief, at the thought of
the Claim which was laid to her by
<hi>Brilljard;</hi> he silently views her, while
Tears were ready to break from his
fix'd Eyes, and Sighs stopt what
he would fain have spoke: While
she (wholly confounded with Shame,
Guilt, and Disappointment (for she
could not imagine that <hi>Brilljard</hi>
could have had the Impudence to
have claim'd her for a Wife) fix'd
her fair. Eyes to Earth, and durst
not behold the languishing <hi>Octavio.</hi>
They remain'd thus a long time si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
she not daring to defend her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from a Crime, of which she
knew too well she was guilty, nor
he daring to ask her a Question to
which the Answer might prove so
fatal; he fears to know what he
dies to be satisfied in, and she fears
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56143:427"/>
to discover too late a Secret which
was the only one she had conceal'd
from him. <hi>Octavio</hi> runs over in his
Mind a thousand Thoughts that
perplex'd him, of the Probability
of her being married; he considers
how often he had found her with
that happy young Man, who more
freely entertain'd her than Servants
use to do: He now considers how
he has seen 'em once on a Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
when <hi>Silvia</hi> was in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of a yielding Mistress, and
<hi>Brilljard</hi> of a ravish'd Lover; he
considers how he has found 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
at Cards and Dice, and often
entertaining her with Freedoms of
a Husband, and how he wholly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
her Affairs, commanded her
Servants like their proper Master,
and was in full Authority of all.
These and a thousand more Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
confirms <hi>Octavio</hi> in all his
Fears: A thousand times she is about
to speak, but either fears to lose
<hi>Octavio</hi> by a clear Confession, or to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56143:428"/>
run herself into farther Error by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the matter of Fact, stops her
Words, and she only blushes and
sighs at what she dares not tell, and
if by chance their speaking Eyes
meet, they would both decline 'em
hastily again, as afraid to find there
what their Language could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.
Sometimes he would press her
Hand and sigh—<hi>Ah</hi> Silvia, <hi>you
have undone my Quiet;</hi> to which she
would return no Answer but Sigh;
and now rising from the Couch
she walk'd about the Chamber as
sad and silent as Death, attending
when he should have advanced in
speaking to her, tho' she dreads the
Voice she wishes to hear, and he
waits for her Reply, tho' the Mouth
that he adores should deliver Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Daggers to his Heart. While
thus they remained in the most si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and sad Entertainment (that
ever was between Lovers that had
so much to say) the Page, which
<hi>Octavio</hi> only trusts to wait, brought
him this Letter.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">

                           <hi>I</hi> am too sensible of my many high
Offences to your Lordship, and
have as much Penitence for my Sin
committed towards you as 'tis possible
to conceive; but when I implore a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
from a Lover, who by his own
Passion may guess at the violent Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of my dispairing Flame, I am
yet so vain to hope it. <hi>Antonett</hi> gave
me the Intelligence of your Design, and
raised me up to a Madness that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me to that Barbarity against your
unspotted Honour. I own the baseness
of the Fact, but Lovers are not, my
Lord, always guided by Rules of
Iustice and Reason; or if I had, <hi>I</hi>
should have kill'd the fair Adultress
that drew you to your Vndoing, and
who merits more your Hate than your
Regard; and who having first violated
her marriage Vow to me, with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56143:429"/>
would sacrifice us both to you,
and at the same time betray you to
a Marriage that cannot but prove fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to you, as it is most unlawful in
her; so that, my Lord, if I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
you, I have at the same time
saved you from a Sin and Ruin, and
humbly implore that you will suffer the
Good I have rendered you in the last,
to atone for the Ill I did you in the
first. If I have accused you of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against the State, it was to save
you from that of the too subtil and
too charming <hi>Silvia,</hi> which none but
myself could have snatcht you from:
'Tis true I might have acted something
more worthy of my Birth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but, my Lord, I knew the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Silvia,</hi> and if I should have
sent you the Knowledge of this, when
I sent the Warrant for the Security
of your Person, the haughty Creature
would have prevail'd above all my
Truths, with the Eloquence of Love,
and you had yielded and been betray'd
worse by her, than by the most unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56143:429"/>
Measures I took to prevent it:
Suffer this Reason, my Lord, to plead
for me in that Heart where <hi>Silvia</hi>
Reigns, and shews how powerful she is
every where. Pardon all the Faults
of a most unfortunate Man undone by
Love, and by your own guess what his
Passion would put him on who aims
or wishes at least for the intire Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of <hi>Silvia,</hi> tho' it was never
absolutely hop'd by</p>
                        <closer>
                           <signed>the most unfortunate

                           </signed>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>At the beginning of this Letter
<hi>Octavio</hi> hoped it contained the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his Fault in claiming <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>
he hop'd he would have own'd
it done in order to his Service to his
Lord, or his Love to <hi>Silvia,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing but what it really was;
but when he read on—and found
that he yet confirm'd his Claim, he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56143:430"/>
yeilded to all the Grief that could
sink a Heart over-burthen'd with
violent Love; he fell down on the
Couch were he was sate, and only
calling <hi>Silvia</hi> with a dying Groan,
he held out his Hand in which the
Letter remain'd, and look'd on her
with Eyes that languished with
Death, Love, and Dispair; while she
who already feared from whom it
came, received it with Disdain,
Shame, and Confusion: And <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
recovering a little—Cry'd in
a faint Voice—<hi>See Charming, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
Fair—see how much my Soul
adores you, when even this—can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
extinguish one spark of that Flame
you have kindled in my Soul:</hi> At this
she blush'd and bow'd with a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
modesty that was like to have
given the lie to all the Accusations
against her: She reads the Letter,
while he greedily fixes his Eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Face as she read, observing
with curious Search every Motion
there, all killing and adorable. He
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56143:430"/>
saw her Blushes sometimes rise, then
sink again to their proper Fountain,
her Heart; there swell and rise, and
beat against her Breast that had no
other Covering than a thin Shirt,
for all her Bosom was open, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
the nimble Motions of her
Heart. Her Eyes sometimes would
sparkle with Disdain, and glow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fatal tell-tale Lines; and
sometimes languish with excess of
Grief: But having concluded the
Letter, she laid it on the Table and
began again to traverse the Room,
her Head declined, and her Arms
across her Bosom. <hi>Octavio</hi> made too
true an Interpretation of this Silence,
and Calm in <hi>Silvia,</hi> and no longer
doubted his Fate. He fixes his Eyes
eternally upon her, while she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
what she shall say to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Lover; she find's <hi>Philander</hi>
lost, or if he ever return, 'tis not to
Love, so that he was for ever gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for too well she knew no Arts,
Obligations, or Industry, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56143:431"/>
a flying a <hi>Cupid:</hi> She found if
even that, could return, his whole
Fortune was so exausted he could
not support her; and that she was
of a Nature so haughty and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of Injuries, that she could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forgive him those Affronts he
had done her Honour first, and now
her Love; she resolves no Law or
Force shall submit her to <hi>Brilljard;</hi>
she finds this Fallacy she has put
on <hi>Octavio,</hi> has ruined her Credit in
his Esteem, at least she justly fears
it; so that believing herself aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by all in a strange Country,
she fell to weeping her Fate, and
the Tears wet the Floor as she
walk'd: At which Sight so melting,
<hi>Octavio</hi> starts from the Couch, and
catching her in his trembling Arms,
he cry'd, <hi>be false, be cruel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful;
yet still I must, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to Adore you</hi>—This being
spoken in so hearty and resolved a
Tone, from a Man, of whose Heart
she was so sure, and knew to be so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56143:431"/>
generous, gave her a little Courage
—and like sinking Men she catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
at all that presents her any Hope
of escaping. She resolves by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the whole Truth to save that

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast Stake, his Heart, tho' she could
pretend to no more; and taking the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ainting Lover by the Hand, she leads
him to the Couch: <hi>Well,</hi> said she,
Octavio, <hi>you are too generous to be
impos'd on in any thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will tell you my Heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reserve as absolutely as to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it self, if I were interceeding my
last Peace there.</hi> She begg'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pardons of him for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
any part of her Story from
him, but she could no longer be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that Crime, to a Man for
whom she had so perfect a Passion;
and as she spoke she imbraced him
with an unresistable Softness that
wholly charm'd him: She reconciles
him with every Touch, and sighs
on his Bosom a thousand grateful
Vows and Excuses for her Fault,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56143:432"/>
while he weeps with Love, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Expires in her Arms; she is
not able to see his Passion and his
Grief, and tells him she will do all
things for his Repose. <hi>Ah</hi> Silvia,
sigh'd he, <hi>talk not of my Repose, when
you confess your self Wife to one, and
Mistress to another, in either of which
I have alass no part: Ah, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
for the Vnfortunate</hi> Octavio,
<hi>when two happy Lovers divide the
Treasure of his Soul! Yet tell me
Truth, because it will look like Love;
shew me that excellent Vertue, so rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found in all your fickle Sex. Oh!
tell me Truth, and let me know how
much my Heart can bear before it
break with Love; and yet perhaps to
hear thee speak to me, with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating
dear Voice of thine, may save
me from the Terror of thy Words;
and tho' each make a Wound, their
very Accents have a Balm to heal!
Oh, quickly pour it then into my list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
Soul, and I'll be silent, as o'er
ravished Lovers, whom Ioys have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56143:432"/>
charm'd to tender Sighs and Pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
At this, imbracing her anew,
he let fall a Shower of Tears upon
her Bosom, and sighing Cry'd—
<hi>Now I attend thy Story:</hi> She then
began anew the Repetition of the
Loves between herself and <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
which she slightly ran over,
because he had already heard every
Circumstance of it, both from her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and <hi>Philander;</hi> till she arriv'd to
that part of it where she left <hi>Belsont,</hi>
her Fathers House: <hi>Thus far,</hi> said
she, <hi>you have had a faithful Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
And I was no sooner miss'd by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
my Parent, but you may imagine the
diligent Search that would be made,
both by</hi> Foscario, <hi>whom I was to have
married the next day, and my tender
Parents; but all Search, all</hi> Hu-an-Crys
<hi>were vain; at last they put me
into the weekly</hi> Gazette, <hi>describing me
to the very Features of my Face, my
Hair, my Breast, my Stature, Youth
and Beauty, omitting nothing that
might render me apparent to all that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56143:433"/>
should see me, offering vast Sums to
any that should give Intelligence of
such a lost Maid of Quality.</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
<hi>who understood too well the
Nature of the common People, and
that they would betray their very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for such a proferr'd Sum, durst
trust me no longer to their Mercy:
His Affairs were so involved with
those of</hi> Caesario, <hi>he could not leave</hi>
Paris; <hi>for they every Moment expected
the People should rise against their
King, and these Glorious Chiefs of the
Faction were obliged to wait and watch
the Motions of the dirty Croud. Nor
durst he trust me in any place from
him, for he could not live a Day
without me.</hi> At that Thought she
sigh'd, and then went on: <hi>so that
I was oblig'd to remain obscurely lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in</hi> Paris, <hi>where now I durst no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
trust myself, tho' disguis'd in as
many Shapes as I was obliged to have
Lodgings. At last we were betray'd,
and had only the short Notice given
us to yield or secure our selves from
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56143:433"/>
the hand of Iustice by the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when they design'd to surprize us:
To escape we found almost impossible,
and very hazardous to attempt it; so
that</hi> Philander, <hi>who was raving with
his Fear, call'd myself and this young
Gentleman,</hi> Brilljard, <hi>(then Master of
his Horse) and one that had serv'd
us faithfully through the whole Course
of our Loves) to Councel: Many
things were in vain debated, but at
last this hard Shift was found out,
of marrying me to</hi> Brilljard, <hi>for to</hi>
Philander <hi>it was impossible; so that
no Authority of a Father could take
me from the Husband. I was at first
extreamly unwilling, but when</hi> Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>told me it was to be only a mock-Marriage,
to secure me to himself, I
was reconcil'd to it, and more, when
I found the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inite Submission of the
young Man, who vow'd he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look up to me with the Eyes of
a Lover or Husband, but in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Lord did it to preserve me
intirely for him: Nay further, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56143:434"/>
my future Fear, he confest to me
he was already privately married to
a Gentlewoman, by whom he had two
Children. Oh—tell me true my</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
<hi>Was he married to another?</hi>
Cry'd out the over-joy'd Lover. <hi>Yes,
on my Life,</hi> reply'd <hi>Silvia; for when
it was proved in Court that I was
married to</hi> Brilljard, <hi>(as at last I was,
and innocently Beded) this Lady came
and brought her Children to me, and
falling at my Feet, wept and implor'd
I would not own her Husband, for on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
she had right to him; we all were
fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ced to discover to her the truth of
the Matter, and that he had only mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me to secure me from the Rage
of my Parents; that if he were her
Husband, she was still as intirely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of him as ever, and that he had
advanc'd her Fortune in what he had
done, for she should have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
with those Advantages that
should make her Life, and that of her
Children more Comfortable; and</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
<hi>making both her and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56143:434"/>
considerable Presents, sent her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
very well satisfied. After this,
before People, we used him to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Freedoms, but when alone, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Respect intire; however
this us'd him to something more
Familiarity than formerly, and he
gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w to be more a Companion than a
Servant, as indeed we desired he should;
and of late have found him more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptious
than usual: And thus much
more I must confess, I have reason to
believe him a most passionate Lover, and
have lately found he had Designs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, as you well know.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudge now, oh dear</hi> Octavio, <hi>how
unfortunate I am; yet judge too, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ought to esteem this a Marriage,
or him a Husband: No,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
more briskly than before, <hi>nor
can he by the Laws of God or Man,
pretend to such a Blessing, and you may
be divorc'd.</hi> Pleas'd with this Thought,
he soon assum'd his native Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Joy and Softness, and making
a thousand new Vows that he would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56143:435"/>
perform all he had sworn on his
part; and imploring and pressing
her to renew those she had made
to him, she obeys him; she makes
a thousand grateful Returns, and
they pass the Evening the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
that ever Lovers did. By this
time Supper was served up, noble
and handsome; and after Supper he
led her to his Closet, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
her with Jewels and other
Rareties of great Value, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing that might oblige an
Avaritious designing Woman, if <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
had been such; nor any thing
that might beget Love and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in the most insensible Heart:
And all he did and all he gave was
with a peculiar Grace, in which there
lies as great an Obligation, as in the
Gift it self: The handsom way of
giving being an Art so rarely known,
even to the most Generous. In these
happy and glorious Moments of
Love, wherein the Lover omitted
nothing that could please, <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56143:435"/>
was almost forgotten, for 'tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for Love to beget Love, and
Inconstancy its Likeness, or Disdain:
And we must conclude <hi>Silvia</hi> a
Maid wholly insensible, if she had
not been touch'd with Tenderness,
and even Love it self, at all these
extravagant marks of Passion in
<hi>Octavio;</hi> and it must be confess'd, she
was of a Nature soft and apt for
Impression; she was, in a word, a
Woman. She had her Vanities, and
her little Fevibleses, and lov'd to see
Adorers at her Feet, especially those
in whom all things, all Graces,
Charms of Youth, Wit and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
agreed to form for Love and
Conquest: She naturally lov'd Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Dominion; and it was her
Maxim, That never any Woman
was displeased to find she could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
Desire.</p>
                  <p>'Twas thus they liv'd with unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
Joys, no Spies to pry upon
their Actions, no false Friends to
censure their real Pleasures, no Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56143:436"/>
to poyson their true Content,
no Parents to give Bounds or grave
Rules to the distruction of nobler
lavish Love; but all the Day was
past in new Delights, and every
Day produc'd a thousand Pleasures;
and even the Thoughts of Revenge
were no more remembred on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side; it lessen'd in <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
Heart, as Love advanced there, and
her Resentment against <hi>Philander</hi>
was lost in her growing Passion for
<hi>Octavio:</hi> And sure if any Woman
had Excuses for Loving and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
the most Wise and Prudent
must allow 'em now to <hi>Silvia;</hi> and
if she had Reason for Loving, 'twas
now, for what she paid the most
deserving of his Sex, and whom she
managed with that Art of Loving
(if there be Art in Love) that she
gain'd every Minute upon his Heart,
and he became more and more her
Slave, the more he found he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd:
In spight of all <hi>Brilljard</hi>'s
Pretention he would have married
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56143:436"/>
her, but durst not do it while he
remain'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> because of the
Noise <hi>Brilljard</hi>'s Claim had made;
and he fear'd the Displeasure of his
Uncle, but waited for a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
time, when he could settle his
Affairs so as to remove her into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> tho' he could not tell how
to accomplish that without ruining
his Interest: These Thoughts alone
took up his time whenever he was
absent from <hi>Silvia,</hi> and would often
give him abundance of Trouble, for
he was given over to his Wish of
possessing <hi>Silvia,</hi> and could not live
without her; he lov'd too much,
and thought and consider'd too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
These were his eternal Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
when from the lovely
Object of his Desire, which was as
seldom as possible, for they were
both unwilling to part; tho' Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Rest required it, a thousand
soft things would hinder him, and
make her willing to retain him;
and tho' they were to meet again
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56143:437"/>
next Morning, they grudge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the parting Hours, and the
Repose of Nature. He longs and
languishes for the blessed Moment
that shall give him to the Arms of
the ravishing <hi>Silvia,</hi> and she finds
but too much yielding on her part,
in some of those silent lone Hours,
when Love was most prevailing,
and feeble Mortals most apt to be
overcome by that insinuating God;
so that tho' <hi>Octavio</hi> could not ask
what he sigh'd and dy'd for; tho'
he resolv'd he would not press her,
tho' for the Safety of his Life, for
any Favours; and tho', on the other
side, <hi>Silvia</hi> resolv'd she would not
grant, no, tho' mutual Vows had
passed, tho' Love within pleaded,
and almost unresistible Beauties and
Inducements without, tho' all the
Powers of Love, of Silence, Night,
and Opportunity, tho' on the very
Point a thousand times of yielding,
she had resisted all: But oh! one
Night; let it not rise up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56143:437"/>
against her, you bashful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Maids, who never yet try'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
powerful Minute; nor you chast
Wives, who give no Opportunities:
One night—they lost themselves
in Dalliance, forgot how very near
they were to yielding, and with
imperfect Transports found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
half dead with Love, clasp'd
in each others Arms, betray'd by
soft Degrees of Joy, to all they wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> would be too Amorous to
tell you more; to tell you all that
Night, that happy Night produc'd;
let it suffice that <hi>Silvia</hi> yielded all,
and made <hi>Octavio</hi> happier than a
God. At first he found her wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in his Arms, raving on what
she had unconsideringly done; and
with her soft Reproaches chiding her
ravished Lover, who lay sighing by,
unable to reply any other way, he
held her fast in those Arms that
trembled, yet with Love and new-past
Joy; he found a Pleasure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in her Railing, with a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56143:438"/>
that spoke more Love than
any other Language Love could
speak. Betwixt his Sighs he pleads
his Right of Love, and the Authority
of his solemn Vows; he tells her
that the Marriage Ceremony was
but contrived to satisfy the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and to proclaim his Title to
the Crowd, but Vows and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
were the same to Heaven:
He speaks—and she believes; and
well she might, for all he spoke was
honourable Truth. He knew no
Guile, but uttered all his Soul, and
all that Soul was Honest, Just, and
Brave; thus by degrees he brought
her to a Calm.</p>
                  <p>In this soft Rancounter he had
discovered a thousand new Charms
in <hi>Silvia;</hi> and contrary to those
Men, whose end of Love is Lust
(which extinguish together) <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
found increase of Tenderness
from every Bliss she gave; and grew
at last so fond—so doating on the
still more charming Maid, that he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56143:438"/>
neglected all his Interest, his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the State, and what he ow'd
his Uncle, and his Friends, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the common Theam over all
the United Provinces, for his Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
and Luxury, as they were
pleased to call it; and living so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Humour of those more
sordid and slovenly Men of Quality,
which make up the Nobility of that
parcel of the World. For while
thus he lived retired, scarce visiting
any one, or permitting any to visit
him, they charge him with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crimes of having given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
over to Effeminacy; as indeed
he grew too Lazy in her Arms;
neglecting Glory, Arms, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for the more real Joys of Life;
while she even Rifles him with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy;
and grows so bold and
hardy, that regarding not the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the stingy censorious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his Interest, or her own Fame,
she is seen every day in his Coaches
going to take the Air out of Town;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56143:439"/>
puts him upon Balls, and vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive
Treats; devises new Projects
and ways of Diversion, till some of
the more busie Impertinents of the
Town made a publick Complaint
to his Uncle, and the rest of the
<hi>States,</hi> urging he was a Scandal to
the Reverend and Honourable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
On which it was decreed
that he should either lose that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or take up, and live more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gravity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of a Senator: This Incenses <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian,</hi>
both against the States and
his Nephew; for tho' he had often
reproved and counselled him, yet he
scorn'd his Darling should be school'd
by his Equals in Power. So that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
either to discard him, or
draw him from the Love of this
Woman; he one Morning goes to
his Nephews House, and sending
him up word by his Page he would
speak to him, he was conducted to
his Chamber, where he found him
in his Night-Gown: He began to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56143:439"/>
upbraid him, first with his want of
Respect and Duty to him, and next,
of his Affairs, neglecting to give
his Attendance on the Publick: He
tells him he is become a Scandal to
the Common-Wealth, and that he
liv'd a lude Life with another Man's
Wife: He tells him he has all her
Story, and she was not only a Wife,
but a scandalous Mistress too to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander.
She boasts,</hi> says he, <hi>of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Birth, but what's that,
when her Conduct is Infamous? In
short, Sir,</hi> continued he, <hi>your Life
is obnoxious to the whole Province:
Why, what Sir—cannot honest
Men's Daughters</hi> (cry'd he, more
angerly) <hi>serve your turn, but you
must crack a Commandment? Why,
this is flat Adultery: A little Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a civil way, might have been
allow'd, but this is stark naught. In
fine Sir, quit me this Woman, and
quit her me presently; or, in the first
place, I renounce thee, cast thee from
me as a Stranger, and will leave thee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56143:440"/>
to Ruine, and the incensed States. A
little Pleasure—a little Recreation,
I can allow: A Layer of Love, and a
Layer of Business—But to neglect
the Nation for a Wench, is flat Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against the State; and I wish
there were a Law against all such unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Whore-Masters—that are
States-Men—for the rest 'tis no
great matter. Therefore in a Word,
Sir, leave me off this Mistress of
yours, or we will secure her yet for a</hi>
French <hi>Spy, that comes to debauch
our Common-Wealths-Men—The
States can do it Sir, they can—</hi>
Hitherto <hi>Octavio</hi> received all with
Blush and Bow, in sign of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but when his Uncle told him
the <hi>States</hi> would send away his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss;
no longer able to contain his
Rage, he broke out into all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
imaginable against them, and
swore he would not now forego <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
to be Monarch over all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
Provinces, and 'twas a greater
Glory to be a Slave at her Feet.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56143:440"/>
                     <hi>Go, tell your States,</hi> cry'd he—<hi>They
are a company of Cynical Fops, born
to moyl on in sordid Business, who
never were worthy to understand so
great a Happiness of Life, as that
of nobler Love. Tell 'em, I scorn
the dull Gravity of those Asses of
the Common-Wealth, fit only to bear
the dirty Load of State-Affairs, and
die old busie Fools.</hi> The Uncle, who
little expected such a Return from
him who used to be all Obedience,
began more gently to perswade him
with more solid Reason, but could
get no other Answer from him, than
that what he commanded he should
find it Difficult to disobey; and so for
that time they parted. Some days
after (he never coming so much as
near their Councils) they sent for
him, to answer the Contempt: He
came and received abundance of hard
Reproaches, and finding they were
resolved to Degrade him, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
rallied them in Answer to all
they said; nor could all the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56143:441"/>
of his Friends perswade him to
any Submission, after receiving so
rough and ill-bred a Treatment as
they gave him: And impatient to
return to <hi>Silvia,</hi> where all his Joys
were Centered, he was with much
a-do perswaded to stay and hear the
Resolution of the Council, which
was to take from him those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
he held amongst them; at
which he cock'd and smil'd, and
told 'em he receiv'd what he was
much more proud of than of those
useless Trifles they call'd Honours;
and wishes they might treat all that
served them at that ungrateful Rate:
For he that had received a hundred
Wounds, and lost a Stream of Blood
for their Security, shall, if he kiss
their Wives against their Wills, be
banish'd like a Coward. So hasting
from the Council, he got into his
Coach, and went to <hi>Silvia.</hi> This
incensed the old Gentlemen to a high
Degree, and they carried it against
the younger Party. (because more in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56143:441"/>
Number) That this <hi>French</hi> Lady,
who was for high-Treason, as they
call'd it, forc'd to fly <hi>France,</hi> should
be no longer protected in <hi>Holland:</hi>
And in order to her Removal, or
rather their Revenge on <hi>Octavio,</hi>
they sent out their Warrant to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
her; and either to send her
as an Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> or force her
to some other part of the World.
For a day or two <hi>Sebastian</hi>'s Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
prevailed for the stoping the
Warrant; believing he should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring his Nephew to some
Submission, which when he found
in vain, he betook himself to his
Chamber, and refused any Visits or
Diversions: By this time <hi>Octavio</hi>'s ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
the <hi>States</hi> was become the
Jest of the Town, and all the Sparks
laugh'd at them as they past, and
Lampoon'd 'em to damnable <hi>Dutch</hi>
Tunes, which so highly incens'd
'em that they sent immediately and
serv'd the Warrant on <hi>Silvia,</hi> whom
they surpriz'd in <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Coach,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56143:442"/>
as she was coming from taking the
Air. You may imagine what an
Agony of Trouble and Grief our
generous and surpriz'd Lover was
in: It was in vain to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
and he who before would
not have submitted to have sav'd his
Life, to the <hi>States,</hi> now for the
Preservation of one moments Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to <hi>Silvia,</hi> he was ready to go
and fall at their Feet, kiss their
Shooes, and implore their Pity. He
first accompanies her to the House
of the Messenger, where he only is
permitted to behold her with Eyes
of dying Love, and unable to say
any thing to her, left her with such
Gifts, and Charge, to the Messengers
Care, as might oblige him to treat
her well; While <hi>Silvia,</hi> less sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
bid him, at going from her,
not to afflict himself for any thing
she suffered; she found it was the
Malice of the pevish old Magistrates,
and that the most they could do to
her, was to send her from him:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56143:442"/>
This last she spoke with a Sigh, that
pierced his Heart more sensibly than
ever any thing yet had done; and
he only reply'd (with a Sigh) No
Silvia, <hi>no rigid Power on Earth shall
ever be able to deprive you of my eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Adoration, or to separate me one
Moment from</hi> Silvia, <hi>after she is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to leave this ungrateful place,
and whose Departure I will hasten all
that I can, since the Land is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of so great a Blessing.</hi> So lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her for a little Space, he hasted
to his Uncle, whom he found very
much discontented: He throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at his Feet, and assails him with
all the moving Eloquence of Sighs
and Tears; in vain was all, in vain
alas he pleads. From this he flies
to Rage—and says all a distracted
Lover could power forth to ease a
tortured Heart; what Divinity did
he not provoke? Wholly regardless
even of Heaven and Man, he made
a publick Confession of his Passion,
deny'd her being married to <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:56143:443"/>
and weeps as he protests her
Innocence: He kneels again, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
and begs anew, and made
the movingest Moan that ever
touched a Heart, but could receive
no other Return but Threats and
Frowns: The old Gentleman had
never been in Love since he was
born, no not enough to marry, but
bore and unaccountable Hate to the
whole Sex, and therefore was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyless
to all he could say on the
Score of Love; tho' he endeavours
to soften him by a thousand things
more dear to him. <hi>For my Sake,
Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>if ever my soft Pleawere
grateful to you, when all your
Ioy was in the young</hi> Octavio; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,
release, the charming</hi> Silvia; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
her tender Youth, her blooming
Beauty, her timorous helpless Sex, her
noble Quality, and save her from the
rude Assaults of Power—Oh save
the Lovely Maid!</hi> This he uttered
with interrupting Sighs and Tears,
which fell upon the Floor as he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56143:443"/>
the Obdurate on his Knees: At
last Pity touch'd his Heart, and he
said—<hi>Spare, Sir, the Character of
your inchanting</hi> Circe; <hi>for I have
heard too much of her, and what Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
she has bred in</hi> France; <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning
her Honour, betraying a
vertuous Sister, defaming her Noble
Parents, and ruining an Illustrious
young Noble Man, who was both her
Brother and her Lover. This Sir,
in short, is the Character of your
Beauteous Innocent. Alas Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Octavio, you never saw this
Maid! or if you had, you would not
be so cruel. Go to, Sir,</hi> reply'd the
old Gentleman, <hi>I am not so soon
softened at the sight of Beauty. But
do but see her, Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octavio,
and then perhaps you will be charm'd
like me—You are a Fop, Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Sebastian, and if you would have
me allow any Favour to your inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Lady, you must promise me first
to abandon her, and marry the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Monsieur—who is vastly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56143:444"/>
Rich, and whom I have so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to you, she loves you too;
and tho' she be not fair, she has the
best Fortune of any Lady in the</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands.
<hi>On these Terms, Sir, I am
for a Reconciliation with you, and will
immediately go and deliver the fair
Prisoner, and she shall have her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to go or stay, or do what she
please—and now, Sir, you know my
Will and Pleasure—Octavio</hi> found
it vain to pursue him any further
with his Petitions; only reply'd it
was wonderous hard and cruel. To
which the old one reply'd; <hi>'Tis
what must be done, I have resolved it,
or my Estate, in value, above two
hundred thousand Pounds, shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of to your Sister, the Countess
of</hi> Clarinau: And this he ended with
an Execration on himself if he did
not do; and he was a Man that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
was just to his Word.</p>
                  <p>Much more to this ungrateful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
he spoke, and <hi>Octavio</hi> had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to all the Dissimulation his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56143:444"/>
generous Soul was capable of; and
'twas the first base thing, and sure
the last, that ever he was guilty of.
He promises his Uncle to obey all
his Commands and Injunctions, since
he would have it so; and only beg'd
he might be permitted but one
Visit, to take his last Leave of her:
This was at first refused, but at last;
provided he might hear what he
said to her, he would suffer him to
go: <hi>For,</hi> said the crafty old Man
(who knew too well the Cunning
of Youth) <hi>I will have no Tricks put
upon me; I will not be outwitted by a
young Knave:</hi> This was the worst
part of all; he knew, if he alone
could speak with her, they might
have contriv'd, by handsome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Flattery, to have accomplish'd
their Design, which was; <hi>first,</hi> by
the Authority of the old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to have freed her from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement;
and next, to have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Affairs in the best Posture
he could; and without valuing his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56143:445"/>
Uncle's Fortune, his own being grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he resolv'd to go with her into
<hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> but his going with
him to visit her would prevent what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they might resolve: But since
the Liberty of <hi>Silvia</hi> was first to be
considered, he resolves—since it
must be so, and leaves the rest to Time
and his good Fortune. <hi>Well then, Sir,</hi>
said <hi>Octavio, since you have resolv'd
your self, to be a Witness of those
melancholy things, I shall possibly say
to her, let us haste to end the great
Affair—Hang it,</hi> Cry'd <hi>Sebastian,
if I go I shall abuse the young Hussie,
or commit some Indecency that will
not be suitable to good Manners—
I hope you will, not Sir</hi>—reply'd
<hi>Octavio—Whip 'em, whip 'em,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
the Uncle, <hi>I hate the young
cozening Baggages, that wander about
the World undoing young extravagant
Coxcombes; gots so, they are naught,
stark-naught—Be sure you dispatch
as soon as you can, and—do you
hear—let's have no Whineing.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56143:445"/>
Octavio</hi> overjoy'd he should have
her released to Night, promised la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly
all he was urged to; and his
own Coach being at the Gate, they
both went immediately to the House
of the Messenger; and all the way
the old Gentleman did nothing but
rail against the Vices of the Age, and
the Sins of Villainous Youth; the
Snares of Beauty, and the Danger
of witty Women; and of how ill
Consequences these were to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth.
He said, if he were
to make Laws, he would confine all
young Women to Monasteries,
where they should never see Man
till Forty, and then come out and
marry for Generation sake, no more:
For his part he had never seen that
Beauty yet that could inspire him
with that silly thing call'd Love;
and wonder'd what the Devil ail'd all
the young Fellows of this Age,
that they talk'd of nothing else: At
this rate they discoursed till they
arrived at the Prison, and calling for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56143:446"/>
the Messenger, he conducted them
both to the Chamber of the fair Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
who was laid on a Couch,
near which stood a Table with two
Candles, which gave a great Light
to that part of the Room, and made
<hi>Silvia</hi> appear more fair than ever,
if possible. She had not that day
been dress'd but in a rich Night-Gown,
and Cornets of the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Fashion: At his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
she blush'd (with a secret
Joy, which never had possessed her
Soul for him before) and spread a
thousand Beauties round her fair Face:
She was leaping with a transported
Pleasure to his Arms, when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an old Grave Person follow
him into the Room: At which she
reassum'd a Strangeness, a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Languishment, which charm'd
no less than her Gayety. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
'em with a modest Grace
in her beautiful Eyes; and by the
Reception <hi>Octavio</hi> gave her, she found
that reverend Person was his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56143:446"/>
or at least some body of
Authority; and therefore assuming
a Gravity unusual, she received 'em
with all the Ceremony due to their
Quality: And first she address'd
herself to the old Gentleman, who
stood gazing at her, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
at which she was a little out
of Countenance. When <hi>Octavio</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it, approach'd his Uncle, and
cry'd, <hi>Sir, This is the Lady—Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian</hi>
starting as from a Dream,
cry'd—<hi>Pardon me, Madam, I am
a Fellow whom Age hath rendered less
Ceremonious than Youth: I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet been so happy as to have been
used to a fair Lady; Women never
took up one Minute of my more perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
time, but I have been a Satyr
upon the whole Sex: And if my
Treatment of you be rougher than your
Birth and Beauty Merits, I beseech
you—fair Creature, pardon it, since
I am come in order to do you Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Silvia.</hi> (blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Anger at the Presence of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56143:447"/>
a Man who had contributed to the
having brought her to that place)
<hi>I cannot but wonder at this sudden
Change of Goodness, in a Person to
whom I am indebted for part of my
Misfortune, and which I shall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
esteem as such, since it has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
me a Happiness, and an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to which I could no other way
have arrived.</hi> This last she spoke
with usual insinuating Charms; the
little Affectation of the Voice swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
to all the Tenderness it was
possible to put on, and so easy and
natural to <hi>Silvia:</hi> And if before the
old Gentleman were seized with
some unusual Pleasure, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he never felt about his icy and
insensible Heart, and which now
began to thaw at the Fire of her
Eyes—I say, if before he were
surprized with looking, what was he
when she spoke—with a Voice so
soft, and an Air so bewitching? He
was all Eyes and Ears, and had use
of no other Sense but what inform'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56143:447"/>
tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e: He gazes upon her, as if
he waited and listen'd what she
would farther say; and she stood
waiting for his Reply, till asham'd,
she turn'd her Eyes into her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
and knew not how to proceed.
<hi>Octavio</hi> views both by turns, and
knows not how to begin the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
again, it being his Uncle's
Cue to speak: But finding him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
mute—he steps to him,
and gently pull'd him by the Sleeve
—but finds no Motion in him;
he speaks to him, but in vain, for
he could hear nothing but <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
charming Voice; nor saw nothing
but her lovely Face, nor attended
any thing but when she would speak
again, and look that way. At this
<hi>Octavio</hi> smil'd, and taking his Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
by the Hand, he led her nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
her admiring Adversary; whom
she approach'd with Modesty and
Sweetness in her Eyes, that the old
Fellow having never before beheld
the like Vision was wholly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56143:448"/>
and his old Heart burnt in
the Socket, which being his last
Blaze made the greater Fire. <hi>Fine
Lady,</hi> cry'd he—<hi>or rather fine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
how is it I shall expiate for a
Barbarity that nothing could be guilty
of but the Brute, who had not learn'd
Humanity from your Eyes: What A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
can I make for my Sin;
and how shall I be punished? Sir,</hi>
reply'd <hi>Silvia, if I can merit your
Esteem and Assistance, to deliver me
from this cruel Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inement, I shall
think of what's past as a Ioy, since
it renders me worthy of your Pity
and Compassion. To answer you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
were to hold you under this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Roof too long; therefore let me
convince you of my Service, by leading
you to a Place more fit for so fair a
Person.</hi> And calling for the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
he ask'd him if he would
take his Bail for his fair Prisoner;
who reply'd, <hi>Your Lordship may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all things:</hi> So throwing him a
little Purse, about thirty Pounds in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56143:448"/>
Gold, he bid him drink the Ladies
Health; and without more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or talk, led her to the Coach;
and never so much as asking her
whether she would go, insensibly
carries her, where he had amind to
have her, to his own House: This
was a little Affliction to <hi>Octavio,</hi>
who nevertheless durst not say any
thing to his Uncle, nor so much as
to ask him the Reason why: But
being arrived all thither, he conducts
her into a very fair Apartment, and
bade her there command that World
he could command for her: He
gave her there a very magnificent
Supper, and all three supp'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Octavio</hi> and <hi>Silvia</hi> still won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what would be the Issue of
this Business; for <hi>Octavio</hi> could not
imagine that his Uncle, who was
a single Man, and a grave Senator,
one fam'd for a Woman-Hater, a
great Railer at the Vices of young
Men, should keep a fair young single
Woman in his House: But it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56143:449"/>
late, and no Preparation for her
Departing, she took the Courage to
say—<hi>Sir, I am so extreamly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to you, and have received so
great a Favour from you, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flatter myself 'tis for any Vertue
in me, or meerly out of Compassion to
my Sex, that you have done this; but
for somebody's Sake to whom I am
more enjaged than I am aware of;
and when you pass'd your Parole for
my Liberty, I am not so vain to think
it was for my Sake; therefore pray
inform me, Sir, how I can pay this
Debt, and to whom, and who it is
you require should be bound for me,
to save you harmless. Madam,</hi> cry'd
<hi>Sebastian, tho' there need no greater
Security than your own Innocence, yet
least that Innocence should not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to guard you from the Outrage
of a People approaching to Savages,
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mine, that you will make this House
your Sanctuary; my Power can save
you from impending Harms, and all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56143:449"/>
that I call mine, you shall command.</hi> At
this she blushing bow'd, but durst
not make Reply to contradict him:
She knew at least that there she was
safe, and well, free from Fear of
the Tyranny of the rest, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apprehension: 'Tis true she
found by the Shyness of <hi>Octavio</hi>
towards her before his Uncle, that
she was to manage her Amour
with him by stealth, till they could
contrive matters more to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
She therefore finding she
should want nothing, but as much
of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Conversation as she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired;
she begg'd he would give
her Leave to write a Note to her
Page, who was a faithful sober
Youth, to bring her Jewels, and
what things she had of Value, to
her, which she did, and received
those and her Servants together,
who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound a perfect Welcome to
the old Lover; but <hi>Antonett</hi> had like
to have lost her Place, but that
<hi>Octavio</hi> pleaded for her, and she her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56143:450"/>
confessing 'twas Love to the false
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> that made her do that
foolish thing (in which she vow'd
she thought no harm, tho' it was
like to have cost so dear) she was
again received into Favour: So that
for some Days <hi>Silvia</hi> found herself
very much at her Ease with the old
Gentleman, and had no want of any
thing but <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Company: But
she had the Pleasure to find by his
Eyes and Sighs he wanted hers more:
He dy'd every day, and his fair
Face faded like falling Roses: Still
she was gay; for if she had it not
about her, she assumed it to keep
him in Heart: she was not displeased
to see the old Man on Fire too, and
fancied some Diversion from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue:
But he concealed his Passion
all he could, both to hide it from his
Nephew, and because he knew not
what he ail'd: A strange change
he found, a wonderous Disorder in
Nature, but could not give a Name
to it, nor Sigh aloud for fear he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56143:450"/>
should be heard, and lose his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
especially for this Woman, on
whom he had rail'd so lavishly. One
day therefore, after a Night of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
very incommode to his Age, he
takes <hi>Octavio</hi> into the Garden alone,
telling him he had a great Secret to
impart to him. <hi>Octavio</hi> guessing
what it might be, put his Heart in
as good order as he could to receive
it: He at least knew the worst was
but for him at last to steal <hi>Silvia</hi>
from him, if he should be weak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to doat on the young Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and therefore resolv'd to hear
with patience. But if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to attend, the other was not
prepared to begin, and so both walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many silent Turns about the
Garden. <hi>Sebastian</hi> had a-mind to
ask a thousand Questions of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
who he found, ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gre all his
Vows of deserting <hi>Silvia,</hi> had no
power of doing it: He had a-mind
to urge him to marry the Widow,
but durst not now press it, tho' he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56143:451"/>
used to do so, least he should take it
for Jealousy in him; nor durst he
now forbid him seeing her, least
he should betray the Secrets of his
Soul: He began every Moment to
love him le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, as he loved <hi>Silvia</hi>
more, and beholds him as an Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to his Repose, nay his very
Life. At last the old Man (who
thought if he brought his Nephew
forth under pretence of a Secret, and
said nothing to him, it would have
look'd ill) began to speak. <hi>Octavio,</hi>
said he, <hi>I have hitherto found you so
just in all you have said, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>were
a Sin to doubt you, in what relates
to</hi> Silvia. <hi>You have told me she is
nobly Born; and you have with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Imprecations convinced me she is
Vertuous; and lastly, you have sworn
she was not Married</hi>—At this he
sigh'd and paus'd, and left <hi>Octavio</hi>
trembling with Fear of the Result:
A thousand times he was like to have
denyed all, but durst not defame the
most sacred Idol of his Soul: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56143:451"/>
he thought his Uncle would
be generous, and think it fit to give
him <hi>Silvia;</hi> but that Thought was
too Seraphick to remain a Moment
in his Heart. <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octavio,
I own I said so of</hi> Silvia, <hi>and hope
no Action she has committed since she
had a Protection under your Roof has
contradicted any thing I said. No,</hi>
said <hi>Sebastian,</hi> sighing—and pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
as loath to speak more: <hi>Sir,</hi>
said <hi>Octavio, I suppose this is not the
Secret you had to impart to me, for
which you separate me to this lonely
Walk; fear not to trust me with it,
whatever it be, for I am so intirely
your own, that I will grant, submit,
prostrate myself, and give up all my
Will, Power, and Faculties to your
Interest or Designs.</hi> This incouraged
the old Lover, who reply'd—
<hi>Tell me on Truth,</hi> Octavio, <hi>which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of you, and I will desire no
more—Have not you had the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of this fair Maid?</hi> You ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
me: Now it it was that he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56143:452"/>
fear'd what Design the Amorous
old Gentleman had in his Head and
Heart; and was at a loss what to
say, whether to give him some Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
that he had known and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
her, and so prevent his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
on her; or by saying he had
not, to leave her Defenceless to his
Love. But on second Thoughts, he
could not resolve to say any thing
to the Disadvantage of <hi>Silvia,</hi> tho'
to save his own Life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
assured his Uncle he never durst
assume the Boldness to ask so rude
a Question of a Woman of her Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
And much more he spoke to
that purpose to convince him. That
'tis true he wou'd have Marry'd her,
if he cou'd have gain'd his consent;
maugre all the Scandal that the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
World had thrown upon her.
But since he was positive in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
for the Widow, he wou'd
bend his Mind to Obedience. <hi>In
that,</hi> replied Sabastian, <hi>you are Wise,
and I am glad all your Youthful Fires
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56143:452"/>
are blown over; and having once fixt
you in the World as I design, I have
resolved on an Affair</hi>—At this
again he paused—<hi>I am,</hi> says he,
<hi>in Love,</hi>—<hi>I think it is Love, or
that which you call so: I cannot eat nor
sleep, nor even pray, but this fair
Stranger interposes; or if by chance I
slumber, all my Dreams are of her;
I see her, I touch her, I imbrace her,
and find a Pleasure even then that all
my waking Thoughts cou'd never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me. If I go to the State House
I mind nothing there, my Heart's at
home with the Young Gentlewoman,
on the</hi> Change <hi>or wheresoever I go, my
restless Thoughts present her still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me: And prethee tell me, is not
this Love,</hi> Octavio? <hi>It may arrive to
Love,</hi> replied the blushing Youth,
<hi>if you shou'd fondly give way to it: But
you are Wise and Grave, and hate all
Women, Sir, till about Forty, and
then for Generation only: You are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Follies of vain Youth. And
let me tell you, Sir, without Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56143:453"/>
Already you are charged with a
Thousand little Vanities unsuitable to
your Years, and the Character you have
had, and the Figure you have made in
the World. I heard a Lampoon on you
the other day,—Pardon my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Sir, for keeping a Beauty in your
House, who they are pleased to say was
my Mistress before.</hi> And pulling out
a Lampoon, which his Page had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given him, he gave it his Uncle.
But instead of making him resolve to
quit <hi>Silvia,</hi> it only serv'd to incense
him against <hi>Octavio;</hi> he rail'd at all
Wits, and swore there was not a more
dangerous Enemy to a civil, sober
Commonwealth: That a Poet was
to be banish'd as a Spy, or hang'd
as a Traytor: That it ought to be
as much against the Law to let 'em
live, as to Shoot with white Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that to write Lampoons
should be put into the Statute against
Stabbing. And cou'd he find the
Rogue that had the Wit to write
that, he wou'd make him a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56143:453"/>
to all the Race of that Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Vermin; what to abuse a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
one of the States, a very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of the Commonwealth!—
'twas Abominable and not to be
born,—and looking on his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
—and considering his Face
a while, he cry'd,—<hi>I Fancy,</hi> Sir,
<hi>by your Physiognomy, that you your self
have a hand in this Libel:</hi> At which
<hi>Octavio</hi> blush'd, which he taking for
guilt, flew out into terrible Anger
against him, not suffering him to
speak for himself, or clear his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
And as he was going in this
Rage from him, having forbidden
him ever to set his Foot within his
Doors, he told him,—<hi>If,</hi> said he,
<hi>the scandalous Town, from your Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
have such Thoughts of me, I will
convince it by Marrying this fair Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the first thing I do: I cannot doubt
but to find a welcom since she is a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
Woman, without Friend or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
and especially when she shall see
how civilly you have handled her here,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56143:454"/>
in your Dogerel Ballad: I'll teach you
to be a Wit,</hi> Sir; <hi>and so your Humble
Servant.</hi>—And leaving him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wild with his Fears, he went
directly to <hi>Silvia,</hi> where he told
her, his Nephew was going to make
up the Match between himself and
Madam the Widow of—and that
he had made a scandalous Lampoon
on her Fair self. He forgot nothing
that might make her hate the Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
young Nobleman, whom she
knew too well to believe that any
thing of this was other than the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his own growing Passion for
her. For tho' she saw <hi>Octavio</hi> every
day, in this time she had remain'd
at his Uncles, yet the Old Lover so
watch'd their very Looks, that 'twas
impossible almost to tell one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Heart by any Glance there.
But <hi>Octavio</hi> had once in this time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
a Letter to her, which having
Opportunity to do he put it into her
Comb-box, when he was with his
Uncle one day in her Dressing-room;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56143:454"/>
for he durst not trust her Pag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and
less <hi>Antonett,</hi> who had before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
'em: And having for <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
release so solemnly Sworn to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
(to which Vows he took Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
care to keep him.) He had so
perfect an awe upon his Spirits from
every Look and Command of his
Uncles, he took infinitely heed how
he gave him any Umbrage by any
Action of his; and the rather because
he hoped when time shou'd serve to
bring about his Business of stealing
<hi>Silvia</hi> from him, for she was kept
and guarded like a mighty Heiress;
so that by this prudent Management
on both sides, they heighten'd the
growing Love in every Heart. In
that Billet which he dropt in her
Comb-box, he did not only make
Ten thousand Vows of Eternal Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Faith, and beg the same
assurance of her again; but told her
he was secur'd (so well he thought
of her) from fears of his Uncles
Addresses to her, and beg'd she wou'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56143:455"/>
not let 'em perplex her, but rather
serve her for her diversion, that she
should from time to time write him
all he said to her, and how he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her when alone; and that since
the Old Lover was so watchful, she
should not trust her Letters with any
body; but as she walk'd out into the
Garden, she shou'd in passing throw
the Hall, put her Letter in at the
broken Glass of an Old Sedan that
stood there, and had stood for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years; and that his own Page,
whom he could trust, shou'd, when
he came with him to his Uncles, take
it from thence.—Thus every Day
they writ, and received the dearest
returns in the World; where all the
Satisfaction, that Vows oft repeated
cou'd give, was rendred each other;
with an account from <hi>Silvia</hi> that
was very pleasant, of all the Passion
of the Doating Old <hi>Sebastian,</hi> the
Presents he made her, the Fantastick
Youth he would assume, and the
unusual manner of his Love, which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56143:455"/>
was a great diversion to both; and
this Difficulty of speaking to <hi>Silvia,</hi>
and entertaining her with Love, tho'
it had its Pains, had its infinite Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
too; it increas'd their Love on
both sides, and all their Wishes.
But now by this last Banishment
from the House where she was, to
lose that only Pleasure of beholding
the Adorable Maid, gave him all the
Pains without the hope of one Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and he began to fear he should
have a World of Difficulty to secure
the dear Object of his continual
Thoughts: He found no way to send
to her, and dreads all his Malicious
Uncle and Rival may say to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage:
He dreads even that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Tenderness and Esteem he had
for the good Old Man, who had been
so fond a Parent to him; least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that should make him unwilling
to use that Extremity against him
in the regaining <hi>Silvia,</hi> which he
would use to any other Man. Oh,
how he Curses the fatal hour
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56143:456"/>
that ever he implored his Aid for
her Release; and having overcome
all Difficulties, even that of his
Fears of <hi>Philander,</hi> (from whom
they had received no Letter in Two
Months) and that of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and had Establish'd himself in
her Soul and her Arms; he should,
by employing his Uncle's Authority
for <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Service, be so Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to involve 'em into new Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Difficulties, of which he
could foresee no other end, than that
which must be fatal to some of 'em.
But he believed half his Torture
would be eased, could he but write
to <hi>Silvia,</hi> for see her he could not
hope: He bethought himself of a
way atlast.</p>
                  <p>His Uncle had belonging to his
House the most fine Garden of any
in that Province, where those things
are not much esteem'd, in which the
Old Gentleman took wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and kept a Gardener and his
Family in a little House at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56143:456"/>
end of the Garden, on purpose
to look to it and dress it. This Man
had a very great Veneration for <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
whom he call'd his Young Lord.
Sure of the Fidelity of this Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when it was dark enough to
conceal him, he wrapt himself in
his Cloak and got him thither by
a back-way, where with Presents he
soon won those to his Interest,
who would before have been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by him in any Service. He
had a little clean Room, and some
little <hi>French</hi> Novels which he
brought; and there he was as well
conceal'd as if he had been at the
<hi>Indies;</hi> he left word at home that
he was gone out of Town. He knew
well enough that <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Lodgings
look'd that way. And when it was
dark enough he walk'd under her
Window, till he saw a Candle light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Bed-Chamber, which
was as great a Joy to him as the Star
that Guides the Traveller, or wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Seaman, or the Lamp at <hi>Sestos,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56143:457"/>
that Guided the Ravish'd Lover o'er
the <hi>Hellespont.</hi> And by that time he
could imagine all in Bed, he made
a little noise with a Key on the Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
of his Sword; but whether <hi>Silvia</hi>
heard it or not I cannot tell, but she
anon came to the Window, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up the Shash, leaned on her Arms
and look'd into the Garden. Oh!
who but he himself that Lov'd so well
as <hi>Octavio,</hi> can express the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports
he was in at the Sight? which
more from the Sight within than
that without, he saw was the lovely
<hi>Silvia;</hi> whom calling softly by her
Name, answered him as if she knew
the welcome Voice, and cry'd,—
<hi>Whose there, Octavio?</hi> She was soon
Answer'd you may imagine. And they
began the most indearing Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that ever Love could dictate.
He complains on his Fate that sets
'em at that distance, and she pities
him. He makes a Thousand Doubts,
and she undeceives 'em all. He
Fears, and she convinces his Error,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56143:457"/>
and is impatient at his Suspicions.
She will not indure him to question
a Heart that has given him so many
proofs of its Tenderness and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
She tells him her own Wishes,
how soft and servent they are; and
assures him, he is extreamly oblig'd
to her—<hi>Since for you—my
Charming Friend,</hi> said she to Octavio,
<hi>I have refus'd this Night to Marry your
Vncle; have a care,</hi> said she, Smiling,
<hi>how you treat me, least I revenge my
self on you; become your Aunt, and
bring Heirs to the Estate you have a
Right to: The Writings of all which
I have now in my Chamber, and which
were but just now laid at my Feet, and
which I cannot yet get him to receive
back. And to oblige me to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
has told me, how you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me, by giving your self to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and exposing me in Lampoons.</hi>
—To this <hi>Octavio</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
but she assured him she need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Argument to convince her of
the Falshhood of all. He Sighs, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56143:458"/>
told her all she said, tho' Dear and
Charming was not sufficient to ease
his Heart, for he foresaw a World of
hazzard to get her from thence, and
mischiefs if she remained; insomuch
that he caus'd the Tears to flow from
the fair Eyes of <hi>Silvia,</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on her rigid Fortune. And
she cry'd, <hi>Oh, my</hi> Octavio! <hi>what
strange Fate or Stars rul'd my Birth,
that I shou'd be born the ruine of what
I Love, or of those that Love me?</hi> At
this rate they past the Night, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more soft, sometimes incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another; but the last result
was to contrive the means of esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
He fancy'd she might easily
do it by the Garden from that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:
But that he was not sure he
could trust the Gardener so far, who
in all things would serve him, in
which his Lord and Master was not
Injured; and he amongst the rest of
the Servants, had Order not to suffer
<hi>Silvia</hi> out of the Garden, for which
reason he kept a strict Guard on that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56143:458"/>
back-Door. Some way must be
found out which yet was not, and
was left to time. He told her where
he was, and that he wou'd not stir
from thence, till he were secur'd of
her flight: And Day coming on, tho'
loath, yet for fear of Eyes and Ears
that might Spy upon 'em, he retired
to his little Lodging and <hi>Silvia</hi> to
Bed; after giving and receiving a
Thousand Vows and Farewels. The
next Night he came to the same
place, but instead of entertaining
her—he only saw her softly put
up the Shash a little, and throw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
white out of the Window and
retire. He was wondring at the
meaning, but taking up what was
thrown down, he found and smelt it
was <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Handkerchief, in which
was ty'd up a <hi>Billet:</hi> He went to his
little Lodging and read it.</p>

commanded him to hope all things

<hi>Silvia,</hi> they parted as silent as the
Night from Day, which was now
just dividing—so long they stay'd,
tho' but to look at each other; so
that all the Morning was pass'd in
Bed to make the Day seem shorter,
which was too tedious to both:
This Pleasure he had after Noon,
towards the Evening, that when
<hi>Silvia</hi> walked, as she alwaies did
in the Garden, he could see her tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Glass of his Window, but
durst not open it; for the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman

heard his Tread on the Gravel, she
threw down a Handkerchief again,

After he had writ this he hast'd
and throws it into her Window, and
return'd to Bed without seeing her,
which was no small Affliction to his
Soul: He had an ill Night of it,
and fancied a thousand tormenting
things; That the old Gentleman
might th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be with her; and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
what might he not perswade
by force of rich Presents, of which
his Uncle was well stored: And so
he guess'd, and as he guess'd it
proved, as by his next Nights Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was inform'd, that the old
Lover no sooner saw <hi>Silvia</hi> retire,
but having a mind to try his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in some Critical Minute—
for such a Minute he had heard
there was that favoured Lovers;
but he goes to his Closet, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out some Jewels of great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
to make himself the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
he goes directly to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
Chamber, and entered just as she
had taken up <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Letter, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56143:463"/>
clap'd it in her Bosom as she heard
some body at the Door; but was not
in a little Confusion when she saw
who it was; which she excused, by
telling him she was surpriz'd to
find herself with a Man in her
Chamber: That there he fell to plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his cause of Love; and offered
her again to settle his Estate upon
her, and implor'd she would be his
Wife. After a thousand faint De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,
she told him she could not
possibly receive that Honour, but if
she could, she would have look'd
upon it as a great Favour from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
at that he was Thunder-struck,
and look'd as gastly as if his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Ghost had frighten'd him; and
after much Debate, Love and Grief
on his side, Design and Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on hers, she gave him Hopes
that Aton'd for all she had before
said; insomuch that before they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an absolute Bargain was struck
up, and he was to settle part of his
Estate upon her, as also that <hi>Villa,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56143:464"/>
to which he had resolved in two
days to carry her; in earnest to this
he presents her a Necklace of Pearl
of good Value, and other Jewels,
which was the best Rhetorick he had
yet spoke to her; and now she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
the most Complaisant Lady
in the World, she suffers him to
talk wantonly to her, nay even to
kiss her, and rub his grizly Beard
on her divine Face, grasp her Hands,
and touch her Breast; a Blessing he
had never before arriv'd to with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
body above the Quality of his
own Servant-Maid. To all which
she makes the best Resistance she
can, under the Circumstances of one
who was to deceive well; and
while she loaths she seems well
pleas'd, while the gay Jewels spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in her Eyes and <hi>Octavio</hi> in her
Heart; so fond is Youth of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to purchase an addition of
Beauty at any Price. Thus with
her pretty Flatteries she wrought
upon his Soul, and smil'd and look'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56143:464"/>
him into Faith; loth to depart she
sends him pleas'd away, and having
her Heart the more inclin'd to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
by being Persecuted with his
Uncles Love (for by Comparison she
finds the mighty Difference) she sets
herself to write him the Account of
what I have related; this Nights
Adventure and Agreement between
his Uncle and herself. She tells him
that to Morrow, for now 'twas al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Day, she had promised him to
go to his <hi>Villa:</hi> She tells him at
what rate she has purchased the
Blessing expected; and lastly, leaves
the management of the rest to him,
who needs not be instructed. This
Letter he receiv'd the next Night,
at the old place, and <hi>Silvia</hi> with
it lets down a Velvet Night Bag,
which contain'd all the Jewels and
things of Value she had receiv'd of
himself, his Uncle, or any other:
After which he retired, and was
pretty well at ease, with the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
he should ere long be made
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56143:465"/>
Happy in the Possession of <hi>Silvia:</hi>
In order to it the next Morning he
was early up, and dressing himself
in a great course Campagne-Coat of
the Gardeners, puting up his Hair,
as well as he could, under a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Hat,
he got on a Horse that
suited his Habit, and rides to the
<hi>Villa,</hi> whither they were to come,
and which he knew perfectly well
every Room of; for there our He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
was born. He went to a little
<hi>Caberet</hi> in the Village, from whence
he could survey all the great House,
and see every Body that pass'd in
and out: He remain'd fix'd at the
Window, fill'd with a thousand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations;
this he had resolv'd, not
to set upon the good old Man as a
Thief or Robber; nor could he find
in this Heart or Nature to injure
him, tho' but in a little afrighting
him, who had given him so many
anxious Hours, and who had been
so unjust to desire that Blessing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he would not allow him; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56143:465"/>
to believe that a Vertue in himself,
which he exclaim'd against as so
great a Vice in his Nephew; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
he resolv'd to deceive him,
to save his own Life. And he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that nice part of Generosity, as
to satisfy a little unnecessary Lust in
an old Man, to ruin the eternal
Content of a young one, so nearly
allied to his Soul, as was his own dear
proper Person. While he was thus
considering he saw his Uncle's Coach
coming, and <hi>Silvia</hi> with that doting
Lover in it, who was that day dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in all the Fopperies of Youth,
and every thing was young and
gay about him but his Person, that
was Winter it self, disguised in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Spring; and he was altogether
a meer Contradiction: But who
can guess the Disorders and Pantings
of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Heart at the Sight;
and tho' he had resolved before he
would not to save his Life lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Hands on his old Parent; yet
at their Approach, at their presenting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56143:466"/>
themselves together before his Eyes,
as two Lovers going to betray him
to all the Miseries, Pangs, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
of Love, going to possess
—her, the dear Object and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Life of his Soul, and she the
Parent of him, to whom she had
disposed of herself so intirely alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
he was provok'd to break from
all his Resolutions, and with one of
those two Pistols he had in his
Pockets, to have sent unerring Death
to his old amorous Heart: But that
Thought was no sooner born than
stifled in his Soul, where it met with
all the Sence of Gratitude that ever
could present the tender Love and
dear Care of a Parent there; and the
Coach passing into the Gate put him
upon new Designs, and before they
were finished he saw <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Page
coming from the House, after seeing
his Lady to her Apartment, and
being show'd his own, where he
laid his Vallice and Riding-things,
and was now come out to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56143:466"/>
a Country where he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been before. <hi>Octavio</hi> goes down
and meets him, and ventures to make
himself known to him: And so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
glad was the Youth to have
an Opportunity to serve him, that
he vow'd he would not only do it
with his Life, on Occasion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
he could do it effectually, since
the old Gentleman had no sort of
Jealousie now; especially since they
had so prudently manag'd Matters
in this time of his Ladies remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Sebastian</hi>'s House. <hi>So that,
Sir, it will not be difficult,</hi> says the
generous Boy, <hi>for me to convey you
to my Lodging when it is dark.</hi> He
told him his Lady cast many a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Look out towards the Road as
she pass'd, <hi>for you, I am sure my
Lord—for she had told both myself
and</hi> Antonett <hi>of her Design before,
least our Surprize or Resistance should
prevent any Force you might use on
the Road, to take her from my Lord</hi>
Sebastian: <hi>She sigh'd and look'd on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56143:467"/>
me as she alighted, with Eyes, my
Lord, that told me her Grief for
your Disappointment.</hi> You may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
imagine how transported the
poor <hi>Octavio</hi> was; he kiss'd and
imbrac'd the Amiable Boy a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times; and taking a Ring
from his Finger of considerable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
gave it the dear Reviver of his
Hopes. <hi>Octavio</hi> already knew the
Strength of the House, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
but of a Gardener, whose Wife
was House-keeper, and their Son,
who was his Fathers Servant in
the Garden, and their Daughter,
who was a sort of Maid-servant:
And they had brought only the
Coach-man, and one Foot-man, who
were likely to be mirrily imploy'd
in the Kitchin at Night when all
got to Supper together. I say, <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
already knew this, and there was
now nothing that opposed his
Wishes: So that dismissing the dear
Boy he remained the rest of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Day at the <hi>Caberet,</hi> the most
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56143:467"/>
impatient of Night of any Man on
Earth: And when the Boy appear'd
it was like the Approach of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
He told him his Lady was the
most Melancholy Creature that ever
Eyes beheld, and that to conceal the
Cause, she had feigned herself Ill,
and had not stir'd from her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all the day: That the old Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was perpetually with her, and
the most concern'd Doatard that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Cupid</hi> inslav'd: That he had so
wholly taken up his Lady with his
disagreeable Entertainment, that it
was impossible either by a Look or
Note to inform her of his being so
near her, whom she considered as
her present Defender, and her future
Happiness. <hi>But this Evening,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the Youth, <hi>as I was wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on her at Supper, she spy'd
the Ring on my Finger, which, my
Lord, your Bounty made me Master
of this Morning. She blush'd a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times and fix'd her Eyes upon it,
for she knew it, and was Impatient to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56143:468"/>
have ask'd me some Questions, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
her Words. And after that I saw a
Ioy dance in her lovely Eyes, that told
me, She devin'd you were not far from
thence. Therefore I beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
let us haste.</hi> So both went out
together, and the Page Conducted
him into a Chamber he better knew
than the Boy, while every Moment
he receives Intelligence how Affairs
went in that of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s, by the Page,
who leaving <hi>Octavio</hi> there went out
as a Spy for him. In fine, with much
ado, <hi>Silvia</hi> perswaded her Old Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to urge her for no Favours that
Night, for she was indispos'd and
unfit for Love; yet she perswades
with such an Air, so Smiling and
Insinuating, that she increases the
Fire she indeavour'd to allay: but
he, who was all Obedience as well as
New Desire, resolves to humour
her, and shew the perfect Gallantry
of his Love; he promises her she
shall command: And after that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was the Old Gentleman seen in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56143:468"/>
so excellent a Humour before, in the
whole Course of his Life; a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Lightening against a Storm, that
must be fatal to him. He was no
sooner gone from her, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to go to Bed and Sleep, that he
might be the earlier up, to show her
the fine Gardens which she lov'd,
but she sends <hi>Antonett</hi> to call the
Page, from whom she long'd to know
something of <hi>Octavio,</hi> and was sure
he cou'd inform her. But she was
undressing while she spoke, and got
into her Bed before she left her:
But <hi>Antonett,</hi> instead of bringing
the Sighing Youth, brought the
Transported and Ravish'd <hi>Octavio,</hi>
who had by this time pull'd off his
Course Campaign and put down his
Hair. He fell breathless with Joy on
her Bed side; when <hi>Antonett,</hi> who
knew that Love desired no lookers
on, retired and left <hi>Octavio</hi> almost
dead with Joy, in the Clasping Arms
of the Trembling Maid, the lovely
<hi>Silvia.</hi> Oh, who can guess their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction?
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56143:469"/>
Who can guess their
Sighs and Love? their tender Words
half stifled in Kisses; Lovers! fond
Lovers! only can imagine; to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this Tale will be Insipid. He
now forgets where he is, that not
far off lay his Amorous Uncle, that
to be found there was Death and
something worse; but wholly Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
with the Languishing Beauty,
taking his Pistols out of either Poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
he lays them on a Dressing
Table near the Bed side, and in a
Moment throws off his Cloths, and
gives himself up to all the Heaven of
Love that lay ready to receive him
there, without thinking of any thing
but the vast Power of eithers Charms.
They lay and forgot the hasty Hours,
but Old <hi>Sebastian</hi> did not. They
were all counted by him, with the
Impatience of a Lover: He Burnt,
he Rag'd with fierce Desire, and tost
from side to side and found no ease;
<hi>Silvia</hi> was present in Imagination,
and he like <hi>Tantalus</hi> reaches at the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56143:469"/>
Food, which, tho' in view, is not
within his reach: He wou'd have
Pray'd, but he had no Devotion for
any Deity but <hi>Silvia;</hi> he rose and
walk'd, and went to Bed again, and
found himself uneasie every way. A
Thousand times he was about to go,
and try what Opportunity would do
in the dark silent Night—but fears
her Rage—he fears she'll chide at
least; then he resolves and unresolves
as fast: Unhappy Lover—thus
to blow the Fire when there were no
Materials to supply it; at last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with fierce Desire, too Violent
to be withstood, or rather Fate
wou'd have it so ordained, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
all, and steals to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
believing when she found him
in her Arms she could not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased;
or if she were, that was
the surest place of Reconciliation:
So that only putting his Night Gown
about him, he went softly to her
Chamber for fear of waking her:
The unthinking Lovers had left open
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56143:470"/>
the Door, so that it was hardly put
to. And the first Alarm was <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>'s
Hand being seiz'd, which was
Clasping his Treasure. He starts
from the frighted Arms of <hi>Silvia,</hi>
and leaping from the Bed wou'd have
escaped, for he knew too well the
touch of that Old Hand; but <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
wholly surpriz'd at so robust a
repulse, took most unfortunately a
stronger hold, and laying both his
Hands roughly upon him, with a
Resolution to know who he was,
for he felt his Hair; and <hi>Octavio</hi>
struggling at the same Minute to get
from him, they both fell against the
Dressing Table, threw down the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols;
in their fall one of which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off, shot the unfortunate Old
Lover into the Head, so that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spoke word more: At the going
off of the Pistol, <hi>Silvia,</hi> who had
not minded those <hi>Octavio</hi> laid on the
Table, cry'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out—<hi>Oh my</hi> Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio!
—<hi>My dearest Charmer,</hi> reply'd
he, <hi>I'm well</hi>—And feeling on the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56143:470"/>
Dead Body, which he wonder'd had
no longer Motion, he felt Blood
flowing round it, and Sighing cry'd
—<hi>Ah,</hi> Silvia! <hi>I'm undone</hi>—
<hi>My Vncle</hi>—<hi>Oh my Parent</hi>—
<hi>Speak, Dear Sir! Oh! what unlucky
Accident has done this fatal Deed?
Silvia,</hi> who was very soft by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was extreamly surpriz'd, and
frightned at the News of a Dead Man
in her Chamber, so that she was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to run Mad with the Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it: She rav'd and tore her self,
and exprest her Fright in Cries and
Distraction; so that <hi>Octavio</hi> was
compelled from one charitable Grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to another. He goes to her and
Comforts her, and tells, since 'tis by
no design of either of them, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
will be their Guardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
He tells her all their fault was
Love, which made him so heedlesly
fond of Joys with her, he staid to
reap those when he should have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
'em by Flight. He tells her
this is now no place to stay in, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56143:471"/>
that he would put on her Clothes
and fly with her to some secure part
of the World; <hi>For who,</hi> said he,
<hi>that finds this poor Vnfortunate here,
will not charge his Death on me or thee.
—Haste then, my dearest Maid,
haste, haste, and let us fly</hi>—So
dressing her he led her into <hi>Antonett</hi>'s
Chamber, and conjured her to say
nothing of the Accident, while he
went to see which way they could get
out. So locking the Chamber door
where the dead Body lay, which by
this time was stiff and cold; he lock'd
that also of his Uncle's Chamber,
and calling the Page they all got
themselves ready; and puting Two
Horses in the Coach, they unseen
and unperceived got themselves all
out: The Servants having drunk
hard at their meeting in the Country
last Night, were all too sound a sleep
to understand any thing of what
past. It being now about the Break
of Day, <hi>Octavio</hi> was the Coachman,
and the Page Riding by the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56143:471"/>
while <hi>Silvia</hi> and <hi>Antonett</hi> were
in it, they in an hours time reach'd
the Town, where <hi>Octavio</hi> pack'd up
all that was carriageable; took his
own Coach and Six Horses; left his
Affairs to the Managent of a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that dwelt with him; took Bills
to the value of Two thousand Pounds,
and immediately left the Town, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
receiving some Letters that came
last Night by the Post, one of which
was from <hi>Philander;</hi> and indeed this
new Grief upon <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Soul, made
him the most Dejected and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Man in the World, insomuch
that he, who never wept for any
thing but for Love, was often found
with Tears rowling down his
Cheeks, at the remembrance of an
Accident so deplorable, and of which
he and his unhappy Passion was the
Cause, tho' Innocently: Yet could
not the dire Reflection oft hat, nor
the loss of so tender a Parent, as was
<hi>Sebastian,</hi> lessen one Spark of that
Fire for <hi>Silvia,</hi> whose unfortunate
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56143:472"/>
Flame had been so Fatal. While
They were safe out of danger, the
Servants of <hi>Sebastian</hi> admired when
Ten, Eleven and Twelve a Clock
was come, they saw neither the Old
Lord nor any of the New Guests.
But when the Coachman mist his
Coach and Horses he was in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
maze, and thought some Body
had stollen 'em, and accusing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of Sluggishness and Debauchery,
that made him not able to hear when
the Coach went out, he forswore
all Drinking. But when the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
and he met and discoursed
about the Lady and the rest, they
concluded that the Old Gentleman
and she were agreed upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and being got to Bed together
had quite forgot themselves; and
made a Thousand Roguish remarks
upon 'em. They believed the Maid
and the Page too were as well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
since they saw neither. But
when Dinner was ready she went up
to the Maids Chamber and found it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56143:472"/>
empty, as also that of the Page;
her Heart then presaging something,
she ventures to knock at her Lord's
Chamber door, but finding it Lock'd
and none Answer, they broke it
open; and after doing the same by
that of <hi>Silvia,</hi> they found the Poor
<hi>Sebastian</hi> stretch'd on the Floor, and

that is alive, and who has kill'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and for every Man to set a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hand to bear him out of Danger,
thinking it too much that one's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
dead: I say, this being the
Nature of the People, they never
pursu'd the Murderers or fled Persons,
but suffered <hi>Sebastian</hi> to lie till the
Coroner sat upon him, who found
it, or at least thought it, Accident;
and there was all for that time. But
this, with all the reasonable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
did not satisfie the <hi>States.</hi>
Here is one of their High and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
killed, a fair Lady fled, and
upon inquiry a fine Young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
too, the Nephew: All knew
they were Rivals in this fair Lady;
all knew there were Animosities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
'em; all knew <hi>Octavio</hi> was
absconded some Days before; so
that, upon Consideration, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
he was Murder'd by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact;
and the rather, because they
wish'd it so in spight to <hi>Octavio;</hi> and
because both he and <hi>Silvia</hi> were fled
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56143:473"/>
like Guilty Persons. Upon this they
make a Seizure of both his and his
Uncle's Estate, to the use of the
<hi>States.</hi> Thus the best and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Man that ever grac'd that part
of the World was undone by Love.
While <hi>Silvia</hi> with Sighs and Tears
would often say, <hi>That sure she was
born the Fate of all that Ador'd her,
and no Man ever thriv'd that had a
Design upon her, or a Pretension to
her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus between excess of Grief and
excess of Love, which indeed lay
veil'd in the first, they arriv'd at
<hi>Bruxells;</hi> where <hi>Octavio,</hi> having
News of the proceedings of the
<hi>States</hi> against him, resolving rather
to lose his Life, than tamely to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
his Right, he went forth in
order to take some Care about it:
And in these extreams of a troubled
Mind he had forgot to read <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
Letters, but gave 'em to <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
to peruse, till he return'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
and conjuring her, by all
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56143:474"/>
the Charms of Love, not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
herself to be afflicted, but now to
consider she was wholly his; and
she could not, and ought not to rob
him of a Sigh or Tear for any other
Man. For they had concluded to
marry as soon as <hi>Silvia</hi> should be
delivered from that part of <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of which she was possess'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beholding her intirely his own,
of whom he was so fondly tender,
he could not indure the Wind should
blow on her, and kiss her lovely
Face: Jealous of even the Air she
breath'd, he was ever putting her
in mind of whose and what she was;
and she ever giving him new As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
that she was only <hi>Octavio</hi>'s.
The last part of his ill News he
conceal'd from her; that of the
Usage of the <hi>States.</hi> He was so
intirely careful of her Fame, that he
had two Lodgings, one, most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent,
for her, another for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and only visited her all the
live-long Day. And being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

as well as those of my Ioys;
equally Extream.</p>
                        <p>In my last I gave you an Account
how triumphing a Lover I was in the
Possession of the adorable <hi>Calista;</hi> and
how very near I was being surpriz'd
in the Fountain, where I had hid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the Rage of old <hi>Clarinau;</hi>
and escaped wet and cold to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And tho' indeed I escaped, it was
not without giving the old Husband
a Iealousy, which put him upon an
Inquiry after a stricter mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r, as I
heard the next day from <hi>Calista;</hi> but
with as ill Success as the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56143:475"/>
notwithstanding it appears by
what after happened that he still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Iealousy, and that of me,
from a thousand little Inquiries I had
from time to time made, form my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now absent, and most of all from
my being (as now he fancied) that
Vision which <hi>Calista</hi> saw in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
All these Circumstances wrought
a thousand <hi>Canundrums</hi> in his <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
politick Noddle: And he resolves
that <hi>Calista</hi>'s Actions should be more
narrowly watch'd. This I can only
guess from what insu'd. I am not able
to say by what good Fortune I escap'd
several happy Nights after the first,
but 'tis certain I did so; for the old
Man carrying all things fair to the
lovely Countess, she thought herself
secure in her Ioys hitherto, as to any
Discovery: However I never went on
this dear Adventure but I was well
arm'd against any Mishaps of Poniard,
Sword, and Pistol, that Grab of a
right <hi>Spaniard. Calista</hi> had been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

above two years before I beheld
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56143:475"/>
her, and had never been with Child:
But it so chanced, that she conceived
the very first Night of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
since which time not all her Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and Charms could prevail for
one Night with the old Count: For,
whether from her seeming Fondness
he imagined the Cause, or what other
Reason he had to withstand her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and Caresses, I know not: But
still he found or feigned some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
to put her off; so that <hi>Calista's</hi>
Fears and Love increased with her
growing Belly. And tho' almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Night I had the fair young Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in Bed with me (without the
least Suspicion on <hi>Dormina</hi>'s side) or
else in the Arbours, or on flowery Banks
in the Garden: Till I am confident
there was not a Walk, a Grove, an
Arbour, or Bed of Sweets, that was
not conscious of our stollen Delights.
Nay we grew so very bold in Love,
that we often suffered the Day to break
upon us; and still escaped his Spyes,
who by either watching at the wrong
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56143:476"/>
Door, or part of the vast Garden; or
by Sleepiness and Carelessness still let
us pass their View. Four happy Months,
thus bless'd and thus secur'd, we liv'd,
when <hi>Calista</hi> could no longer conceal
her growing Shame from the Iealous
<hi>Clarinau</hi> or <hi>Dormina.</hi> She fear'd
with too much Reason that 'twas Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy
which made him refrain her
Bed, tho' he dissembled well all Day:
And one Night, weeping in my Bosom,
with all the tenderness of Love, she
said, <hi>That if I loved her, as she
hoped I did, I should be shortly
very miserable: For oh,</hi> cry'd she,
<hi>I can no longer hide this—dear
Effect of my stollen Happiness—
and</hi> Clarinau <hi>will no sooner perceive
my Condition, but he will use his
utmost Rigour against me. I know
his jealous Nature, and find I am
undone</hi>—With that she told me
how he had killed his first Wife; for
which he was obliged to fly from the
Court and Country of <hi>Spain:</hi> And that
she found from all his Severity he was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56143:476"/>
not chang'd from his Nature. In sine,
she said and lov'd so much, that I
was wholly charm'd, and vow'd myself
her Slave, or Sacrifice, either to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what she could propose, or fall a
Victim with her to my Love. After
which 'twas concluded (neither having
a mind to leave the World, when we
both knew so well how to make our
selves happy in it) that the next
Night I should bring her a Suit of
Mans Cloths; and she would in that
Disguise fly with me to any part of the
World. For she vow'd if this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Force of Flying had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to her, she had not been longer
able to have indured his Tyranny and
Slavery: But had resolved to break
her Chain, and put herself upon any
Fortune. So that after the usual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments
on both sides, I left her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to follow my Fortune, and she
me, to sacrifice all to her Repose.
That Night, and all next Day, she
was not idle; but put up all her Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ls,
of which she had the richest of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56143:477"/>
Lady in all those Parts, for in
that the old Count was over lavish:
And the next Night I brought her
a Suit, which I had made that day
on purpose; as gay as could be made
in so short a time; and scaleing my
Wall well arm'd, I found her ready at
the Door to receive me; and going
into an Arbour, by the aid of a Dark-Lanthorn
I carried, she dress'd her in
a lac'd Shirt of mine, and this Suit
I had brought her, of blew Velvet,
trim'd with rich Loops and Buttons
of Gold; a white Hat and white Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
a fair Peruke, and scarlet
Breeches, the rest suitable. And I must
confess to you, my dear <hi>Octavio,</hi> that
never any thing appear'd so Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and yet I have seen <hi>Silvia!</hi> But
even she a Baby to this more noble
Figure. <hi>Calista</hi> is tall, and fashioned
the most divinely—the most proper
for that Dress of any of her Sex: And
I own I never saw any thing so Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
all over, from Head to Foot:
and viewing her thus (carrying my
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56143:477"/>
Lanthorn all about her, but more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
her Face, her wondrous Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Face—(Pardon me if I say,
what does but look like Flattery)—I
never saw any thing more resembling my
dear <hi>Octavio,</hi> than the lovely <hi>Calista.</hi>
Your every Feature, your very Smile
and Air; so that, if possible, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
my Adoration and Esteem for
her: Thus compleated, I Armed her and
buckl'd on her Sword, and she would
needs have one of my Pistols too, that
stuck in my Belt; and now she appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all lovely Man. 'Twas so late by
that time we had done, that the Moon
which began to shine very Bright,
gave us a Thousand little Fears, and
disposing her Iewels all about us safe,
we began our Adventure, with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
dreadful Apprehensions on <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta</hi>'s
side. And going up the Walk
towards the place where we were to
mount the Wall; just at the end of it,
turning a Corner we encounter'd Two
Men, who were too near us to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.
<hi>Oh,</hi> cry'd <hi>Calista</hi> to me, who
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56143:478"/>
saw 'em first,—<hi>My dear</hi> Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>we are undone!</hi> I look'd and saw
'em and replied, <hi>My Charmer do not
fear, they are but two to two whoe're
they be; for Love, and I, shall be of
force enough to Encounter 'em. No,
my Philander,</hi> replied she briskly, <hi>'tis I
will be your Second in this Rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
At this approaching 'em more near
(for they hasted to us, nor could we fly
from them,) we soon found by his hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that Old <hi>Clarinau</hi> was one, and
the other a Tall Spaniard, his Nephew.
I clapt my Hair under my Hat, and
both of us making a stand, we resolv'd
if they durst not venture on us to let
'em pass—but <hi>Clarinau,</hi> who was
on that side which faced <hi>Calista,</hi> cry'd,
<hi>Ah Villain, have I caught thee!</hi>
and at the same instant with a <hi>Poniard</hi>
stabbed her into the Arm; for with a
sudden turn she evaded it from her
Heart, to which it was designed. At
which repaying his Complement, she
shot of her Pistol, and down he fell,
crying out for a Priest; while I at the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56143:478"/>
same time laid my Tall Boy at his
Feet. I caught my dear Virago in my
Arms, and hasted through the Garden
with her, and was very hasty in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my Ladder, putting my fair Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
before me, without so much as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
yet to ask her if she were wounded,
least it should have hinder'd our flight
if I had found her hurt: Nor knew I
she was so, till I felt her warm preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Blood streaming on my Face, as
I lifted her over the Wall; but I soon
conveyed her into my new Lodgings; yet
not soon enough to secure her from those
that pursu'd us: For with their bauling
they alarm'd some of the Servants,
who looking narrowly for the Murderers,
track'd us by <hi>Calista</hi>'s Blood, which
they saw with their Flambeaus from the
Place where <hi>Clarinau</hi> and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
lay, to the very Wall; and
thinking from our Wounds we could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

escape far, they searching the Houses,
found me dressing <hi>Calista</hi>'s Wound,
which I kist a Thousand times. But
the matchless Courage of the fair Vira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go!
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56143:479"/>

Soul! nothing of foolish Woman har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>our'd
there, nothing but softest Love;
for while I was raving mad, tearing
my Hair and cursing my Fate in vain,
she had no concern but for me; no pain
but that of her fear of being taken
from me and being delivered to Old <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinau,</hi>
whom I fear'd was not dead;
nor could the very seizing her daunt her
Spirits, but with an unmatch'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
she bore it all; she only wish'd
she could have escaped without Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
We were both led to Prison,
but none knew who we were, for those
that seized us had by chance never
seen me, and <hi>Calista's</hi> Habit secur'd
the discovery. While we both remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, we had this Comfort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well Lodg'd together; for they did
not go about to part us, being in for
one Crime. And all the satisfaction
she had, was, that she should, she hop'd,
die concealed, if she must die for the
Crime; and that was much a greater
Ioy than to think she should be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56143:479"/>
back to <hi>Clarinau,</hi> who in a
few days we heard was upon his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
this gave her new fears; but
I confess to you I was not afflicted at it;
nor did I think it hard for me to bribe
<hi>Calista</hi> off; for the Master of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was very Civil and Poor, so that
with the help of some few of <hi>Calista</hi>'s
Iewels, he was wrought upon to let her
escape, I offering to remain and bear
all the brunt of the Business, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pay whatever he could be Fined for it.
These Reasons with the ready Iewels
mollified the needy Rascal; and tho'
loath she were to leave me; yet she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assured that all they could do was
but to sine me; and her stay she knew
was her inevitable Ruine, she at last
submitted, leaving me sufficient in
Iewels to satisfie for all that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
which were the value of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

than to bestow. Yet out of my contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56143:481"/>
stock, I have sent my <hi>Silvia</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
towards that dangerous unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
hour, which will declare me, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
a happy Father of what my <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
bears about her; 'tis a Bill for a
Thousand Patacoons. I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
under an easie restraint, about a
little Dispute between a Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
here and my self, I had else been
at <hi>Bruxells</hi> to have provided all things
for your coming Ilness, but every day
expect my Liberty, and then without
delay I will take Post and bring <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
to your Arms.</p>
                        <p>I have News that <hi>Caesario</hi> is arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Bruxells.</hi> I am at present a
Stranger to all that passes, and having
a double Obligation to haste, you need
not fear but I shall do so.</p>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>This Letter raised in her a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Sentiment from that of the
Story of his Misfortune; and that
taught her to know that this he
had writ to her was all false and
dissembl'd: Which made her in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56143:482"/>
the Letter, cry out with a
vehement Scorn and Indignation
—<hi>Oh how I hate thee Traytor!
who hast the Impudence to continue thus
to impose upon me, as if I wanted
common Sense to see thy Baseness:
For what can be more Base and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
than Lyes, that poor Plebeian
Shift; contemn'd by Men of Honour
or of Wit.</hi> This she spoke without
reminding that this most contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
Quality she herself was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guilty of,
tho' infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
in her Sex, there being a
thousand little Actions of their Lives
liable to Censure and Reproach,
which they would willingly excuse
and colour over with little Falsities;
but in a Man, whose most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Actions pass oftentimes for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Gallantries, and to whom 'tis
no Infamy to own a thousand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but rather a Glory to his
Fame and Merit: I say, in him
(whom Custom has favoured with
an Allowance to commit any Vice
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56143:482"/>
and boast it) 'tis not so brave. And
this Fault of <hi>Philander</hi>'s cur'd <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
of her Disease of Love; and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from her Heart all that Softness
which once had so much favoured
him. Nevertheless she was fill'd with
Thoughts that fail'd not to make
her extreamly Melancholy: And
'twas in this Humour <hi>Octavio</hi> found
her; who forgetting all his own
Griefs, to lessen hers (for his Love
was arrived to a degree of Madness)
he caresses her with all the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
his Passion could pour out;
he falls at her Feet, and pleads with
such a Look and Voice as could not
be resisted; nor ceas'd he till he had
talk'd her into Ease, till he had
look'd and lov'd her into a perfect
Calm: 'Twas then he urg'd her to
a new Confirmation of her Heart to
him, and took hold of every yielding
Softness in her to improve his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
He press'd her to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
wish'd, but by such tender Degrees,
by Arts so fond and indearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:56143:483"/>
the could deny nothing. In this
Humour she makes a thousand Vows
against <hi>Philander;</hi> to hate him as a
Man that has first ruined her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and then abandon'd her to all
the Ills that attend ungoverned
Youth, and unguarded Beauty: She
makes <hi>Octavio</hi> swear as often to be
reveng'd on him, for the Dishonour
of his Sister: Which being perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they re-assum'd all the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which had seem'd almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
by adverse Fate, and for a
little space liv'd in great Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
or if <hi>Octavio</hi> had Sentiments
that represented past Unhappinesses
and a future Prospect of ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
he strove with all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Love to hide 'em from <hi>Silvia.</hi>
In this time they often sent to the
Nunnery of the <hi>Augustins,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the Countess of <hi>Clarinau;</hi>
and at last hearing she was arrived,
no force of Perswasion or Reason
could hinder <hi>Silvia</hi> from going to
make her a Visit: <hi>Octavio</hi> pleads in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56143:483"/>
vain the overthrow of all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
by his Sisters, knowledge that
her Intrigue was found out: But
in an Undress—for her Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
permitted no other, she is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Monastery, and asks for
the Mother Prioress, who came to
the Grate: Where after the first
Complement's over, she tells her she
is a Relation to that Lady who such
a day came to the House. <hi>Silvia</hi> by
her Habit and Equipage appearing
of Quality; was answered, that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the Lady were very much indispos'd,
and unfit to appear at the Grate, she
would nevertheless indeavour to serve
her, since she was so earnest; and
commanding one of the Nuns, to
call down Madam the Countess, she
immediately came; but tho' in a
Dress all negligent, and Face where
Languishment appeared, she at first
sight surprized our Fair One; with
a certain Majesty in her Mein and
Motion, and an Air of Greatness in
her Face, which resembled that of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56143:484"/>
                     <hi>Octavio:</hi> So that not being able to
sustain herself on her trembling Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters,
she was ready to faint at a
Sight so charming, and a Form An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick.
She saw her all that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
had describ'd; nor could the
Partiality of his Passion render her
more lovely than she appear'd this
Instant to <hi>Silvia.</hi> She came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
her—but she found a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in her Looks above all Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that aw'd the jealous Upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and almost put her out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enance;
and with a rising Blush she
seem'd asham'd of her Errand. At
this Silence the lovely <hi>Calista,</hi> a
little surpriz'd, demanded of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Nun if that Lady would
speak with her? This awaked <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
into an Address, and she reply'd;
<hi>Yes, Madam, I am the Vnfortunate,
who am compell'd by my hard Fate to
complain of the most charming Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that ever Nature made: I thought
in coming hither I should have had no
other Business but to have told you
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56143:484"/>
how false, how perjured a Lover I had
had; but at a Sight so wonderous I
blame him no more (whom I find now
compell'd to love) but you, who have
taken from me, by your Charms, the
only Blessing Heaven had lent me.</hi>
This she ended with a Sigh, and
Madam the Countess, who from the
beginning of her speaking guess'd,
from a certain trembling at her Heart,
who it was she spoke of, resolv'd to
show no Signs of a womanish Fear
or Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lousy, but with an unalterable
Air and Courage, reply'd, <hi>Madam,
if my Charms were so powerful, as you
are pleased to tell me they are, they
sure have attracted too many Lovers
for me to understand which of 'em it
is I have been so unhappy to rob you
of. If he be a gallant Man, I shall
neither deny him, nor repent my Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him the more, for his having
been a Lover before.</hi> To which, <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
who expected not so brisk an
Answer, reply'd. <hi>She that makes
such a Confession with so much Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56143:485"/>
I know cannot be insensible of
the Injuries she does, but will have a
Consideration and Pity for those
Wretches at least, who are undone to
establish her Satisfaction. Madam,</hi>
reply'd the Countess (a little touch'd
with the Tenderness and Sadness
with which she spoke) <hi>you have so
just a Character of my Soul, that I
assure you, I would not, for any Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the World, do an Action should
render it less worthy of your good
Thoughts. Name me the Man—
and if I find him such as I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
you with Honour, he shall find
my Friendship no more. Ah Madam,
'tis impossible,</hi> cry'd <hi>Silvia, that he
can ever be mine, that has once had
the Glory of being conquered by you;
and what's yet more, of having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uered
you. Nay, Madam,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Calista, if your Loss be irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I have no more to do, but to sigh
with you, and joyn our hard Fates;
but I am not so vain of my own Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor have so little Admiration for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56143:485"/>
that of yours, to imagine I can retain
any thing you have a Claim to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for
me, I am not fond of Admirers,
if Heaven be pleased to give me one,
I ask no more. I'll leave the World
to you, so it allow me my</hi> Philander.
This she spoke with a little Malice,
which call'd up all the Blushes in
the fair Face of <hi>Silvia;</hi> who a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
netled at the word <hi>Philander,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.
<hi>Go, take the perjured Man,
and see how long you can maintain
your Empire over his fickle Heart,
who has already betray'd you to all the
Reproach an incensed Rival and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
Brother can load you with: See
where he has exposed you to</hi> Octavio;
<hi>and after that tell me what you can
hope from such a perjured Villain</hi>—
At these Words she gave her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Philander</hi> had writ to <hi>Octavio,</hi>
with that he had writ to herself—
and without taking Leave or speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more, she left her thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Rival: Who after pausing a
Moment on what should be writ
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56143:486"/>
there, and what the angry Lady
ment, she silently passed on to her
Chamber. But if she were surprized
with her Visiter, she was much
more when opening the Letters, she
found one to her Brother, filled with
the History of her Infamy, and what
pressed her Soul more sensibly, the
other fill'd with Passion and Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to a Mistriss. She had scarcely
read them out but a young Nun,
her Kinswoman, came into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
whom I have since heard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
she scarce saw in that Moment
any Alteration in her, but that she
rose and received her with her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Grace and Sweetness; and but
for some Answers that she made
<hi>mal a propo,</hi> and Sighs that against
her Will broke from her Heart, she
should not have found an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but this being unusual made
her Inquisitive; and the faint Denial
she met with made her importune,
and that so earnestly and with so
many Vows of Fidelity and Secrecy,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56143:486"/>
that <hi>Calistas</hi>'s Heart, even breaking
within, poured it self for Ease into
the faithful Bosom of this young
Devotee; and having told her all the
Story of her Misfortune, she began
with so much Courage and bravery
of Mind, to make Vows against the
charming Betrayer of her Fame, and
with him all Mankind; and this
with such Consideration and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
as left no room for Reproach
or Perswasion; and from this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
resolved never to quit the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of the Cloysters. She had all
her Life before her Marriage lived
in one, and wished now she never
had seen the World, or departed
from a Life so pure and Innocent.
She looked upon this fatal Accident
now a Blessing, to bring her back to
a Life of Devotion and Tranquillity;
and indeed is a Miracle of Piety.
Sometime after this she was brought
to Bed, but commanded the Child
should be removed where she might
never see it, which accordingly was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56143:487"/>
done; after which, in due time, she
took the Habit; and remains a rare
Example of Repentance, and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living.
This new Penitent became
the News of the whole Town; and
it was not without some Pleasure
that <hi>Octavio</hi> heard it, as the only
Action she could do that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
him to her; the knowledg
of which, and a few soft Days with
<hi>Silvia,</hi> made him chase away all
those Shiverings that had seized him
upon several Occasions: But <hi>Silvia</hi>
was all Sweetness, all Love and good
Humour, and made his Days easy,
and his Nights intirely Happy. While
on the other side there was no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
no Pleasure, that the fond
lavish Lover did not at any Price
purchase for her Repose; for it was
the whole Business of his Life to
study what would charm and please
her: And being assured by so many
Vows of her Heart, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
rested to make him perfectly
Happy, but her being delivered of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56143:487"/>
what belong'd to his Rival, and in
which he had no part, he was at
perfect Ease. This she wishes with
an Impatience equal to his; whose
Love and Fondness for <hi>Octavio</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be arrived to the highest
Degree, and she every Minute ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be freed from the only
thing that hinder'd her from giving
herself intirely to her impatient Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this Serenity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<hi>Silvia</hi>'s Page one day brings
'em News his Lord was arriv'd, and
that he saw him in the Park walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with some <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen,
and undiscovered to him came to
give her Notice, that she might
take her measures accordingly, in
spight of all her Love to <hi>Octavio:</hi> Her
Blushes flew to her Cheeks at the
News, and her Heart panted with
unusual Motion; she wonders at
her self and Fears, and doubts her
own Resolution; she till now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
him wholly indifferent to her,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56143:488"/>
but she knows not what Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this new Disorder will bear; and
what confounded and perplext her
more, was, That <hi>Octavio</hi> beheld all
these Emotions, with unconceivable
resentment, he swells with Pride
and Anger, and even bursts with
Grief, and not able longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his complaint, he reproaches
her in the softest Language that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Love and Grief invented; while
she weeps with Shame and divided
Love, and demands of him a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pardons; she deals thus kindly
at least with him to confess this
Truth; that 'twas impossible, but
at the approach of a Man who
taught her first to love, and for
which Knowledge she had paid so
infinitely dear, she could not but
feel unusual Motions, that that Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and Infant Flame he once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
could not but have left some
warmth about her Heart, and that
<hi>Philander,</hi> the once charming dear
<hi>Philander,</hi> could never be absolutely
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56143:488"/>
to her as a common Man, and beg'd
that he would give some grains of
allowance to a Maid, so soft by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and who had once lov'd so
well to be undone for the dear Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and tho' every kind word she
gave his Rival was a Dagger at his
Heart, nevertheless, he found, or
would think he found some reason
in what she said; at least he seem'd
more appeased, while she on the
other side dissembled all the ease
and repose of Mind, that could flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him to Calmness.</p>
                  <p>You must know that for <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
Honour, she had Lodgings by her
self, and <hi>Octavio</hi> had his in another
House, at an Aunts of his, a Widow,
and a Woman of great Quality; and
<hi>Silvia</hi> being near her Lying-in, had
provided all things with the greatest
Magnificence imaginable, and past
for a Young Widow whose Husband
died at the Siege of—<hi>Octavio</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
visited her daily, and all the
Nights she had to her self. For he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56143:489"/>
treated her as one whom he design'd
to make his Wife, and one whose
Honour was his own; but that
Night the News of <hi>Philander</hi>'s Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
was told her, she was more than
ordinary impatient to have him gone
pretending Illness, and yet seem'd
loth to let him go, and Lovers (the
greatest Cullies in Nature, and the
aptest to be deceived, tho' the most
quick-sighted)—do the soonest
believe; and finding it the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
he should depart, the more
ill she feign'd to be, he took his
Leave, and left her to her Repose,
after taking all care necessary for
one in her Circumstances. But she,
to make his Absence more sure, and
fearing least he should suspect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of her Design, being herself
Guilty, she orders him to be call'd
back, and Caresses him anew, tells
him she was never more unwilling
to part with him, and all the while
is complaining and wishing to be
in Bed: And says he must not stir
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56143:489"/>
till he sees her laid. This obliges
and cajoles him anew, and he will
not suffer her Women to undress
her, but does the grateful Business
himself, and reaps some dear Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
by every Service, and pleases
his Eyes and Lips with the ravishing
Beauties of the loose unguarded suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Fair one. She permits him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing to have him gone, which
was not till he saw her laid as if
to her Rest: But he was no sooner
got into his Coach, but she rose and
slip'd on her Night-Gown and some
other loose things, and got into a
Chair, commanding her Page to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
the Chair-men to all the great
<hi>Cabarets:</hi> Where she believed it most
likely to find <hi>Philander;</hi> which was
accordingly done; and the Page en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
enquires for such a <hi>Cavalier,</hi>
describing his Person and fine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
black Hair of his own:
But the first he entered into he saw
<hi>Brilljard</hi> bespeaking Supper: For
you must know that that Husband-Lover
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56143:490"/>
being left, as I have said, in
Prison in <hi>Holland,</hi> for the Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Octavio;</hi> the unhappy young
Noble Man was no sooner fled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the unlucky Death of his Uncle,
but the States set <hi>Brilljard</hi> at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
who took his Journey immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to <hi>Philander,</hi> whom he found
just released from his troublesome
Affair, and design'd for <hi>Bruxells,</hi>
where they arriv'd that very Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Where the first thing he did
was to go to the Nunnery of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
to inquire for the fair, <hi>Calista;</hi>
but instead of encountering the kind,
the impatient, the brave <hi>Calista,</hi> he
was addressed to by the old Lady
Abbess in so rough a manner, that he
no longer doubted upon what Terms
he stood there, tho' he wondered
how they should know his Story
with <hi>Calista:</hi> When to put him out
of Doubt, she assured him he should
never more behold the Face of her
injured Neece; for whose Revenge
she left him to Heaven. It was in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56143:490"/>
vain he kneel'd and implored; he
was confirm'd again and again she
should never come from out the
Confines of those Walls; and that
her whole remaining Life spent in
Penitence was too little to wash away
her Sins with him: And giving him
the Letter he sent to <hi>Octavio</hi> (which
<hi>Silvia</hi> had given <hi>Calista,</hi> and she the
Lady Abbess, with a full Confession
of her Fault) she cry'd; <hi>See there,
Sir, the Treachery you have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against a Woman of Quality—
whom your Criminal Love has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
the most Miserable of her Sex.</hi>
At the ending of which, she drew
the Curtain over the Grate and left
him, wholly amazed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
finding it to be the same he had
writ to <hi>Octavio,</hi> and in it that
he had writ to <hi>Silvia:</hi> By the sight
of which he no longer doubted but
that Confident had betrayed him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way. He rails on his false
Friendship, curses the Lady Abbess,
himself, his Fortune and his Birth;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56143:491"/>
but finds it all in vain: Nor was
he so infinitely afflicted with the
thought of the eternal Loss of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lista</hi>
(because he had possessed her)
as he was to find himself betray'd
to her, and doubtless to <hi>Silvia</hi> by
<hi>Octavio;</hi> and nothing but <hi>Calista</hi>'s
being confin'd from him (tho' she
were very dear and charming to his
Thoughts) could have made him
rave so extreamly for a Sight of her:
He loves her the more by how much
more it was impossible for him to
see her; and that Difficulty and his
Dispair increased his Flame. In this
Humour he went to his Lodging,
the most undone Extravagant that
ever rag'd with Love. He considers
her in a place where no Art or
force of Love, or humane Wit can
retrieve her; no nor so much as send
her a Letter. This added to his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and in his first wild Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he resolves nothing less than
firing the Monastery, that in that
Confusion he might Seize his right
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56143:491"/>
of Love; and do a Deed that would
render his Name as famous as the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Youth, who to get a Fame,
tho' an Inglorious one, fired the
Temple of their Gods. But his Rage
abating by Consideration, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
dwelt not long with him:
And he ran over a number more,
till from one to another he reduced
himself to a degree of Moderation,
which presented him with some flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Hope, that gave him a little
Ease: 'Twas then that <hi>Chivalier To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso,</hi>
and another <hi>French</hi> Gentleman
of <hi>Cesario</hi>'s Faction (who were new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arrived in <hi>Bruxells</hi>) came to pay
him their Respects: And after a
while carried him into the Park to
walk, where <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Page had seen
him; and from whence they sent
<hi>Brilljard</hi> to bespeak Supper at this
<hi>Cabaret,</hi> where <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Chair
and herself waited, and where the
Page found <hi>Brilljard,</hi> of whom he
asked for his Lord; but understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he would not possibly come in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:56143:492"/>
some Hours, being design'd for
Court that Evening, whither he was
obliged to go and kiss the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
Hands, he went to the Lady,
who was almost dead with Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and told her what he had
learn'd: Upon which she ordered
her Chairmen to carry her back to
her Lodgings, for she would not be
perswaded to ask any Questions of
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> for whom she had a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Hate: However she resolved to
send the Page back with a Billet to
wait <hi>Philander</hi>'s coming; which was
not long; for having sooner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
their Complement at Court
than they believed they should, they
went all to Supper together, where
<hi>Brilljard</hi> had bespoke it: Where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impatient to learn all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of <hi>Cesario</hi> since his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from him, and of which no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could give so good an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as <hi>Chivalier Tomaso, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
gave order that no body
whomsoever should disturb them,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56143:492"/>
and sate himself down to listen to
the Fortune of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>You know, my Lord, said <hi>Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi>
the state of Things at your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture;
and that all our glorious
Designs for the Liberty of all <hi>France</hi>
were discovered and betray'd by some
of those little Rascals, that great
Men are obliged to make use of in
the greatest Designs: Upon whose
Confession you were proscrib'd, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
this Gentleman, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
It was our good Fortunes to
escape untaken, and yours to fall
first into the Messenger's Hands, and
carried to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> even from
whence you had the Luck to escape:
But it was not so with <hi>Cesario. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi>
cry'd <hi>Philander, the Prince I
hope is not taken?</hi> Not so neither,
reply'd <hi>Tomaso,</hi> nor should you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you have receiv'd no News of
him in a long time, since forty
thousand Crowns being offered for
his Head, or to any that could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him, it would have exposed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56143:493"/>
him to have written to any body,
he being beset on all sides with Spies
from the King; so that it 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to venture a Letter without
very great Hazzard of his Life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all these Hindrances, <hi>Cesario,</hi>
who, you know, was ever a great
admirer of the fair Sex, happen'd in
this his Retreat to fall most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
in Love: Nor could the fears
of Death, which alarm'd him on all
sides, deterr him from this new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
Which because it has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to some part of his Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I cannot omit, especially to
your Lordship, his Friend, to whom
every Circumstance of that Princes
Fate and Fortune will be of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
                  <p>You must imagin, my Lord, that
your Seizure and Escape was enough
to alarm the whole Party; and there
was not a Man of the League who
did not think it high time to look
about him, when one, so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as your Lordship, was surpriz'd.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56143:493"/>
Nor did the Prince himself any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
believe himself safe; but retired
himself under the darkness of the
following Night: He went only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with his Page, to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
House, a Widow of Quality in
<hi>Paris,</hi> that populous City; being as
he conceived, the securest Place to
conceal himself in. This Lady was
Madam the Countess of—who
had, as you know, my Lord, one
only Daughter, Madam <hi>Osell Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione,</hi>
the Heiress of her Family.
The Prince knew this young Lady
had a Tenderness for him ever since
they were both very young, which
first took beginning in a Mask at
Court, where she then acted <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and danced so exceeding finely,
that she gave our young Hero new
Desire, if not absolute Love; and
charm'd him at least into Wishes.
She was then old enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
she conquered, as well as to
make a Conquest: And she was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving Impressions, as well
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56143:494"/>
as to give 'em: And it was believed
by some who were very near the
Prince, and knew all his Secrets then,
that this young Lady pitied the
Sighs of the Royal Lover, and even
then rewarded 'em: And tho' this
were most credibly whispered, yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it seems impossible he should
then have been happy, and after so
many Years, after the Possession of
so many other Beauties, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her again, and find all the
Passions and Pains of a beginning
Flame. But there is nothing to be
wondered at in the Contradictions
and Humours of Man's human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But however inconstant and
wavering he had been, <hi>Hermione</hi>
retain'd her first Passion for him; and
that I less wonder at, since you know
the Prince has the most charming
Person in the World, and is the most
perfectly Beautiful of all his Sex:
To this his Youth and Quality adds
no little Lustre; and I should not
wonder if all the softer Sex should
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:56143:494"/>
languish for him, nor that any one
should love on—who hath once
been touch'd with Love for him.
'Twas this last Assurance the Prince
so absolutely depended on, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
she was far from the
Opinion of his Party) made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to take Sanctuary in those Arms
he was sure would receive him in any
Condition and Circumstances. But
now he makes her new Vows, which
possibly at first his Safety obliged
him to, while she return'd 'em with
all the Passion of Love. He made a
thousand Submissions to Madam the
Countess, who he knew was fond
of her Daughter to that degree, that
for her Repose she was even willing
to behold the Sacrifice of her. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to this Prince, whom she knew
<hi>Hermione</hi> loved even to Death; so
fond, so blindly fond is Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And indeed after a little time that
he lay there conceal'd, he reap'd all
the Satisfaction that Love could give
him, or his Youth could wish, with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56143:495"/>
all the Freedom imaginable. He
only made Vows of renouncing all
other Women, what Ties or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
soever he had upon him;
and to resign himself intirely up to
<hi>Hermione.</hi> I know not what new
Charms he had found by frequent
Conversation with her, and being
uninterrupted by the sight of any
other Ladies; but 'tis most certain,
my Lord, he grew to that excess of
Love, or rather Doatage (if Love
in one so young, can be call'd so)
that he languishes for her, even while
he possessed her all: He dy'd, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
by Company to retire from
her an Hour, at the end of which,
being again brought to her, he would
fall at her Feet, and sigh, and weep,
and make the most pitious Moan that
ever Love inspir'd. He would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
upon the Cruelty of a Moments
Absence, and vow he could not live
where she was not. All that distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
his Happiness, he reproach'd as
Enemies to his Repose, and at last
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56143:495"/>
made her feign an Illness, that no
Visits might be made her, and that
he might possess all her Hours. Nor
did <hi>Hermione</hi> perceive all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making her Advantages of so
glorious an Opportunity; but with
the usual Cunning of her Sex, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
every Minute she gave him: She
now found herself sure of the Heart
of the finest Man in the World;
and of one she believed would prove
the greatest, being the Head of a
most powerful Faction, who were
resolved the first Opportunity to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Affairs so as to come to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Rebellion, and to make him a
King. All these things, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
soever in Reason, her Love
and Ambition suggested to her; so
that she believed she had but one
Game more to play to establish her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the greatest and most happy
Woman in the World. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults
in this weighty Affair with her
Mother, who had a share of Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that could carry on a Design
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56143:496"/>
as well as any of her Sex. They
found but one Obstacle to all <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione</hi>'s
rising Greatness; and that
was the Prince's being married; and
that to a Lady of so considerable
Birth and Fortune, so eminent for
her Vertue, and all Perfections of
Woman-kind; and withal so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for Wit and Beauty, that 'twas
impossible to find any Cause of a
Separation between 'em. So that
finding it improbable to remove that
Lett to her Glories, she grew very
Melancholy; which was soon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the too Amorous Prince, who
pleads, and sighs, and weeps on her
Bosom Day and Night to find the
Cause: But she, who found she had
a difficult Game to play, and that
she had need of all her little Aids,
pretends a thousand little frivillous
Reasons before she discovers the true
one; which serv'd but to oblige him
to ask anew, as she design'd he should
—At last, one Morning, finding
him in the softest fit in the World,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56143:496"/>
and ready to give her whatever she
could ask in return for the Secret of
her Disquiet, she told him with a
Sigh, how Unhappy she was in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so violently a Man who could
never be any thing to her more than
the Robber of her Honour: And at
last with abundance of Sighs and
Tears bewail'd his Marriage—
He taking her with all the Joy
imaginable in his Arms, thank'd her
for speaking of the only thing he had
a thousand times been going to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to her, but durst not for fear she
should Reproach him. He told her
he look'd upon himself as married
to no Woman but herself, to whom,
by a thousand solemn Vows he had
contracted himself, and that he would
never own any other while he liv'd,
let Fortune do what she pleas'd with
him. <hi>Hermione</hi> thriving hitherto so
well, urged his easy Heart yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and told him, Tho' she had left
no Doubt remaining in her of his
Love and Vertue, no suspicion of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:56143:497"/>
his Vows, yet the World would still
esteem the Princess his Wife, and
herself only as a Prostitute to his
Youthful Pleasure; and as she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
her Birth and Fortune not to
be much inferior to that of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
she should die with Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Shame, to bear all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of his Wantonness, while his
now Wife would live esteem'd and
pitied as an injured Innocent. To
all which he reply'd, as mad in Love,
That the Princess, he confess'd, was
a Lady to whom he had Obligations,
but that he esteem'd her no more his
Wife, since he was married to her
at the Age of twelve Years; an Age
wherein he was not capacitated to
chuse Good or Evil, or to answer
for himself, or his Inclinations: And
tho' she were a Lady of absolute
Vertue, of Youth, Wit and Beauty;
yet Fate had so ordain'd it, that he
had reserv'd his Heart to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
intirely for herself; and that he
renounc'd all Pretenders to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56143:497"/>
herself; that he had now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
the Princess for the space of
twenty Years; that Youth had a
long Race to run, and could not take
up at those Years with one single
Beauty: That hitherto Ravage and
Destruction of Hearts had been his
Province and Glory, and that he
thought he had never lost time but
when he was a little while Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
But now he was fix'd to all
he would ever possess whilst he had
Breath; and that she was both his
Mistress and his Wife; his eternal
Happiness, and the end of all his
Loving. 'Tis there he said he would
remain as in his first state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
That hitherto his Ambition
had been above his Passion, but that
now his Heart was so intirely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
to this fair Charmer (for so he
call'd and thought her) that he could
be content to live and die in the
Glory of being hers alone, without
wishing for Liberty or Empire, but
to render her more Glorious. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:56143:498"/>
things tender and fond he said
to this purpose, and the result of all
ended in most solemn Vows, That if
ever Fortune favoured him with a
Crown, he would fix it on her Head,
and make her in spight of all former
Ties and Obligations Queen of
<hi>France.</hi> This was sufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
her Sighs and Tears, and she
remain'd intirely satisfied of his
Vows, which were exchanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Madam the Countess, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by all the binding Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Love on his side could invent,
and Ambition and Subtilty on hers.
When I came at any time to visit
him, which by stealth a-nights I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
did, to take Orders from him
how I should act in all things (tho'
I lay conceal'd like himself) he would
tell me all that had passed between
him and <hi>Hermione.</hi> I suppose, not
so much for the reposing the Secret
in my Breast, as out of a fond Pleasure
to be relating Passages of his Doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>age,
and repeating her Name, which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56143:498"/>
was ever in his Mouth: I saw she
had reduc'd him to a great degree of
Slavery, and could not look tamely
on while a Hero so young, so gay,
so great, and so hopeful, lay idling
away his precious Time, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing, either in order for his
own Safety or Ambition. 'Twas, my
Lord, a great pity to see how his
noble Resolution was changed, and
how he was perfectly effeminated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
soft Woman. I indeavoured at last
to rouse him from this Lethargy of
Love; and argued with him the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reason, that in my Opinion he
had to be so charm'd. I told him <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione,</hi>
of all the Beauties of <hi>France,</hi>
was esteemed one of the meanest, and
that if ever she had gain'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
(as many she was infamously
fam'd for) it was purely the force of
her Youth and Quality; but that
now that Bloom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was past, and
she was one of those, which in
less quality, we call'd Old. At these
Reproaches of his Judgment, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:56143:499"/>
perceiv'd him to blush, but more
with Anger than Shame. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
according to the Vogue of the
Town, he found there was Reason
in what I said, and which he could
only contradict by saying however
she was, she appeared all otherwise
to him: He blam'd me a little kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for my hard Words against her,
and began to swear to me he thought
her all over Charm. He vow'd
there was absolute Fascination in her
Eyes and Tongue. <hi>'Tis confess'd,</hi>
said he, <hi>she has not much of Youth,
nor of that which we agree to call Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but she has a Grace so Masculine,
an Air so Ravishing, a Wit and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
so absolutely made to charm, that
they all together sufficiently recompense
for her want of Delicacy in Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Feature: And in a word, my</hi>
Tomaso, cry's he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imbracing me;
<hi>she is, tho' I know not what, or how, a
Maid that compels me to adore her;
she has a natural Power to please a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the rest of her dull Sex; and I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56143:499"/>
can abate her a Face and Shape, and
yet vie her for Beauty with any of
the celebrated ones of</hi> France.</p>
                  <p>I found by the manner of his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, that he was really charm'd,
and past all Retrieve; bewitch'd to
this Lady. I found it vain therefore
to press him to a Separation, or to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
his Passion; but on the contrary
told him there was a time for all
things; if Fate had so ordain'd it
that he must love. But I besought
him with all the Eloquence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Duty and Friendship not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his Passion to surmount his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and his Reason, so far as to
neglect his Interest and Safety; and
for a little Pleasure with a Woman,
suffer all his Friends to perish that
had woven their Fortunes with his,
and must stand or fall as he thriv'd:
I implor'd him not to cast away the
<hi>Good Cause</hi> which was so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd,
and that yet, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Discourse, might all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved
by his Conduct and good
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:56143:500"/>
Management. That I knew, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the King appeared in outward
shew to be offended, that it was yet
in his Power to calm the greatest
Tempest this Discovery had raised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That 'twas but casting himself at
his Majesty's Feet, and begging his
Mercy, by a Confession of the Truth
of some part of the Matter; and that
it was impossible he could fail of a
Pardon from so indulgent a Monarch
as he had offended: That there
was no Action could wholly raze
out of the Kings Heart that Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and Passion he had ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
towards him; and his Peace
might be made with all the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
imaginable. To this he urged
a very great Reluctancy, and cry'd
he would sooner die, than by a
Confession expose the Lives of his
Friends, and let the World see their
whole Design before they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct it: And not only so, but
put it past all their Industry ever to
bring so hopeful a Plot about again.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56143:500"/>
At this I smil'd, and asking his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Pardon, told him I was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Opinion, as most of the Heads
of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were, That what
he said to his Majesty in Private
could never possibly be made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:
That his Majesty would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself with the Knowledge of
the Truth, without caring to satisfy
the World, so greatly to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of a Prince of the Blood, and a
Man so very dear to him as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
He urg'd the Fears this would
give those of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and alarm 'em with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Apprehensions, that it would
discover every Man of 'em, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raveling
the Intrigue. To this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
That their Fears would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short liv'd; for as soon as he
had by his Submission and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
gained his Pardon, he had no
more to do but to renounce all he
had said, leave the Court, and put
himself into the Protection of his
Friends, who were ready to receive
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56143:501"/>
him. That he need but appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
a little time, and he would see
himself address'd to again by all of the
<hi>Hugonot</hi> Party, who would quickly
put him into a Condition of fearing
nothing.</p>
                  <p>My Councel, with the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
from all of Quality of the
Party, who came to see him, was at
last approved of by him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to say a thousand things to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
me of his Fidelity to his Friends
and the Faction, which he vow'd
never to forsake for any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
but to stand or fall in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
and that he was resolved to
be a King or Nothing; and that he
would put in Practice all the Arts
and Stratagems of Cunning, as well
as Force, to attain to this Glorious
End, however crooked and indirect
they might appear to Fools. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he conceived the first necessary
Step to this, was the getting his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
to gain a little time to manage
things anew, to the best Advantage:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56143:501"/>
That at present all things were at
a stand without Life or Motion,
wanting the sight of himself who
was the very Life and Soul of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Axel-tree that could turn
the Wheel of Fortune round again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now he had talk'd himself
into Sense again; he cry'd—</hi> Oh

my Soul is on the Wing, and ready
to take its Flight through any Hazzard.
—<hi>But sighing, on a suddain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

a celebrated Beauty: One, whom it
was imagined, the King, and several
after him at Court, had made a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
with—On this he paused
for some time, and reflected on his
Passion for <hi>Silvia;</hi> and this fantastick
Intrigue of the Prince's inspired
him with a kind of Curiosity to try,
whether fleeting Love would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him back again to this abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Maid. In these Thoughts, and
such Discourse, they passed away the
time during Supper; which ended,
and a fresh Bottle brought to the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:56143:502"/>
Table, with a new Command that
none should interrupt 'em: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<hi>Philander</hi> obliged <hi>Tomaso</hi> to
give him a farther Account of the
Princes Proceedings; which he did
in this manner:</p>
                  <p>My Lord, having left my Prince,
as I imagined, very well resolved,
I spoke of it to as many of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as I could conveniently meet with,
to prepare 'em for the Discovery I
believed the Prince would pretend to
make, that they should not by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alarm'd at the first News of it,
put themselves into Fears that might
indeed discover 'em: Nor would I
suffer <hi>Cesario</hi> to rest, but daily saw
him, or rather nightly stole to him,
to keep up his Resolution: And
indeed, in spight of Love, to
which he had made himself so intire
a Slave, I brought him to his own
House, to visit Madam his Wife,
who was very well at Court, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
her Husbands ill Conduct, as
they call'd it. The King being, as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:56143:503"/>
you know, my Lord, extreamly kind
to that deserving Lady, often made
her Visits, and would without very
great Impatiency hear her plead for
her Husband, the Prince; and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
it was not ungrateful to him:
All this we daily learn'd from a
Page, who secretly brought Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from Madam the Princess:
So that we conceived it wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Interest of the Prince,
that he should live in a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
with this prudent Lady.
To this end he feigned more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
than usual to her, and as soon
as it was dark, every Evening made
her his Visits. One Evening among
the rest, he happened to be there,
just as the Proclamation came forth
of four thousand Crowns to any
that could discover him; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
half an Hour after came the King
to visit the Princess, as every Night
he did; her Lodging being in the
Court: The King came without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Notice, and with a very
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:56143:503"/>
slender Train that Night; so that
he was almost in the Princess's Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
before any body inform'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her he was there; so that the Prince
had no time to retire but into Madam
the Princess's <hi>Cabaret,</hi> the Door of
which, she immediately locking, made
such a Noise and Bustle that it was
heard by his Majesty, who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
had passed it by, if her Confusion
and Blushes had not farther betray'd
her, with the unusual Address she
made to the King: Who therefore
asked her who she had conceal'd in
her Closet. She endeavoured to put
him off with some feign'd Replies,
but 'twould not do; the more her
Confusion, the more the King was
inquisitive, and urged her to give
him the Key of her <hi>Cabaret:</hi> But
she, who knew the Life of the Prince
would be in very great Danger,
should he be taken so, and knew on
the other side. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat to deny it would
betray the Truth as much as his
Discovery would, and cause him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56143:504"/>
to force the Key or the Door,
fell down at his Feet, and wetting
his Shooes with her Tears, and grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Knees in her trembling Arms,
implor'd that Mercy and Pity for
the Prince her Husband, whom her
Vertue had rendered dear to her,
however Criminal he appear'd to
his Majesty: She told him his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had more peculiarly the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of a God than any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
upon Earth, and never heard
the Wretched or the Innocent plead
in vain. She told him that herself
and her Children, who were dearer
to her than Life, should all be as
Hostages for the good Conduct and
Duty of the Prince's future Life
and Actions: And they would all
be obliged to suffer any Death, tho'
never so ignominious, upon the least
breaking out of her Lord: That he
should utterly abandon those of the
<hi>reformed Religion,</hi> and yield to what
Articles his Majesty would graciously
be pleased to impose, quitting all his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:56143:504"/>
false and unreasonable Pretensions to
the Crown, which was only the
Effects of the Flattery of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot
Party,</hi> and the <hi>Male-Contents.</hi>
Thus with the Vertue and Goodness
of an Angel, she pleaded with such
moving Eloquence, mix'd with
Tears, from beautiful Eyes, that she
fail'd not to soften the royal Heart,
who knew not how to be deaf when
Beauty pleaded: Yet he would not
seem to yield so suddenly, least it
should be imagined he had too light
a Sense of his Treasons, which, in
any other great Man, would have
been punished with no less than
Death: Yet, as she pleaded, he grew
calmer, and suffered it without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
till she waited for his
Reply; and obliged him by her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to speak. He numbers up the
Obligations he had heaped on her
Husband; how he had, by putting
all Places of great Command and
Interest into his Hands, made him
the greatest Prince and Favourite, of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56143:505"/>
a Subject, in the World; and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
happier than a Monarch:
That he had all the Glory and Power
of one, and wanted but the Care:
All the Sweets of Empire, while all
that was disagreeable and toilsom,
remain'd with the Title alone. He
therefore upbraided him with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Ingratitude, and want of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
with all the Folly of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Youth: And left nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
that might make the Princess
sensible it was too late to hide any
of his Treasons from him, since they
were all but too apparent to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.
'Twas therefore that she ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
nothing but his Royal Mercy
and Forgiveness, without indeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to lessen his Guilt, or inlarge
on his Innocency. In fine, my Lord,
so well she spoke, that at last she
had the Joy to perceive the happy
Effects of her Wit and Goodness,
which had mov'd Tears of Pity and
Compassion from his Majesty's Eyes;
which was <hi>Cesario</hi>'s Cue to come
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56143:505"/>
forth, as immediately he did (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heard all that had pass'd)
and threw himself at his Majesty's
Feet: And this was the critical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
he was to snatch for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Point, and of which he made
a most admirable use. He call'd up
all the Force of necessary Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Tenderness to his Voice, Tears
to his Eyes, and Trembling to his
Hands, that stay'd the too willing
and melting Monarch by his Robe,
till he had heard him implore, and
granted him his Pity: Nor did he
quit his Hold, till the King cry'd
with a soft Voice—Rise—at
which he was assured of what he
asked. He refused however to rise,
till the Pardon was pronounced. He
own'd himself the greatest Criminal
in Nature; that he was drawn from
his Allegiance by the most subtile
Artifices of his Enemies, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
false Friendships had allur'd his
Hopes with gilded Promises; and
which he now too plainly saw were
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56143:506"/>
Designs to propagate their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interests, and not his Glory.
He humbly besought his Majesty
to make some gracious Allowances
for his Vanities of Youth, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
now he had so dearly bought
Discretion, at almost the price of
his Majesty's eternal Displeasure,
that he would reform, and lead so
good a Life, so absolutely from any
appearance of Ambition, that his
Majesty should see he had not a
more faithful Subject than himself.
In fine, he found himself, by this
Acknowledgment he had begun
with, to advance yet farther: Nor
would his Majesty be satisfied
without the whole Scene of the
Matter; and how they were to have
surprized and seized him; where,
and by what Numbers. All which
he was forc'd to give an Account
of; since now to have fallen back,
when he was in their Hands, had
been his infallible Ruine. All
which he perform'd with as much
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:56143:506"/>
Tenderness and Respect to his
Friends concern'd, as if his own Life
had been depending: And tho' he
were extreamly prest to discover
some of the great ones of the Party,
he would never give his consent to
an Action so mean, as to be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
All that could be got from
him farther, was, to promise his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to give under his Hand, what
he had in private confess'd to him;
with which the King remained very
well satisfy'd, and order'd him to
come to Court the next day. Thus
for that Night they parted, with
infinite Caresses on the King's part,
and no little Joy on his. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
was no sooner gone, but he
gave immediate order to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries
of State, to draw up his
Pardon, which was done, with good
Speed, that he had it in his own
Hands the next day. When he came
to Court 'tis not to be imagined the
Surprize it was to all to behold the
Man, in the greatest State imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:56143:507"/>
who but Yesterday was to
have been Crucified at any Price:
And those, who most exclaim'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, were the first who paid
him Homage, and caress'd him at the
highest rate; only the most Wise
and Judicious, prophesied his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were not of a long Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The King made no Visits
where the Prince did not publickly
appear: He told all People, with
infinite Joy, that the Prince had
confessed the whole Plot, and that
he would give it under his Hand
and Seal, in order to having it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
thro'out all <hi>France,</hi> for the
Satisfaction of all those who had
been deluded and deceived by our
specious Pretences; and for the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of those, who had any ways ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to so pernicious a Villainy: So
that he met with nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
from those of our own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at Court: For there were many,
who, hitherto were unsuspected,
and who now, out of fear of being
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56143:507"/>
betray'd by the Prince, were ready
to fall at the Kings Feet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
all: Others there were, that
left the Court and Town upon it.
In fine, the face of things seem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
altered, while the Prince
bore himself like a Person who had
the Misfortune justly to lie beneath
the Exclamations of a disobliged
Multitude, as they at least imagined,
and bore all, as if their Fears had
been true, without so much as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
at his Justification, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his Majesty's good Opinion of
him: He added to his Pardon a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of twenty thousand Crowns;
half of it being paid the next day
after his coming to Court. And in
short, my Lord, his Majesty grew
so fond of the Prince, he could not
indure to suffer him out of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and was never satisfied with
seeing him: He carried him the
next day to the publick <hi>Theatre</hi> with
him, to show the World he was
reconcil'd. But by this time he had
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56143:508"/>
all confirm'd, and grew impatient
to declare himself to his Friends,
whom he would not have remain
long in their ill Opinion of him.
It happened, the third day of his
coming to Court (in returning some
of those Visits he had received from
all the great Persons.) he went to
wait upon the Dutchess of—a
Lady who had ever had a tender
Respect for the Prince: In the time
of this Visit, a young Lady of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
happen'd to come in; one whom
your Lordship knows a great Wit,
and much esteemed at Court, <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moisell
Mariana:</hi> By this Lady he
found himself welcom'd to Court
with all the Demonstrations of Joy;
as also by the old Dutchess, who
had divers times heretofore perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Prince to leave the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi>
and return to the King and
Court: She used to tell him he was
a handsome Youth, and she loved
his Mother well; that he danc'd
finely, and she had rather see him
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56143:508"/>
in a Ball at Court, than in Rebellion
in the Field; and often to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her Love would rally him;
and now shew'd no less concern of
Joy for his Reconciliation; and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on him, as a true Convert, fell
a-railing, with all the Malice and
Wit she could invent, at those pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
spirited Knaves who had sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him. She rail'd me, and cursed
those Politicks which had betray'd
him, to almost Ruine it self. The
Prince heard her, with all the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he could, for some time, but
when he found her touch him so
tenderly, and name his Friends, as
if he had own'd any such ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
his Colour came into his
Face, and he could not forbear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
us with all the Force of
Friendship. He told her he knew
of no such Seducers, no Villains of
the Party, nor of any trayterous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
that either himself, or any Man
in <hi>France,</hi> had ever harboured: At
which, she growing to upbraid him,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56143:509"/>
in a manner too passionate, he thought
it decent to end his Visit, and left
her very abruptly. At his going
out he met with the Duke of—
Brother to the Dutchess, going to
visit her: <hi>En passant</hi> a very indifferent
Ceremony pass'd on both sides, for
this Duke never had entertain'd a
Friendship, or scarce Respect for <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario;</hi>
but going into his Sister's, the
Dutchess her Chamber, he found her
all in a Rage at the Princes so publick
Defence of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and their
Allies; and the Duke entering, they
told him what had pass'd. This
was a very great Pleasure to him,
who had a mortal Hate at this time
to the Prince. He made his Visit
very short, hastens to Court, and
went directly to the King, and told
him how infinitely he found his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
mistaken in the imagined Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Prince; and then told
him what he had said at the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of—Lodgings, and had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd
he ever confess'd any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:56143:509"/>
Design against his Majesty,
and gave 'em the Lye, who durst
charge him with any such Villainy.
The King, who was unwilling to
credit what he wished not true, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told the Duke, he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, but that it was the Malice
of his Enemies who had forg'd this;
the Duke reply'd, he would bring
those to his Majesty, that heard the
Words: Immediately thereupon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
away his Page, to begg the
Dutchess would come to Court, with
<hi>Madamoisell Mariana.</hi> The Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
suspecting the truth of the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and unwilling to do the Prince
an ill Office, excused herself, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
word she was ill of the Colick.
But <hi>Mariana,</hi> who lov'd the King's
Interest, and found the Ingratitude,
as she call'd it, of the prime, hasted
in her Chair to Court, and justified
all the Duke had said; who being a
Woman of great Wit and Honour,
found that Credit which the Duke
fail'd of, as an open Enemy to the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56143:510"/>
Prince. About an hour after the
Prince appeared at Court, and
found the face of Things changed
extreamly; and those, who before
had kiss'd his Hand, and were proud
of every smile from him: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him with coldness, and scarce
made way as he past. However,
he went on to the Presence and found
the King, whose looks were also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much changed; who taking him
into the Bed-Chamber, show'd him
his whole Confession, drawn up
ready for him to sign, as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
tho' he never intended any
such thing; and now resolv'd to die
rather than do it: He took it in his
Hand, while the King cry'd,—
<hi>Here keep your Word, and Sign your
Narrative.—Stay, Sir,</hi> replied
the Prince, <hi>I have the Council of my
Friends to ask first, in so weighty an
Affair.</hi> The King confirm'd in all
he had heard, no longer doubted but
he had been too cunning for him;
and going out in a very great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:56143:510"/>
he only cry'd,—<hi>Sir, if
you have any better Friends than my
self, I leave you to 'em;</hi>—and with
this left him. The Prince was very
glad he had got the Confession-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
hoping it would never come
to light again; the King was the
only person to whom he had made
the Confession, and he was but one
Accuser; and him he thought the
Party could at any time be too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
to oppose, all being easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
on their side, and nothing on
that of the Court. After this, in
the Evening, the King going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
Madam the Dutchess of—for
whom he had a very great Esteem,
and whither every Day the whole
Court followed him: The Prince,
with all the assurance imaginable,
made his Court there also; but he was
no sooner come into the Presence,
but he perceived Anger in the Eyes
of that Monarch, who had indeed a
peculiar Greatness and Firceness there
when Angry: A Minute after he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:56143:511"/>
sent Monsieur—to the Prince,
with a command to leave the Court;
and without much Ceremony he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
departed, and went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>Hermione,</hi> who with all
the impatience of Love expected
him; nor was much surprized to
find him Banisht the Court: For he
made her acquainted with his most
Secret Designs; who having made
all his Interests her own, Espoused
whatever related to him, and was
capable of retaining all with great
Fidelity: Nor had he quitted her
one Night, since his coming to
Court; and he hath often, with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
told me, <hi>Hermione</hi> was a Friend
as well as a Mistress, and one with
whom, when the first Play was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he could Discourse with of use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things of State, as well as Love;
and improve in both the Noble My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
by her Charming Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Night of this second Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
I went to <hi>Hermione</hi>'s to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
him, where we Discours'd what
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56143:511"/>
was next to be done. He did not
think his Pardon was sufficient to
secure him, and he was not willing
to trust a King who might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that that Tenderness he
had for him, was absolutely against
the Peace and Quiet of all <hi>France.</hi>
I was of this Opinion, so that upon
farther debate, we thought it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary to quit <hi>France,</hi> till
the Courts heat should be a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and that the King might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
himself, by his absence, in
more Tranquillity than he really is.
In order to this, he made me take
my Flight into <hi>Flanders,</hi> here to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
all things necessary against his
coming, and I received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to seek you out, and beg you
would attend his coming hither. I
expect him every Day. He told me
at parting he long'd to consult with
you how next to play this mighty
Game, on which so many Kingdoms
are staked, and which he is resolv'd
to win or be nothing. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:56143:512"/>
Relation, replied <hi>Philander,</hi>
we had of this Affair, but I never could
learn by what Artifice the Prince
brought about his good Fortune at
Court; but of your own Escape, I
have heard nothing, pray oblige me
with the Relation of it: <hi>Sir,</hi> said
Thomaso, <hi>there is so little worthy the
trouble you will take in hearing it, that
you may spare your self the Curiosity.
Sir,</hi> reply'd Philander, <hi>I alway had
too great a share in what concern'd
you not to be Curious of the Story.
In which,</hi> reply'd Thomaso, <hi>tho'
there be nothing Novel, I will satisfie
you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be pleas'd to know, my Lord, that
about a Week before our design was
fully discovered by some of our own
under-Rogues, I had taken a great
House in <hi>Fabour St. Iermins,</hi> for my
Mistress, whom you know, my
Lord, I had liv'd with for the space
of a Year. She was gone to drink
the Waters of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> for some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition,
and I had promised her
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56143:512"/>
all things should be fitted against her
return, agreeable to her Humour
and Desire; and indeed I spared no
cost to make her Apartment Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent:
And I believe few Women
of Quality could purchace one so
rich; for I lov'd the Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had Beauty and Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough to charm, tho' the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians</hi>
of the Royal Party call'd her
<hi>Nicky Nacky,</hi> which was given her
in derision to me, not to her, for
whom every body, for her own sake,
had a considerable Esteem. Besides,
my Lord, I had taken up Money
out of the Orphans and Widows
Bank from the Chamber of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and could very well afford to be La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
when I spent upon the publick
Stock. While I was thus ordering
all things, my <hi>Vallet</hi> came running
out of Breath to tell me, that being
at the <hi>Loovre,</hi> he saw several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
carried to the Secretaries Office,
with Messengers; and that inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
who they might be, he found
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56143:513"/>
they were two <hi>Parisians,</hi> who had
offered themselves to the Messengers,
to be carryed to be Examined about
a Plot, the Prince <hi>Cesario</hi> and those
of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> had to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
his Majesty, kill Monsieur his
Brother, and set all <hi>Paris</hi> in a
Flame: And as to what particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
related to my self; he said, That
I was named as the person design'd
to seize upon the King's Guards,
and dispatch Monsieur. This my
own Conscience told me was too
true for me to make any doubt, but
I was discovered; I therefore left a
Servant in the House, and in an
Hackney-Coach took my Flight. I
drove a little out of <hi>Paris</hi> till Night
and then returned again, as the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
part of the World where I could
conceal my self: I was not long in
studying who I should trust with my
Life and safety, but went directly to
the Palace of Madam the Countess of
—who you know, my Lord, was
a Widow, and a Woman who had
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56143:513"/>
for a year past, a most violent
Passion for me; but she being a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
who had made many such Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries,
and past her Youth, I had
had only a very great Respect and
Acknowledgment for her and her
Quality, and being obliged to her
for the Effects of her Tenderness,
shown upon several Occasions, I
could not but acquit my self like a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
to her, whenever I could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
and which, tho' I have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times feigned great Business to
prevent, yet I could not always be
ungrateful; and when I paid her my
Services, 'twas ever extreamly well
received; and because of her Quality,
and seting up for a second Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
she always took care to make
my Approaches to her in as conceal'd
a manner as possible; and only her
Porter, one Page, and one Woman,
knew this secret Amour; and for the
better carrying it on, I ever went in
a Hackney-Coach, least my Livery
should be seen at her Gate: And as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56143:514"/>
it was my Custom at other times,
so I now sent the Porter (whom, by
my Bounty and his Ladies, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
my own Creature) for the
Page, to come to me, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
did, and I desired him to let
his Lady know, I waited her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
That was the Word: He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
brought me Answer, that
by good Fortune his Lady was all
alone, and infinitely wishing she
knew where to send him for me:
and I immediately, at that good
News, ran up to her Chamber; where
I was no sooner come, but desiring
me to sit, she ordered her Porter to
be call'd, and gave him Orders, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of Life, not to tell of my
being in the House, whatever En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
should be made after me; and
having given the same Command to
her Page, she dismiss'd 'em, and
came to me, with all the Fear and
Trembling imaginable. <hi>Ah Monsieur,</hi>
cry'd she, falling on my Neck, <hi>we
are undone</hi>—I not imagining she
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56143:514"/>
had heard the News already; cry'd,
<hi>Why, is my Passion discovered? Ah,</hi>
reply'd she in Tears, <hi>I would to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
it were no worse! would all the
Earth had discovered that, which I
should esteem my Glory—But 'tis,
my charming Monsieur,</hi> continued she,
<hi>Your Treasons and not Amour, whose
discovery will be so fatal to me.</hi> At
this I seemed amaz'd, and beg'd
her to let me understand her: She
told me what I have said before;
and moreover, That the Council had
that very Evening issued out War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for me, and she admired how
I escaped. After a little Discourse
of this kind, I asked her what she
would advise me to do? for I was
very well assured the violent hate the
King had particularly for me, would
make him never consent I should
live on any terms: And therefore
'twas determined I should not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
my self; and she resolved
to run the risk of concealing me;
which in fine she did Three Days,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56143:515"/>
furnishing me with Money and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for my Flight. In this
time a Proclamation came forth and
offered five hundred Crowns for my
Head, or to Seize me alive or dead.
This Sum so wrought with the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Minds of Men, that no Art was
left unessay'd to take me: They
searcht all Houses, all Hackney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coaches
that pass'd by Night; and
did all that Avarice could inspire to
take me, but all in vain: At last this
glorious Sum so dazled the Mind of
Madam the Countess's Porter, that
he went to a Captain of the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and assured him, if the King
would give him the aforesaid Sum,
he would betray me, and bring him
the following Night to surprize me
without any Resistance: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
who thought, if the Porter
should have all the Sum, he should
get none; and every one hoping to
be the happy Man that should take
me and win the Prize, could not
indure another should have the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56143:515"/>
of both, and so never told the
King of the Offer the Porter had
made. But however Secret one
may imagine an Amour to be kept,
yet in so busie a place as <hi>Paris,</hi> and
the Apartments of the Court Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
this of ours had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed,
and the Intrigue more
than suspected: Whether this, or
the Captain before nam'd, imagined
to find me at the House of the
Countess, because her Porter had
made such an Offer; I say, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it was, the next Morning, upon
a <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Guards broke into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Chambers, and missing me, had
the Insolence to come to the Door
of that of the Countess; and she had
only time to slip on her Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gown,
and running to the Door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
them to have Respect to her
Sex and Quality, while I started from
my Bed, which was the same from
whence the Countess rose; and not
knowing where to hide, or what to
do, concealing my Clothes between
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:56143:516"/>
the Sheets, I mounted from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a great silver Sconce that was
fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tened to the Wall by the Bed-side,
and form thence made but one
Spring up to the Tester of the Bed;
which being one of those, raised with
strong wood-work, and Japan, I
could easily do; or rather it was by
Miracle I did it; and laid myself
along on the top, while my Back
touched the Cieling of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
by this time, when no Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
could prevail, they had burst
open the Chamber Door, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
directly to the Bed, they could
not believe their Eyes: They saw
no Person there, but the plain print
of two, with the Pillows for two
Persons. This gave them the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
to search farther, which they
did, with their Swords, under the
Bed, in every Corner, behind every
Curtain, up the Chimney, felt all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Wains<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot and Hangings for
false Doors, or Closets; survey'd
the Floor for a Trap-door: At last,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56143:516"/>
they found my fringed Gloves in
the Window, and the Shash a little
up, and then they concluded I had
made my Escape out at that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow:
This Thought they seem'd
confirm'd in, and therefore ran to
the Garden, where they thought I
had descended, and with my Gloves,
which they bore away, as the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of their almost gained Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they searched every Hedge and
Bush, Arbour, Grotto, and Tree;
but not being able to find what they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ought, they concluded me gone,
and told all the Town how very
near they were to seizing me. After
this, the very Porter and Page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
me escaped out at that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and there was no farther Search
made after me: But the Countess
was amazed, as much as any of the
Souldiers, to find which way I had
convey'd myself, when I came
down and undeceiv'd her; but when
she saw from whence I came, she
wondered more than before, how I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56143:517"/>
could get up so high; when trying the
trick again, I could not do it, if I
might have won never so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Wager upon it, without pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down the Sconce and the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
also.</p>
                  <p>After this, I remain'd there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discovered
the whole time the Prince
was at <hi>Hermione</hi>'s, till his coming
to Court, when I verily believed he
would have gained me my Pardon,
with his own; but the King had
sworn my final Destruction, if he
ever got me in his Power; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
me a Traytor, seiz'd all
they could find of mine. 'Twas
then that I believed it high time to
take my Flight; which, as soon as
I heard the Prince again in Disgrace,
I did, and got safely into <hi>Holland,</hi>
where I have remained about six
Weeks. But, oh! what is Woman?
The first News I heard, and that
was while I remain'd at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess's,
that my Mistriss, for whom
I had taken such Care, and who had
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56143:517"/>
professed to love me above all things,
no sooner heard I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>led and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
but retiring to a Friends
House (for her own was seized for
mine) and the Officers imagining
me there too, they came to search;
and a young <hi>Cavalier,</hi> of a noble
Aspect, great Wit and Courage, and
indeed a very fine Gentleman, was
the Officer that entered her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to search for me; who, being
at first sight, surprized with her
Beauty, and melted with her Tears,
fell most desperately in Love with
her, and after hearing how she had
lost all her Money, Plate, and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and rich Furniture, offered her
his Service to retrieve 'em, and did
do it; and from one Favour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
continued so to oblige the
fair fickle Creature, that he won,
with that and his handsom Mien,
a Possession of her Heart, and she
yielded in a weeks time to my most
mortal Enemy. And the Countess,
who, at my going from her, swound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:56143:518"/>
and bathed me all in Tears,
making a thousand Vows of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and never to favour Mankind
more: This very Woman, Sir, as
soon as my Back was turn'd, made
new Advances to a young Lord,
who, believing her to be none of
the most Faithful, would not trust
her under Matrimony: He being a
Man of no great Fortune, and she
a Mistriss of a very considerable one,
his standing off on these Terms, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
her the more; and I have
Advice that she is very much in
Love with him, and 'tis believed will
do what he desires of her: So that
I was no sooner abandoned by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but fickle Woman followed
her Example, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led me too. Thus,
my Lord, you have the History of
my double Unhappiness: And I am
waiting here a Fate which no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Wit can guess at: The Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of the Prince will give a little
Life to our Affair; and I yet have
Hope to see him in <hi>Paris,</hi> at the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56143:518"/>
Head of forty thousand <hi>Hugonots,</hi> to
revenge all the Insolences we have
suffered.</p>
                  <p>After discoursing of several things,
and of the Fate of several Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was Bed-time, and they taking Leave,
each Man departed to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philander,</hi> while he was undres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
being alone with <hi>Brilljard,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to discourse of <hi>Silvia,</hi> and to
take some care of letting her know
he was arrived at <hi>Bruxells;</hi> who
even yet retained some unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hope, as Lovers do, of one day
being happy with that fair one; and
believing he could not be so, with
so much Facility, while she was in
the Hands of <hi>Octavio,</hi> as those of
<hi>Philander,</hi> whould never tell his Lord
his Sentiments of her Conduct, nor
of her Love to <hi>Octavio,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Passages that had occur'd in
<hi>Holland:</hi> He only cry'd, he believ'd
she might be overcome, being left
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56143:519"/>
to herself, and by the Merits and
good Fashion of <hi>Octavio;</hi> but would
not give his Master an absolute Fear,
or any account of Truth; that he
might live with her again if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as before; and that she might
hold herself so obliged to him for his
Silence in these Affairs, as might one
day render him happy. These were
the unweighed Reasons he gave for
deluding his Lord into a Kind Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the fickle Maid: But ever
when he named <hi>Silvia, Philander</hi>
could perceive his Blushes rise, and
from 'em, believ'd there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
behind in his Thought, which
he had a mind to know: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pressed him to the last degree,
—and cry'd—<hi>Come—confess
to me,</hi> Brilljard, <hi>the reason of your
Blushes: I know you are a Lover, and I
was content to suffer you my Rival,
knowing your Respect to me.</hi> This,
tho' he spoke smiling, raised a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Confusion in <hi>Brilljard</hi>'s Heart.
<hi>I own, my Lord,</hi> said he, <hi>that I have,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56143:519"/>
in spight of that Respect, and all the
force of my Soul, had the daring to
love her whom you lov'd; but still the
consideration of my Obligations to your
Lordship surmounted that sawcy Flame,
notwithstanding all the Incouragement
of your Inconstancy, and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Rage it put</hi> Silvia <hi>in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you. How,</hi> cry'd <hi>Philander,
does</hi> Silvia <hi>know then of my Falsness,
and is it certain that</hi> Octavio <hi>has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
me to her?</hi> With that <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
was forc'd to advance, and with
a design of some Revenge upon <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
(whom, he hoped, would be
challenged by his Lord, where one
or both might fall in the Rancoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and leave him Master of his
Hopes) he told him all that had
passed between 'em, all but real Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
which he only imagined, but
laid the whole Weight on <hi>Octavio,</hi>
making <hi>Silvia</hi> act but as an incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Woman, purely out of high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
and Resentment of so great an
Injury as was done her Love. He f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

she was his Wife already;
and for which <hi>Octavio</hi> procured the

an Accident that happened to the

forced to fly, the <hi>States</hi> released him,
when he came to his Lord: <hi>How,

grew into a violent Rage,
sometimes against <hi>Octavio,</hi> for his
Treasons against Friendship; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he felt the old Flame revive,
rais'd and blown by Jealousy, and
was raving to imagine any other
should posses the lovely <hi>Silvia.</hi> He
now beholds her with all those
Charms that first fired him, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56143:520"/>
thinks, if she be Criminal, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Effects of the: greatest Love,
which always hurries Women on to
the highest Revenges. In vain he
seeks to extinguish this returning
Flame by the Thought of <hi>

yet at that Thought he starts like
one awakened from a Dream of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to fall asleep again, and dream
of Love. Before 'twas Rage and
Pride, but now it was Tenderness
and Grief, softer Passions, and more
insupportable. New Wounds smart
most, but old ones are most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
While he was thus rageing,
walking, pausing, and loving, one
knock'd at his Chamber-Door. It
was <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Page, who had waited
all the Evening to speak to him,
and could not till now be admitted.
<hi>Brilljard</hi> was just going to tell him
he was there before, when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
now again: <hi>Philander</hi> was all
unbutton'd, his Stockings down, and
his Hair under his Cap, when the

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56143:521"/>
to his Lord, who knew him and
imbraced him: And 'twas a pretty
while they thus caressed each other,
without the Power of speaking; he
of asking a Question, and the Boy
of delivering his Message; at last he
gave him <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Billet; which was
thus—</p>

that word, without considering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were in order for a Visit
or not, he advancing his joyful
Voice, cry'd out to the Page; Lead
on, my faithful Boy, lead on to <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi>
In vain <hi>Brilljard</hi> beseeches him
to put himself into a better Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page;
in vain he urges to him the
indecency of making a Visit in that
Posture; he thought of nothing
but <hi>Silvia;</hi> however he ran after
him with his Hat, Cloak, and Comb,
and as he was in the Chair dress'd
his Hair, and suffered the Page to
conduct him where he pleas'd:
Which being to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Lodgings,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56143:522"/>
he ran up Stairs, and into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as by Instinct of Love, and found
her laid on her Bed, to which he
made but one step from the Door;
and catching her in his Arms, as he
kneeled upon the Carpet, they both
remain'd unable to utter any thing
but Sighs: And surely <hi>Silvia</hi> never
appear'd more charming; she had
for a Month or two liv'd at her Ease,
and had besides all the Advantage of
fine Dressing, which she had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posly
put on, in the most tempting
Fashion, on purpose to ingage him,
or rather, to make him see how fine
a Creature his Perfidy had lost him:
She first broke Silence, and with a
thousand violent Reproaches, seem'd
as if she would fain break from those
Arms, which she wish'd might be
too strong for her Force; while he
endeavours to appease her by swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and lying, as Lovers do, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
a thousand times that there
was nothing in that History of his
Amour with <hi>Calista,</hi> but Revenge
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:56143:522"/>
on <hi>Octavio,</hi> who he knew was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Interest in her Heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all the Laws of Honour
and Friendship (for he had learn'd
by the Reproaches of the Lady Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bess,
that <hi>Calista</hi> was Sister to <hi>Octavio)</hi>
he has had the daring to confess to me
his Passion, said he, for you, and could
I do less in Revenge than tell him I
had one for his Sister? I knew by
the violent Reproaches I ever met
with in your Letters, tho' they were
not plainly confess'd, that he had
play'd me foul, and discover'd my

this I suffered, to see how far
you could be prevail'd with against
me. I knew <hi>Octavio</hi> had Charms
of Youth and Wit, and that you
had too much the Ascendant over
him, to be deny'd any Secret you
had a mind to draw from him; I
knew your Nature too curious, and
your Love too inquisitive, not to
press him to a sight of my Letters,
which seen, must incense you; and

with his Tears, which bedew'd her
fair Bosom, as they fell from his
bright dissembling Eyes; and yet so
well he dissembled, that he scarce
knew himself that he did so: And
such Effects it wrought on <hi>Silvia,</hi>
that in spight of all her Honour
and Vows engaged to <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
horrid Protestations, never to receive
again the Fugitive to her Arms, she
suffers all he ask's, gives herself up
again to Love, and is a second time
undone. She regards him as one
to whom she had a peculiar Right
as the first Lover: She was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to his Love, to his Heart, and
<hi>Octavio</hi> appeared the intruding Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
that would, and ought to be
content with the Gleanings of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:56143:523"/>
Harvest, <hi>Philander</hi> should give him
the opportunity to take up: And
tho', if she had at this very time
been put to her sober Choice, which
she would have abandoned, it would
have been <hi>Philander,</hi> as not in so
good Circumstances at that time to
gratify all her Extravagancies of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
but she could not indure to
think of loosing either: She was
for two Reasons covetous of both,
and swore Fidelity to both, protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
each the only Man; and she was
now contriving in her Thoughts
how to play the Jilt most Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially;
a Help meet, tho' natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to her Sex, she had not yet
much essay'd, and never to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
She knew well she should have
need of all her Cunning in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
for she had to do with Men
of Quality and Honour, and too
much Wit to be grosly imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
She knew <hi>Octavio</hi> lov'd so well,
it would either make her lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e him
by Death or resenting Pride, if she
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:56143:524"/>
should ever be discovered to him
to be untrue; and she knew she
should lose <hi>Philander</hi> to some new
Mistriss, if he once perceived her
false. He asked her a thousand
Questions concerning <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
she seem'd to lavish every Secret of
her Soul to her Lover; but like a
right Woman, so ordered her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
as all that made for her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
she declared, and all the
rest she conceal'd. She told him that
those Hopes which her Revenge had
made her give <hi>Octavio,</hi> had obliged
him to present her with such and
such fine Jewels, such Plate, such
Summs; and in fine, made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that all her Trophies from
the believing Lover, should be laid
at his Feet, who had conquered her
Heart: And that now, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
herself, she would abandon
him wholly to Dispair. This did
not so well satisfy <hi>Philander,</hi> but
that he needed some greater Proofs
of her Fidelity, fearing all these
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56143:524"/>
rich Presents were not for a little
Hope alone; and she fail'd not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what Protestations he desired.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Night pass'd away, and
in the Morning, she knowing he
was not very well furnished with
Money, gave him the Key of her
Cabinet, where she bid him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
himself with all he wanted;
which he did, and left her, to go
take Orders about his Horses and
other Affairs, not so absolutely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of her Vertue, but he fear'd
himself put upon, which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
he was likely to reap by
the Deceit, made him less consider
than he would perhaps otherwise
have done. He had all the Night a
full Possession of <hi>Silvia,</hi> and found
in the Morning he was not so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
concern'd as he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night:
It was but a Repetition of
what he had been feasted with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
'twas no new Treat, but like
Matrimony, went dully down: And
now he found his Heart warm a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:56143:525"/>
little more for <hi>Calista,</hi> with which
little Impatience he left <hi>Silvia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Morning a Lady having sent
to <hi>Octavio,</hi> to give her an Assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Park; tho' he were not
curious after Beauty; yet believing
there might be something more in
it than meerly a Lady, he dress'd
himself and went, which was the
reason he made not his Visit that
Morning, as he used to do, to <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
and so was yet ignorant of her
Ingratitude: while she, on the other
side, finding herself more possess'd
with Vanity than Love; for having
gain'd her end as imagined, and got
a second Victory over his Heart, in
spight of all <hi>Calista</hi>'s Charms, she
did not so much consider him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
nor was he so dear to her as
before she believed it possible to get
him any more to her Arms; and
she found it was Pride and Revenge
to <hi>Calista,</hi> that made her so fond of
indearing him, and that she should
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56143:525"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hereby triumph over that haughty
Rival, who pretended to be so sure
of the Heart of her Hero: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
satisfied her Ambition in that
Point, she was more pleased than
she imagined she should be, and
could now return her Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Octavio,</hi> whose Charms,
whose Indearments, and lavish Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations,
came anew to her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and made him appear the
most agreeable to her Genius and
Humour, which now lean'd to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
more than Love; and now she
fancies she found <hi>Philander</hi> duller
in her Arms than <hi>Octavio,</hi> that he
tasted of <hi>Calista,</hi> while <hi>Octavio</hi> was
all her own intirely, adoring and
ever presenting; two Excellencies,
of which <hi>Philander</hi> now had but
part of one. She found <hi>Philander</hi>
now in a Condition to be ever ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
from her, while <hi>Octavio</hi>'s was
still to be giving; which was a great
Weight in the Scale of Love, when
a fair vain Woman guides the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:56143:526"/>
And now she begins to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
all that <hi>Philander</hi> had said of
his Innocence, from what she now
remembers she heard from <hi>Calista</hi>
herself, and reproaches her own
Weakness for believing: While her
penitent Thoughts were thus wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in favour of <hi>Octavio,</hi> that
Lover arriv'd, and approach'd her
with all the Joy in his Soul and
Eyes that either could express. <hi>'Tis
now, my fair Charmer,</hi> said he, <hi>that
I am come to offer you, what alone
can make me more worthy of you—</hi>
And pulling from his Pocket the
Writings and Inventories of all his
own and his Uncles Estate—<hi>See
here,</hi> said he, <hi>what those mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that favour Love, have done for</hi>
Silvia? <hi>It is not,</hi> continued he, <hi>the
Trifle of a Million of Money (which
these amount to) that has pleased me,
but because I am now able to lay it
without Controul at your Feet.</hi> If she
were before inclined to receive him
well, what was she now, when a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56143:526"/>
million of Money rendered him so
charming: She imbrac'd his Neck
with her snowy Arms, lays her
Cheek to his ravish'd Face, and
kiss'd him a thousand Welcomes; so
well she knew how to make herself
Mistriss of all this vast Fortune: And
I suppose he never appear'd so fine
as at this Moment. While she thus
caressed him, he could not forbear sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if there were yet something
behind to compleat his Happiness:
For tho' <hi>Octavio</hi> were extreamly
blinded with Love, he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Wit, and a great many
Doubts (which were augmented by
the Arrival of <hi>Philander</hi>) and he
was too wise and too haughty to be
imposed upon, at least as he believed:
And yet he had so very good an
Opinion of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Honour and
Vows, which she had engaged to
him, that he durst hardly name his
Fears, when by his Sighs she found
them: And willing to leave no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle
unremov'd that might hinder
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:56143:527"/>
her possessing this Fortune, she told
him; <hi>My dear</hi> Octavio—<hi>I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
these Sighs proceed from some
Fears you have of</hi> Philander<hi>'s being
in</hi> Bruxells, <hi>and consequently that I
will see him, as heretofore; but be
assured that that false Man shall no
more dare to pretend to me; but on
the contrary, I will behold him as my
mortal Enemy, the Murderer of my
Fame and Innocence, and as the most
ungrateful and perfidious Man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
liv'd.</hi> This she confirm'd with
Oaths and Tears, and a thousand
indearing Expressions. So that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
his Heart in a perfect Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
and he leaving his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Accounts with her, he
told her he was obliged to dine with
the <hi>Advocates,</hi> who had acted for
him in <hi>Holland,</hi> and could not stay
to dine with her.</p>
                  <p>You must know, that as soon as
the Noise of old <hi>Sebastian, Octavio</hi>'s
Uncle's Death was noised about, and
that he was thereupon fled, they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:56143:527"/>
seized all the Estates, both that of
the Uncle, and that of <hi>Octavio,</hi> as
belonging to him by right of Law;
but looking upon him as his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's
Murderer, they were forfeited
to the <hi>States.</hi> This part of ill News
<hi>Octavio</hi> kept from <hi>Silvia,</hi> but took
order that there should be such a
Process began in his Name with
the <hi>States,</hi> that might retrieve it;
and sent word, if it could not be
carried on by Attornies (for he was
not, he said, in Health) that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
he would come into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
himself. But they being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to prove by the Witness of any
of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s or <hi>Sebastian</hi>'s Servants,
that <hi>Octavio</hi> had any hand in his
Death; but, on the contrary, all
Circumstances, and the Coroner's
Verdict, brought it in as a thing done
by Accident, and through his own
Fault, they were obliged to release
to <hi>Octavio</hi> all his Fortune, with that
of his Uncle, which was this day
brought to him, by those he was
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:56143:528"/>
obliged to dine and make up some
Accompts withal: He therefore told
her he fear'd he should be absent
all that Afternoon; which she was
the more pleased at; because, if <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
should return before she had
ordered the Method of their Visit,
so as not to meet with each other,
(which was her only Contrivance
now) she should be sure he would
not see or be seen by <hi>Octavio;</hi> who
had no sooner taken his Leave, but
<hi>Philander</hi> returns; who being now
fully bent upon some Adventure to
see <hi>Calista</hi> if possible, and which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
would take up his whole
Time, to excuse his Absence to
the jealous <hi>Silvia,</hi> he feign'd that he
was sent to by <hi>Cesario,</hi> to meet him
upon the Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> and
conduct him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that
he should be absent some Days. This
was as <hi>Silvia</hi> could have wished;
and after forcing herself to take as
kind a Leave of him as she could,
whose Head was wholly possess'd
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:56143:528"/>
with a Million of Gold, she sent
him away, both Parties being very
well pleased with the Artifices with
which they gilted each other. At
<hi>Philander</hi>'s going into his Chair, he
was seen by the old Count of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinau,</hi>
who cur'd perfectly of his
Wound, was come thither to seek
<hi>Philander,</hi> in order to take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of a Man of Honour, as he
call'd it; which in <hi>Spanish,</hi> is the
private Stab, for private Injuries;
and indeed, more reasonable than
base <hi>French</hi> Duelling, where the
Injured is as likely to suffer as the
Injurer: But <hi>Clarinau</hi> durst not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
him by Day-light in the open
Street, nor durst he indeed appear
in his own Figure in the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Dominions, standing already
there convicted of the Murder of
his first Wife; but in a Disguise
came to <hi>Bruxells.</hi> The Chair with
<hi>Philander</hi> was no sooner gone from
the Lodgings, but he inquired of
some of the House who lodged
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:56143:529"/>
there, that that Gentleman came to
visit? and they told him, A great Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
Lady, who was a Woman of
Quality, and a Stranger: This was
sufficient, you may believe, for him
to think it Madam the Countess of
<hi>Clarinau.</hi> With this Assurance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
to his Lodging, which was but
hard by, and sets a Footman that
attended him, to watch the Return
of <hi>Philander</hi> to those Lodgings, which
he believed would not be long: The
Footman, who had not seen <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
only asked a Discription of him;
he told him he was a pretty tall
Man, in black Clothes (for the Court
was then in Mourning) with a long
black Hair, fine black Eyes, very
handsome, and well made: This
was enough for the Lad; he thought
he should know him from a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
by these Marks and Tokens.
A way goes the Footman, and waited
till the shuting in of the Evening,
and then, runing to his Lord, told
him <hi>Philander</hi> was come to those
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:56143:529"/>
Lodgings; that he saw him alight
out of the Chair, and took perfect
Notice of him; that he was sure it
was that <hi>Philander</hi> he look'd for:
<hi>Clarinau,</hi> overjoy'd that his Revenge
was at hand, took his Dagger, Sword,
and Pistol, and hasted to <hi>Silvia's</hi>
Lodgings, where he found the Chair
still waiting, and the Doors all
open; he made no more ado, but
goes in and ascends the Stairs, and
passes on, without any Opposition,
to the very Chamber where they
sate, <hi>Silvia</hi> in the Arms of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
not <hi>Philander,</hi> but <hi>Octavio,</hi> who
being also in black, tall, long brown
Hair, and handsome, and by a Sight
that might very well deceive; he
made no more to do, not doubting
but it was <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Calista,</hi> but
steps to him, and offering to stab
him, was prevented by his starting
at the suddeness of his Approach;
however the Dagger did not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
miss him, but wounded him
in the left Arm; but <hi>Octavio's</hi> Youth,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56143:530"/>
too nimble for <hi>Clarinau</hi>'s Age, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Dagger as it wounded
him, at once prevented the Hurt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much, and return'd a home
Blow at <hi>Clarinau,</hi> so that he fell at
<hi>Silvia's</hi> Feet, whose Shreeks alarm'd
the House to their Aid, where they
found, by the light of a Candle that
was brought, that the Man was not
dead, but lay gazing on <hi>Octavio,</hi> who
said to him; <hi>Tell me, thou unfortunate
Wretch, what miserable Fate brought
thee to this place, to disturb the Repose
of those who neither know thee, nor had
done thee Injury? Ah, Sir,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Clarinau, you have Reason for what
you say, and I ask Heaven, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lady, and your self, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pardons for my Mistake and
Crime: Too late I see my Error, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and forgive me; and let me have
a Priest, for I believe I am a dead
Man. Octavio</hi> was extreamly mov'd
with Compassion at these Words,
and immediately sent his Page, who
was alarm'd up in the Crowd, for
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56143:530"/>
a Father and a Surgeon; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
before the rest that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave
that Stranger, meaning <hi>Octavio,</hi>
since he had, by a Mistake of his
Footman, pull'd on his own Death,
and had deserved it: And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as he could, he told them
for whom he had mistaken <hi>Octavio,</hi>
who having injured his Honour, he
had vow'd Revenge upon; and that
he took the fair Lady, meaning <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
for a faithless Wife of his, who
had been the Authoress of all this.
<hi>Octavio</hi> soon divin'd this to be his
Brother-in-Law <hi>Clarinau,</hi> whom yet
he had never seen; and stooping
down to him, he cry'd; <hi>'Tis I, Sir,
that ought to demand a thousand Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of you, for letting the Revenge
of</hi> Calista<hi>'s Honour alone so long.
Clarinau</hi> wondered who he should be
that named <hi>Calista,</hi> and asking him
his Name, he told him he was the
unhappy Brother to that fair Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
whose Story was but too well
known to him. This while <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinau</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:56143:531"/>
viewing his Face, found him
the very Picture of that false Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
while <hi>Octavio</hi> went on and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
him, if it were his Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to die, that he would revenge
the Honour of him and his Sister on
the Betrayer of both. By this time
the Surgeon came, who found not
his Wound to be mortal, as was fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and ventured to remove him to
his own Lodgings, whither <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
would accompany him; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Silvia</hi> inclin'd, after her Fright,
to be repos'd, he took his Leave of
her for that Evening, not daring,
out of Respect to her, to visit her
any more that Night: He was no
sooner gone, but <hi>Philander,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us'd to go without two very
good pocket Pistols about him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left 'em under his Pillow last
Night at <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Lodgings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Love Adventures, he knew
not what Occasion he might have
for 'em, return'd back to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
When he came she was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:56143:531"/>
surprized at first to see him, but
after reflecting on what Revenge was
threatened him, she exposed <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>'s
Secret to him, and told him
the whole Adventure, and how she
had got his Writings, which would
be all her own, if she might be
suffered to manage the fond Believer.

foresaw the dangerous Consequence
of a Quarrel of this nature, and had
no sooner blown the Fire (which
she did, to the end that <hi>Philander</hi>
should avoid her Lodgings, and all
places where he might meet <hi>Octavio</hi>)
but she hinders all her Designs; and
fixing him there, he was resolv'd to
expect him at the first place he
thought most likely to find him in:
She indeavoured, by a thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
to get him gone, urging it
all for his Safety; but that made
him but the more resolv'd; and all
she could do could not hinder him
from staying Supper, and after
that, from going to Bed: So that
she was forced to hide a thousand
Terrors and Fears by feigned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,
the sooner to get him to meet
<hi>Cesario</hi> in the Morning, as he said
he was to do: And tho' she could
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56143:532"/>
not help flattering both while by,
yet she ever lov'd the absent best;
and now repented a thousand times
that she had told him any thing.</p>
                  <p>Early the next Morning, as was
his Custom, <hi>Octavio</hi> came to inquire
of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Health; and tho' he had
oftentimes only inquired and no more
(taking Excuse of ill Nights, or
Commands that none should come
to her till she call'd) and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
satisfied, and came again:
Yet now, when he went into <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett</hi>'s
Chamber, he found she was
in a great Consternation, and her
Looks, and flattering Excuses made
him know, there was more than
usual in his being to day deny'd; he
therefore pressed it the more, and
she grew to greater Confusion by
his pressing her: At last he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Key of her Lady's Chamber,
he having, he said, Business of great
Importance to communicate to her;
she told him she had as great a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
not to deliver it,—<hi>That is,</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:56143:533"/>
said she (fearing she had said too
much) <hi>my Lady's Commands;</hi> and
finding no Perswasion would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
and rather venturing <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
eternal Displeasure, than not to be
satisfied in the Jealousies she had
raised; especially reflecting on <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>'s
being in Town, he took
<hi>Antonett</hi> in his Arms and forced
the Key from her, who was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be forced; for she admired
<hi>Octavio</hi>'s Bounty, and car'd not for
<hi>Philander. Octavio</hi> being Master
of the Key, flies to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Door
like Lightening, or a jealous Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
mad to discover, what seen,
would kill him: He opens the
Chamber-door, and goes softly to the
Bed-side, as if he now fear'd to find
what he sought, and wished to
Heaven he might be mistaken; he
opened the Curtains, and found <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
sleeping with <hi>Philander</hi> in her
Arms. I need make no Discripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Confusion and Surprize;
the Character I have given of that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56143:533"/>
gallant, honest and generous Lover,
is sufficient to make you imagine
his Heart, when indeed he could
believe his Eyes: Before he thought
—he was about to draw his
Sword, and run 'em both through,
and revenge at once his injured Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
his Love, and that of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
but that little Reason he had
left check'd that Barbarity, and he
was readier, from his own natural
sweetness of Disposition to run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon his own Sword: And there
the <hi>Christian</hi> pleaded—and yet
he found his Heart breaking, his
whole Body trembling, his Mind all
Agony, his Cheeks cold and pale,
his Eyes languishing, his Tongue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to give Utterance to his Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and his Leggs to support his
Body; and much ado he had to reel
into <hi>Antonett</hi>'s Chamber, where he
found the Maid dying with Grief
for her Concern for him. He was
no sooner got to her Bed-side, but he
fell dead upon it; while she, who
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56143:534"/>
was afraid to alarm her Lady and
<hi>Philander,</hi> least <hi>Octavio</hi> being found
there, had accused her with betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em; but shuting the Door
close (for yet no body had seen
him but herself) she indeavoured all
she could to bring him to Life again,
and it was a great while before she
could do so: As soon as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
he lay a good while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking, reflecting on his Fate;
but after appearing as if he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
all his manly Spirits together,
he rose up, and conjured <hi>Antonett</hi> to
say nothing of what had happen'd,
and that she should not repent the
Service she would do him by it.
<hi>Antonett,</hi> who was his absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
Slave, promised him all he
desired; and he had the Courage to
go once again, to confirm himself
in the Lewdness of this undone fair
one, whose Perjuries had rendered
her even odious now to him, and
he beheld her with Scorn and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain:
And that she might know
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56143:534"/>
how indifferently he did so (when
she should come to know it) he
took <hi>Philander</hi>'s Sword, that lay on
her <hi>Toylet,</hi> and left his own in the
place, and went out pleased; at least
in this, that he had commanded his
Passion in the midst of the most
powerful Occasion for Madness and
Revenge that ever was.</p>
                  <p>They lay, thus secur'd in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Arms, till nine a-Clock in the
Morning, when <hi>Philander</hi> received
a Note from <hi>Brilljard,</hi> who was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
his Lords Design of getting
a Billet delivered to <hi>Calista</hi> by the
way of a Nun, whom <hi>Brilljard</hi> had
made some Address to to that end,
and sent to beg, his Lord would come
to the Grate and speak to the young
Nun, who had undertaken for any
innocent Message. This Note made
him rise and hast to go out, when
he received another from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Hand; which was thus:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:56143:535"/>
                        <head>To Philander.</head>
                        <p>MY Lord, I have important Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
with you, and beg I may
speak with you at three of the Clock;
I will wait you by the Fountain in
the Park:</p>
                        <closer>
                           <signed>Yours</signed>
                        </closer>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Silvia,</hi> who was impatient to have
him gone, never asked to see either
of these Notes, least it should have
deterr'd him; and she knew <hi>Octavio</hi>
would visit her early, tho' she knew
withal she could refuse him Ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with any slight Excuse, so
good an Opinion he had of her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and so absolute an Ascendant
she had over him.—She had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Orders, if he came, to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her Chamber; and she was glad
to know he had not yet been at her
Lodgings. A hundred times she
was about to make use of the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56143:535"/>
Love <hi>Philander</hi> had for her,
and to have proposed to him the
suffering <hi>Octavio</hi> to share her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
for so good an Interest, since
no Returns could be had from
<hi>France,</hi> nor any Signs of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of their Fortunes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way: But still she fear'd he
had too much Honour to permit
such a Cheat in Love, to be put e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon an Enemy. This Fear
deferred her speaking of it, or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to sacrifice <hi>Octavio</hi> as a Cully to
their Interest, tho' she wished it;
nor knew she long how to deceive
both; the Business was to put <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
off handsomly, if possible, since
she fail'd of all other Hopes. These
were her Thoughts while <hi>Philander</hi>
was dressing, and rais'd by his asking
for some more Pistols from her Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
which she found would quickly
be at an end, if one Lover deminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
daily, and the other was hindered
from increasing: But <hi>Philander</hi> was
no sooner dress'd but he left her to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56143:536"/>
her Repose; and <hi>Octavio</hi> (who had
a <hi>Grison</hi> attending the Motions of
<hi>Philander</hi> all that Morning, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> had
brought him word he was gone
from <hi>Silvia</hi>) went to visit her, and
entered her Chamber, all changed
from what he was before, and Death
sate in his Face and Eyes, maugre
all his Resolves and art of Dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
She not at first perceiving it
as she lay, she stretch'd out her
Arms to receive him with her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Caresses, but he gently put her
off, and sighing cry'd—<hi>No</hi> Silvia,
<hi>I leave those Ioys for happier Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
She was a little surpriz'd at
that—but not imagining he had
known her Guilt, reply'd; <hi>Then
those Caresses were only meant for
him; for if</hi> Silvia <hi>could make him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
he was sure of being the Man;</hi>
and by force compell'd him to suffer
her Kisses and Imbraces, while his
Heart was bursting, without any
sense of the Pleasure of her Touches.
<hi>Ah</hi> Silvia, says he,—<hi>I can never
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56143:536"/>
think myself Secure or Happy while</hi>
Philander <hi>is so near you; every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Moment alarms me with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Fears; in Sleep I dream thou
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>art false, and gives thy Honour up
all my absent Nights, and all day
thy Vows:</hi> And that he was sure,
should she again suffer herself to see
<hi>Philander,</hi> he should be abandoned;
and perhaps she again undone. <hi>For
since I parted with you,</hi> continued he,
<hi>I heard from</hi> Clarinau, <hi>that he saw</hi>
Philander <hi>yesterday come out of your
Lodgings. How can I bear this, when
you have vow'd, not to see him, with
Imprecations that must damn thee,</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
<hi>without severe Repentance?—</hi>
At this she offered to swear again,
—but he stop'd her, and begg'd
her not to swear till she had well
considered; then she confess'd he
made her a Visit, but that she us'd
him with that Pride and Scorn that
if he were a Man of Honour, he
could never bear; and she was sure
he would trouble her no more: In
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:56143:537"/>
fine, she flattered, fawn'd, and
gilted so, as no Woman common in
the Trade of sinful Love, could be
so great a Mistriss of the Art. He
suffered her to go on in all that
could confirm him she thought him
an errant Coxcomb; and all that
could render her the most contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
of her Sex. He was pleas'd,
because it made him dispise her;
and that was easier than adoring
her; yet tho' he heard her with
Scorn, he heard her with too much
Love. When she was even Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
with eager Protestation—he
cry'd, <hi>Ah Indiscreet and Vnadvised</hi>
Silvia, <hi>how I pity thee. Ah,</hi> said
she—observing him speak this
with a scornful Smile—<hi>is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
you should indeed be offended for
a simple Visit! which neither was by
my Invitation or Wish: Can you be
angry if I treat</hi> Philander <hi>with the
Civility of a Brother? Or rather, that
I suffer him to see me to receive my
Reproaches?—Stop here, <hi>said he,</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:56143:537"/>
thou fair deluding Flatterer, or thou
art for ever ruin'd. Do not charge
thy Soul yet farther;—do not
delude me on—all yet I can forgive,
as I am dying, but should I live, I
could not promise thee. Add not new
Crimes by cozening me anew, for I
shall find out Truth, tho' it lie hid
even in the bottom of</hi> Philander<hi>'s
Heart.</hi> This he spoke with an Air
of Fierceness—which seeing her
grow pale upon, he sunk again to
Compassion, and in a soft Voice
cry'd—<hi>Whatever Injuries thou hast
done thy Honour, thy Word, and
Faith to me, and my poor Heart, I
can perhaps forgive when you dare
utter Truth: There is some Honesty
in that—</hi> She once more embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him, fell a-new to protesting
her ill Treatment of <hi>Philander,</hi> how
she gave him back his Vows, and
assur'd him she would never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to him. <hi>And did you part</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Silvia? reply'd the dying <hi>Octavio.
Vpon my Honour,</hi> said she, <hi>just so.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56143:538"/>
—Did you not kiss at parting?</hi>
said he faintly,—<hi>Iust kiss'd, as
Friends, no more, by all thy Love.</hi>
At this he bursts into Tears, and
cry'd—<hi>Oh! why, when I repos'd my
Heart with thee, and lavished out my
very Soul in Love, could I not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
this poor Recompence, of being fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dealt with? Behold this Sword—
I took it from your</hi> Toylet; <hi>view it,
it is</hi> Philander<hi>'s; myself this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
took it from your Table: No
more—since you may guess the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
rest: I am undone, and I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
—I had a thousand Warnings
of my Fate, but still the Beauty charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and too good Nature yielded: Oft
you have cozen'd me, and oft I saw
it, and still Love made me willing
to forgive; the foolish Passion hung
upon my Soul, and sooth'd me into
Peace. Silvia,</hi> quite confounded,
(not so much with the Knowledge
he had of the unlucky Adventure, as
at her so earnest denying and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing
any Love had pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56143:538"/>
'em) lay still to consider how
to retrieve this lost Game, and gave
him leisure to go on.—<hi>Now,</hi>
said he, <hi>thou art silent—would
thou had'st still been so: Ah hapless
Maid, who hast this Fate attending
thee, To ruin all that love thee! Be
dumb, be dumb for ever; let the false
Charm that dwells upon thy Tongue be
ended with my Life: Let it no more
undo believing Man; least amongst
the Number some one may conquer
thee, and deaf to all thy Wit, and blind
to Beauty, in some mad Passion think
of all thy Cozenings, should fall upon
thee and forget thy Sex, and by thy
Death revenge the lost</hi> Octavio. At
these Words he would have rose
from her Arms, but she detain'd
him, and with a pitious Voice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd
his Pardon; but he calmly
reply'd; <hi>Yes,</hi> Silvia, <hi>I will pardon
thee, and wish that Heaven may do
so; to whom apply thy early Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
and Penitence, for it can never,
never, charm me more: My Fortune,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56143:539"/>
if thou ever want'st Support, to keep
thee Chast and Vertuous, shall still be
commanded by thee, with that usual
Frankness it has hitherto served thee;
but for</hi> Octavio, <hi>he is resolved to
go where he will never more be seen by
Woman—or hear the name of Love
to ought but Heaven.—Farewel—
one parting Kiss, and then a long Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.</hi>
—As he bow'd to kiss her
she caught him fast in her Arms,
while a Flood of Tears bathe his
Face, nor could he prevent his from
mixing with hers: While thus they
lay, <hi>Philander</hi> came into the Room,
and finding them so closely intwin'd,
he was as much surpriz'd almost as
<hi>Octavio</hi> was before; and drawing
his Sword, was about to have kill'd
him; but his Honour overcame his
Passion; and he would not take him
at such Disadvantage, but with the
Flat of his Sword striking him on
the Back as he lay, he cry'd, <hi>Rise
Traytor, and turn to thy mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Octavio,</hi> not at all surpriz'd,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56143:539"/>
turn'd his Head, and his Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew'd
in Tears, towards his Rival.
<hi>If thou beest an Enemy,</hi> said he, <hi>thou
never could'st have taken me in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Humour of dying. Finish,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
<hi>that Life then, which if you
spare, it will possibly never leave thine
in Repose; the Injuries you have done
me, being too great to be forgiven.
And is it thus,</hi> reply'd <hi>Philander,
—thus with my Mistriss, that you
would revenge 'em? Is it in the Arms
of</hi> Silvia <hi>that you would repay me the
Favours I did your Sister</hi> Calista?
<hi>You have by that Word,</hi> said <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio
handsomly reproach'd my Sloath.</hi>
And leaping briskly from the Bed
he took out his Sword, and cry'd:
<hi>Come then,—let us go where we may
repair both our Losses, since Ladies
Chambers are not fit places to adjust
Debts of this nature in.</hi> At these
Words they both went down Stairs;
and 'twas in vain <hi>Silvia</hi> call'd and
cry'd out to conjure them to come
back; her Power of Commanding
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56143:540"/>
she had in one unlucky Day lost
over both those gallant Lovers: And
both left her with Pity; to say no
worse of the Effect of her ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavio</hi> went directly to the Park,
to the Place whither he before had
challenged <hi>Philander,</hi> who lost no
time but followed him: As soon as
he was come to the Fountain he
drew, and told <hi>Philander</hi> that was
the place whither he invited him
in his Billet that Morning; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
if he liked not the Ground, he
was ready to remove to any other:
<hi>Philander</hi> was a little surpriz'd to
find that Invitation was a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
and that <hi>Octavio</hi> should be
beforehand with him upon the Score
of Revenge; and reply'd; <hi>Sir, if
the Billet came from you, it was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
I thank you for, since it kindly
put me in mind of that Revenge I
ought so justly to take of you for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
the Secrets of Friendship I
reposed in you, and making base Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56143:540"/>
of 'em, to recommend your
self to a Woman, you knew I lov'd, and
who hates you, in spight of all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
ways you have taken to gain
her. Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Octavio, I confess
with a Blush and infinite Shame the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
with which you accuse me, and have
nothing to defend so great a Perfidy.
To tell you I was wrought out of it by
the greatest Cunning imaginable, and
that I must have seen</hi> Silvia <hi>dy at my
Feet if I had refused 'em, is not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
enough for the Breach of that
Friendship. No, tho' I were exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with the Relation there of my
Sister's Dishonour; I must therefore
adjust that Debt with you as well as
I can; and if I dy in the juster Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
of my Sister's Honour, I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it the Vengeance of Heaven upon
me for that one Breach of Friendship.
Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Philander, you have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me so great a Satisfaction in this
Confession; and have made so good
and gallant an Atonement by this
Acknowledgment, that 'tis with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56143:541"/>
I go to punish you for other
Injuries, of which I am assured you
cannot so well acquit your self. Tho'
I would not justify a Baseness,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Octavio, for which there ought
to be no Excuse; yet I will not accuse
myself, or acknowledge other Injuries,
but leave you something to maintain
the Quarrel on—and render it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
just on your side; nor go to wipe
off the Outrage you pretend I have done
your Love, by adoring the fair Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who at least has been dear to you,
by the Wrongs you have done my
Sister. Come, Sir, we shall not by
disputing quit Scores,</hi> cry'd <hi>Philander</hi>
a little impatiently, <hi>what I have so
lately seen, has made my Rage too
brisk for long Parly.</hi> At that they
both advanced, and made above
twenty Passes before either received
any Wound; the first that bled was
<hi>Octavio,</hi> who received a Wound in
his Breast, which he returned on
<hi>Philander;</hi> and after that many were
given and taken; so that the Track
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56143:541"/>
their Feet made in following and
advancing as they fought, was
marked out by their Blood: In this
Condition (still fighting) <hi>Silvia</hi>
(who had call'd 'em back in vain,
and only in her Night-Gown in a
Chair pursued 'em that Minute they
quitted her Chamber) found 'em
thus imployed, and without any fear
the threw herself between them:
<hi>Octavio,</hi> out of Respect to her, ceased;
but <hi>Philander,</hi> as if he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
her, would still have been
striving for Victory, when she stay'd
his Hand, and beg'd him to hear her;
he then set the Point of his Sword
to the Ground, and breathless and
fainting almost, attended what she
had to say: She conjur'd him to cease
the Quarrel, and told him if <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
had injured him in her Heart,
he ought to remember he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<hi>Octavio</hi> as much in that of
his Sister: She conjured him by all
the Friendship both she and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had received at <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Hands;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:56143:542"/>
and concluded with saying so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fine things of that <hi>Cavalier,</hi> that
in lieu of appeasing, it but the
more exasperated the jealous <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
who took new Courage with
new Breath, and passed at <hi>Octavio.</hi>
She then addressed to <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
cry'd: <hi>Hold, oh hold, or make your
way through me, for here I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Vertue and Honour!</hi> and put
herself before <hi>Octavio:</hi> She spoke
with so pitious a Voice, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with so much Tenderness, that
<hi>Octavio</hi> laying his Sword at her
Feet, bid her dispose—false as she
was, of his Honour. <hi>For oh,</hi> said
he, <hi>my Life is already fallen a Victim
to your Perjuries!</hi> He could say no
more, but falling where he had laid
his Sword, left <hi>Philander</hi> master of
the Field. By this time some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
that had been walking came
up to 'em, and found a Man ly dead,
and a Lady imploring another to fly:
They look'd on <hi>Octavio,</hi> and found
he had yet Life; and immediately
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56143:542"/>
sent for Surgeons, who carried him
to his Lodgings, with very little
Hope: <hi>Philander,</hi> as well as his
Wounds would give him leave, got
into a Chair, telling the Gentlemen
that looked on him, he would be
responsible for <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Life, if he
had the ill Fortune to take it;
that his Quarrel was too just to
suffer him to fly.—So being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the <hi>Cabarett,</hi> with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Command to <hi>Silvia</hi> not to
follow him, or visit him: For fear
of hurting him by disobeying, she
suffered herself to be carried to her
Lodgings, where she threw herself
on her Bed, and drowned her fair
Eyes in a Showre of Tears: She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
with <hi>Antonett</hi> and her Page
what to do in this Extremity; she
fears she has by her ill Management
lost both her Lovers, and she was
in a Condition of needing every Aid.
They who knew the excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of <hi>Octavio,</hi> and knew him to
be the most considerable Lover of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56143:543"/>
the two, besought her, as the best
Expedient she could have Recourse
to, to visit <hi>Octavio,</hi> who could not
but take it kindly; and they did
not doubt but she had so absolute
a Power over him, that with a very
little Complaisance towards him,
she would retrieve that Heart her
ill Luck had this Morning forfeited;
and which, they protested, they
knew nothing of, nor how he got
into her Chamber. This Advice
she took; but because <hi>Octavio</hi> was
carried away dead, she feared (and
swounded with the Fear) that he
was no longer in the World, or at
least, that he would not long be so:
However she assum'd her Courage
again at the Thought, that, if he
did dy, she had an absolute Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all his Fortune, which was
to her the most considerable part of
the Man, or at least, what rendered
him so very agreeable to her: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she thought fit to send her Page,
which she did in an hour after he
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56143:543"/>
was carried home, to see how he did,
who brought her word that he was
reviv'd to Life, and had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Gentleman to receive no Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
from her. This was all she
could learn, and what put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the greatest Extremity of Grief.
She after sent to <hi>Philander,</hi> and found
him much the better of the two,
but most infinitely incensed against
<hi>Silvia:</hi> This also added to her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair;
yet since she found she had
not a Heart that any Love or loss
of Honour, or Fortune could break;
but on the contrary, a Rest of Youth
and Beauty, that might oblige her,
with some Reason, to look forward
on new Lovers, if the old must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:
The next thing she resolv'd,
was, to do her utmost Indeavour to
retrieve <hi>Octavio,</hi> which if unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
she would make the best of
her Youth. She sent therefore (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his Commands to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
none of her People to come and
see him) to inquire of his Health;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56143:544"/>
and in four Days (finding he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
other Visits) she dress'd herself,
with all the Advantages of her Sex,
and in a Chair was carried to his
Aunt's, where he lay. The good
Lady not knowing but she might
be that Person of Quality whom she
knew to be extreamly in Love with
her Nephew, and who liv'd at the
Court of <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and was Neece
to the Governour, carried her to his
Chamber, where she left her, as not
willing to be a Witness of a Visit, she
knew must be supposed <hi>Incognito:</hi>
It was Evening, and <hi>Octavio</hi> was in
Bed, and at the first sight of her his
Blood grew disordered in his Veins,
flush'd in his pale Face, and burnt
all over his Body, and he was near
to swounding as he lay: She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
his Bed with a Face all set
for Languishment, Love and Shame
in her Eyes, and Sighs, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking seem'd to tell her Grief
at his Disaster; she sate, or rather,
fell on his Bed, as unable to support
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56143:544"/>
the sight of him in that Condition;
she in a soft manner seiz'd his burning
Hand, grasp'd it and sigh'd, then
put it to her Mouth, and suffered a
Tear or two to fall upon it; and
when she would have spoke she made
her Sobs resist her Words; and left
nothing unacted that might move
the tender Hearted <hi>Octavio</hi> to that
degree of Passion she wished. A
hundred times fain he would have
spoke, but still his rising Passion
choak'd his Words; and still he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
they would prove either too soft
and kind for the Injuries he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or too rough and cold for so
delicate and charming a Creature,
and one who, in spight of all those
Injuries, he still adored: She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
before him with those Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that never fail'd to conquer him;
with that Submission and Pleading
in her modest bashful Eyes, that even
gave his the Lye, who had seen her
Perfidy. Oh! what should he do to
keep that Fire from breaking forth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56143:545"/>
with Violence, which she had so
throughly kindled in his Heart; how
should that excellent good Nature
assume an unwonted Sullenness, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to appear what it could not by
Nature be? He was all Soft and
Sweet, and if he had had Pride, he knew
also how to make his Pleasure; and
his Youth lov'd Love above all the
other little Vanities that attend it,
and was the most proper to it. Fain
he would palliate her Crime, and
considers in the Condition she was,
she could not but have some Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
for <hi>Philander;</hi> that it was no
more than what before past; 'twas
no new Lover that came to kindle
new Passions, or to approach her
with a new Flame; but a Decliner,
who came and was received with
the Dregs of Love, with all the
cold Indifference imaginable: This
he would have perswaded himself,
but dares not till he hear her speak;
and yet fears she should not speak
his Sense; and this Fear makes him
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56143:545"/>
sighing break Silence, and he cry'd
in a soft Tone; <hi>Ah! why, too lovely
Fair, why do you come to trouble the
Repose of my dying Hours? Will you,
cruel Maid, pursue me to my Grave,
shall I not have one lone Hour to ask
Forgiveness of Heaven, for my Sin
of loving thee? The greatest that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
loaded my Youth—and yet alas,
—the least repented yet. Be kind,
and trouble not my Solitude; depart
with all the Trophies of my Ruine,
and if they can add any Glory to thy
future Life, boast 'em all over the
Vniverse, and tell, what a deluded
Youth thou hast undone. Take, take
fair Deceiver, all my Industry, my
right of Birth, my thriving Parents
have been so long a geting to make
me happy with; take the useless Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle,
and lavish it on Pleasure to make
thee gay and fit for luckier Lovers:
Take that best part of me, and let this
worst alone; 'twas that first won the
dear Confession from thee, that drew
my Ruin on—for which I hate it
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:56143:546"/>
—and wish myself born a poor
Cottage Boor, where I might never
have seen thy tempting Beauty, but
liv'd for ever bless'd in Ignorance.</hi>
At this the Tears ran from his Eyes,
with which the soften'd Silvia mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her welcome Stream, and as soon
as she could speak, she reply'd (with
half Cunning and half Love, for
still there was too much of the first
mingled with the last) <hi>Oh my Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,
to what Extremities are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to drive a poor Vnfortunate,
who, even in the height of Youth, and
some small stock of Beauty, am redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to
all the Miseries of the Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Far from my noble Parents, lost
to Honour, and abandoned by my
Friends; a helpless Wanderer in a
strange Land, exposed to Want, and
perishing, and had no Sanctuary but
thyself, thy dear, thy precious self,
whom Heaven had sent, in Mercy, to
my Aid; and thou at last, by a mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
turn of miserable Fate, hast
taken that dear Aid away.</hi> At this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:56143:546"/>
she fell weeping on his panting
Bosom; nevertheless he got the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to reply once again, before he
yielded himself a shameful Victim to
her Flattery, and said; <hi>Ah cruel</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
<hi>is it possible that you can charge
the Levity on me! Is it I have taken
this poor Aid, as you are pleased to
call it, from you? Oh! rather blame
your own unhappy Easiness, that after
having sworn me Faith and Love,
could violate 'em both; both, where
there was no need. 'Twould better
have become thy Pride and Quality,
to have resented Injuries receiv'd, than
brought again that scorn'd abandon'd
Person (fine as it was, and shining
still with Youth) to his forgetful Arms.
Alas,</hi> said she, <hi>I will not justify my
hateful Crime; a Crime I loath to
think of, it was a Fault beyond a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
there might have po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been new Ioy in such a Sin, but here
'twas pall'd and gone—sted to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
away:—And but for the dear
Cause I did commit it, there were no
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56143:547"/>
Expiation for my Fault; no penitent
Tears could wash away my Crime.
Alas,</hi> said he,—<hi>if there were any
Cause, if there be any possible Excuse
for such a breach of Love, give it my
Heart; make me believe it, and I yet
may live; and tho' I cannot think thee
Innocent, to be compell'd by any fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
Reason, 'twould greatly satisfy
my longing Soul. But have a care,
do not delude me on—for if thou
dost perswade me into Pardon, and to
return to all my native Fondness, and
then again shoula'st play me fast and
loose; by Heaven—by all my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Passion to thee, by all that Men
call Holy, I will pursue thee with my
utmost Hate; forsake thee with my
Fortune and my Heart, and leave thee
wretched to the scorning Crowd. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
these rude Expressions of a Love
that can hardly forgive the Words it
utters: I blush with Shame while I
pronounce 'em true.</hi> When she reply'd;
<hi>May all you have pronounced, and all
your injured Love can yet invent, fall
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56143:547"/>
on me, when I ever more deceive you:
believe me now, and but forgive what
is past, and trust my Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
for the future.</hi> At this she
told him, that in the first Visit <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
made her, she using him so
reproachfully, and upbraiding him
with his Inconstancy, made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that he was betray'd by
<hi>Octavio,</hi> and that the whole Intrigue
with <hi>Calista,</hi> confessed by him, was
discovered to <hi>Silvia:</hi> Which, he said,
put him into so violent a Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Octavia,</hi> that he vow'd that
Minute to find him out and kill
him. Nor could all the Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Reason serve to hinder him;
so that she (who as she said) lov'd
<hi>Octavio</hi> to Death, finding so powerful
an Enemy, as her Fears made her
fancy <hi>Philander</hi> was, ready to have
snatch'd from her, in one furious
Moment, all she ador'd; she had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to all the Flattery of Love to
withold him from an Attempt so
dangerous: And 'twas with much
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56143:548"/>
ado, with all those Aids, that he
was obliged to stay; which she had
forced him to do, to get time to give
him Notice in the Morning for his
approaching Danger: Not that she
feared <hi>Octavio's</hi> Life, had <hi>Philander</hi>
attacked it fairly; but he look'd on
himself as a Person injured by close
private ways, and would take a
like Revenge, and have hurt him
when he as little dream'd of it, as
<hi>Philander</hi> did of the Discovery he
made of his Letter to her. To this
she swore, she weep'd, she imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and still protested it true; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withal a thousand Protestations
of her future Detestation of him;
and that since the worst was past,
and that they had fought, and he
was come off, tho' with so many
Wounds, yet with Life, she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
utterly to defy <hi>Philander,</hi> as
the most perfidious of his Sex; and
assured him that nothing in the
World was so indifferent as she in
his Arms. In fine, after having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56143:548"/>
nothing that might gain a
Credit, and assure him of her Love
and Heart, and possess him with a
Belief, for the future, of her lasting
Vows: He wholly convinc'd and
overcome, snatches her in his Arms,
and bursting into a Shower of Tears,
cry'd—<hi>Take,—take all my Soul,
thou lovely Charmer of it, and dispose
of the Destiny of</hi> Octavio. And
smothering her with kisses and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
made a perfect Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the Surgeons, who came
to visit him, finding him in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of a Fever, tho' more Joy
was triumphing in his Face than
before, they imagined this Lady, the
fair Person, for whom this Quarrel
was; for it had made a great Noise,
you may believe; and finding it
hurtful for his Wounds, either to be
transported with too much Rage,
Grief or Love, besought him he
would not talk too much, or suffer
any Visits that might prejudice his
Health: And indeed, with what
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56143:549"/>
had been past, he found himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Transport very ill and feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
so that <hi>Silvia</hi> promised the
Doctors she would visit him no
more in a day or two, tho' she knew
not well how to be from him so
long; but would content herself
with sending her Page to inquire
of his Health. To this <hi>Octavio</hi> made
very great Opposition, but his Aunt,
and the rest of the Learned, were
of Opinion it ought for his Health
to be so, and he was obliged to be
satisfied with her Absence: At part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she came to him, and again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
him to believe her Vows to
be well, and that she would depart
somewhere with him far from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
who she knew was obliged
to attend the Motions of <hi>Cesario</hi> at
<hi>Bruxels,</hi> whom again she impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
never to see more. This satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
our impatient Lover, and he
suffered her to go and leave him to
what Rest he could get. She was
no sooner got home, and retired to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56143:549"/>
her Chamber, but finding herself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which now she did not care
to be, and being assured she should
not see <hi>Octavio;</hi> instead of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing
for her new gain'd Victory,
she sent her Page to inquire again
of <hi>Philander's</hi> Health, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
that she might visit him: At
first, before she sent, she check'd this
Thought as base, as against all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and all her Vows and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to the brave <hi>Octavio;</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Inclination to it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a Pleasure and Satisfaction in
it; she was of a Nature not to lose
a Pleasure for a little Punctilio of
Honour; and without considering
what would be the event of such a
Folly, she sent her Page, tho' he
had been repulsed before, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
coming with any Messages from
his Lady. The Page found no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Success than hitherto he had
done; but being with much Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
brought to <hi>Philander's</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
he found him sitting in his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56143:550"/>
Night-Gown, to whom addressing
himself—he had no sooner named
his Lady—but <hi>Philander</hi> did him
bee gone, for he would hear nothing
from that false Woman: The Boy
would have reply'd, but he grew
more inraged; and reviling her with
all the Railings of incensed Lovers,
he put himself into his Closet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speaking any more, or suffering
any Answer. This Message being
delivered to the expecting Lady, put
her into a very great Rage—
which ended in as deep a Concern:
Her great Pride fortified by her
Looking-glass, made her highly resent
the Affront; and she believed it
more to the Glory of her Beauty to
have quitted a hundred Lovers than
to be abandoned by one. 'Twas
this that made her rave and tear,
and talk high; and after all, to use
her Cunning to retrieve, what it had
been most happy for her, should have
been for ever lost; and she ought to
have blessed the Occasion. But her
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:56143:550"/>
malicious Star had defign'd other
Fortune for her: She writ to him
several Letters, that were sent back
sealed: She railed, she upbraided,
and then fell to Submission. At last
he was perswaded to open one, but
returned such Answers as gave her
no Satisfaction, but incouraged her
with a little Hope that she should
draw him on to a Reconciliation:
Between whiles she fail'd not to send
<hi>Octavio</hi> the kindest impatient Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the World, and received the
softest Replies that the Tongue of
Man could utter, for he could not
write yet. At last, <hi>Philander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reduced <hi>Silvia</hi> to the very brink
of Dispair, and finding by her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Importunity, that he could
make his Peace with her on any
term of Advantage to himself; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

he being a Person, by no means, of

These Conditions she liked, all but

Day she had leave from the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
to visit <hi>Octavio,</hi> and that all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd
Lover lay panting in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the blessed Sight, believing
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:56143:551"/>
every Minute an Age; his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dressed and perfum'd, and all
things ready to receive the Darling
of his Soul, <hi>Philander</hi> came in a
Coach and six Horses (and making
her pack up all her Jewels and fine
Things, and what they could not
carry in the Coach put up to come
after them) and hurries her to a
little Town in <hi>Luke-Land,</hi> a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> without
giving her time to write, or letting
her know whither she was going. While
she was putting up her things
(I know she has since confessed) her
Heart trembled, and foreboaded the
Ill that was to come; that is, that she
was hasting to Ruin; But she had
chanced to say so much to him of her
Passion, to retrieve him, that she was
ashamed to own the Contrary so
soon; but suffered that Force upon
her Inclinations to do the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable
and disinteressed thing in
the World. She had not been there
a Week, and her Trunks of Plate and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56143:552"/>
fine Things were arrived, but she
fell in Labour, and was brought to
Bed, tho' she show'd very little of
her Condition all the time she went.
This great Affair being well over,
she considers herself a new Woman,
and began, or rather continued, to
consider the Advantage she had lost
in <hi>Octavio:</hi> She regrets extreamly
her Conduct, and from one Degree
to another she looks on herself as lost
to him; she every day saw what
she had decay'd, her Jewels sold one
by one, and at last her Necessaries.
<hi>Philander,</hi> whose Head was running
on <hi>Calista,</hi> grudg'd every Moment
he was not about that Affair, grew
as peevish as shee; she recovers to
new Beauty, but he grows colder
and colder by Possession; Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd
and ill Humour increased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They grew uneasy on both sides,
and not a Day passed wherein they
did not break into open and violent
Quarrels, upbraiding each other with
those Faults, which both wished
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56143:552"/>
that either would again commit,
that they might be fairly rid of one
another: It grew at last to that
height, that they were never well
but when they were absent from one
another; he making a hundred little
Intrigues and Gallantries with all
the pretty Women, and those of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Quality in the Town or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Villa's.</hi> She saw this with
Grief, Shame, and Disdain, and
could not tell which way to relieve
herself: She was not permitted the
Privilege of Visits, unless to some
grave Ladies, or to Monasteries; a
Man was a Rarety she had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen in two Months, which was
the time she had been there; so that
she had leasure to think of her Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bemoan the Effects of her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
and contrive, if she could,
to remedy her disagreeable Life,
which now was reduced, not only
to scurrilous Quarrels, and hard
Words; but often in her Fury, she
flying upon him, and with the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:56143:553"/>
or Indiscretion of her Sex,
would provoke him to Indecencies,
that render Life insupportable on
both sides. While they liv'd at this
rate, both contriving how handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to get quit of each other, <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,</hi>
who was left in <hi>Bruxells,</hi> to
take care of his Lord's Affairs there,
and that as soon as he had heard
of <hi>Cesario's</hi> Arrival, he should come
with all speed, and give him notice,
thought every Minute an Hour till
he could see again the Charmer of
his Soul, for whom he suffered com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Fevers of Love. He studies
nothing but how first to get her
Pardon, and then to compass his
Designs of possessing her: He had
not seen her, nor durst pretend to
it, since she left <hi>Holland.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
she would have the Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to conceal some of his Faults,
least he should discover, in Revenge,
some of her's; and fancied she
would imagine so of his Conduct:
He had met with no Reproaches
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:56143:553"/>
yet from his Lord, and believed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Safe. With this Imagination he
omitted nothing that might render
him acceptable to her, nor to gain
any Secret he believed might be of
use to him: Knowing therefore that
she had not dealt very generously
with <hi>Octavio,</hi> by this Flight with
<hi>Philander,</hi> and believing that that
exasperated Lover, would in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
declare any thing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the fair Fugitive, he (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of throwing himself at
his Feet, and asking his Pardon for his
ill treating him in <hi>Holland)</hi> design'd
before he went into <hi>Luke-Land</hi> to
pay <hi>Octavio</hi> a Visit, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
went; he met first with his Page,
who being very well acquainted with
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> discoursed with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
he carried him to his Lord:
He told him, That his Lord that
day that <hi>Silvia</hi> departed, being in
impatient Expectation of her, and
that she came not according to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
sent him to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:56143:554"/>
to know if any Accident had
prevented her coming; but that when
he came, tho' he had been with her
but an Hour before, she was gone
away with <hi>Philander,</hi> never more
to return. The Youth, not being
able to carry this sad news to his
Lord, when he came home, offered
at a hundred things to conceal the
right; but the impatient Lover would
not be so answered, but all inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
commanded him to tell that
Truth which he found already but
too apparently in his Eyes. The
Lad, so commanded, could no longer
defer telling him <hi>Silvia</hi> was gone,
and being asked again and again,
what he meant, with a Face and
Voice, that every Moment altered to
dying; the Page assured him she
was gone out of <hi>Bruxells</hi> with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
never more to return; which
was no sooner told him, but he sunk
on the Couch where he lay, and
fainted: He farther told him how
long it was, and with what Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:56143:554"/>
he was recovered to Life; and
that after he was so, he refused to
speak or see any Visitors; could for
a long time be neither perswaded to
eat nor sleep, but that he had spoke
to no body ever since, and did now
believe he could not procure him the
Favour he beg'd: That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he would go and see what the
very Name of any that had but a
relation to the Family of <hi>Silvia</hi> would
produce in him, whether a storm of
Passion, or a calm of Grief: Either
would be better than a Dulness, all
silent and sad, in which there was
no understanding what he meant by
it: Whoever spoke, he only made
a short sign, and turn'd away, as
much as to say, Speak no more to
me: But now, resolv'd to try his
Temper, hasted to his Lord, and
told him that <hi>Brilljard,</hi> full of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
for his past Fault, and Grief,
for the ill Condition he heard he was
in, was come to pay his humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to him and gain his Pardon,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:56143:555"/>
before he went to his Lord and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via;</hi>
without which he had, nor
could have any peace of Mind, he
being too sensible of the baseness of
the Injury he had done him. At
the Name of <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Silvia,
Octavio</hi> show'd some signs of listen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but to the rest no regard; and
starting from the Bed where he was
laid: <hi>Ah! what hast thou said,</hi> cry'd
he? The Page then repeated the
Message, and was commanded to
bring him up; who, accordingly,
with all the signs of Submission, cast
himself at his Feet and Mercy; and
tho' he were an Enemy, the very
thought that he belonged to <hi>Silvia</hi>
made <hi>Octavio</hi> caress him, as the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Friends: He kept him with
him two or three days, and would
not suffer him to stir from him; but
all their Discourse was of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Silvia;</hi> of whom, the deceived
Lover spoke the softest unheard ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
things, that ever Passion utter'd:
He made the amorous <hi>Brilljard</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:56143:555"/>
weep a hundred times a-day; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
when he would have sooth'd
his Heart with Hopes of seeing her,
and one day injoying her intirely to
himself, he would with so much
peace of Mind renounce her, as <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
no longer doubted but he would
indeed not more trust her fickle Sex.
At last the News arrived that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario</hi>
was in <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and <hi>Brillijard</hi>
was obliged the next Morning to
take Horse, and to go to his Lord:
And to make himself the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to <hi>Silvia,</hi> he humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
<hi>Octavio</hi> to write some part
of his Resentment to her, that he
might oblige her to a Reason for
what she had so inhumanly done:
This flattered him a little, and he
was not long before he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by <hi>Brilljard</hi>'s Intreaties; who,
having his Ends in every thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
this Letter might contain at
least something to asist in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
by giving him Authority
over her by so great a Secret: The
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56143:556"/>
next Morning, before he took Horse,
he waited on <hi>Octavio</hi> for his Letter,
and promised him an Answer at his
Return, which would be in a few
days. The Letter was open, and
<hi>Octavio</hi> suffered <hi>Brilljard</hi> to read it,
making him an absolute Confident
in his Amour; which having done,
he besought him to add one thing
more to it; and that was, to beg
her to forgive <hi>Brilljard,</hi> which for
his sake he knew she would do: He
told him, he was obliged as a good
<hi>Christian,</hi> and a dying Man, one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
for Heaven, to do that good
Office, and accordingly did. <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard,</hi>
taking Post immediately, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to <hi>Philander,</hi> where he found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing as he wished, all out of
Humour, still on the Fret, and ever
peevish. He had not seen <hi>Silvia,</hi> as
I said, since she went from <hi>Holland,</hi>
and now knew not which way to
approach her: <hi>Philander</hi> was abroad
on some of his usual Gallantries, when
<hi>Brilljard</hi> arrived; and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:56143:556"/>
a while of the Affairs of his
Lord and <hi>Silvia,</hi> he told <hi>Antonett</hi>
he had a great desire to speak with
that dissatisfied fair one, assuring her
he believed his Visit would be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
from what he had to say to
her concerning <hi>Octavio:</hi> She told him
(with infinite Joy) that she did
not doubt of his Pardon from her
Lady if he brought any News from
that gallant injured Man; and in all
hast, tho' her Lady saw no body, but
refused to rise from her Couch, she
ran to her, and besought her to see
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> for he came with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
from <hi>Octavio,</hi> the Person who
was the Subject of their Discourse
Night and Day, when alone. She
immediately sent for <hi>Brilljard,</hi> who
approach'd his Goddess with a tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Devotion; he kneel'd before
her, and humbly besought her Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for all that was past: But she,
who with the very Thought that he
had something to say from <hi>Octavio,</hi>
forgot all but that, and hastily bid
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:56143:557"/>
him rise, and take all he ask'd and
hope for what he wished: In this
Transport she imbraced his Head,
and kiss'd his Cheek, and took him
up. <hi>That, Madam,</hi> said Brilljard,
<hi>which your divine Bounty alone has
given me, without any Merit in me,
I durst not have had the Confidence
to have hop'd without my Credential
from a nobler Hand.—This, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
said he,—And gives her a
Letter from <hi>Octavio:</hi> The dear hand
she knew and kiss'd a hundred times
as she opened it; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
<hi>Brilljard</hi> to withdraw for a
Moment, that he might not see her
Concern at the reading it, she sate
her down and found it this.</p>

I had hoarded up together in my Heart,

upon the Rack, and screw him up to
all degrees of Pain; yet such, as do
not end in kinder Death. Oh thou
unhappy Ruiner of my Repose! Oh
fair Vnfortunate! if yet my Agony
would give me leave to argue, I am
so miserably lost, to ask thee yet this
woful Satisfaction; to tell me why
thou hast undone me thus? Why thou
shouldest chuse out me from all the
Crowd of fond admiring Fools, to
make the World's Reproach, and turn
to redicule? How could'st thou use that
soft good Nature so, that had not one
ungrateful sullen Humour in it, for
thy Revenge and Pride to work upon?
No Baseness in my Love, no dull Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity

but all was gay and kind, all lavish
Fondness, and all that Woman vain,

Youth that might have gain'd me
Fame abroad was dedicated to thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Service, laid at thy Feet, and
idly past in Love. Oh charming
Maid, whom Heaven has form'd for
the Punishment of all, whose Flames
are Criminal! why could'st not thou
have made some kind distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those common Passions and my
Flame? I gave thee all my Vows, my
honest Vows, before I asked a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for Love. I made thee mine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sacred Powers, that witness
every secret solemn Vow, and fix 'em
in the eternal Book of Fate; if thou
had'st given thy Faith to any other,
as, oh, too sure thou hast, what Fault
was this in me, who knew it not, why
should I bear that sin? I took thee to
me as a Virgin Treasure, sent from
the Gods to charm the Ills of Life,
to make the tedious Iourney short and
joyful; I came to make atonement for
thy Sin, and to redeem thy Fame;
not add to the detested Number. I
came to guild thy Stains of Honour
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:56143:559"/>
over; and set so high a Price upon
thy Name, that all Reproaches for thy
past Offences, should have been lost in
future Crowds of Glory: I came to
lead thee from a world of Shame, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Ills, and future Miseries;
from noisy Flatterers that would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
thee, first to dull Lust, and
more unthinking Wit; possess thee,
then traduce thee. By Heaven, I swear,
it was not for myself alone, I took
such pains to gain thee, and set thee
free from all those Circumstances that
might perhaps debauch thy worthier
Nature, and I believed it was with
pain you yielded to every buying Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
No, 'twas for thy Sake, in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

was not yet so vain to hope to win,

nor had I once complain'd upon my

I had fairly won, to have it basely

scorn to look into my easy Heart, and
loath the Figure you have made me

Eyes were not in Fault; nor that
thy Sense, too delicate and nice, could
meet no proper Subject for thy Wit,
thy Heart, thy tender Heart, was not
in fault, because it took not in my

back: Oh! no, my <hi>Silvia,</hi> this, tho' I

what greater Earnest of eternal Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Oh! thou had'st raised me to the

that Pride that taught me first Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition;
'tis a poor Satisfaction now,
to know (if thou could'st yet tell
Truth) what Motive first seduced thee
to my Ruin? Had it been Interest—
by Heaven, I would have bought my

I would gratify my real Passions; at

greater degree, had no sooner read
this Letter, but she suffered herself
to be distracted, with all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Passions that possess dispairing
Lovers; sometimes raveing, and
sometimes sighing and weeping:
'Twas a good while she continued
in these Disorders, still thinking on
what she had to do next, that might
redeem all: Being a little come to
herself, she thought good to consult
with <hi>Brilljard</hi> in this Affair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom and <hi>Octavio</hi> she found
there was a very good Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And resolving absolutely to quit
<hi>Philander,</hi> she no longer had any
Scruples or Doubt what Course to
take, nor car'd she what Price she
paid for a Reconciliation with <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi>
if any Price would purchase it:
In order to this Resolve, fix'd in her
Heart, she sends for <hi>Brilljard,</hi> whom
she careses anew, with all the Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Familiarity of a Woman,
who was resolv'd to make him her
Confident, or rather indeed her next
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56143:562"/>
Gallant. I have already said he was
very handsome, and very well made,
and you may believe he took all the
care he could in dressing, which he
understood very well: He had a
good deal of Wit, and was very
well fashion'd and bred:—With
all these Accomplishments, and the
addition of Love and Youth, he could
not be imagined to appear wholly
indifferent in the Eyes of any body,
tho' hitherto he had in those of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
whose Heart was doating on
<hi>Philander;</hi> but now, that that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was wholly extinguished, and
that their eternal Quarrels had made
almost a perpetual Separation, she
being alone, without the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, which she lov'd, and
was used to, and in her Inclination
naturally addicted to love, she found
<hi>Brilljard</hi> more agreeable than he
used to be; which together with
he Designs she had upon him, made
her take such a Freedom with him,
as wholly transported this almost
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:56143:563"/>
hopeless Lover: She discourses with
him concerning <hi>Octavio</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and he failed not to answer,
so as to please her, right or wrong;
she tells him how uneasy she was
with <hi>Philander,</hi> who every day
grew more and more insupportable
to her; she tells him she had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Inclination for <hi>Octavio,</hi> and
more for his Fortune, that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to support her, than his Person;
she knew she had a great Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him, and however it might
seem now to be diminished by her
unlucky Flight with <hi>Philander,</hi> she
doubted not but to reduce him to all
that Love he once profess'd to her,
by telling him she was forc'd away,
and without her Knowledge, being
carried only to take the Air, was
compell'd to the fatal Place where
she now was. <hi>Brilljard</hi> sooths and
flatters her in all her Hope, and
offers her his Service in her Flight,
which he might easily assist, unknown
to <hi>Philander.</hi> It was now about fix
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56143:563"/>
a Clock at Night, and she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Supper to be provided
and brought to her Chamber, where
<hi>Brilljard</hi> and she supp'd together,
and talk'd of nothing but the new
Design; the hope of effecting which
put her into so good Humour, that
she frankly drank her Bottle, and
show'd more signs of Mirth than
she had done in many Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
In this good Humour <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
look'd more amiable than ever,
she smiles upon him, she caresses him
with all the assurance of Friendship
imaginable; she tells him she shall
behold him as her dearest Friend,
and spoke so many kind things, that
he was imbolden'd, and approach'd
her by degrees more near; he makes
Advances; and the greatest Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
was, the Secret he had of
her intended Flight: He tells her,
He hop'd she would be pleased to
consider (that while he was serving
her in a new Amour, and assisting to
render her into the Arms of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56143:564"/>
he was wounding his own
Heart which languished for her;
that he should not have taken the
Presumption to have told her this
as such a time as he offered his
Life to serve her, but that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
no Secret to her, and that a
Man who lov'd at his rate, and yet
would contrive to make his Mistriss
happy with another, ought in Justice
to receive some Recompence of a
Flame so constant and so submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
While he spake he found he
was not regarded with the Looks
of Scorn or Disdain; he knew her
haughty Temper, and finding it
calm, he pressed on to new Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
he fell at her Feet, and
pleaded so well, where no Opposers
were, that <hi>Silvia</hi> no longer resisted,
or if she did, it was very feebly,
and with a sort of Wish, that he
would pursue his Boldness yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which at last he did, from
one degree of Softness and gentle
Force to another, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56143:564"/>
the happiest Man in the World;
tho' she was very much disordered
at the Apprehension of what she
had suffered from a Man of his
Character, as she imagined so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
below her; but he redoubled
his Submissions in so cunning a
manner, that he soon brought her
to her good Humour; and after
that he used the kind Authority of
a Husband whenever he had an
Opportunity, and found her not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at his Services<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
he had a Secret from her,
which if reveal'd, would not only
prevent her Design, but ruin her for
ever; she found too late she had
discovered too much to him, to keep
him at the Distance of a Servant, and
that she had no other way to attach
him eternally to her Interest, but
by this means. He now every day
appear'd more fine, and well dressed,
and omitted nothing that might
make him, if possible, and absolute
Master of her Heart, which he
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:56143:565"/>
vow'd he would defend with his
Life, from even <hi>Philander</hi> himself;
and that he would pretend no other
Empire over her, nor presume or
pretend to ingross that fair and
charming Person which ought to be
universally adored. In fine, he fail'd
not to please both her Desire and
her Vanity, and every day she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Philander</hi> less, who sometimes
in two or three together came not
home to visit her. At this time it
so happened, he being in Love with
the young Daughter of an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
about a League from his own
Lodgings, and he is always eager
on the first Address, till he has
compleated the Conquest; so that
she had not only time to please and
revenge herself with <hi>Brilljard,</hi> but
fully to resolve their Affair, and to
provide all things against their
Flight, which they had absolutely
done before <hi>Philander</hi>'s Return;
who, coming home, received <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
very kindly, and the News
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:56143:565"/>
which he brought, and which made
him understand, he should not have
any long time to finish his new A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in; but as he was very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
both in Wit and Beauty, he
left not the Village without leaving
some Ruins behind of Beauty, which
ever after bewail'd his Charms; and
since his departure was so necessary,
and that in four or five days he was
oblig'd to go, they deferr'd their flight
till he was gone; which time they
had wholly to themselves, and made
as good use of it as they could; at
least she thought so, and you may be
sure, he also, whose Love increas'd
with his possession. But <hi>Silvia</hi> longs
for Liberty, and those necessary Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantries,
which every day diminish'd;
she lov'd rich Cloths, gay Coaches,
and to be lavish; and now she was
stinted to good Housewifery, a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury
she hated.</p>
                  <p>The time of <hi>Philander's</hi> departure
being come, he took a very careless
leave of <hi>Silvia,</hi> telling her he would
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:56143:566"/>
see what Commands the Prince had
for him, and return in Ten or
Twelve days. <hi>Brilljard</hi> pretended
some little Indisposition, and beg'd he
might be permitted to follow him,
which was granted, and the next
day, tho <hi>Brilljard</hi> pleaded infinitely
for a continuation of his happiness
two or three days more, she would
not grant it, but oblig'd him, by a
thousand kind promises of it for the
future, to get Horses ready for her
Page, and Woman, and her Coach
for her self; which accordingly was
done, and they left the Village, whose
Name I cannot now call to mind,
taking with her what of value she
had left. They were three days on
their journey; <hi>Brilljard</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of care of her Health, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being Hot, and for fear of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<hi>Philander</hi> by some accident
on the Road, delay'd the time as
much as was possible, to be as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as he could all the while; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Silvia</hi> was never seen in a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:56143:566"/>
more Gay. She found this
short time of hope and pleasure, had
brought all her banish'd Beauties back,
that Care, Sickness and Grief, had
extreamly tarnisht, only her Shape
was a little more inclining to be Fat,
which did not at all however yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
her fineness; and she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
too Charming without, for the
deformity of her indiscretion within;
but she had broke the bounds of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and now stuck at nothing that
might carry on an Interest, which
she resolved should be the business of
her future life.</p>
                  <p>She at last arriv'd at <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and
caus'd a Lodging to be taken for her
in the remotest part of the Town;
as soon as she came she oblig'd <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
to visit <hi>Octavio;</hi> but going to his
Aunt's, to enquire for him, he was
told that he was no longer in the
World; he stood amaz'd a while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he had been dead, when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
the Aunt, told him he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to the Monastery of the Order
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:56143:567"/>
of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and would in a day
or two without the Probationary
Year, take Holy Orders. This did not
so much surprize him as the other,
knowing that he discours'd to him,
when he saw him last, as if some
such retirement he meant to resolve
upon; with this News, which he
was not altogether displeas'd at, <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
return'd to <hi>Silvia,</hi> which soon
chang'd all her good Humour to Tears
and Melancholy: She inquir'd at
what place he was, and believ'd she
shou'd have power to withdraw him
from a resolution so fatal to her, and
so contradictive to his Youth and
Fortune; and having consulted the
matter with <hi>Brilljard,</hi> he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
her to go to him, and use all
means possible to withdraw him.
This resolv'd, she writ a most insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating
Letter to him, wherein she
excus'd her flight by a surprize of
<hi>Philander</hi>'s, and urg'd her condition,
as it then was, for the excuse of her
long silence; and that as soon as her
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56143:567"/>
Health would give her leave, she
came to put her self eternally into
his Arms; never to depart more from
thence. These Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
accompanied with all the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
tenderness her artful Fancy
was capable of framing, she sent,
with a full assurance it would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
to perswade him to the World,
and her fair Arms again. While she
was preparing this to go, <hi>Philander,</hi>
who had heard at his arrival, what
made so much noise, that he had
been the occasion of the Worlds loss
of two of the finest Persons in it, the
Sister <hi>Calista</hi> by Debauching her, and
the Brother by Ravishing his Mistriss
from him, both which were entring
without all possibility of prevention,
into Holy Orders. He took so great a
Melancholy at it, as made him keep
his Chamber for two Days, maugre
all the urgent affairs that ought to
have invited him from thence; he
was consulting by what power to
prevent the Misfortune; he now ran
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56143:568"/>
back to all the Obligations he had to
<hi>Octavio,</hi> and pardons him all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
he did him; he loves him more
by loving <hi>Silvia</hi> less, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
how that generous Friend, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he knew he had dishonoured his
Sister, had notwithstanding sent him
Letters of Credit, to the Majestrates
of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and Bills of Exchange to
save him from the Murder of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
as was likely to have
been. He now charges all his little
faults to those of Love, and hearing
that old <hi>Clarinau</hi> was dead of the
wound <hi>Octavio</hi> had given him
by mistake, which increased in
him new hope of <hi>Calista,</hi> cou'd
she be retriev'd from the Monastery,
he resolv'd in order to this to make
<hi>Octavio</hi> a Visit, to beg his Pardon, and
beg his Friendship, and his Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in the World. He came accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to the Monastery, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
civilly received by <hi>Octavio,</hi> who
yet had not the Habit on. <hi>Philander</hi>
told him, he heard he was leaving the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56143:568"/>
World, and could not suffer him to
do so, without indeavouring to gain
his Pardon of him, for all the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
he had done him; that as to what
related to his Sister the Countess,
he protested upon his Honour, if he
had but imagined she had been so, he
wou'd have suffer'd death sooner than
his Passion to have approach'd her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly;
and that for <hi>Silvia,</hi> if he
were assur'd her possession could
make him happy, and call him to
the World again, he assur'd him he
wou'd quit her to him, were she Ten
times dearer to him than she was.
This he confirm'd with so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
of Friendship, that <hi>Octavio</hi>
oblig'd to the last degree, believ'd
and return'd him this Answer, <hi>Sir, I
must confess you have found out the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to disarm me of my resentment
against you, if I were not oblig'd by
those Vows I am going to take, to pardon
and be at peace with all the World.
However these Vows cannot hinder me
from conserving intirely that Friendship
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56143:569"/>
in my Heart, which your good qualities
and beauties at first sight ingag'd there,
and from esteeming you more than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I ought to do: the Man whom I
must yet own my Rival, and the undoer
of my Sisters Honour. But Oh—no
more of that, a Friend's above a Sister,
or a Mistriss.</hi> At this he hung down
his Eyes and sigh'd—<hi>Philander</hi>
told him he was too much concern'd
in him, not to be extreamly afflicted
at the resolution he had taken, and
besought him to quit a design so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to his Youth, and the glorious
things that Heaven had destin'd him
to; he urg'd all that could be said to
diswade him, and after all, could not
believe he would quit the World at
this Age, when it would be sufficient
Forty Years hence so to do. <hi>Octavio</hi>
only answer'd with a Smile; but
when he saw <hi>Philander</hi> still persist,
he endeavour'd to convince him by
speaking, and lifting up his Eyes to
Heaven; he Vow'd by all the Holy
Powers there, he never would look
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:56143:569"/>
down to Earth again; nor more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
fickle, faithless Beauty; <hi>All the
Gay Vanities of Youth,</hi> said he, <hi>for
ever I renounce, and leave 'em all to
those that find a Pleasure or a Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in 'em: for the fair faithless Maid,
that has undone me, I leave to you the
Empire of her Heart; but have a care,</hi>
said he, (and Sighing laid his Arms
about his Neck) <hi>for even you with
all that stock of Charms, she will at last
betray: I wish her well—so well as
to repent of all her Wrongs to me—
'Tis all I have to say.</hi> What <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
could urge, being impossible to
prevail with him: And beging his
Pardon and Friendship (which was
granted by <hi>Octavio,</hi> and implor'd on
his side from <hi>Philander)</hi> he took a ring
of a great value from his Finger, and
presented it to <hi>Philander,</hi> and beg'd
him to keep it for his Sake; and to
remember him while he did so: They
Kist, and Sighing parted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philander</hi> was no sooner gone, but
<hi>Brilljard</hi> came to wait on <hi>Octavio,</hi>
                     <pb n="328" facs="tcp:56143:570"/>
whom he found at his Devotion, and
beg'd his Pardon for disturbing him:
He receiv'd him with a very good
Grace, and a chearful Countenance,
imbracing him, and after some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Condition he was going
to reduce himself to, and his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that one so young should
think of Devoting himself so early to
Heaven, and things of that nature
as the time and occasion requir'd, he
told him the extream Affliction <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
was seiz'd with, at the News of
the Resolution he had taken, and
deliver'd him her Letter, which he
read without any Emotions in his
Heart or Face, as at other times us'd
to be visible at the very mention of
her Name, or approach of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
At the finishing of which he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
smiling Cry'd; <hi>Alass, I pity her,</hi> and
gave him back the Letter. <hi>Brilljard</hi>
ask'd if he would not please to write
her some Answer, or condescend to
see her; <hi>No,</hi> replyed Octavio, <hi>I have
done with all the gilded Vanities
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56143:570"/>
of Life, now I shall think of</hi> Silvia
<hi>but as Some Heavenly thing, fit for
Diviner Contemplations, but neverwith
the Youthful thoughts of Love. What
he should send her now,</hi> he said, <hi>would
have a different Stile to those she us'd
to receive from him; it would be Pious
Counsel, Grave Advice, unfit for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
so Young and Gay as</hi> Silvia, <hi>and
would scarce find a welcome: He wish'd
he could convert her from the World—
and save her from the dangers that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
her.</hi> To this purpose was all he
said of her, and all that could be got
from him by the earnest Solliciter of
Love, who perhaps was glad his
Negotiation succeeded no better, and
took his leave of him, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to visit him often; which <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio</hi>
besought him to do, and told him
he would take some care, that for
the good of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s better part, she
should not be reduced by want of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for her Life, and little Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
to prostitute her self to vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
Man; he yet had so much
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:56143:571"/>
respect for her—and be sought <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
to come and take care of it with
him, and to intreat <hi>Silvia</hi> to accept
of it from him; and if it contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her future happiness he should
be more pleas'd than to have possest
her intirely.</p>
                  <p>You may imagine how this News
pleas'd <hi>Silvia;</hi> who trembling with
fear every Moment, had expected
<hi>Brilljard</hi>'s coming, and found no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Benefit by his Negotiation, but
she must bear what she cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void;
but 'twas rather with the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a Bacchanal, than a Woman of
common Sense, and Prudence; all
about her pleaded some days in vain,
and she hated <hi>Brilljard</hi> for not doing
impossibilities; and it was sometime
before he could bring her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to speak to her or visit her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philander</hi> having left <hi>Octavio,</hi> went
immediately to wait on <hi>Cesario,</hi> who
was extreamly pleas'd to meet him
there; and they exchang'd their Souls
to each other, and all the Secrets of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:56143:571"/>
'em. After they had discours'd of all
that they had a mind to hear and
know on both sides, <hi>Cesario</hi> inquir'd
of him of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Health; and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
gave him an account of the
uneasiness of her Temper, and the
occasions of their Quarrels, in which
<hi>Octavio</hi> had his part, as being the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of some of 'em: From this he
falls to give a Character of that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and came to this part of it, where
he had put himself into the Orders of
the <hi>Bernardines,</hi> resolving to leave
the World, and all its Charms and
Temptations. As they were speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
some Gentlemen, who came to
make their Court to the Prince, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
'em speaking of <hi>Octavio,</hi> told
them that to morrow he was to be
initiated, without the Years Tryal;
the Prince would needs go and see
the Ceremony, having heard so much
of the Man; and accordingly next
day, accompanied with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<hi>Philander, Thomaso,</hi> and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Persons of Quality and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:56143:572"/>
he went to the great Church;
where were present all the Ladies of
the Court, and all that were in the
Town. The Noise of it was so great,
that <hi>Silvia,</hi> all languishing, and ill
as she was, would not be perswaded
from going, but so muffl'd in her
Hoods, as she was not to be known
by any.</p>
                  <p>Never was any thing so magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
as this Ceremony, the Church
was on no occasion so richly adorn'd;
<hi>Silvia</hi> chanc'd to be seated near the
Prince of <hi>Michlenburgh,</hi> who was then
in <hi>Bruxells</hi> and at the Ceremony; sad
as she was, while the soft Musick was
playing, she discours'd to him, tho'
she knew him not, of the business of
the day: He told her she was to see a
Sight, that ought to make her Sex
less cruel; a Man extreamly Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and Young, whose Fortune could
command almost all the pleasures of
the World; yet for the Love of the
most Amiable Creature in the World,
who has treated him with Rigor, he
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:56143:572"/>
abandons this Youth and Beauty to
all the Severities of rigid Devotion:
This relation, with a great deal he
said of <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Vertues and Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had like to have discovered her by
putting her into a Swoon: and she
had much ado to support her self in
her Seat. I my self went among the
rest to this Ceremony, having in all
the time I lived in <hi>Flanders,</hi> never
been so curious to see any such thing:
The Order of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> is one of
the neatest of any of 'em, and there
is a Monastery of that Order, which
are oblig'd to be all Noble Mens Sons;
of which I have seen fifteen hundred
at a time in one House; all handsome,
and most of 'em Young; their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
adds a Grace to their Person, for
of all the Religious, that is the most
becoming: Long white Vests of fine
Cloth, ty'd about with White Silk
Sashes, or Cord of White Silk; over
this a long Cloak without a Cape, of
the same fine white Broad-Cloth;
their Hair of a pretty Length, as that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56143:573"/>
of our Parsons in <hi>England,</hi> and a
White Beaver; they have very fine
Apartments, fit for their quality, and
above all, every one his Library;
They have Attendance and Equipage
according to their Rank, and have
nothing of the Inconveniences and
Slovenliness of some of the Religious,
but served in as good order as can be,
and they have nothing of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastick
—but the Name, the Vow
of Chastity, and the Opportunity of
gaining Heaven, by the sweetest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
in the World, fine House, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Air, and delicate Gardens,
Grotto's and Groves. 'Twas this Oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that <hi>Octavio</hi> had chosen, as too
delicate to undertake the Austerity
of any other; and in my opinion 'tis
here a Man may hope to become a
Saint, sooner than in any other, more
perplext with Want, Cold, and all
the necessaries of Life, which takes
the thought too much from Heaven,
and afflicts it with the Cares of this
World, with Pain and too much Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence:
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:56143:573"/>
and I rather think 'tis Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
than Choice that makes a
Man a Cordelier, that may be a <hi>Iesuit</hi>
or a <hi>Bernardine,</hi> two the best of the
<hi>Holy Orders.</hi> But to return, 'twas
upon a <hi>Thursday</hi> this Ceremony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;
and as I said there was never
any thing beheld so fine as the
Church that day was, and all the
Fathers that officiated at the High-Altar;
behind which a most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Scene of Glory was opened,
with Clouds most rarely and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
set off, behind which appear'd
new onesmore bright and dazling, till
from one degree to another, their
lustre was hardly able to be look'd on;
and in which sat an hundred little
Angels so rarely dress'd, such shining
Robes, such Charming Faces, such
flowing bright Hair, Crown'd with
Roses of White and Red, with such
Artificial Wings, as one would have
said they had born the Body up in
the Splendid Sky: and these, to soft
Musick, Tun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> soft Voices with
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:56143:574"/>
such sweetness of Harmony, that for
my part, I confess, I thought my self
no longer on Earth; and sure there is
nothing gives us an Idea of real Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
like a Church all adorn'd with
rare Pictures, and the other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, with what ever can
Charm the Eyes; and Musick, and
Voices to Ravish the Ear; both which
inspire the Soul with unresistable
Devotion; and I can Swear for my
own part, in those Moments a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times I have wish'd to Die; so
absolutely I have forgot the World,
and all its Vanities, and fixt my
thoughts on Heaven. While this Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
continued, and the Anthems
were Singing, Fifty Boys all in White,
bearing Silver Censers, Cast Incense
all round, and perfum'd the Place
with the richest and most agreeable
Smells, while two hundred Silver
Lamps were burning about the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
to give a greater Glory to the
open'd Scene, while other Boys
strow'd Flowers upon the inlaid
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:56143:574"/>
Pavement, where the gay Victim
was to tread; for no Crowd of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
fill'd the empty Space, but
those that were Spectators, were so
placed as rather served to adorn than
disorder the awful Ceremony, where
all were silent, and as still as Death; as
awful as Mourners, that attend the
Hearse of some lov'd Monarch. While
we were thus listening, the soft Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
playing, and the Angels singing,
the whole Fraternity of the Order of
St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> came in, two by two, in
very graceful Order; and going up to
the shining Altar, whose Furniture,
that day, was Embroidered with
Diamonds, Pearls, and Stones of
great Value; they bow'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to their Places, into little gilded
Stalls, like our Knights of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at <hi>Windsor:</hi> After them fifty
Boys that sang, approach in order
to the Altar, bow'd, and divided on
each side; they were dressed in white
Cloth of Silver, with golden Wings
and rosy Chaplets: After these, the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:56143:575"/>
Bishop in his pontifick Robes, set
with Diamonds of great Price, and
his Mitre richly adorn'd, ascended
the Altar; where, after a short An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them,
he turn'd to receive the young
Devotee, who was just entered the
Church, while all Eyes were fixed
on him: He was led, or rather, on
each side attended, with two young
Noble-men, his Relations; and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw any thing more rich in
Dress, but that of <hi>Octavio</hi> exceeded
all Imagination, for the gayety and
fineness of the Work: It was white
Cloth of Silver embroidered with
Gold, and Buttons of Diamonds;
lin'd with rich Cloth of Gold and
Silver Flowers, his Breeches of the
same, trim'd with a pale Pinck Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture;
rich Linen, and a white
Plume in his white Hat: His Hair,
which was long and black, was that
day in the finest order that could be
imagined; but for his Face and Eyes,
I am not able to describe the Charms
that adorn'd 'em; no Fancy, no
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:56143:575"/>
Imagination can paint the Beauties
there: He look'd indeed as if he
were maid for Heaven; no Mortal
ever had such Grace: He look'd,
methought, as if the Gods of Love
had met in Council to dress him up
that day for everlasting Conquest;
for to his usual Beauties he seem'd
to have the Addition of a thousand
more; he bore new Lustre in his
Face and Eyes, Smiles on his Cheeks,
and Dimples on his Lips: He mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he trode with nobler Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as if some supernatural Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had took a peculiar Care of
him: Ten thousand Sighs, from all
sides, were sent him, as he passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
which, mix'd with the soft
Musick, made such a murmuring as
gentle Breezes moving yielding
Boughs: I am assured he won that
day more Hearts, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
than ever he had gain'd
with all his Toils of Love and
Youth before, when Industry as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
him to conquer. In his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:56143:576"/>
to the Altar, he made three
Bows; where, at the Foot o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it on
the lower Step, kneel'd, and then
High-Mass began; in which were
all sorts of different Musick, and that
so excellent, that wholly ravished
with what I saw and heard, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
myself no longer on Earth, but
absolutely ascended up to the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Sky. All I could see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
me, all I heard, was ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and heavenly; the Scene of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the dazling Altar; the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Paintings, and the numerous
Lamps; the Awfulness, the Musick,
and the Order, made me conceive
myself above the Stars, and I had
no part of mortal Thought about
me. After the Holy Ceremony was
performed, the Bishop turn'd and
bless'd him; and while an Anthem
was singing, <hi>Octavio,</hi> who was still
kneeling, submitted his Head to the
Hands of a Father, who with a pair
of Sissors cut off his delicate Hair; at
which a soft Murmur of Pity and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:56143:576"/>
Grief, fill'd the Place: Those fine
Locks, with which <hi>Silvia</hi> had a
thousand time play'd, and wound
the Curles about her snowy Finger,
she now had the dying Grief, for
her Sake, for her Infidelity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
sacrificed to her Cruelty, and
distributed amongst the Ladies, who
at any Price would purchase a Curl:
After this they took off his Linen,
and his Coat, under which he had a
white Sattin Wastcoat, and under
his Breeches Drawers of the same.
Then the Bishop took his Robes,
which lay consecrated on the Altar,
and put them on, and invested him
with the Holy Robe: The Singing
continuing to the end of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
where, after an Anthem was
sung (while he prostrated himself
before the Altar) he arose, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the two noble Men that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him to the Altar, two <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardines</hi>
approach'd and conducted
him from it, to the Seats of every
one of the Order, whom he kissed,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:56143:577"/>
and imbraced, as they came forth to
welcome him to the Society. It was
with abundance of Tears that every
one beheld this Transformation; but
<hi>Silvia</hi> swouned several times du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Ceremony, yet would not
suffer herself to be carried out; but
<hi>Antonett</hi> and another young Lady
of the House where she lodged, that
accompanied her, did what they
could to conceal her from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
View. For my part, I swear
I was never so affected in my Life,
with any thing, as I was at this
Ceremony, nor ever found my Heart
so oppressed with Tenderness; and
was myself ready to sink where I
sate, when he came near me, to be
welcom'd by a Father that sate next
me: After this he was led by two
of the eldest Fathers, to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and left a thousand sighing
Hearts behind him. Had he dy'd,
there had not been half that Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
so foolish is the mistaken
World, to grieve at our happiest
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56143:577"/>
Fortune, either when we go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or retreat from this World,
which has nothing in it that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
charm, without a thousand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
to attend it: And in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
I am sure, he himself was the
only Person that was not infinitely
concerned; who quitted the World
with so modest a Bravery, so intire
a Joy, as no young Conqueror ever
perform'd his Triumphs with more.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremony being ended, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonett</hi>
got <hi>Silvia</hi> to her Chair, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
even to Death; and she
vow'd afterwards, she had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
to withhold herself from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and seizing him at the Altar,
and preventing his Fortune and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
but that she believed <hi>Philander</hi>
would have resented it to the
last degree, and possibly have made
it fatal to both herself and <hi>Octavio.</hi>
It was a great while before she could
recover from the Indisposition to
which this fatal and unexpected Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
had reduced her: But as I
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56143:578"/>
have said, she was not of a Nature
to dy for Love; and charming and
brave as <hi>Octavio</hi> was, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
her Interest, and the loss of his
considerable Fortune, that gave her
the greatest Cause of Grief. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
she vainly fancied that yet her
Power was such, that with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of one Visit, and some of her
usual Arts, which rarely fail, she
had power to withdraw his Thoughts
from Heaven, and fix 'em all on her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
again, and to make him fly
those Inclosures to her more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Arms: But again she wisely
considered, tho' he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd,
his Fortune was disposed of
to Holy Uses, and could never be so.
This last Thought more prevailed
upon her, and had more convincing
Reason in it, than all that could
besides oppose her Flame; for she
had this wretched Prudence, even
in the highest Flights and Passions
of her Love, to have a wise Regard
to Interest; insomuch that it is most
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56143:578"/>
certain, she refused to give herself
up intirely even to <hi>Philander;</hi> him,
whom one would have thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but perfect Love, soft irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Love could have compell'd her
to have transgress'd withal, when so
many Reasons contradicted her Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
How much more then ought
we to believe that Interest was the
greatest Motive of all her after Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions?
However, this powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
fail'd not to beget in her all
the Pains and Melancholies that the
most violent of Passions could do:
But <hi>Brilljard,</hi> who lov'd to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Degree than ever, strove all he
could to divert the Thoughts of a
Grief, for which there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
and believed if he could get
her out of <hi>Bruxells,</hi> retir'd to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Town, or rather Village, where
he was first made happy, and where
<hi>Philander</hi> still believed her to be, he
should again reassume that Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her Heart he had before: In
this melancholy Fit of hers he Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56143:579"/>
it, urging the Danger he
should be in for obeying her, should
<hi>Philander</hi> once come to know that
she was in <hi>Bruxells;</hi> and that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
she would not find so civil a
Treatment as he ought to pay her,
if he should come to the knowledge
of it: Besides these Reasons, he said,
he had some of greater Importance,
which he must not discover till she
were withdrawn from <hi>Bruxells:</hi> But
there needed not much to perswade
her to retire, in the Humour she then
was; and with no Opposition on her
side, she told him she was ready to
go where he thought fit; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the next day they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Town, and in three more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to the Village. In all this
Journey <hi>Brilljard</hi> never approach'd
her but with all the Respect ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
but withal with abundance
of silent Passion; which manner of
Carriage, obliged <hi>Silvia</hi> very often
to take Notice of it, with great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and Signs of Favour; and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56143:579"/>
as he saw her Melancholy abate, he
increased in sighing and Lovers Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
Yet with all this he could not
oblige her to those Returns he
wished: When, after ten days stay,
<hi>Philander</hi> writ to him, to inquire
of his Health, and of <hi>Silvia,</hi> to
whom he sent a very kind good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
Letter, but no more of the
Lover than if there had never been
such a Joy between 'em: He beg'd
her to take care of herself, and told
her he would be with her in ten
or fifteen days; and desired her to
send him <hi>Brilljard,</hi> if he were not
wholly necessary to her Service, for
he had urgent Affairs to imploy him
in: So that <hi>Brilljard,</hi> not being able
longer, with any colour to defend
his Stay, writ him word he would
wait on him in two days: which
short time he wholly imploy'd in
utmost Indeavour to gain <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
Favour; but she, whose Thoughts
were roving on new Designs, which
she thought fit to conceal from a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56143:580"/>
Lover, still put him off with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Illness, and thoughtfulness on
the late melancholy Object and loss
of <hi>Octavio:</hi> But assur'd him as soon
as she was recovered of that Pressure,
she would receive him with the same
Joy she had before, and which his
Person and his Services merited
from her; 'twas thus she sooth'd
the hoping Lover, who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with all the Satisfaction ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
bearing a Letter from <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
to <hi>Philander,</hi> written with all
the Art of Flattery. <hi>Brilljard</hi> was
no sooner gone, but <hi>Silvia,</hi> whose
Head ran on new Adventures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to try her Chance; and being,
whenever she pleased, of a Humour
very Gay, she resolv'd upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
in which she could trust no
body but her Page, who lov'd his
Lady to the last Degree of Passion,
tho he never durst show it, even
in his Looks or Sighs; and yet the
cunning <hi>Silvia</hi> had by chance found
his Flame, and would often take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56143:580"/>
to torture the poor Youth, to
laugh at him: She knew he would
dy to serve her, and she durst trust
him with the most important Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her Life: She therefore the
next Morning sends for him to her
Chamber, which she often did, and
told him her Design; which was, in
Man's Cloths to go back to <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi>
and see if they could find any
Adventures by the way that might
be worth the Journey, and divert
'em: She told him she would trust
him with all her Secrets; and he
vow'd Fidelity. She bid him bring
her a Suit of those Cloths she used
to wear at her first Arrival at <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and he look'd out one very fine,
and which she had worn that day
she went to have been married to
<hi>Octavio,</hi> when the <hi>States</hi> Messengers
took her for a <hi>French</hi> Spy, a Suit
<hi>Philander</hi> had never seen: She e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quips
herself, and leaving in charge
with <hi>Antonett</hi> what to say in her
Absence; and telling her she was
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:56143:581"/>
going upon a Frolick to divert her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a day or two, she, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by her Page only, took Horse,
and made away towards <hi>Bruxells:</hi>
You must know that the half-way
Stage is a very small Village, in
which there is most lamentable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and may vie with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of <hi>Spain</hi> for bad Inns. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
not used much to riding, as a
Man, was pretty well tired by that
time she got to one of those <hi>Hotels;</hi>
and as soon as she alighted she went
to her Chamber, to refresh and
cool herself; and while the Page
was gone to the Kitchen, to see what
there was to eat, she was leaning
out of the Window, and looking on
the Passengers that rode along, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of which took up in the same
House. Among them that alighted,
there was a very handsom young
Gentleman, appearing of Quality,
attended only by his Page: She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
this Person a little more than
the rest, and finding him so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:56143:581"/>
had a Curiosity, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to her, to know who he was:
She ran to another Window, that
look'd into the Yard, a kind of
Balcony, and saw him alight, and
look at her; and Saluted her in
passing into the Kitchin, seeing her
look like a Youth of Quality: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in he saw her Page, and ask'd if
he belong'd to that Young Cavalier
in the Gallery; the Page told him he
did: And being ask'd Who he was,
he told him he was a young Noble
Man of <hi>France;</hi> a Stranger to all
those parts, and had made an escape
from his Tutors, to ramble for his
Fancy and his Pleasure; and said he
was of a Humour, never to be out of
his way; all places being alike to him
in those little Adventures. So leaving
him (with yet a greater Curiosity)
he ran to <hi>Silvia,</hi> and told her what
had past between the young Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and him: While she, who was
possest with the same Inquisitive Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
bid him inquire who he was,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56143:582"/>
when the Master of the <hi>Hotel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the interim up to usher in
her Supper, she inquir'd of him who
that Young Stranger was; he told
her, one of the greatest Persons in
<hi>Flanders;</hi> that he was Nephew to
the Governour, and who had a very
great Equipage at other times; but
that now he was <hi>Incognito,</hi> being on
an Intrigue: This Intrigue gave <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
new Curiosity; and hoping the
Master would tell him again, she
fell into great praises of his Beauty
and his Mein; which for several
reasons pleas'd the Man of the Inn,
who departed with the good News,
and told every Word of it to the
Young Cavalier: The good Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
besides the pleasing him with
the grateful Complements, a farther
design in the Relation; for his House
being very full of Persons of all sorts,
he had no Lodging for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's
Nephew, unless he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to our Young Cavalier.
The Gay unknown, extreamly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:56143:582"/>
pleas'd with the Character he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, by so beautiful a Gentleman,
and one who appear'd of so much
quality, being alone, and knowing
he was so also, sent a <hi>Spanish</hi> Page,
that spoke very good <hi>French,</hi> and
had a handsome Address, and quick
Wit, to make his Complement to the
Young <hi>Mounsieur;</hi> which was to
beg to be admitted to Sup with him;
who readily accepted the Honour, as
she call'd it; and the Young Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
whom we must call <hi>Alonzo,</hi>
for a reason or two, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enter'd her Chamber, with an
admirable Address, appearing much
handsomer near, than at distance;
tho' even then he drew <hi>Silvia</hi>'s
Eyes with admiration on him; there
were a thousand Young Graces in
his Person, Sweetnesses in his Face,
Love and Fire in his Eyes, and Wit
on his Tongue: His Stature was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tall nor Low, very well made,
and fashion'd; a Light brown Hair,
Hazle Eyes, and a very soft and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:56143:583"/>
Air; about twenty Years of
Age: He spoke very good <hi>French;</hi>
and after the first Complements on
either side were over, as on such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
are necessary; in which on
both sides were nothing but great
Expressions of Esteem, <hi>Silvia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
so very well to be pleas'd with
the fair Stranger, that she had like
to have forgot the part she was to
act, and have made Discoveries of
her Sex, by Addressing herself with
the Modesty and Blushes of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
But <hi>Alonzo</hi> who had no such
apprehension; tho' she appear'd with
much more Beauty, than he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ansied
ever to have seen in a Man, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
admir'd without suspecting,
and took all those Signs of Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to unassur'd Youth, and first
Address; and he was absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in her. <hi>Alonzo</hi>'s Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought up, which was the best
the bad Inn afforded, they sat down,
and all Supper time talk'd of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pleasant things, and most of Love
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:56143:583"/>
and Women, where both exprest, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Gallantry for the fair
Sex. <hi>Alonzo</hi> related many short and
pleasant accidents, and amours he
had had with women. Tho' the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were by Birth a <hi>Spaniard;</hi> yet
while they discours'd, the Glass was
not Idle, but went as briskly about,
as if <hi>Silvia</hi> had been an absolute good
Fellow. <hi>Alonzo</hi> Drinks his, and his
Mistresses Health, and <hi>Silvia</hi> return'd
the Civility, and so on till three Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
were Sacrific'd to Love and good
Humour, while she at the expence
of a little Modesty, declared herself
so much of the opinion of <hi>Don Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi>
for Gay Inconstancy, and the
Blessing of Variety, that he was
wholly Charm'd with a Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so agreeable to his own. I have
heard her Page say, from whom I
have had a great part of the Truths
of her Life, that he never saw <hi>Silvia</hi>
in so pleasant a Humour all his life
before, nor seem'd so well pleas'd,
which gave him, her Lover, a Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:56143:584"/>
that perplext him above any
thing he had ever felt from Love;
tho' he durst not own it. But <hi>Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
finding his Young Companion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so Charming (and in his
own way too) could not forbear
very often from falling upon his
Neck, and Kissing the fair disguis'd,
with as hearty an Ardour, as ever
he did one of an other Sex: He told
her he Ador'd her; she was directly
of his Principle, all gay, inconstant,
galiard and roving, and with such
a Gusto he commended the Joys of
fickle Youth, that <hi>Silvia</hi> would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
after say, she was then Jealous
of him, and Envious of those who
possest him, tho' she knew not whom.
The more she lookt on him, and
heard him speak, the more she fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
him: and Wine that warm'd
her Head, made her give him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Demonstrations of Love, that
warm'd her Heart; which he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoke
for Friendship, having mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her Sex. In this fit of beginning
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56143:584"/>
Love (which is always the best)
and Jealousie, she bethought her to
ask him on what Adventure he had
now been; for he being without his
Equipage, she believ'd, she said, he
was upon some affair of Love: He
told her there was a Lady, within an
Hours riding of that place, of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and handsome, very much Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Amongst those that were of the
number of her Adorers, he said, was
a Young Man of Quality of <hi>France,</hi>
who call'd himself <hi>Philander:</hi> This
<hi>Philander</hi> had been about eight Days
very happy in her Favour, and had
hap'ned to boast his good Fortune
the next Night at the Governours
Table, where he Din'd with the
Prince <hi>Cesario.</hi> I told him, continued
<hi>Alonzo,</hi> That the Person he so boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
of, had so soon granted him the
Favour, that I believ'd she was of a
Humour to suffer none to die at her
Feet: but this, said he, <hi>Philander</hi>
thought an Indignity to his good
parts, and told me, he believ'd he was
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:56143:585"/>
the only Man happy in her Favour,
and that could be so: On this I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
a Wager, at which he colour'd
extreamly, and the Company laugh'd,
which Incens'd him more; the
Prince urg'd the Wager, which was
a pair of <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses, the best in
the Court, on my side, against a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
on his: This odds offer'd by
me Incens'd him yet more; but urg'd
to lay, we ended the Dispute with
the Wager, the best Conclusion of
all Controversies. He would have
known what measures I would take;
I refus'd to satisfie him in that; I
only swore him upon Honour, that
he should not discover the Wager or
the dispute to the Lady. The next day
I went to pay her a visit, from my
Aunt, the Governours Lady, and
she receiv'd me with all the civility
in the World, I seem'd surpriz'd at her
Beauty, and could talk of nothing
but the Adoration I had for her, and

suffering my closest Embraces. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
prosper'd so well, I left her for
that time, and two days after I made
my visit again; she was a Married
Lady, and her Husband was a <hi>Dutch
Count,</hi> and gone to a little Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he held under my Uncle, so that
again I found a free Admittance; I
told her 'twas my Aunt's Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I brought before, but that now
'twas my own I brought, which was
that of an impatient Heart, that
Burnt with a World of Fire and
Flame, and Non-sense. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine, so
eager I was, and so pressing for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than Dull Kissing, that
she began to retire as fast as she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
before, and told me, after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of pressing her to it, that
she had set a price upon her Beauty,
and unless I understood how to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56143:586"/>
her, it was not her fault, if I
were not happy: At first I so little
expected it had been Money, that I
reiterated my Vows, and fansied it
was the assurance of my Heart she
meant; but she very frankly replyed,
Sir, you may spare your Pains, and
five hundred Pistols will ease you of
a great deal of trouble, and be the
best Argument of your Love. This
Generous Consciencious Humour of
hers, of suffering none to Die that
had five hundred Pistols to present for
a Cure, was very good News to me,
and I found I was not at all oblig'd to
my Youth or Beauty, but that a Man
with half a Nose, or a single Eye, or
that stunk like an old <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that
had Din'd on Rotten Cheese and
Garlick, should have been equally
as welcome for the aforesaid Sum, to
this Charming Insensible. I must
confess, I do not love to chaffer for
my pleasure, it takes off the best part
of it, and were I left to my own
Judgment of its worth, I should
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56143:586"/>
hardly have offer'd so sneaking a
Sum; but that sort of bargaining
was her Humour, and to enjoy her
mine, tho' she had strangely pall'd
me by this management of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
all I had now to do, was to
appoint my Night, and bring my
Money; now was a very proper time
for it, her Husband being absent: I
took my leave of her, infinitely well
pleas'd to have gain'd my point on
any Terms, with a promise to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my self there the next Night: but
she told me she had a Brother to
come to morrow, whom she would
not have see me, and for that reason,
(being however not willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the receiving her Pistoles) she
desired I would wait at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
House, till a Foot-man should give
me notice when to come; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I came, and sent her a Billet, that
I waited prepar'd at all points; and
she return'd me a Billet to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
<hi>That her Brother with some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
being arriv'd, as she expected, she
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56143:587"/>
beg'd for her Honour's sake, that I
would wait till she sent, which should be as
soon as they were gone to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
and they having rid a long
Iourney, would early retire; that
she was impatient of the Blessing, and
should be as well prepar'd as himself, and
that she would leave her Woman</hi> Leti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
<hi>to give me Admittance.</hi>—This sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
me very well; and as I atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
here, some of my acquaintance
chanced to arrive; with whom I
Supp'd, and took so many Glasses, to
her Health, as it past down, that I
was arriv'd at a very handsome pitch,
and to say Truth was as full of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
as <hi>Venus.</hi> However as soon as her
Foot-man arriv'd, I stole away, and
took Horse, and by that time it was
quite dark arriv'd at her House, where
I was let in by a Young<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Maid, whose
Habit was very neat and clean, and she
herself appear'd to my Eyes, then daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with Wine, the most beautiful
Young Creature I had ever seen, as
in truth she was; she seemed all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:56143:587"/>
and blushing Innocence; so
that conducting me into a low Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
while she went to tell her Lady
I was come, who lay ready drest in
all the Magnificence of Night-dress
to receive me, I sate contemplating
on this fair Young Maid, and no
more thought of her Lady, than of
<hi>Bethlehem Gabor.</hi> The Maid soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and Curtsying, told me with
Blushes on her Face, that her Lady
expected me; the House was still
as Sleep, and no Noise heard, but the
little Winds that rush'd among the
<hi>Iesamin</hi> that grew at the Window;
now whether at that moment, the
false Light in the Room, or the true
Wine deceived me, I know not; but I
beheld this Maid as an Angel for
Beauty; and indeed I think she had all
the temptations of Nature. I began to
kiss her, and she to tremble and blush;
yet not so much out of Fear, as Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and Shame at my Addresses. I
found her pleased with my Vows, and
melting at my Kisses; I sigh'd in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56143:588"/>
her Bosom, which panted me a
welcome there; that Bosom whiter
than Snow, sweeter than the Nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay
she had Planted there. She
urg'd me faintly to go to her Lady,
who expected me, and I swore it
was for her Sake I came (whom I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw) and that I scorn'd all other
Beauties: She kindl'd at this, and
her Cheeks glow'd with Love. I
press'd her to all I wish'd, but she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
she was a Maid, and should
be undone. I told her I would Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her, and swore it with a thousand
Oaths; she believed, and grew pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
Fond—In fine, at last she,
yielded to all I ask'd of her, which
we had scarce recover'd when her
Lady rung. I could not stir, but she
who fear'd a Surprize, ran to her, and
told her I was gone into the Garden,
and would come immediately; she,
hastens down again to me, Fires me
anew, and pleas'd me anew; 'twas
thus I taught a longing Maid the first
Lesson of Sin, at the price of Fifty
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56143:588"/>
Pistoles, which I presented her; nor
could I yet part from this young Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but stayed so long that her Lady
rung a Silver Bell again; but my new
Prize was so wholly taken up with
the pleasure of this new Amour, and
the good Fortune arriv'd to her, she
heard not the Bell, so that the fair
deceiv'd, put on her Night-gown
and Slippers, and came softly down
Stairs, and found my new Love, and
I closely imbracing with all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and fondness imaginable. I
know not what she saw in me in that
kind moment to her Woman, or
whether the disappointment gave
her a greater desire, but 'tis most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
she fell most desperately in Love
with me, and scorning to take notice
of the Indignity I put upon her, she
unseen stole to her Chamber: Where
after a most afflicting Night, she next
Morning called her Woman to her
(whom I left towards Morning,)
better pleased with my Fifty Pistoles
worth of Beauty, than I should have
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:56143:589"/>
been with that of five hundred: the
Maid whose Guilt made her very
much unassur'd, approach'd her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with such tremblings, as she no
longer doubted, but she was guilty,
but durst not examine her about it,
least she, who had her Honour in
keeping, should by the discovery she
found she had made of her Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
expose that of her Lady. She
therefore, dissembled as well as she
could, and examined her about my
stay; to which the Maid answer'd,
I had fallen asleep, and 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to wake me till day appear'd;
when for fear of discovery, I posted
away. This, tho' the Lady knew
was false, she was forc'd to take for
currant Excuse, and more raging
with Love, than ever, she immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
dispatch'd away her Foot-man,
with a Letter to me, upbraiding me
extreamly; but at the same time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
me with all the passion imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
and because I should not again
see my young Mistriss, who was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56143:589"/>
in Love with me, she appointed
me to meet her at a little House she
had, a Bow-shot from her own, where
was a fine De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oy, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Wild-fowl kept, which her
Husband took great delight in; there I
was to wait her coming, where
liv'd only a Man, and his old Wife,
her Servants: I was very glad of
this Invitation, and went; she came
adorn'd with all her Charms. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
her a new Woman, and one
whom I had a Wager to win upon, the
conquest of one I had inclination to,
till by the discovery of the Jilt in her
I began to dispise the Beauty; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as I said, she was new, and
now perhaps easie to be brought to
my Terms, as indeed it hap'ned; she
caress'd me with all imaginable fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
was ready to Eat my Lips, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Kissing them, and much
more forward than I wish'd, who
do not love an over easie Conquest;
however she pleas'd me for three
days together, all which time she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56143:590"/>
me there, coming to me early,
and staying the latest Hour; and I
have no reason to repent my time;
for besides that I have past it very
well, she at my coming away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
me this Jewel in my Hat, and
this Ring on my Finger, and I have
sav'd my five hundred Pistoles, my
heart, and my credit in the Encounter,
and am going to <hi>Bruxells</hi> to triumph
over the haughty conceited <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who set so great a value on his
own Beauty, and yet for all his fine
Person has paid the Pistoles before he
could purchase the Blessing, as she
swore to me, who have made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of her, and reduced her to the
thing she never yet was, a Lover;
insomuch that she has promised me
to renounce <hi>Philander.</hi> I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to visit her again; but if I do,
'twill be more for the Vanity to
please than be pleas'd, for I never
repeat any thing with pleasure: All
the while he spoke, <hi>Silvia</hi> fix'd her
Eyes, and all her soft desires upon him;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:56143:590"/>
she envies the happy Countess, but
much more the happy Maid, with
whom his perfect liking made him
happy; she fansies him in her Arms,
and wishes him there; she is ready a
thousand times to tell him she is a
Woman; but when she reflects on his
inconstancy, she fears. When he had
ended his Story, she Cry'd, sighing:
<hi>And you are just come from this fair
Lady?</hi> He answered her, he was,
<hi>Sound and Heart-hole:</hi> She reply'd,
<hi>'Tis very well you are so, but all the young
do not thus escape from Beauty, and
you may some time or other be Intrapt.
Oh,</hi> cry'd he! <hi>I defy the power of one,
while Heaven has distributed Variety
to all. Were you never in Love,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Silvia? <hi>Never,</hi> said he, <hi>that they
call Love: I have burnt and rav'd
an Hour or two, or so; pursu'd, and
gaz'd, and laid Sieges, till I had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
but what's this to Love? Did
I ever make a second visit, unless up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Necessity or Gratitude? And yet</hi>
—and there he sigh'd; <hi>and yet,</hi> said
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56143:591"/>
he, <hi>I saw a Beauty once upon the Tower,
that has ever since given me Torment.</hi>
At <hi>Bruxells,</hi> said Silvia? <hi>There,</hi> replyed
he; <hi>she was the fairest Creature Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
e're made, such White and Read
by Nature, such a Hair, such Eyes,
and such a Mouth!—all Youth and
ravishing sweetness,—I pursu'd
her to her Lodgings, and all I could get,
was, that she belonged to a young Noble
Man, who since has taken Orders. From
the Night I saw her, I never left her
Window, but had Spies of all sorts, who
brought me in intelligence, and a little
after I found she had quitted the place
with a new Lover, which made me love
and rave for her ten times more, when
I knew assuredly she was a Whore—
and how fine a one I had mist:</hi> This
call'd all the Blood to <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Face,
and so confounded her, she could not
answer; she knew it was her self, of
whom he spoke; and that course word
tho' innocently spoken, or rather
gayly express'd, put her quite out of
Countenance; however she recover'd
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:56143:591"/>
again, when she considered they
were not meant as rudenesses to her.
She lov'd him, and was easie to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
With such discourse they past
the Evening, till towards Bed-time,
and the young <hi>Spaniara,</hi> who had
took but little rest in three Nights
before, was for some repose; and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for his Chamber, the Host be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
him, since they had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
(the young <hi>French</hi> Gentleman
and himself) to be so good Friends,
that they would share a Bed together;
for intruth, said he, Sir, you must
sit up all Night else: he replyed,
with all his Soul, it was the most
grateful proposal, had been ever
made him; and Addressing himself
to <hi>Silvia,</hi> asked him if he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him that Blessing: She blush'd
extreamly at the question, and hung
down her Eyes, and he laugh'd to
see it: <hi>Sir,</hi> said Silvia, <hi>I will give you
my Bed, for 'tis all one to me, to lye
on a Bed, or on the Chairs. Why, Sir,</hi>
said Alonzo, <hi>I am too passionate an
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:56143:592"/>
adorer of the Female Sex, to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
any of my own with Addresses; nor
am I so Nice, but I can suffer a Man
to lye by me, especially so dear a Youth
as your self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e.</hi> at which he Embraced
him in his Arms, which did but the
more raise <hi>Silva</hi>'s Blushes, who wish'd
for what she dreaded: With you,
<hi>Sir,</hi> said she, <hi>I could methinks be content
to do what I do not use to do;</hi> and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to betray her Sex, forced a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
for either one or the other she
was compell'd to do; and with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he thought her what she
seemed, she chose to give her consent,
and they both went to Bed together:
to add to her deceit (she being forced
in her Sickness to cut off her Hair)
when she put off her Perriwig, she
discovered nothing of the Woman;
nor feared she any thing but her
Breasts, which were the roundest
and the whitest in the World; but
she was long in undressing, which
to colour the Matter, she suffered her
Page to do, who, poor Lad, was
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:56143:592"/>
never in so trembling a condition, as
in that manner to be obliged to serve
her, where she discovered so many
Charms he never before had seen,
but all such as might be seen with
Modesty: By that time she came to
Bed, <hi>Alonzo</hi> was fast asleep, being
so long kept waking, and never so
much as dreamt he had a Woman
with him; but she whose fears kept
her waking, had a thousand Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Wishes, so natural it is
when Virtue has broke the bounds
of Modesty, to plunge in past all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
and I believe there are very
few who retire after the first Sin.
She considers her condition in a
strange Country, her Splendor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining,
her Love for <hi>Philander</hi> quite
reduced to Friendship, or hardly
that; she was young, and eat and
drank well; had a World of Vanity,
that Food of desire, that Fuel to Vice:
She saw this the Beautifullest Youth
she imagin'd ever to have seen, of
Quality and Fortune able to serve her;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56143:593"/>
all these made her rave with a desire
to gain him for a Lover, and she ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
as all the vain and young do,
that tho no Charms had yet been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hold him, she alone had those
that would; her Glass had a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times told her so; she compares
him to <hi>Octavio,</hi> and finds him in her
opinion handsomer; she was possest
with some Love for <hi>Philander,</hi> when
he first Address'd to her, and <hi>Octavio</hi>
shar'd at best but half a Heart; but
now, that she had lost all for <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>Octavio,</hi> and had a Heart to
cast away, or give to a new Lover;
it was like her Money, she hated to
keep to it, and lavish'd it on any
Trifle, rather than hoard it, or let it
lie by: 'Twas a loss of time her
Youth could not spare: she after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
resolved, and when she had
resolved, she believ'd it done. By a
Candle she had by her to read a little
Novel, she had brought, she Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him often, as curiously as <hi>Psyche</hi>
did her <hi>Cupid,</hi> and tho he slept like
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56143:593"/>
a meer Mortal, he appeared as
Charming to her Eyes as the wing'd
God himself; and 'tis believed she
wish'd he would awake and find by
her Curiosity, her Sex: For this I
know, she durst no longer trust her
self a Bed with him, but got up, and
all the last part of the Night walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Room: her Page lay in the
Room with her, by her order, on the
Table, with a little Vallice under his
Head, which he carryed <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
in; she waked him and told him
all her fears in a pleasant manner. In
the Morning <hi>Alonzo</hi> awakes, and
wonders to find her up so soon, and
reproach'd her for the unkindness;
new Protestations on both sides pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of eternal Friendship, they
both resolved for <hi>Bruxells;</hi> but lest
she should incounter <hi>Philander</hi> on the
way, who possible might be on visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his <hi>Dutch</hi> Countess, she desired
him to ride on before, and to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fer
him to lose the happiness of his
Company, till they met in <hi>Bruxells:</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:56143:594"/>
With much ado he consents, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ring the Countess gave him
from of his Finger; Sir, said he, be
pleas'd to wear this, and if ever you
need my Fortune or my Sword, send
it, and in what part of the World
soever I am, I will fly to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<hi>Silvia</hi> returned him a little
Ring set round with Diamonds, that
<hi>Philander</hi> in his woing time had given
her amongst a thousand of finer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue:
His Name and hers was Ingraven,
instead of a Poesie in it; which was
only <hi>Philander</hi> and <hi>Silvia,</hi> and which
he took no notice of, and parted
from each other in the tenderest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that two young Gentlemen
could possible be imagin'd to do, tho it
were more than so on her side; for she
was madly in Love with him.</p>
                  <p>As soon as <hi>Silvia</hi> came to <hi>Bruxells,</hi>
she sent in the Evening to search out
<hi>Brilljard,</hi> for she had considered, if
he should come to the knowledge of
her being in Town, and she should
not send to him, he would take it so
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:56143:594"/>
very ill, that he might prevent all
her designs and rambles, the now
Joy of her Heart; she knew she
could make him her Slave, her Pimp,
her any thing, for Love, and the
hope of her Favour; and his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
might defend her; and she should
know all <hi>Philander</hi>'s motions, whom
now, tho she lov'd no more, she fear'd.
She found him, and he took her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
infinitely pleas'd at the trust
she reposed in him; the only means
by which he could arrive to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
She continues her Mans Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and he supplyed the place of <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>
dress'd her and undress'd her, shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her Linen every day; nor did
he take all these Freedoms, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
a little farther upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and opportunity, which was the
hire she gave him to serve her in
more Lucky Amours; the Fine she
paid to live free, and at ease. She tells
him her adventure, which tho it were
Daggers to his Heart, was however
the only way to keep her his own;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:56143:595"/>
for he knew her Spirit was too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be restrained by any means.
At last she told him her design upon
a certain young Man of quality,
which she told him was the same she
Incountered. She assures him 'twas
not Love or Liking, but perfectly
Interest that made her design upon
him, and that if he would assist her,
she would be very kind to him, as a
Man that had gain'd very greatly
upon her Heart. This Flattery she
urg'd with infinite fondness and art,
and he over-joy'd believed every
word as Gospel; so that he promised
her the next day to carry a Billet to
the young <hi>Don:</hi> In the mean time
she caus'd him to Sup with her, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posly
to give her an account of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,
Cesario</hi> and <hi>Hermione,</hi> whom
she heard was come to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> and
liv'd publickly with the Prince. He
told her it was very true, and that
he saw them every day, nay, every
moment together; for he verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they could not live asunder. That
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:56143:595"/>
                     <hi>Philander</hi> was every Evening Cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there, where all the male contents
of the Reformed Religion had taken
Sanctuary, and where the Grand
Council was every Night held; for
some great things were in Agitation,
and debating how to trouble the
repose of all <hi>France</hi> again with new
Broils; he told her, that all the
World made their Court to <hi>Hermione,</hi>
that if any Body had any Petitions,
or Addresses to make to the Prince,
'twas by her sole Interest; she sate
in their closest Councils, and heard
their gravest debates; and she was
the Oracle of the Board: The Prince
paying her a perfect Adoration, while
she, whose Charms of Youth were
ended, being turned of thirty,
fortifyed her decays with all
the Arts her Wit and Sex were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of, and kept her Illustrious
Lover, as perfectly her Slave as if she
had ingag'd him by all those tyes that
Fetter the most circumspect, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
subdued him to her Will, who
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:56143:596"/>
was without Exception the most love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Person upon Earth: and tho, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
you know him so perfectly
well; yet I must tell you my opinion of
him; He is all the softer Sex can wish,
and ours admire; he is form'd for
Love and War; and as he is the most
amorous and wanton in Courts, he
is also the most fierce and brave in
Field: His Birth the most elevated,
his Age arriv'd to full blown Man,
adorn'd with all the spreading Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that Charm the Fair, and ingage
the World; and I have often heard
some of our Party say, his Person
gain'd him more numbers to his side,
than his Cause or Quality; for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
all the useful Arts of Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
the gracious smile and bow,
and all those cheap Favours that so
gain upon Hearts; and without the
expence of any thing but Ceremony,
has made the Nation mad for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
who never otherwise oblig'd
'em; and sure nothing is more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the great, than Affability; nor
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:56143:596"/>
shows greater marks of Grandure,
or shall more etternize them, than
bowing to the Crowd. As the
Maiden Queen I have read of in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who made herself idoliz'd by
that sole Piece of politick Cunning,
understanding well the stubborn yet
good Nature of the People; and
gained more upon 'em by those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Arts, than if she had parted with
all the Prerogatives of her Crown.
Ah! Madam, you cannot imagine
what little Slights govern'd the whole
Universe, and how easie 'tis for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs
to oblige. This <hi>Cesario</hi> was
made to know, and there is none
so poor an Object, who may not have
Access to him, and whom he does not
send away well pleased, tho' he do not
grant what they ask. He dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
quickly, which is a grateful Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in great Men; and none ever
espoused his Interest, that did not
find a Reward and a Protection:
'Tis true, these are all the Tools
he is to work with, and he stops at
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:56143:597"/>
nothing that leads to his Ambition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
nor has he done all that lies in the
Power of Man only, to set al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>France</hi> yet in a Flame, but he calls
up the very Devils from Hell, to
his Aid, and there is no Man fam'd
for Negromancy, to whom he does
not apply himself; which, indeed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
is done by the Advice of <hi>Hermione<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
who is very much affected with those
sort of People, and puts a very great
Trust and Confidence in 'em. She
sent, at great Expence, for a <hi>German</hi>
Conjurer, who arrived the other Day,
and who is perpetually consulting
with another of the same sort, a
<hi>Scot</hi> by Birth, called <hi>Fergusano.</hi> He
was once in Holy Orders, and still
is so, but all his Practice is the black
Art; and excellent in it he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be. <hi>Hermione</hi> undertakes
nothing without his Advice; and as
he is absolutely her Creature, so his
Art governs her, and she the Prince:
She holds her Mid-night Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with him; and as she is very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:56143:597"/>
so she is very learned,
and studies this Art, taught by this
great Master <hi>Fergusano:</hi> And so far
is this glorious Hero bewitched with
these Sorcerers, that he puts his
whole Trust in these Conjurations
and Charms; and so far they have
imposed on him, that with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
Oyntment which they have
prepared for him, he shall be invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,
tho' he face the very Mouth
of a Cannon: They have, at the
earnest Request of <hi>Hermione,</hi> calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
his Nativity, and find him
born to be a King; and that before
twenty Moons exspire he shall be
crown'd in <hi>France:</hi> And flattering
his easie Youth with all the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Ambition, they have made
themselves absolutely useful to him.
This <hi>Scot,</hi> being a most inveterate
Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> lets the Prince rest
neither Night nor Day, but is still
inspiring him with new Hopes of
a Crown, and laying him down all
the false Arguments imaginable, to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:56143:598"/>
spur the active Spirit: My Lord is
not of the Opinion, yet seems to
comply with them in Council; he
laughs at all the Fopperies of Charms
and Incantations; insomuch, that
he many times angers the Prince,
and is in eternal little Feuds with
<hi>Hermione.</hi> The <hi>German,</hi> would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in these Disputes say, he found
by his Art, That the Stop to the
Princes Glory would be his Love.
This so incensed <hi>Hermione,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Prince, that they had
like to have broke with him, but
durst not for fear; he knowing too
much to be disobliged: On the other
side, <hi>Fergusano</hi> is most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
charmed with the Wit and
masculine Spirit of <hi>Hermione,</hi> her
Courage, and the manliness of her
Mind; and understanding what way
she would be served, resolved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
her, finding she had an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Ascendant over the Prince,
whom, by this means, he knew he
should get into his sole Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:56143:598"/>
                     <hi>Hermione,</hi> tho' she seemed
to be possess'd so intirely of <hi>Cesar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>'s
Heart, found she had great and
powerful Opposers, who believ'd the
Prince lay idling in her Arms, and
that possibly she might eclipse his
Fame by living at that rate with a
Woman he had no other Pretensions
to but Love; and many other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
were urged daily to him by the
Admirers of his great Actions: And
she feared, with reason, that some
time or other Ambition might get
the Ascendant of Love: She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in her Mid-night Conferences
with <hi>Fergusano,</hi> often urg'd him to
show her that piece of his Art, to
make a Philtre to retain fleeting
Love; and not only keep a Passion
alive, but even revive it from the
dead. She tells him of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with him, she urges his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Marriage, as she was pleased to
call it, in his Youth; and that he
being so young, she believed he
might find it lawful to marry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:56143:599"/>
a second time; that possibly his
Princess was for the Interest of the
King; and Men of his elivated For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ought not to be ty'd to those
Strictnesses of common Men, but for
the good of the Publick, sometimes
act beyond the musty Rules of Law
and Equity, those politick Bands to
confine the <hi>Mobile.</hi> At this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
rate she pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ads her Right to
<hi>Cesario,</hi> and he har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ens with all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and approves so well all she
says, that he resolves, not only to
attach the Prince to her by all the
force of the black Art, but that of
necessary Marriage also: This plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her to the last degree; and she
left him, after he had promised her to
bring her the Philtre by the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for it was that she most ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the other requiring time to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
with him, and work him by
degrees to it. Accordingly the next
Morning he brings her a Tooth-pick-case
of Gold of rare infernal
Workmanship, wrought with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:56143:599"/>
Charms, of that Force, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
time the Prince should touch
it, and while he but wore it about
him, his Fondness should not only
continue, but increase, and he should
hate all Womankind besides, at least
in the way of Love; and have no
power to possess another Woman,
tho' she had all the Attractions of
Nature. He tells her the Prince could
never suspect so familiar a Present,
and for the fineness of the Work,
it was a Present for a Prince, <hi>For,</hi>
said he, <hi>no human Art could frame
so rare a piece of Workmanship, that
Nine Nights the most delicate of the
Infernals were mixing the Metal with
the most powerful of Charms, and
watch'd the critical Minutes of the
Stars, in which to form the mystick
Figures, every one being a Spell upon
the Heart of that unerring Magick,
no mortal Power could ever dissolve,
undo, or conquer.</hi> The only Art
now was in giving it, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver to part with it; and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:56143:600"/>
she, who had all the Cunning of
her Sex, undertook for that part:
She dismissed her infernal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and went to her <hi>Toilet</hi> to dress
her, knowing well that the Prince
would not be long before he came
to her: She laid the Tooth-pick-Case
down so as he could not avoid see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: The Prince came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after in, as he ever used to do
Night and Morning, to see her dress
her; he saw this gay Thing on her
Table, and took it in his Hand, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
the Work of it, as he was the
most curious Person in the World:
She told him there was not a finer
wrought thing in the World, and
that she had a very great Esteem for
it, it being made by the <hi>Sybils;</hi>
and bade him mind the Antique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Work: The more she
commended it, the more he liked it,
and told her she must let him call
it his: She told him he would give
it away to the next Commender:
He vow'd he would not: She told
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:56143:600"/>
him, then he should not only call
it his, but it should in reality be
so; and he vow'd it should be the
last thing he would part with in
the World.</p>
                  <p>From that time forward she found,
or thought she found, a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
Fondness in him than she
had seen before; however it was,
she rul'd and govern'd him as she
pleased; and indeed, never was so
great a Slave to Beauty as, in my
Opinion, he was to none at all;
for she is far from having any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Charms; yet it was not long,
since it was absolutely believed by all,
that he had been resolved to give
himself wholly up to her Arms; to
have sought no other Glory than to
have retired to a Corner of the
World with her, and changed all
his Crowns of Laurel for those of
Roses: But some stirring Spirits have
roused him anew, and awakened
Ambition in him, and they are on
great Designs, which possibly ere
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:56143:601"/>
long, may make all <hi>France</hi> to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
yet still <hi>Hermione</hi> is oppressed
with Love, and the Effects of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increasing Passion. He has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Correspondence with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>Paris,</hi> and Advice of all things
that pass; they let him know they
are ready to receive him whenever
he can bring a Force into <hi>France;</hi>
nor needs he any considerable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he having already there in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
place, through which he shall
pass, all, or the most part of the
Hearts and Hands at his Devotion;
and they want but Arms, and they
shall gather as they go: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
he will land himself in some
part of the Kingdom, and it would
be Incouragement enough to all the
joyful People, who will from all
parts flock together. In fine, he is
offered all Assistance and Money;
and least all the Forces of <hi>France</hi>
should be bent against him, he has
Friends of great Quality and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
that are resolved to rise in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:56143:601"/>
places of the Kingdom, in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi>
and <hi>Guinny,</hi> whether the
King must be obliged to send his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or a great part of 'em; so that
all this side of <hi>France</hi> will be left
defenceless. I myself, Madam, have
some Share in this great Design, and
possibly you will one day see me a
Person of a Quality sufficient to merit
those Favours I am now blessed
with. <hi>Pray,</hi> reply'd <hi>Silvia,</hi> smiling
with a little Scorn, <hi>what part are you
to play, to arrive at this good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
I am,</hi> said he, <hi>trusted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
all the Ammunition and Arms,
and to hire a Vessel to transport them
to some Sea-port Town in</hi> France,
<hi>which the Council shall think most
proper to receive us. Silvia</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and said she prophesied another
End of this high Design than they
imagined; but desperate Fortunes
must take their Chance. <hi>What,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
she, <hi>does not</hi> Hermione <hi>speak
of me, and inquire of me? Yes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Brill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ard, but in such a way,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:56143:602"/>
as if she look'd on you as a lost Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and one of such a Reputation,
she would not receive a Visit from for
all the World.</hi> At this <hi>Silvia</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>treamly, and cry'd, Hermione
<hi>would be very well content to be so
mean a Sinner as myself, to be so
young and so handsome an one. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
said she, <hi>to be serious, I would
be glad to know what real Probability
there is in advancing and succeeding
in this Design, for I would take my
Measures accordingly, and keep</hi> Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>whose wavering, or rather lost For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
is the greatest Motive of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to part with him, and that
have made me so uneasy to him.
Brilljard</hi> told her he was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of the Design, and that it
was almost impossible to miscarry
in the Discontent all <hi>France</hi> was in
at this Juncture; and they feared
nothing but the Prince's Relapsing,
who, now, most certainly preferred
Love to Glory. He farther told her,
that as they were in Council, one
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:56143:602"/>
deputed from the <hi>Parisians,</hi> arrived
with new Offers, and to know the
last Result of the Prince, whether
he would espouse their Interest or
not, as they were with Life and
Fortune ready to espouse his Glory:
They sent him word, it was from
him they expected Liberty, and him
whom they look'd upon as their
titular Deity. Old <hi>Fergusano</hi> was
then in Council, that <hi>High-land
Wizard,</hi> that manages all, and who
is ever at hand to awaken Mischief,
alarm'd the Prince to new Glories,
reproaching his scandalous Life,
withal telling him there were Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to be taken to reconcile Love
and Fame; and which he was to
discourse to him about in his Closet
only; but as things were, he bade
him look into the Story of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
and <hi>Renaldo,</hi> and compare his
own with it, and he doubted not
but he would return blushing at his
Remissness and Sloath: Not that he
would exempt his Youth from the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:56143:603"/>
Pleasures of Love, but he would not
have Love hinder his Glory: This
bold Speech before <hi>Hermione,</hi> had
like to have begot an ill understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but she was as much for the
Prince's Glory as <hi>Fergusano,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be angry, when she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the Elevation of the Prince,
would be her own also. At this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
reproach, the Prince blush'd;
the Board seconding the wizard, had
this good effect to draw this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from him, That they should see
he was not so attach'd to Love, but he
could for sometime give a Cessation
to his Heart, and that the Envoy from
the <hi>Parisians,</hi> might return assur'd, that
he would as soon as he could put his
affairs in good order, come to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and bring Arms for those that had
none, with such Friends as he could
get together; he could not promise
Numbers, least by leading so many
here, their design should take Air, but
would wholly trust to Fortune, and
their good resolutions: He demanded
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:56143:603"/>
a Sum of money of 'em, for the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Arms, and they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him all Aids. This is the
last result of Council, which broke
immediately up; and the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to his Closet; where he was
no sooner come, but reflecting on the
necessity of leaving <hi>Hermione,</hi> he
fell into the most profound Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and Muzing, that could seize
a Man; while he sat thus, <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>
(who had school'd <hi>Fergusano</hi> for his
rough Speech in Council, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
he would now take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to repair that want of respect,
while the Prince was to be spoken to
alone) sent him into the Closet to
him; where he found him walking
with his Arms across, not minding
the Bard who stood gazing on him,
and at last called to him; and finding
no reply, he advanced, and pulling
him gently by the Arm, cry'd—
<hi>Awake, Royal young Man, awake! and
look up to coming Greatness—I was
reflecting,</hi> replyed Cesario, <hi>on all the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:56143:604"/>
various Fortunes I have pass'd from the
time of my Birth, to this present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
day, and would be glad to know if
any supernatural means can tell me, what
future Event will befal me? If I beleived
I should not gain a Crown by this great
Enterprize I am undertaking, here I
would lay me down in silent Ease, give
up my Toils and restless Soul to Love,
and never think on vain Ambition
more: Ease thou my troubled Mind, if
thou hast any Friend among the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
and they dare utter Truth: My gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Prince,</hi> replyed the fawning Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
<hi>this Night, if you dare loose your
self from Love, and come unattended
to my Apartment, I'll undertake to
show you all the future Fortune you
are to run, the Hazards, Dangers, and
Escapes, that attend your mighty Race of
Life: I'll lay the Adamantin Book
before you, where all the Destinies of
Princes are Hieroglisick'd. I'll show
you more, if Hell can furnish Objects,
and you dare stand untrembling at the
Terrour of 'em. Enough,</hi> replyed
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:56143:604"/>
Cesario; <hi>Name me the Hour. 'Twixt
Twelve and One,</hi> said he; <hi>for that's
the sacred dismal time of Night for
Fiends to come, for Tombs to open, and
let loose their Dead,—we shall have
use of both.—No more,</hi> reply'd Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario,
<hi>I'll attend 'em:</hi> The Prince
was going out, when <hi>Fergusano</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
him, and cry'd, <hi>one thing, Sir,
I must caution you, That from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
to that, wherein I shall show you
your Destiny, you commit nothing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with Women-kind: Away,</hi> replyed the
Prince, smiling, <hi>and leave your Canting.</hi>
The Wizard putting on a more grave
Countenance, replyed—<hi>By all
the Infernals, Sir, if you commit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Things, I cannot serve you. If
your devils,</hi> replyed the Prince, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>be so nice, I doubt I shall find 'em
too honest for my Purpose. Sir,</hi> said
the subtle old Fiend, <hi>such Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Devils your Highness is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with to Night; and if you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Secret, it will not prove so
Lucky. Since they are so Humourous,</hi>
                     <pb n="398" facs="tcp:56143:605"/>
cry'd Cesario, <hi>I will give 'em way for
once:</hi> And going out of the Room,
he went directly to <hi>Hermione</hi>'s apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
where it being late, she is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for Bed, and with a thousand
Kisses, and hanging on his Neck, she
ask'd him, why he is so slow, and
why he suffers not himself to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd?
He feigns a thousand excuses,
at which she seems extreamly amaz'd;
she complains, reproaches and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
—He tells her he was to
wait on the Governour, about his
most urgent affairs, and was (late
as it was) to consult with him: She
ask'd him what affairs he was to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate,
of which she was not to
bear her part? he refuses to tell her;
and she replyed she had sense and
courage for any Enterprize, and
should resent it very ill, if she were
not made acquainted with it: But he
swore to her, she should know all
the whole truth, as soon as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned:
This pacifyed her in some
measure, and at the hour appointed,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:56143:605"/>
she suffered him to go; and in a
Chair was carryed to a little House
<hi>Fergusano</hi> had taken without the
Town, to which belong'd a large
Garden, at the farther end of which
was a Thicket of unordered Trees,
that surrounded a Grotto; which
pass'd a good way under the ground. It
had had some rareties of Water-work
formerly belonging to it, but now they
were decay'd; only here and there a
broken Rock let out a little Stream,
that murmur'd and dash'd upon the
Earth below, and ran away in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Rivolet; which served to add a
Melancholy to the dismal place: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this the Prince was conducted by
the old <hi>German,</hi> who assisted in the
Charm; they had only one Torch
to light the way, which at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the Cave, they put out, and
within was only one Glimmering
Lamp, that rather served to add to
the horror of the Vault, discovering
its hollowness and ruins. At his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
he was saluted with a noise
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:56143:606"/>
like the rushing of Wind, which
whiz'd and whistled in the mighty
Concave. Anon a more silent whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
surrounded him, without being
able to behold any Creature, save the
old <hi>German.</hi> Anon came in <hi>Fergusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
who rowling a great Stone that
lay at one corner of the Cave, he
desired the Prince to place himself
on it, and not be surpriz'd at any
thing he should behold, nor to stir
from that inchanted Ground: he
nodding, assented to obey, while
<hi>Fergusano</hi> and the <hi>German,</hi> with
each a Wand in their Hands,
struck against the unformed Rocks,
that finish'd the end of the Cave,
Muttering a thousand Incantations;
with Voices dreadful, and motions
Antick; and after a mighty stroke of
Thunder that shook the Earth, the
rude Rock divided, and opened a
space that discovered a most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Apartment; in which was
presented a young <hi>Hero,</hi> attended
with Military Officers; his Pages
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:56143:606"/>
dressing him for the Field, all in
gilded Armour. The Prince began
to doubt himself, and to swear in his
thought, that the Apparition was
himself, so very like he was to himself,
as if he had seen his proper Figure in a
Glass. After this, several Persons
seemed to address to this great Man,
of all sorts and conditions, from the
Prince to the Peasant, with whom he
seemed to discourse with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and affability; they offered
him the League, which he took and
Signed, and gave them back; they
attend him to the Door with great
Joy and respect; but as soon as he
was gone, they laugh'd and pointed
after him; at which the Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
incens'd rose, and cryed out,
<hi>What means all this, s' Death, am I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Scorn and Mockery of the
Crowd? Fergusano</hi> besought him to
sit and have patience, and he obey'd,
and check'd himself. The Scene of
the Apartment being changed to an
Arbour of Flowers, and the prospect
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:56143:607"/>
of a noble and ravishing Garden;
the <hi>Hero</hi> is presented Arm'd as he
was, only without his Plume-Head-peece,
kneeling at the Feet of a fair
Woman, in loose Robes and Hair,
and attended with abundance of
little Loves, who disarm him by
degrees, of those Ornaments of War.
While she Caresses him with all the
signs of Love, the <hi>Cupid's</hi> make
Garlands of Flowers, and wreath
around his Arms and Neck, Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Head, and fettering him all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in these sweet soft Chains. They
Curle his Hair, and adorn him with
all Effeminacy; while he lies smiling
and pleas'd—the wanton Boys
disposing of his Instruments of War,
as they think fit, putting them to
ridiculous uses, and Laughing at
'em. While thus he lay, there enters
to him a great many States-men and
Politicians; grave-Men in Furs and
Chains, attended by the common
Crowd: and opening a Scene farther
off in prospect, show him Crowns,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:56143:607"/>
Scepters, Globes, Ensigns, Arms,
and Trophies; promiscuously shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel'd
together, with heaps of Gold,
Jewels, Parchments, Records, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Seals; at which sight he
starts from the Arms of the fair <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
and strove to have approach'd
those who waited for him, but
she held him fast, and with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Tears and signs of moving
Flattery, brought him back to her
Arms again, and all dissatisfy'd the
promiscuous Crowd depart, some
looking back with Scorn, others with
signs of Rage, and all the Scene of
Glory, of Arms and Crowns, disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
with the Crowd. <hi>Cesario</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forgeting, cryed out again, <hi>Ha lost!
all for a Trifling Woman lost; all
those Trophies of thy Conquest for a
Mistress! By Heaven I'll shake the
Charmer from my Soul, if both I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have.</hi> When <hi>Fergusano</hi> advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him, cryed—See, Sir, how
Supinely the young <hi>Hero</hi>'s laid upon
her downy Breast, and smil'd as he
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:56143:608"/>
spoke, which angered the Prince,
who replyed with Scorn, <hi>Now by my
Life, a Plot upon my Love;</hi> but they
protested it was not so, and beg'd he
would be silent; while thus the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
lay regardless of his Glory, all
deck'd with Flowers and Braclets,
the Drums beat, and the Trumpets
were heard, or seemed to be heard
to sound, and a vast opening space
was fill'd with armed Wariers, who
offer him their Swords, and seem to
point at Crowns, that were born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them; a while they plead in
vain, and point to Crowns in vain,
at which he only casts a scornful
smile, and lays him down in the soft
Arms of Love. They urge again, but
with one amorous look the <hi>Circe</hi> more
prevails, than all their reasonings. At
last by force, they divested him of
his Rosy-Garlands, in which there
lay a Charm, and he assumes new
life, while others bore the Inchantress
out of his sight; and then he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to be conducted where
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:56143:608"/>
they pleas'd, who lead him forth,
showing him all the way a prospect
of Crowns. At this <hi>Cesario</hi> sigh'd, and
the Ceremony continued.</p>
                  <p>The Scene chang'd, discovering a
Sea-shore, where the <hi>Hero</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
Landed, but with a very Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Air; attended with several
Officers and Gentlemen; the Earth
seems to ring with Joy, and loud
Acclamations at his approach; vast
Multitudes thronging to behold him,
and striving who first should kiss his
Hand; and bearing him aloft in the
Air, carry him out of sight with
Peals of Welcome and Joy.</p>
                  <p>He is represented next in Council,
and deep debate; and so disappears:
Then soft Musick is heard, and he
enters in the royal Robe, with a
Crown presented him on the Knee;
which he receives, and bows to all
the Rabble and the Numbers, to give
them thanks: He having in his Hand
blew Garters, with the order of St.
<hi>Espéret,</hi> which he distributes to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:56143:609"/>
persons on either Hand; throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ducal Crowns and Coronets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rabble, who scuffle and
strive to catch at them: after a great
shout of Joy, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
again shook the Earth, at
which they seemed all amaz'd, when
a thick black Cloud descended and,
covered the whole Scene, and the
Rock clos'd again, and <hi>Fergusano</hi> let
fall his Wand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prince seeing the Ceremony
end here, rises in a rage, and crys
out,</hi> I charge ye to go on—remove
the Veil, and let the Sun appear; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
your mystick Wand, and show
what follows next. I cannot, Sir, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the trembling Wizard;</hi> the
Fates have clos'd the everlasting Book
forbiding farther search. Then damn
your scanted Art, <hi>replyed the Prince,</hi>
a petty Iuggler could have done as much.
Is't not enough, <hi>replyed the</hi> German
<hi>Rabbi,</hi> that we have show'd you Crown'd,
and Crown'd in <hi>France</hi> it self? I find
the Infernals themselves are bounded
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:56143:609"/>
here, and can declare no more. Oh, they
are pretty Powers that can be Bounded,
<hi>replyed the Prince with scorn. They
strove with all their Art to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
him, laying the fault on some
mistake of theirs, in the ingredients
of the Charm, which at another
time they'd strive to prevent: they
sooth him with all the hope in the
World, that what was left unreveal'd,
must needs be as glorious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to him, as what he had seen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
which was absolutely to be
depended on: thus they brought him
to the open Garden again, where they
continued their Instructions to him,
telling him that now was the time
to arrive to all the Glories he had
seen; they presented to him the State
of Affairs in</hi> France, <hi>and how much
a greater interest he had in the Hearts
of the People, than their proper Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
arguing a thousand Fallacies
to the deluded</hi> Hero, <hi>who blind and
mad with his Dreams of Glory; his
Visions, and Prospects, listen'd with
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:56143:610"/>
reverence and attention, to all their
false perswasions. I call 'em false,
Madam, for I never had Faith
in these sort of People, and am sorry
so many great Men and Ladies of our
times, are so bewitch'd to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.
They there presented him
with a List of all the considerable
of the Reformed Religion in</hi> Paris,
<hi>who had assured him Aids of Men
and Money in this Epedition, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
rich Trades-men, Magistrates
and Gown-men of the reformed
Church, and the Law. Next to this,
another of the Contribution of
pious Ladies; all which Sums being
named, amounted to a considerable
supply; so that they assur'd him Hell
it self could not with these Aids ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his Glory; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
should be compell'd to render him
assistance, by the help of Charms, to
make him invincible: so that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
o'er-come by them, he has given
order, that all Preparations be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
made for the most secret and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:56143:610"/>
speedy conveyance of himself and
Friends to some Sea-port in</hi> France;
<hi>he has order'd abundance of Letters
to be writ to those of the</hi> Hugonot
<hi>Party into all parts of</hi> France: <hi>all
which will be ready to assist him at
his Landing.</hi> Fergusano <hi>undertakes
for the management of the whole
affair, to write, to speak, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade;
and you know, Madam, he
is the most subtle and insinuating of
all his Non-conforming Race, and
the most malignant of all our Party,
and sainted by 'em for the most pious,
and industrious Labourer in the</hi>
Cause; <hi>all that he says is Oracle to
the Crowd, and all he say's Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
and 'tis he alone is the great
Engin, that sets the great Work a
turning.</hi> Yes, <hi>replyed Silvia,</hi> and
makes the giddy World Mad with his
damnable Notions. Pernicious as he
is, <hi>replyed Brilljard,</hi> he has the sole
management of affairs under <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one;</hi>
he has power to treat, to advise,
to raise Money, to make and name Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:56143:611"/>
and lastly, to draw out a Scen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of fair Pretences for <hi>Cesario</hi> to the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the lawfulness
of his Claim: for let the Conquest be
never so sure, the People require it,
and the Conquerer is oblig'd to give
some better reason, than that of the
strength of his Sword, for his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over them. This Pretension is a
Declaration, or rather a most scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
pernicious, and treasonable Libel, if
I may say so, who have so great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in it, pen'd with all the Malice
Envy can invent; the most unbred,
rude piece of Stuff, as makes it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the Author had neither Wit or
common good Manners; besides the hellish
Principles he has made evident there.
My Lord would have no hand in the
Approbation of this gross piece of Villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Scandal, which has more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fasten'd
him from their interest, than
any of their other d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>signs, and from
which he daily more and more declines,
or seems disgusted with, tho he does
not wholly intend to quit the Interest.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:56143:611"/>
Having no other probable means to
make good that fortune, which has been
so evidently and wholly destroy'd by it.
I am extream glad, <hi>said Silvia,</hi> that
<hi>Philander</hi>'s Sentiments are so Generous,
and am at nothing so much amaz'd, as
to hear the Prince could suffer so gross
a thing to pass in his Name. I must,
<hi>said Brilljard,</hi> do the Prince right in
this point, to assure you, when the thing
was first in the rough draught show'd him,
he told <hi>Fergusano,</hi> that those accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Crown'd Head, were too Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous
for the thoughts of a Gentleman;
and giving it him again, cry'd,—
No—let it never be said, that the
Royal Blood, that runs in my Veins,
could dictate to me no more noble ways
for its defence and pretensions, than the
mean Cowardice of Lyes; and that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to Empire, I should have recourse
to the most detestable of all shifts. No,
no, my too zealous Friend, <hi>continued he,</hi>
I will, with only my Sword in my Hand at
the head of my Army, proclaim my right,
and demand a Crown; which if I win, is
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:56143:612"/>
mine; if not, 'tis his, whose Sword is
better or Lucklier; and tho the future
World may call this unjust, at least
they'll say it was brave. <hi>At this the
Wizard smil'd, and reply'd;</hi> Alas,
Sir, had we hitherto acted by rules of
Generosity only, we had not brought so
great advantages to our Interest. You
tell me, Sir, of a Speech you'll make,
with your Sword in your Hand; that
will do very well at the head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and a handsome Declaration would
be proper for men of Sense; but this is
not to the Wise, but to the Fools; on
whom nothing will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pass, but what is
pen'd to their Capacity, and who will
not be able to hear the Speeches you shall
make to an Army: this is to rouse 'em,
and find 'em wherever they are; how
far remote soever from you, that at
once they may be incited to assist you,
and espouse your Interest: This is the
sort of Gospel they believe; all other
is too fine: believe me, Sir, 'tis by these
gross devices, you are to perswade those
Sons of Earth, whose Spirits never
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:56143:612"/>
mounted above the Dunghill, whence
they grew like o're-ripe Pumpkins. Lyes
are the Spirit that inspires 'em, they
are the very Brandy that make 'em Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant;
and you may as soon beat Sense
into their Brains, as the very appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Truth; 'tis the very Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the scarlet Beast to 'em. They
understand no other than their own,
and he that does, knows to what ends
we aim. No matter, Sir, what Tools
you work withal, so the finisht piece be
fine at last. Look forward to the
Goal, a Crown attend it! and never
mind the dirty Road that leads to't.</p>
                  <p>With such false Arguments as
these, he wrought upon the easie
Nature of the Prince, who ordered
some thousands of 'em to be Printed
ready for their being disperst all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>France,</hi> as soon as they should be
Landed: Especially among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risians,</hi>
too apt to take any impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that bore the stamp and pretence
of Religion and Liberty.</p>
                  <p>While these and all other things
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:56143:613"/>
necessary were preparing, <hi>Cesario</hi>
wholly given over to Love, being
urg'd by <hi>Hermione,</hi> to know the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of his last Nights absence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravels
all the secret, and told my
Lord, and she one Night at Supper,
the whole Scene of the <hi>Grotto;</hi> so
that <hi>Hermione,</hi> more than ever being
puft up with Ambitious thoughts,
hast'ned to have the Prince press'd
to marry her; and consulting with
the Councillour of her closest secrets,
sets him anew to work; swearing
violently, that if he did not bring that
design about, she should be able by
her Ascendant o're <hi>Cesario,</hi> to ruin
all those they had undertaken, and
yet turn the Prince from the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
and that it was more to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
her Ambition (to which they
were oblig'd for all the Prince had
promised) that he had undertaken to
Head an Army, and put himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the Hands of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi>
and forsake all the soft repose of Love
and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, than for any Inclination or
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:56143:613"/>
Ambition of his own; and that she
who had power to animate him one
way, he might be assur'd had the
same power another. This she ended
in very high Language, with a look
too fierce and fiery to leave him any
doubt of; and he promised all things
should be done as she desired, and
that he would overcome the Prince,
and bring him absolutely under her
power: Not, said she, with a scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
look, that I need your aid in this
affair, or want power of my own
to command it; but I will not have
him look upon it as my Act alone,
or a thing of my seeking, but by
your advice shall be made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it is for the good of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
that having to do with a sort
of People of the Reformed Religion,
whose pretences were more Nice,
than Wise; more seemingly zealous
than reasonable or just; they might
look upon the Life she lead with the
Prince, as scandalous, that was not
justifyed by form, tho never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:56143:614"/>
A thousand things she urg'd
to him, who needed no instruction
how to make that appear authentick
and just, however contrary to religion
and Sense: But so inform'd, he parted
from her, and told her the Event
should declare his zeal for her Service;
and so it did, for he no sooner spoke
of it to the Prince, but he took the
Hint as a divine Voice; his very Soul
flush'd in his lovely Cheeks, and all
the Fire of Love was dancing in
his Eyes: Yet as if he had fear'd
what he wish'd could not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
and lawfully be brought to
pass; he ask'd a thousand questions
concerning it, all which the subtle Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
so well resolv'd, at least in his
judgment, who easily was convinced
of what he wish'd, that he no longer
deferr'd his happiness; but that very
Night in the visit he made <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi>
fell at her Feet, and implores her
consent of what he had told her
<hi>Fergusano</hi> had fully convinced him
was necessary for his Interest and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:56143:614"/>
Glory, neither of which he could
injoy or regard, if she was not the
partner of 'em; and that when he
should go to <hi>France,</hi> and put himself
in the Field to demand a Crown, he
should do it with absolute Vigor and
Resolution, if she were to be seated
as Queen on the same Throne with
him, without whom a Cottage
would be more pleasant; and he
could relish no Joys that were
not as intirely and immediately hers
as his own: He pleaded impatiently
for what she long'd, and would have
made her Petition for, and all the
while she makes a thousand doubts
and scruples only to be convinced
and confirmed by him; and after
seeming fully satisfyed, he leads her
into a Chamber (where <hi>Fergusano</hi>
waited, and only her Woman, and his
faithful confident <hi>Tomaso,</hi>) and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her: since which, she has whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
managed him with greater power
than before; takes abundance of
State; is extreamly elevated, I will
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:56143:615"/>
not say Insolent; and tho they do
not make a publick Declaration of
this; yet she owns it to all her Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates;
and is ever reproaching my
Lord with his lewd course of Life,
wholly forgetting her own; crying
out upon infamous Women, as if she
had been all the course of her Life an
innocent.</p>
                  <p>By this time Dinner was ended,
and <hi>Silvia</hi> urg'd <hi>Brilljard</hi> to depart
with her Letter; but he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
surpriz'd to find it to be to
the Governours Nephew, <hi>Don Alonzo,</hi>
who was his Lords Friend; and
who would doubtless give him an
account of all, if he did not show
him the Billet, all these reasons could
not disswade this fickle wanderer,
whose Heart was at that time set on
this young inconstant, at least her
inclinations. He tells her that her
Life would be really in danger, if
<hi>Philander</hi> comes to the knowledge
of such an Intrigue, which could
not possibly be carry'd on in that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:56143:615"/>
Town without noise: She tells him
she is resolved to quit that false injurer
of her Fame and Beauty; who had
basely abandoned her for other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of less merit, even since she
had pardoned him the Crimes of
Love he committed at <hi>Cologne;</hi> that
while he was in the Country with
her, during the time of her Lying in,
he had given himself to all that would
receive him there; that since he came
away, he had left no Beauty unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted;
and could he possibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
her of a Spirit to bow beneath
such injuries? No, she would on to
all the revenges her Youth and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were capable of taking, and stick
at nothing that led to that interest;
and that if he did not joyn with her
in her noble design, she would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him, and put herself wholly out
of his Protection: Thus she spoke
with a fierceness, that made the Lover
tremble with fear of losing her; he
therefore told her she had reason;
and that since she was resolved, he
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:56143:616"/>
would confess to her that <hi>Philander</hi>
was the most perfidious Creature in
the World; and that <hi>Hermione,</hi> the
haughty <hi>Hermione,</hi> who hated
naughty Women, invited and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the handsome Ladies of the
Court to Balls, and to the Basset Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and made very great entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
only to draw to her Interest
all the brave and the young men; and
that she daily gain'd abundance, by
these Arts, to <hi>Cesario,</hi> and above all
strove by these amusements to engage
<hi>Philander;</hi> whom she perceiv'd to
grow cold in the great concern; dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treating him with Variety of
Beauty; so that there was no Gaity,
no Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lantry, or Play, but at <hi>Hermio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>'s;
whither all the Youth of both
Qualities repaired; and 'twas there
the Governours Nephew was every
Evening to be found. Possibly, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I had not told you this, if the
Princes Bounty had not taken me
totally off from <hi>Philander;</hi> so that
I have no other dependance on him,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:56143:616"/>
but that of my Respect and Duty,
out of perfect Gratitude. After this
to gain <hi>Brilljard</hi> intirely, she assur'd
him if his Fortune were suitable to
her Quality, and her way of Life,
she believed she should devote herself
to him; and tho what she said were
the least of her thoughts, if fail'd not
to flatter him agreeably, and he sigh'd
with Grief, that he could not ingage
her; all he could get was little
enough to support him fine, which
he was always as any Person of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
at Court, and appear'd as Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and might have had some happy
Minutes with very fine Ladies, who
thought well of him. To salve this
defect of want of Fortune, he told
her he had received a command from
<hi>Octavio,</hi> to come to him about set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of a very considerable Pension
upon her, and that he had at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting
put Money into his Aunt's
Hands, who was a Woman of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
quality; to be dispos'd of to
that Charitable Use, and that if she
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:56143:617"/>
pleas'd to maintain her rest of Fame,
and live without receiving Love Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
from Men, she might now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that, which would be a much
better and nobler support than that
from a Lover, which would be Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory,
and last but as long as her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or a less time, his Love. To this
she knew not what to answer, but
ready money being the joy of her
Heart, and the support of her Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
she seems to yield to this, having
said so much before; and she consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
she wanted a thousand things
to adorn her Beauty, being very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive;
she was impatient till this
were performed, and deferr'd the
sending to <hi>Don Alonzo,</hi> tho her
thoughts were perpetually on him.
She by the advice of <hi>Brilljard,</hi> writes a
Letter to <hi>Octavio;</hi> which was not like
those she had before written, but as an
humble Penitent would write to a
Ghostly Father, treating him with all
the respect that was possible: and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
she mention'd love, it was as if her
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:56143:617"/>
Heart had, violently and against her
will, burst out into softness, as still she
retain'd there; and then she would
take up again, and ask pardon for that
Transgression; she told him it was
a passion, which tho she could never
Extinguish for him, yet that it
should never warm her for another,
but she would leave <hi>Philander</hi> to
the World, and retire where she was
not known, and try to make up her
broken Fortunes; with abundance
of things to this purpose; which he
carried to <hi>Octavio:</hi> he said he could
have wish'd she would have retir'd
to a Monastery, as all the first part
of her Letter had given him hope;
and resolved, and retir'd as he was,
he could not read this without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
confusion and change of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
He ask'd <hi>Brilljard</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times whether he believ'd he
might trust her, or if she would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
those ways of shame, that
at last lose all: He answered, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believ'd she would. However
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:56143:618"/>
said <hi>Octavio,</hi> 'tis not my business
to Capitulate, but to believe and act
all things for the interest and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of her, whom I yet adore; and
without farther delay writ to his
Aunt, to present <hi>Silvia</hi> with those
Sums he had left for her; and which
had been sufficient to have made her
happy all the rest of her Life, if
her Sins of Love had not obstructed
it. However she no sooner found
herself Mistriss of so considerable a
Sum, but in lieu of retiring, and
ordering her affairs so as to render
it for ever serviceable to her, the
first thing she does, is to furnish her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with new Coach and Equipage,
and to lavish out in Cloth, and Jewels,
a great part of it immediately; and
was impatient to be seen on the
<hi>Toure,</hi> and in all publick Places;
nor could <hi>Brilljard</hi> perswade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but against all good Manners
and Reason, she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lew into most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
passions with him, till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to give her way; it hap'ned
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:56143:618"/>
that the first day she show'd on the
<hi>Toure,</hi> neither <hi>Philander, Cesario,</hi>
nor <hi>Hermione</hi> chanc'd to be there; so
that at Supper it was all the news,
how glorious a young Creature was
seen only with one Lady, which was
<hi>Antonet</hi> very well drest in the Coach
with her: every Body that made
their Court that Night to <hi>Hermione,</hi>
spoke of this new Vision, as the most
extraordinary Charmer that had ever
been seen; all were that day undone
with Love, and none could learn
who this fair destroyer was; for all
the time of <hi>Silvia</hi>'s being at <hi>Bruxells</hi>
before, her being big with Child had
kept her from appearing in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
places; so that she was wholly
a new Face to all that saw her; and it
is easie to be imagined what Charms
that delicate Person appear'd with
to all, when dress'd to such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
who naturally was the most
beautiful Creature in the World;
with all the Bloom of Youth that
could add to Beauty. Among the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:56143:619"/>
rest that day that lost their Hearts,
was the Governour's Nephew; who
came into the presence that Night
wholly Transported, and told <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione</hi>
he dy'd for the lovely Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he had that day seen; so that
she, who was the most curious to
gain all the Beauties to her side,
that the men might be so too, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
all she could to find out where
this Beauty dwelt. <hi>Philander,</hi> now
grown the most Amorous and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
in the World, grew passionately
in love with the very description of
her, not imagining it had been <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
because of her Equipage: He
knew she lov'd him, at least he
thought she lov'd him too well to
conceal herself from him, or be in
<hi>Bruxells,</hi> and not let him know it;
so that wholly ravish'd with the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of the imagined new fair
One, he burnt with desire of seeing
her; and all this Night was pass'd in
discourse of this Stranger alone; the
next day her Livery being discrib'd
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:56143:619"/>
to <hi>Hermione,</hi> she sent two Pages all
about the Town, to see if they could
discover a Livery so remarkable;
and that if they did, they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of them who they belonged to,
and where that Persons Lodging
was. This was not a very difficult
matter to perform: <hi>Bruxells</hi> is not a
large place, and it was soon survey'd
from one end to the other: At last
they met with two of her Foot-men,
whom they saluted, and taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of their Livery, ask'd them who
they belong'd to? these Lads were
strangers to the Lady they serv'd,
and newly taken; and <hi>Silvia</hi> at her
first coming resolv'd to change her
Name, and was called Madam <hi>De</hi>
—a Name very considerable in
<hi>France;</hi> which they told the Pages,
and that she liv'd at such a place: This
news <hi>Hermione</hi> no sooner heard, but
she sends a Gentlemen in the Name
of the Prince and herself to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
her, and tell her she had the
Honour to know some great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:56143:620"/>
of that name in <hi>France,</hi> and did
not doubt but she was related to
them: She therefore sent to offer her
her Friendship; which possibly in a
strange place might not be unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to her, and that she should be
extream glad to see her at Court, that
is, at <hi>Cesario</hi>'s Palace. The Gentleman
who deliver'd this message, being
surpriz'd at the dazling Beauty of
the fair Stranger, was almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assur'd
in his Address, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of it surpriz'd <hi>Silvia</hi> no less, to
be invited as a strange Lady, by one
that hated her; she could not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were real, or a Plot upon her;
however she made answer, and bad
him tell Madam, the Princess, which
Title she gave her, that she receiv'd
her Complement as the greatest
Honour that could arrive to her,
and that she would wait upon her
Highness, and let her know from
her own Mouth the Sense she had
of the Obligation. The Gentleman
returned and delivered his message
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:56143:620"/>
to <hi>Hermione;</hi> but so altered in his
Look, so sad and unusual, that she
took notice of it, and ask'd him
how he liked the new Beauty: He
blushed and bow'd and told her, she
was a Wonder—This made <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione</hi>'s
Colour rise, it being spoke
before <hi>Cesario;</hi> for tho' she were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Hero's Heart, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
he should believe there was a
greater Beauty in the World, and
one universally Adored. She knew
not how so great a Miracle might
work upon him, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
she had invited her to Court.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Silvia,</hi> after
debating what to do in this Affair,
whether to visit <hi>Hermione</hi> and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her self, or to remove from <hi>Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,</hi>
resolved rather upon the last;
but she had fixed her Design as to
<hi>Don Alonzo,</hi> and would not depart
the Town. To her former begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Flame, for him was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more Fuel; she had seen him
the Day before on the <hi>Toure;</hi> she
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:56143:621"/>
had seen him gaze at her with
all the impatience of Love, with
madness of Passion in his Eyes,
ready to fling himself out of the
Coach every time she past by; and
if he appeared Beautiful before, when
in his Riding dress, and harass'd for
Four Nights together with Love
and want of Sleep. What did he
now appear to her Amorous Eyes
and Heart? She had wholly forgot
<hi>Octavio, Philander,</hi> and all, and
made a Sacrifice of both to this new
young Lover: She saw him with
all the advantages of Dress, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
as Youth and Fortune could
invent; and above all, his Beauty
and his Quality warmed her Heart a
new; and what advanced her Flame
yet farther, was a Vanity she had
of fixing the dear Wanderer, and
making him find there was a Beauty
yet in the World, that could put an
end to his Inconstancy, and make
him languish at her Feet as long as
she pleased. Resolv'd on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:56143:621"/>
she defers it no longer, but as
soon as the Persons of Quality, who
used to walk every Evening in the
Park, were got together, she accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with <hi>Antonett,</hi> and Three or
Four strange Pages and Foot-men,
went into the Park, Mask'd, drest
in perfect Glory. She had not walked
long there before she saw <hi>Don Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi>
richer than ever in his Habit, and
more Beautiful to her Eyes than any
thing she had ever seen; he was
gotten among the Young and Fair,
caressing, laughing, playing, and
acting all the little Wantonnesses of
Youth. <hi>Silvia</hi>'s Blood grew disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at this, and she found she lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by her Jealousie, and longs more
than ever to have the glory of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Heart, that so boasted
of never having yet been conquer'd.
She therefore uses all her Art to get
him to look at her; she passed by
him often, and as often as she did
so he view'd her with Pleasure; her
Shape, her Air, her Mien, had
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:56143:622"/>
something so Charming, as without
the Assistance of her Face, she gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Evening a Thousand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests;
but those were not the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
she aimed at, it was <hi>Alonzo</hi>
was the mark'd out Victim, that she
destin'd for the Sacrifice of Love.
She found him so ingag'd with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of great Quality, she almost
dispair'd to get to speak to him; her
Equipage, who stood at the Entrance
of the Park, not being by her, he
did not imagine this fine Lady to be
her he saw on the <hi>Toure</hi> last Night;
yet he look'd at her so much as gave
occasion to those he was with to rally
him extreamly, and tell him he was
in Love with what he had not seen,
and who might, notwithstanding all
that delicate appearance, be ugly
when her Mask was off. <hi>Silvia,</hi>
however, still past on with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of sighing Lovers after her,
some daring to speak, others only
languishing; to all she would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
no word but made signs, as if
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:56143:622"/>
she were a stranger and understood
'em not; at last, <hi>Alonzo</hi> wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient,
breaks from these Ralliers,
and gets into the Crowd that pursued
this lovely unknown: her Heart
leapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> when he approach'd her, and
the first thing she did was to pull
off her Glove, and not only show the
fairest Hand that ever Nature made,
but that Ring on her Finger <hi>Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi>
gave her when they parted at
the Village. The Hand alone was
enough to invite all Eyes with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to look that way; but <hi>Alonzo</hi>
had a double Motive, he saw the
Hand with Love, and the Ring with
Jealousie and Surprize; and as 'tis
natural in such Cases, the very first
Thought that possest him, was, that
the young <hi>Bellumere</hi> (for so <hi>Silvia</hi>
had call'd herself at the Village) was
a Lover of this Lady, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
her this Ring. And after his
Sighings and little Pantings, that
seized him at this thought, would
give him leave, he bowing and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:56143:623"/>
blushing cry'd,—<hi>Madam, the whole
piece must sure be Excellent, when the
Pattern is so very fine.</hi> And hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beging the Favour of a nearer
view, he took her Hand and kiss'd it
with a passionate Eagerness, which
possibly did not so well please <hi>Silvia,</hi>
because she did not think he took her
for the same person, to whom he
show'd such signs of Love last Night.
In taking her Hand he survey'd the
Ring, and cry'd,—<hi>Madam, would
to Heaven I could lay so good a claim
to this fair Hand, as I think I once
could to this Ring, which this Hand
Adorns and Honours. How, Sir,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Silvia, <hi>I hope you will not charge
me with Fellony? I am afraid I shall,</hi>
reply'd he, sighing, <hi>for you have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
me on the King's High-way and
have robbed me of a Heart: I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have robbed a Person,</hi> said Silvia,
<hi>who could more easily have parted with
that Trifle; the next fair Object will
redeem it, and it will be very little the
worse for my using. Ah, Madam,</hi>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:56143:623"/>
reply'd he, sighing, <hi>that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as you will treat it; for I find
already, you have done it more damage
than it ever sustained in all the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
it has had with Love and
Beauty. You complain too soon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Silvia,</hi> smiling, <hi>and you ought to
make a tryal of my good Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you reproach me with harming
you. I know not,</hi> reply'd <hi>Alonzo,</hi>
sighing, <hi>what I may venture to hope
from that; but I am afraid, from your
Inclinations, I ought to hope for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
since a Thousand reasonable
Iealousies already possess me, from the
sight of that Ring; and I more than
doubt I have a powerful Rival, a Youth
of the most divine Form I ever met
with of his Sex; if from him you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, I guess my Fate. I perceive,
Stranger,</hi> said Silvia, <hi>you begin to be
incons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ant already, and find excuses to
complain on your Fate before you have
tried your Fortune. I perswade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that fine Person you speak of, and
to whom you gave this Ring, has so
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:56143:624"/>
great a value for you, that to leave you
no Excuse, I assure you, he will not be
displeas'd to find you a Rival, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you prove a very constant Lover.
I confess,</hi> said Alonzo, <hi>Constancy is
an imposition I never yet had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and ill Nature to impose on the
Fair; and indeed I never found that
Woman yet, of Youth and Beauty,
that ever set so small a value on her
own Charms, to be much in Love
with that dull Vertue, or require it
of my Heart; but upon occasion, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
if such an unreasonable fair one
be found—I am extreamly sorry
(interrupted</hi> Silvia) <hi>to find you have
no better way of recommending yourself;
this will be no great incouragement to
a person of my Humour to receive your
Addresses. Madam, I do not tell you
that I am not in my nature wondrous
constant,</hi> reply'd he; <hi>I tell you only
what has hitherto happen'd to me,
not what will; that I have yet never
been so, is no fault of mine, but power,
or truth in those Beauties to whom I
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:56143:624"/>
have given my Heart, rather believe
they wanted Charms to hold me, than
that I (where Wit and Beauty ingag'd
me) should prove so false to my own
Pleasure. I am very much afraid,
Madam, if I find my Eyes as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
entertained when I shall have the
Honour to see your Face, as my Ears
are with your excellent Wit, I shall be
reduced to that very whining, sighing
Coxcomb, you like so well in a Lover,
and be ever dying at your F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> hope left to preserve myself
from this wretched thing, you Women
love; that is, that I shall not find you
so all over Charming, as what I have
hitherto found presents it self to be. You
have already created Love enough in
me for any reasonable Woman, but I
find you are not to be approached with
the common Devotions we pay your
Sex; but like your Beauty, the Passion
too must be great; and you are not
content unless you see your Lovers die;
this is that fatal proof alone that can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you of their Passion. And tho'
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:56143:625"/>
you laugh to see a Sir</hi> Courtly Nice,
<hi>a Fop in Fashion acted on the Stage,
in your Hearts that foolish thing, that
fine neat Pasquel is your Darling, your
fine Gentleman, your Well-bred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus sometimes in Jest and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Earnest, they recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves to each other, and to
so great a degree, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to be more Charm'd
on either side, which lasted till it
was time to depart; but he besought
her not to do so till she had informed
him where he might wait on her, and
most passionately folicits what she
as passionately desired: <hi>To tell you
Truth,</hi> said she, <hi>I cannot permit you
that freedom without you ask it of</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumere.
He reply'd, <hi>Next to wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on her, he should be the most over-joy'd
in the World, to pay his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to that young Gentleman.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to name him, gave him a
Thousand Fears; which when he
would have urg'd, she bid him trust
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:56143:625"/>
to the generosity of that Man, who
was of Quality, and loved him;
she then told him his Lodgings
(which were her own:) <hi>Alonzo</hi>
infinitely over-joyed, resolv'd to lose
no time, but promis'd that Evening
to visit him: And at their parting he
treated her with so much passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Respect, that she was vext to
see it paid to one he yet knew not.
However she verily believed her
Conquest was certain: He having seen
her three times, and all those times
for a several Person, and yet was still
in Love with her: And she doubted
not when all three were joyn'd in
one, he would be much more in
Love than yet he had been; with
this assurance they parted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silvia</hi> was no sooner got home
but she resolved to receive <hi>Alonzo,</hi>
who she was assured would come:
She hasted to dress herself in a very
rich Suit of Man's Cloths, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as the young <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
She believed <hi>Brilljard</hi>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:56143:626"/>
would not come till late as was his
use, now being at Play at <hi>Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one</hi>'s.
She look'd extream pretty
when she was drest, and had all
the Charms that Heaven could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
a Face and Shape withal:
Her Apartment was very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and all look'd very great. She
was no sooner drest but the young
Lover came. <hi>Silvia</hi> received him
on the Stair-case with open Arms,
and all the signs of Joy that could
be exprest, and leads him to a
rich drawing Room, where she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to entertain him with that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Nights adventure, when they
both lay together at the Village,
while <hi>Alonzo</hi> makes imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies;
wholly charmed with the look
of the young Cavalier, which so
resembled what he had seen the
day before in another Garb on the
<hi>Toure.</hi> He is wholly ravish'd with
his Voice, it being absolutely the
same that had charmed him that Day
in the Park; the more he gaz'd and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:56143:626"/>
listen'd, the more he was confirm'd
in his Opinion, that he was the same,
and he had the Musick of that dear
accent still in his Ears, and could
not be deceived. A Thousand times
he is about to kneel before her and
ask her Pardon, but still is check'd
by Doubt: He sees, he hears, this is
the same lovely Youth who lay in Bed
with him at the Village <hi>Caberett;</hi>
and then no longer thinks her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
He hears and sees it is the same
Face, and Voice, and Hands he saw
on the <hi>Toure,</hi> and in the Park,
and then believes her Woman: While
he is in these perplexities, <hi>Silvia,</hi>
who with Vanity and Pride per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his disorder, taking him in her
Arms, cry'd, <hi>Come my</hi> Alonzo, <hi>that
you shall no longer doubt but I am
perfectly your Friend, I will shew you
a Sister of mine, whom you will say is a
Beauty, or I am too partial, and I will
have your judgment of her.</hi> With that
he call'd to <hi>Antonett</hi> to beg her Lady
would permit him to bring a young

Stranger to kiss her Hand. The Maid,
instructed, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gazing on <hi>Silvia</hi> as one confounded
and amaz'd, not knowing yet how
to determine; he now begins to
think himself mistaken in the fair
Youth, and is ready to ask his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for a Fault but imagin'd, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
by his silence, the little Prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to discourse and laugh at him at
his pleasure. <hi>Come,</hi> said <hi>Silvia,</hi> smil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>I find the naming a Beauty to you
has made you Melancholy; possibly when
you see her she will not appear so to you;
we do not always agree in one Object.
Your Iudgment,</hi> reply'd Alonzo, <hi>is
too good to leave me any hope of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
at the sight of a fine Woman; if
she be like your self I read my destiny in
your charming Face. Silvia</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with a Smile—and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again for <hi>Antonett,</hi> he ask'd if his
Sister were in a condition of being
seen; she told him she was not, but
all undrest and in her Night-clothes;
<hi>Nay, then,</hi> said Silvia, <hi>I must use my
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:56143:627"/>
Authority with her:</hi> And leaving <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo</hi>
trembling with Expectation,
she ran to her dressing Room where
all things were ready, and slipping
off her Coat put on a rich Night-Gown,
and instead of her Peruke
fine Night-Clothes, and came forth
to the Charm'd <hi>Alonzo,</hi> who was
not able to approach her, she look'd
with such a Majesty and so much
dazling Beauty; he knew her to be
the same he had seen in the <hi>Toure.</hi>
She (seeing he only gazed without
Life or Motion) approaching him gave
him her Hand, and cryed—<hi>Sir,
possibly this is a more old acquaintance
of yours than my Face.</hi> At which he
blush'd and bow'd, but could not
speak: At last <hi>Silvia</hi> laughing
out-right, cryed—<hi>Here</hi> Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett
<hi>bring me again my Peruke,
for I find I shall never be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with</hi> Don Alonzo <hi>in Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats.</hi>
At this he blush'd a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times more than before, and
no longer doubting but this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:56143:628"/>
and the lovely Youth were
one; he fell at her Feet, and told
her he was undone, for she had made
him give her so undisputable
Proofs of his Dulness, he could
never hope she should allow him
capable of eternally adoring her.
<hi>Rise,</hi> cry'd Silvia, smiling, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you have not commited so great an
Errour, as you imagine; the mistake
has been often made, and Persons of a
great deal of Wit have been deceiv'd.
You may say what you please,</hi> replyed
Alonzo, <hi>to put me in Countenance;
but I shall never forgive my self the
Stupidity of that happy Night, that
laid me by the most glorious Beauty of
the World, and yet afforded me no kind
Instinct to inform my Soul how much I
was blest: Oh pity a wretchedness, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Maid, that has no other excuse but
that of Infatuation; a thousand times,
my greedy ravish'd Eyes wander'd
o're the dazling brightness of yours;
a thousand times. I wish'd that Heaven
had made you Woman! and when I
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:56143:628"/>
look'd, I burnt; but when I Kiss'd
those soft, those lovely Lips, I durst
not trust my Heart; for every touch
begot wild Thoughts about it; which
yet the Course of all my Fiery Youth,
through all the wild Debauches I had
wandered, had never yet betray'd me to:
and going to Bed with all this love and
fear about me, I made a solemn Oath
not to approach you, least so much Beauty
had o'er-come my Vertue. But by this
new discovery, you have given me a
Flame I have no power nor virtue to
oppose: 'tis just, 'tis natural to adore
you; and not to do it, were yet a crime
greater than my Sin of Dulness: and
since you have made me lose a Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Friend; it is but just I find a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss;
give me but your permission to
Love, and I will give you all my life in
Services, and wait the rest: I'll
watch and pray for coming happiness;
which I will buy at any price of Life or
Fortune. Well, Sir,</hi> replyed our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
fair One; <hi>If you believe me worth
a Conquest o're you, convince me you can
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:56143:629"/>
love; for I'm no common Beauty to
be won with petty suddain Services; and
could you lay an Empire at my Feet, I
should dispise it where the Heart were
wanting.</hi> You may believe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous;
Youth left no Argument to
convince her in that point unsaid;
and 'tis most certain they came to so
good an understanding, that he was
not seen in <hi>Bruxells</hi> for eight days
and nights after, nor this rare Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for so long a time, seen on the
<hi>Toure</hi> or any publick Place. <hi>Brill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jard</hi>
came every day to visit her, and
receive her commands, as he us'd to
do, but was answer'd still that <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
was Ill, and kept her Chamber,
not suffering even her Domesticks
to approach her: This did not so
well satisfy the Jealous Lover, but
he soon imagined the cause, and
was very much displeas'd at the ill
Treatment; if such a design had
been carried on, he desired to have
the management of it, and was angry
that <hi>Silvia</hi> had not only deceived him
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:56143:629"/>
in the promise he had made for her
to <hi>Octavio;</hi> but had done her own
business without him; he spoke
some hard words; so that to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, she was forced to oblige
<hi>Alonzo</hi> to appear at Court again;
which she had much ado to incline
him to, so absolutely she had
Charm'd him; however he went,
and she suffered <hi>Brilljard</hi> to visit her,
perswading that easie Lover (as all
Lovers are easie) that it was only
indisposition that hindered her of the
happiness of seeing him, and after
having perfectly reconcil'd herself
to him, she ask'd him the news at
<hi>Hermone</hi>'s, to whom, I had forgot
to tell you, she sent every day a
Page with a Complement, and to
let her know she was Ill, or she
would have waited on her: She
every day received the Complement
from her again, as an unknown La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<hi>Brilljard</hi> told her that all things
were now prepar'd, and in a very
short time, they should go for
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:56143:630"/>
                     <hi>France;</hi> but that whatever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was, <hi>Philander</hi> almost publickly
disown'd the Prince's Interest, and
to some very considerable of the
Party, has given out, he does not like
the Proceedings, and that he verily
believed they would find themselves
all mistaken; and that instead of a
Throne the Prince would meet a
Scaffold; so bold and open he has
been. Something of it has arriv'd to
the Prince's Ear, who was so far from
believing it, that he could hardly
be perswaded to speak of it to him;
and when he did, it was with an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
before hand, that he did not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
such reports. So that he gives him
not the pain to deny them: For my
part, I am infinitely afraid he will
disoblige the Prince one day, for last
night, when the Prince desired him
to get his Equipage ready, and to
make such Provision for you as was
necessary; he coldly told him, he
had a mind to go to <hi>Hungary,</hi> which
at that time was besieg'd by <hi>Solyman</hi>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:56143:630"/>
the Magnificent, and that he had no
inclination of returning to <hi>France.</hi>
this surpriz'd and angered the Prince;
but they parted good Friends at last,
and he has promised him all things:
So that I am very well assur'd he will
send me where he supposes you still
are, and how shall we manage that
affair?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silvia</hi> who had more cunning and
subtlety, than all the rest of her Sex;
thought it best to see <hi>Philander,</hi> and
part with him on as good terms as
she could, and that it was better he
should think he yet had the absolute
possession of her, than that he should
return to <hi>France</hi> with an ill opinion
of her Vertue, as yet he had known
no guilt of that kind, nor did he ever
more than fear it, with <hi>Octavio;</hi> so
that it would be easie for her to cajole
him yet a little longer, and when he
was gone, she should have the
World to range in, and possess this
new Lover, to whom she had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all things, and received from him
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:56143:631"/>
all assurances imaginable of inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Love: In order to this then she
consulted with <hi>Brilljard;</hi> and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
she should for a few days leave
<hi>Antonett</hi> with her Equipage, at
that House where she was, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
herself to the Village, where
<hi>Philander</hi> had left her, and where
he still imagined she was: She desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Brilljard</hi> to give her a days time
for this preparation, and it should
be so. He left her, and going to
<hi>Hermione</hi>'s, meets <hi>Philander,</hi> who
immediately gave him order to go to
<hi>Silvia</hi> the next Morning, and let her
know how all things went, and to
tell her he would be with her in two
days. In the mean time <hi>Silvia</hi> sent
for <hi>Alonzo,</hi> who was but that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone from her. He flies on the
Wings of Love, and she tells him,
she is oblig'd to go to a place six or
seven days Journey off, whither he
could not conduct her for reasons she
would tell him at her return: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he could plead with all the force
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:56143:631"/>
of love to the contrary, she gets his
consent, with a promise wholly to
devote herself to him at her return,
and pleas'd she sent him from her,
when <hi>Brilljard</hi> returning, told her
the commands he had; and 'twas
concluded they should both depart
next Morning, accompanied only
by her Page. I am well assur'd she was
very kind to <hi>Brilljard</hi> all that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and which was but too visible
to the amorous Youth, who attended
them, so absolutely had she deprav'd
her reason from one degree of Sin
and Shame to another; and he was
happy above any imagination, while
even her Heart was given to another,
and when she could propose no other
interest in this looseness, but security,
that <hi>Philander</hi> should not know
how ill she had treated him. In four
days <hi>Philander</hi> came, and finding
<hi>Silvia</hi> more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>air than ever was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
pleas'd; for she pretended to
receive him with all the joy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and the deceived Lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:56143:632"/>
and express'd abundance of
Grief, at the being obliged to
part from her; a great many Vows
and Tears were lost on both sides,
and both believed true: But the
Grief of <hi>Brilljard</hi> was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
he could not perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
he could live, when absent from
her: Some Bills <hi>Philander</hi> left her,
and was so plain with her, and
open-hearted, he told her that he
went indeed with <hi>Cesario,</hi> but it
was in order to serve the King; that
he was weary of their Actions, and
foresaw nothing but ruin would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
'em; that he never repented
him of any thing so much, as his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drawn into that Faction; in
which he found himself so greatly
involved, he could not retire with
any credit, but since Self-Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was the first principle to Nature,
he had resolved to make that his aim,
and rather prove false to a party who
had no Justice and Honour on their
Side, than to a King whom all the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:56143:632"/>
Laws of Heaven and Earth obliged
him to serve; however he was so
far in the power of these People,
that he could not disingage himself,
without utter ruin to himself; but
that as soon as he was got into <hi>France,</hi>
he would abandon their Interest:
Let the censuring World say what
it would, who never had right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things, or ever made true
Judgments of mens Actions.</p>
                  <p>He lived five or six days with <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
there; in which time she fail'd
not to assure him of her constant Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
a thousand ways, especially
by Vows that left no doubt upon his
Heart, and it was now that they
both indeed found there was a very
great Friendship still remaining at
the bottom of their Hearts for
each other, nor did they part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
manifest proofs of it. <hi>Brilljard</hi>
took a sad and melancholy leave of
her, and had not the freedom to tell it
aloud; but obliged to depart with his
Lord, they left <hi>Silvia</hi> and post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:56143:633"/>
to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> where they found
the Prince ready to depart, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
left <hi>Hermione</hi> to her Women
more than half dead. I have heard
there never was so sad a parting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Two Lovers; a Hundred
times they swounded with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the separation in each
other's Arms, and at last the
Prince was forced from her while
he left her dead, and was little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himself: He would have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the Officers and People
about him, who had espous'd his
Quarrel, would by no means suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him: And he has a Thousand
times told a person very near him,
That he had rather have forfeited
all his hop'd for Glory, than have
left that Charmer of his Soul. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had taken all care imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for <hi>Hermione,</hi> for that name so
dear to him, was scarce ever out of
his Mouth, he suffer'd himself with
a heavy Heart and Pace, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the Vessel: And I have
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:56143:633"/>
heard, he was hardly seen to smile
all that little Voyage, or his whole
Life after, or do any thing but sigh
and sometimes weep, which was
a very great discouragement to all
that followed him; they were a great
while at Sea, tost to and fro by
stress of Weather, and often dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
back to the Shore where they
first took Shiping; and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Land where they first design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they got a-shore in a little Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
where no Ship of any bigness
could Anchor; so that with much
ado, getting all their Arms and
Men on shore they sunk the Ship,
both to secure any from flying, and
that it might not fall into the Hands
of the <hi>French. Cesario</hi> was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
on the <hi>French</hi> shore, but num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
came to him of the <hi>Hugonot</hi>
Party, for whom he had Arms, and
who wanted them he furnish'd as
far as he could, and immediately
Proclaimed himself King of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Navarr,</hi> while the dirty Croud,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:56143:634"/>
rang him Peals of Joy. But tho' the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
World came in great Crowds to
his Aid, he wanted still the main sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
of his Cause, the men of more
substantial Quality: If the Ladies
could have compos'd an Army, he
would not have wanted one, for
his Beauty had got them all on his
side; and he Charm'd the fair where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he rode.—</p>
                  <p>He march'd from Town to Town
without any opposition, Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself a King in all the places
he came to; still gathering as he
march'd, till he had compos'd a very
formidable Army. He made Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Kingdom—<hi>Fergusano</hi>
was to have been a Cardinal, and
several Lords and Dukes were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated;
and he found no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all his prosperous Course
—in the mean time the Royal
Army was not Idle, which was
composed of Men very well Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined,
and conducted by several
Princes, and Men of great Quality
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:56143:634"/>
and Conduct. But as it is not the
Business of this little History to treat
of War, but altogether Love; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those rougher Relations to the
Chronicles and Historiographers of
those Times, I will only hint on such
things in this Enterprize as are most
proper for my purpose, and tell you
that <hi>Cesario</hi> omitted nothing for the
carrying on his great Design; he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
his Scandals all over <hi>France,</hi>
tho' they met with an obstruction at
<hi>Paris,</hi> and were immediately sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
it being proclaim'd Death
for any person to keep one in their
Houses; and if any should by
chance come to their Hands, they
were on this Penalty, to carry them
to the Secretary of State; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Punishment had past on
Two or Three Offenders, it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the rest from medling with those
edge Tools: I must tell you also,
that the title of King, which <hi>Cesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>
had taken so early upon him,
was much against his Inclinations;
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:56143:635"/>
and he desired to see himself at the
Head of a more satisfiable Army,
before he would take on him a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
he found (in the condition he
was in) he should not defend; but
those about him insinuated into him,
that it was the Title that would not
only make him more Venerable,
but would make his Cause appear
more just and awful; and beget him
a perfect Adoration with those People
who liv'd remote from Courts, and
had never seen that glorious thing
called a King. So that believing it
would give Nerves to the Cause,
he unhappily took upon him that
which ruined him; for he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
sworn to the greatest part of
those of any Quality of his interest,
That his design was Liberty only,
and that his end was the publick
good, so infinitely above his own
private interest, that he desired only
the Honour of being the Champion
for the opprest <hi>Parisians</hi> and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>France;</hi> that if they would
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:56143:635"/>
allow him to lead their Armies, to
fight and spend his dearest Blood
for them, 'twas all the Glory he
aim'd at: 'T was this pretended Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
in a person of his high rank
that first cajol'd the <hi>Mobile,</hi> who
look on him as their God, their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer,
and all that was sacred and
dear to them; but the wiser sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
him only as one that had most
power and pretension to turn the
whole Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> which they
disliking were willing at any Price,
to reduce to their own conditions
and to what they desired; not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
he would have laid a claim to
the Crown, which many of them fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
themselves as capable of as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
rather that he would perhaps have
set up the King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> This <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario</hi>
knew; and understanding their
Sentiments, was unwilling to hinder
their joyning with him, by such a
Declaration which he knew would
be a means to turn abundance of
Hearts against him, as indeed it
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:56143:636"/>
fell out; and he found himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of some few Towns, only with
an Army of Fifteen or Sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Peasants, ill Armed, unus'd
to War, Watchings, and very ill
Logding in the Field, very badly
Victuall'd, and worse Paid. For,
from <hi>Paris</hi> no Aids of any Kind could
be brought him; the Roads all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
being so well guarded and secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Royal Forces, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some great Persons to espouse
his Quarrel, made him not only
dispair of Success, but highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it of those who had given him
so large promises of Aid. Many,
as I said, and most were disgusted
with his Title of King; but some
waited the success of his first Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
which was every day expected,
tho' <hi>Cesario</hi> kept himself as clear of
the Royal Army as he could a long
time, marching away as soon as they
drew near, hoping by these means,
not only to tire them out, but watch
an advantage when to engage, but
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:56143:636"/>
gather still more Numbers. So that
the greatest mischief he did was
teazing the Royal Army, who could
never tell were to have him, so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
he was in marching off. They
often came so near, as to have Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
with one another by small
Parties, where some few Men would
fall on both sides: And to say truth,
<hi>Cesario</hi> in this Expedition show'd
much more of a Souldier than the
Politician: His Skill was great, his
Conduct good, expert in Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and indfatigable in Toils.
And I have heard it from the Mouth
of a Gentleman, who in all that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
never was from him; that
in Seven or Eight Weeks that he
was in Arms he never absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
himself, and hardly slept an
Hour in the Four and twenty; and
that sometimes was on his Horse's-
back, in a Chariot, or on the ground,
suffering even with the meanest of
his Souldiers all the fatigues of the
Enterprize: This Gentleman told me
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:56143:637"/>
he would in those Hours, he should
sleep, and wherein he was not taking
Measures and Councils (which were
always held in the Night) that he
would be eternally speaking to him
of <hi>Hermione;</hi> and that with the
softest concern 'twas possible for
Love and tenderest Passion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press.
That he being the only Friend
he could repose so great a weakness
in, and who sooth'd him to the
degree he wish'd, the Prince was
so well pleas'd with him, as to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
him a Collonel of Horse, for no
other merit than that of having once
served <hi>Hermione,</hi> and now would
flatter his disease agreeably: And
tho' he did so, he protested he was
ashamed to hear how Poor this fond
concern render'd this great Man,
and he has often pity'd what should
have been else admir'd; but who
can tell the force of Love, back'd by
Charms supernatural? and who is it
that will not sigh at the Fate of so
Illustrious a Young-man, whom
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:56143:637"/>
Love had render'd the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all those numbers he led?</p>
                  <p>But now the Royal Army, as if
they had purposly suffered him to
take his Toore about the Country,
to Ensnare him with the more Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
had at last, by new Forces that
came to their assistance daily, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compas'd
him, that it was impossible
for him to avoid any longer giving
them Battle; however he had the
benefit of Posting himself the most
advantageously, that he could wish;
he had the rising Grounds to place
his Cannon, and all things concur'd
to give him success. His Numbers
exceeding those of the Royal Army;
not but he would have avoided a set
Battle, if it had been possible,
till he had made himself Master of
some places of stronger hold; for
yet as I said, he had only subdued
some inconsiderable places, which
were not able to make defence; and
which as soon as he was march'd
out, surrender'd again to their lawful
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:56143:638"/>
Prince; and pulling down his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
put up those of the King:
but he was on all sides so emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras'd,
he could not come even to
parly with any Town of Note; so
that as I said, at last, being as it were
block'd up, tho' the Royal Army did
not offer him Battle: Three Nights
they lay thus in view of each other;
the first night, the Prince sent out
his Scouts, who brought in intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that the Enemy was not so
well prepar'd for Battle, as they
fear'd they might be if they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Prince would engage 'em, but
he had so often given them the slip,
that they believed he had no mind to
put the Fortune of the Day to the
push: And they were glad of these
delays, that new forces might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
when the Scouts returned
with this news, the Prince was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
to fall upon the Enemy; but
<hi>Fergusano,</hi> who was continually
taking Council of his Charms, and
looking into his black Book of Fate,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:56143:638"/>
for every sally and step they made,
perswaded his Highness to have yet
a little patience; positively assuring
him his Fortune depended on a Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Minute, which was not yet come;
and that if he offered to give Battle
before the Change of the Moon, he
was inevitably lost, and that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
of that fortunate moment
would be the beginning of those of
his whole Life: with such like posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
perswasions, he gain'd upon the
Prince, and overcame his impatience
of engageing for that Night, all which
he past in Council without being
perswaded to take any rest, often
blaming the Nicety of their Art
and his Stars; and often asking if
they lost that opportunity that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had now given 'em, whether
all their Art, or Stars, or Devils, could
retrieve it? and nothing would that
Night appease him, or dispossess'd the
Sorcerers of this opinion.</p>
                  <p>The next day they received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
intelligence, that a considerable
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:56143:639"/>
supply would re-inforce the Royal
Army, under the Conduct of a
Prince of the Blood; which were
every moment expected: This news
made the Prince rave, and he broke
out into all the rage imaginable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wizards, who defended
themselves with all the reasons of
their Art; but it was all in vain,
and he vow'd he would that Night
engage the Enemy; if he could find
but one faithful Friend to second
him; tho he dyed in the attempt;
that he was worn out with the
Toils he had undergone; haras'd
almost to death, and would wait no
longer the approach of his lazy Fate,
but boldly advancing, meet it what
Face so 'ere it bore. They besought
him on their Knees, he would not
overthrow the Glorious Design so
long in bringing to perfection, just in
the very Minute of happy projection;
but to wait those certain Fates, that
would bring him Glory and Honour
on their Wings, and who if slighted,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:56143:639"/>
would abandon him to distruction;
it was but some few Hours more,
and then they were his own, to be
commanded by him: 'twas thus
they drill'd and delay'd him on till
Night; when again he sent out his
Scouts to discover the Posture of the
Enemy; and himself in the mean
time went to Council. <hi>Philander</hi>
fail'd not to be sent for thither,
who sometimes feign'd Excuses to
keep away, and when he did come,
he fate unconcern'd, neither giving
or receiving any advice. This was
taken notice of by all, but <hi>Cesario,</hi>
who look'd upon it as his being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watch'd,
and fatigu'd with the
Toils of the day: his Sullenness did
not pass so in the opinion of the rest;
they saw, or at least thought they
saw some other marks of discontent
in his fine Eyes, which Love so
much better became. One of the
Princes Offices and Captain of his
Guard, who was an old Hereditary
Rogue, and whose Father had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:56143:640"/>
in a Rebellion before; a Fellow
rough and daring, comes boldly to
the Prince when the Council rose,
and ask'd him if he were resolved to
Engage? He told him he was. <hi>Then,</hi>
said he, <hi>give me leave to shoot</hi> Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>in the Head:</hi> This blunt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
given without any manner of
reason or Circumstance, made the
Prince start back a step or two, and
ask him his meaning of what he
said. <hi>Sir,</hi> replyed the Captain, <hi>if
you will be safe,</hi> Philander <hi>must Die;
for however it appear to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to all the Camp he shows the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and 'tis more than doubted he, and
the King of</hi> France <hi>understand one
another but too well: Therefore if you
would be Victor, let him be dispatch'd,
and I my self will undertake it: Hold,</hi>
said the Prince, <hi>if I could believe what
you say to be true, I should not take so
base a revenge; I would Fight like a
Souldier, and he should be treated like
a man of Honour: Sir,</hi> said Vaneur,
for that was the Captains name; <hi>do not
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:56143:640"/>
in the Circumstances we now are in
talk of treating (with those that would'
betray us) like men of Honour; we
cannot stand upon decency in killing,
who have so many to dispatch; we
came not into</hi> France <hi>to fight Duels, and
stand on nice Punctillios: I say, we must
make quick work, and I have a good
Pistol charged with two handsome Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
that shall as soon as he appears
amongst us on Horse-back, do his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
as gentilely as can be, and rid
you of one of the most powerful of your
Enemies.</hi> To this, the Prince would
by no means agree; not believing
one syllable of the Accusation. <hi>Vaneur</hi>
swore then, that he would not draw
a Sword for his Service, while <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>
was suffered to live; and he
was as good as his word: He said in
going out, that he would obey the
Prince, but he beg'd his pardon, if
he did not lift a Hand on his side;
and in an Hour after sent him his
Commission, and waited on him,
and was with him almost till the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:56143:641"/>
last, in all the danger, but would
not Fight, having made a solemn
Vow. Several others were of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur</hi>'s
opinion, but the Prince believ'd
nothing of it, <hi>Philander</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as he said, weary of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and party, and regarded them
as his Ruiners, who with fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
drew him into a bad Cause;
which his Youth had not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
and from which he could not
untangle himself.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Scout was come
back, who inform'd the Prince that
now was the best time in the World
to Attack the Enemy, who all lay su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely
in their Tents and did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a Surprize; that the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards
were slender, and that it
would not be hard to put 'em to a
great deal of Confusion. The Prince
who was enough impatient before,
now was all Fire and Spirit, and 'twas
not in the Power of Magick to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him; but hasting immediately to
Horse, with as much speed as possible,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:56143:641"/>
he got at the Head of his Men; and
marching on directy to the Enemy put
them into so great a surprize, that it
may be admired how they got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a condition of defence; and
to make short of a business that was not
long in acting, I may avow nothing
but the immediate hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
(who favours the juster side,
and is always ready for the support
of those who approach so near their
own Divinity, sacred and anointed
Heads) could have turned the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the Battle to the Royal side;
it was prodigious to consider the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
numbers, and the advantage
all on the Princes part; it was mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to behold the order on his
side, and surprize on the other, which
of it self had been sufficient to have
confounded them; yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this unpreparedness on this
side, and the watchfuluess and care on
the other; so well the General and
Officers of the Royal Army mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their scanted Time; so bravely
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:56143:642"/>
disciplin'd, and experienced the
Souldiers were, so resolute and brave,
and all so well mounted and armed,
that as I said to a Miracle they
fought; and 'twas a Miracle they
won the Field: tho that fatal Night,
<hi>Cesario</hi> did in his own Person won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and when his Horse was kill'd
under him, he took a <hi>Partizan</hi> and as
a common Souldier, at the head of his
Foot acted the <hi>Hero,</hi> with as much
courage and bravery, as ever <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself could Boast. Yet all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
him nothing, he saw himself
abandoned on all sides, and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Covert of the Night, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
from the Battle, with his Sword
in his hand, with only one Page,
who fought by his side: A thousand
times he was about to fall on his
own Sword, and like <hi>Brutus</hi> have
finish'd a life he could no longer su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
with Glory: But Love, that
coward of the Mind, and the Image
of Divine <hi>Hermione,</hi> as he esteemed
her, still gave him Love to life; and
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:56143:642"/>
while he could remember she yet lived
to charm him, he could even look
with contempt on the loss of all his
Glory; at which if the repin'd, it
was for her sake, who expected to
behold him return cover'd o'er with
Laurels; in these sad thoughts he
wandered as long as his wearied
Legs would bear him into a low Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
far from the Camp; where
over-prest with Toil, all over pain,
and a Royal Heart even breaking
with Anxiety, he laid him down
under the shelter of a Tree, and
found but his length of Earth left to
support him now, who not many
hours before beheld himself the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Monarch as he imagined in the
World. Oh who, that had seen him
thus; which of his most mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that had view'd the Royal
Youth, adorn'd with all the Charms
of Beauty, Heaven ever distributed
to Man; Born great, and but now
ador'd by all the crowding World
with Hat and Knee; now abandon
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:56143:643"/>
by all, but one kind trembling Boy
weeping by his side, while the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
<hi>Hero</hi> lay Gazing with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
weeping Eyes, at those Stars
that had lately been so cruel to him:
Sighing out his great Soul to the
Winds that whistled round his unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
head; breathing his Griefs as
silently as the sad fatal Night past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Where nothing in nature
seemed to pity him, but the poor
wretched Youth that kneeled by him,
and the sighing Air: I say, who that
beheld this, would not have scorn'd
the World, and all its fickle Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipers?
have curst the Flatteries of
vain Ambition, and priz'd a Cottage
far above a Throne? a Garland
wreath'd by some fair innocent hand,
before the restless Glories of a
Crown?</p>
                  <p>Some Authors in the Relation of
this Battle affirm, That <hi>Philander</hi>
quitted his Post as soon as the Charge
was given, and sheer'd off from that
Wing he commanded; but all Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:56143:643"/>
agree in this Point, that if he
did, it was not for want of Courage;
for in a Thousand Incounters he has
given sufficient proofs of as much
Bravery as a Man can be capable
of: But he disliked the Cause, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved
of all their Preten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions,
and look'd upon the whole Affair
and Proceeding to be most unjust
and ungenerous: And all the fault
his greatest Enemies could charge
him with, was, That he did not deal
so gratefully with a Prince that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him and trusted him; and that
he ought frankly to have told him,
he would not serve him in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
and that it had been more
Gallant to have quited him that way,
than this; but there are so many
Reasons to be given for this more
Politick and safe Deceit, than are
needful in this place, and 'tis most
certain as it is the most justifiable to
Heaven and Man, to one born a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of <hi>France,</hi> and having Sworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to his proper King, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:56143:644"/>
any other Interest; so let the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of this great Man say what
they please, if a Man be oblig'd to be
false to this or that Interest, I think no
body of common Honesty, Sense and
Honour, will dispute which he ought
to abandon; and this is most certain,
that he did not forsake him because
Fortune did so, as this one Instance
may make appear. When <hi>Cesario</hi>
was first Proclaimed King, and had
all the Reason in the World to believe
that Fortune would have been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
partial to him, he offer'd <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
his choice of any Principality and
Government in <hi>France,</hi> and to have
made him of the Order of <hi>Sanct, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>préet;</hi>
all which he refused, tho' he
knew his great Fortune was lost and
already distributed to Favourites at
Court, and himself Proscribed and
Convicted as a Traytor to <hi>France.</hi>
Yet all these refusals did not open the
Eyes of this credulous great young
Man, who still believed it the sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Generosity of his Temper.
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:56143:644"/>
No sooner did the day discover to
the World the horrid Business of the
preceding Night, but a diligent
search was made among the infinite
number of dead, that covered the
Face of the Earth, for the Body of
the Prince, or New King, as they
called him: But when they could
not find him among the dead, they
sent out Parties all ways to search the
Woods, the Forests, and the Plains;
nor was it long they sought in vain,
for he who had laid himself, as I
said, under the shelter of a Tree,
had not for any consideration remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; but finding himself seiz'd
by a common Hand, suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
without Resistance, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by one single Man till more
advanced, when he could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have kill'd the Rustick as
speak or move; an Action so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Character of this truly brave
Man, that there is no reason to
be given to excuse this easie submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but this, That he was Stupified
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:56143:645"/>
with long Watching, Grief, and the
Fatigues of his daily Toyl for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Weeks before: For 'tis not to be
imagin'd it was carelessness, or little
regard for Life; for if it had been so
he would doubtless have lost it No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with the Victory, and never have
retreated while there had been one
Sword left advanced against him;
or if he had disdained the Enemy
should have had the Advantage and
Glory of so great a Conquest, at least
when his Sword had been yet left
him, he should have died like a <hi>Roman,</hi>
and have scorn'd to have added to
the Triumph of the Enemy. But
Love had unman'd his great Soul,
and <hi>Hermione</hi> pleaded within for
Life at any Price, even that of all
his Glory; the thought of her alone
blacken'd this last Scene of his Life,
and for which all his past Triumphs
could never atone nor excuse.</p>
                  <p>Thus taken, he suffered himself
to be led away tamely by common
Hands without resistance: A Victim
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:56143:645"/>
now even fallen to the pity of the
<hi>Mobile</hi> as he past, and so little ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
by the better Sort who saw
him not, they would not give a
credit to it, every one affirming and
laying Wagers he would die like a
<hi>Hero,</hi> and never surrender with Life
to the Conqueror. But his submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was but two true for the repose
of all his Abettors; nor was his
mean surrender all, but he shew'd
a dejection all the way they were
bringing him to <hi>Paris,</hi> so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unworthy of his Character, that
'tis hardly to be credited so great a
a change could have been possible.
And to show that he had lost all his
Spirit and Courage with the Victory,
and that the great strings of his Heart
were broke, the Captain who had the
charge of him, and commanded that
little Squadron that conducted him
to <hi>Paris,</hi> related to me this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Passage in their Journey; he said,
That they Lodged in an Inn, where
he believed both the Master, and a
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:56143:646"/>
great many Strangers who that
Night Lodg'd there, were <hi>Hugonots,</hi>
and great lovers of the Prince; which
the Captain did not know, till after
the Lodgings were taken: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ordered a File of Musqueteers
to guard the Door; and himself on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remained in the Chamber with
the Prince, while Supper was get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ready: The Captain being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
weary with Watching and
Toyling, for a long time together,
laid himself down on a Bench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a great long Table, that was
fast'ned to the Floor, and had unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
laid his Pistols on the Table,
and tho he du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st not Sleep, he
thought there to stretch himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a little ease; who had not quited
his Horse-back in a great while: The
Prince who was walking with his
Arms across about the Room, musing
in a very dejected posture; often
casting his Eyes to the door; at last
advances to the Table, and takes up
the Captains Pistols; the while He
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:56143:646"/>
—who saw him advance, fear'd in
that moment, what the Prince was
going to do; he thought, if he
should rise and snatch at the Pistols,
and miss of 'em, it would express so
great a distrust of the Prince, it might
provoke him to do, what by his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
submitting of 'em, might make
him escape; and therefore since it
was too late, he suffered the Prince
to arm himself with two Pistols;
who before was disarmed of even his
little Pen-knife. He was, he said, a
thousand times about to call out to
the Guards; but then he thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could enter to his relief, he
was sure to be shot Dead, and it was
possible the Prince might make his
party good with four or five com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, who perhaps lov'd
the Prince as well as any, and might
rather assist than hinder his flight; all
this he thought in an instant, and at
the same time seeing the Prince stand
still, in a kind of consideration what
to do, looking, turning, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:56143:647"/>
of the Pistols, he doubted not
but his thought would determine
with his Life; and tho he had been
in the heat of all the Battle, and had
look'd Death in the Face, when he
appeared most horrid, he protested
he knew not how to fear till this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that now he trembled
with the apprehension of unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ruin, he curst a thousand
times his unadvisedness, now it was
too late; he saw the Prince after he
had viewed, and reviewed the Pistols
walk in a great thoughtfulness again
about the Chamber, and at last, as if
he had determined what to do, came
back and laid them again on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
at which the Captain snatch'd
'em up, resolving never to commit
so great an over-sight more. He
did not doubt, he said, but the Prince
in taking them up, had some design
of making his escape; and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ainly
if he had but had Courage to
have attempted it, it had not been
hard to have been accomplish'd: At
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:56143:647"/>
worst he could but have dy'd; but
there is a Fate that over-rules the
most lucky minutes of the greatest
men in the World, and turns even
all advantages offered to misfortunes,
when it designs their ruin.</p>
                  <p>While they were on their way to
<hi>Paris,</hi> he gave some more signs, that
the misfortune he had suffered, had
lessened his Heart and Courage: He
writ several the most submissive
Letters in the World, to the King,
and to the Queen Mother of <hi>France;</hi>
wherein he strove to mitigate his
Treason, with the poorest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
imaginable; and, as if his good
Sense had declined with his Fortune,
his Stile was alter'd and debased to
that of a common Man, or rather a
School-Boy, filled with Tautologies
and Stuff of no Coherence; in which
he neither showed the Majesty of a
Prince, nor Sense of a Gentleman;
as I could make appear by exposing
those Copies, which I leave to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
all which must be imputed to
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:56143:648"/>
the disorder his Head and Heart
were in, for want of that natural rest
he never after found. When he came
to <hi>Paris,</hi> he fell at the Feet of his
Majesty, to whom they brought
him; and with a Showre of Tears
bedewing his Shooes, as he lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
besought his Pardon, and
ask'd his Life; perhaps one of his
greatest weaknesses to imagine, he
could hope for mercy after so many
Pardons for the same fault; and
which if he had had but one grain
of that Bravery left him, he was
wont to be Master of, he could not
have expected; nor have had the
confidence to have implor'd; and he
was a poor Spectacle of pity to all
that once adored him; to see how
he petitioned in vain for Life; which
if it had been granted, had been of
no other use to him, but to have
past in some corner of the Earth
with <hi>Hermione,</hi> dispis'd by all the
rest: and tho he fetch'd Tears of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from the Eyes of the best and,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:56143:648"/>
most merciful of Kings, he could not
gain on his first resolution; which
was never to forgive him that Scuril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Declaration he had dispersed at
his first Landing in <hi>France;</hi> that he
took upon him the Title of King,
he could forgive; that he had been
the cause of so much Blood-shed,
he could forgive, but never that
unworthy Scandal on his unspoted
Fame; of which he was much more
nice, than of his Crown or Life;
and left him (as he told him this)
prostrate on the Earth, when
the Guards took him up and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to the <hi>Bastile:</hi> As he came
out of the <hi>Loure,</hi> 'tis said he look'd
with his wonted Grace, only a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishment
sat there in greater Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than possible all his gayer looks
ever put on, at least in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
all that beheld him ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
so; all the <hi>Parisians</hi> were
crowded in vast numbers to see him:
And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> oh, see what Fortune is,
those that had vow'd him Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:56143:649"/>
in their Hearts, and were
upon all occasions ready to rise in
Mutiny for his least Interest, now
saw him, and suffered him to be
carried to the <hi>Bastile</hi> with a small
Company of Guards, and never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to rescue the Royal Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
from the Hands of Justice,
while he view'd 'em all around with
scorning dying Eyes.</p>
                  <p>While he remained in the <hi>Bastile,</hi>
he was visited by several of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of State, and Cardinals, and
Men of the Church, who urged him
to some Discoveries, but could not
prevail with him: He spoke, he
thought, he dreamt of nothing but
<hi>Hermione;</hi> and when they talk'd of
Heaven, he ran on some Discourse
of that Beauty, something of her
Praise; and so continued to his last
Moment, even on the Scaffold,
where he was urged to excuse, as
a good Christian ought, his Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
his Bloodshed and his unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
War; he set himself to justifie
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:56143:649"/>
his Passion to <hi>Hermione,</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to render the Life he had lead
with her, Innocent and Blameless in
the sight of Heaven; and all the
Churchmen could perswade, could
make him speak of very little
else. Just before he laid himself
down on the Block he called to one
of the Gentlemen of his Chamber,
and taking out the Inchanted Tooth-pick-case, he whisper'd him in the
Ear, and commanded him to bear it
from him to <hi>Hermione;</hi> and laying
himself down suffer'd the Justice of the
Law, and died more pitied than la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
so that it became a Proverb,
If I have an Enemy I wish he may
live like—and die like <hi>Cesario:</hi>
So ended the Race of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Youth, who was in his time
the greatest Man of a Subject in the

of his Prince, happy indeed above
a Monarch, if Ambition and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration

from a Glorious Life brought him to
a Shameful Death.</p>
                  <p>This deplorable News was not long
in coming to <hi>Hermione,</hi> who must
receive this due, That when she heard
her <hi>Hero</hi> was dead, (and with him
all her dearer greatness gone,) she
betook her self to her Bed, and made
a Vow she would never rise nor eat
more; and she was as good as her
word, she lay in that melancholy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
about Ten Days, making the
most pitious Moan for her dead Lover
that e'er was heard, drowning her
Pillow in Tears, and sighing out her
Soul. She called on him in vain as
long as she could speak, at last she fell
into a Lethargy and dreamed of him,
till she could dream no more; an
everlasting sleep closed her fair Eyes,
and the last word she sigh'd was <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario.</hi>

                     <hi>Brillijard</hi> had the good Fortune the
Night of the Battle to get away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     <hi>Silvia</hi> in the Arms of the young
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> and of whom they made
so considerable Advantages, that in
a short time they ruin'd the Fortune
of that young Nobleman, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Talk of the Town, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Governour not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
her stay there, she was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

where e'er she shows the Charmer.
<hi>Fergusano</hi> escap'd, which was to the
last Moment of the Princes Life
the greatest Affliction of his Mind;
and he would often say in great
Rage, That if that Villain had been
brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that he could
have had the satisfaction of seeing
him broken on a Wheel before
he had died, he should have resign'd
his Life with Joy. But his time was
not yet come.</p>

taken, and to the last Minute of his
Imprisonment; and was at last par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,

came to Court in as much Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
