            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY Design in publishing this little Treatise, and the Use which I desire all good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to make of it, is,</p>
            <p>First, To confirm them in the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> by such a sensible Demonstration of the <hi>Falshood</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as men of all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities may apprehend. For if this barbarous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards <hi>Hereticks</hi> be evidently repugnant to the true Spirit of <hi>Christianity,</hi> if it be contrary to the Example of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which we stand bound to imitate; if it be wholly opposite both to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practice of the <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>purest Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> I hope this will sufficiently convince <hi>Wise men,</hi> that the Religion which commands these Cruelties and Inhumanities cannot derive it self from him who is the <hi>God</hi> of Love, and Patience, and Mercy, and Pitty to the Sons of Men.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>§. I. Now that to burn, destroy, extirminate all those who differ from us in Religion, and upon that account are called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> (though they be men of peaceable and quiet Lives) and prosecute them
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48415:4"/>
according to the Laws here mentioned purely on the account of Conscience, that this, I say, is evidently repugnant to the true Spirit of <hi>Christianity,</hi> we learn from <hi>Christ</hi>'s own words to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> who, when a Village of <hi>Samaria</hi> refused to receive him, because he appeared to them to be <hi>going to Jerusalem,</hi> ask this Question,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord wilt thou that we command fire from Heaven to come down, and to consume them, as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did?</hi> For our dear <hi>Lord</hi> no sooner heard this <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> but he rebuked his <hi>Disciples,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Ver. 55, 56.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi> Where observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereas they who are thus persecuted by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are falsly supposed to be <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> the <hi>Samaritans</hi> undoubtedly were both. For, First, In opposition to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> himself appointed for the Place where he would be worshipped, commanding all men to repair to it, they erected a <hi>Temple</hi> upon Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> and there they worshipped, deserting the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> this was their <hi>Schism.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, They also were <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> for they err'd in matters which concerned Salvation, <hi>they feared the Lord, and served their own gods,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 33. And this our <hi>Saviour</hi> testifieth in these words,<note place="margin">John 4. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye worship ye know not what, we know what we worship, for Salvation is of the Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Observe, That whereas <hi>Romanists</hi> do exercise this Cruelty on them whom they call <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> chiefly for their refusing to receive and own him as <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Vicar</hi> who manifestly doth usurp that Title, these <hi>Samaritans</hi> refused to receive our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself in his own Person, and that because
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48415:4"/>
he seemed to <hi>be going to Jerusalem</hi> to worship, so that the Honor of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Place of his peculiar Worship, were all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this case.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Observe, That the Permission of what was here desired by Saint <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> would have been more effectual for the Conviction of the Heretical, Schismatical <hi>Samaritans,</hi> than any of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> or any Arts of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Tyranny</hi> can be for the Conviction of those whom they call <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks;</hi> for these <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> did not desire that they themselves might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute on the <hi>Samaritans</hi> this Sentence, by committing them to the Flames, or by imploring the <hi>Magistrates</hi> assistence to consume or burn them, they onely did request that they might call upon the <hi>God</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>rain down fire upon them,</hi> and consume them; which had it pleased him to doe on this occasion, the rest of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> by what this Village suffered, must have been evidently convinced by Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Heaven, of <hi>God</hi>'s displeasure against their way of Worship, and of the Truth of that <hi>Messiah</hi> and his Doctrine, who procured this Vengeance to be executed upon them; whereas the <hi>Persecutions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> because they minister no Conviction to the Conscience, serve onely to harden Mens Hearts and imbitter their Spirits against those who use them, and to induce them more firmly to believe <hi>That such a barbarous Religion cannot be of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these three Observations it is evident that whatsoever may be pleaded by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to justifie her Practice in burning, massacring, extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> might with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have been pleaded here:
<q>Doth she practise

                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s Sermon, Nov. 5. 1678. p. 15.</note> her Severities out of a <hi>Zeal</hi> for Truth, and for the Honor of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the reclaiming <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and the preventing or terrifying others from adhering to them or being deluded by them;</q>
upon all these accounts you see that the <hi>Disciples</hi> had far greater cause to call for <hi>fire from heaven</hi> upon this Village of <hi>Samaria.</hi> And yet our <hi>Saviour,</hi> under these Circumstances, thinks fit to rebuke even the <hi>desires</hi> of doing this to one small Village; How then will he rebuke the actual performance of it to many hundred thousand Souls, after his solemn Declaration of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie of these Proceedings to the Design of his most blessed <hi>Advent,</hi> and to the Spirit of his <hi>Gospel</hi>? For the true Reasons why <hi>Christ</hi> rebuked his <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> for their Desire of dealing thus severely with these Schismatical and Heretical <hi>Samaritans</hi> were these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because this Spirit of Severity towards erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons, in whomsoever it is found, is highly opposite to the calm Temper of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated in that Reply of <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Disciples, Ye know not what spirit ye are of,</hi> that is, Ye do not well consider under what Way of Dispensation ye are placed by me. <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 7.</note>The Way I come to teach men, the Temper, Disposition and Affection I would fix within them, is not a furious, persecuting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Spirit, but mild, and gentle, and tender of the Lives and Interests of Men, even of those who are our greatest Enemies. <note place="margin">Vide Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> in locum.</note>Under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> indeed, they who rejected and scoffed at a <hi>Prophet,</hi> suffered severely for it, the <hi>Prophet</hi> had Commission to <hi>call for fire from heaven to devour them</hi> presently, <hi>curse them in the name of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 24.

                  <hi>That of Societies of men, Christians, of all other, are most averse from waies of Violence and Bloud, specially from using any such waies on the account of Religion; And, among Christian Churches, where they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, if either of them use those waies upon the account of Religion, they give a strong Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against themselves, that they are not truly Christian.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48415:24"/>The reason is, because</hi> Christ <hi>gave Love for the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by which his Disciples were to be known,</hi> Joh. 13. v. 35. <hi>And lest men should unchristen others first, that they may hate them, and destroy them afterwards,</hi> Christ <hi>enlarged his Precept of Love and extended it to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not onely to ours, but to the Enemies of our Religion,</hi> Matt. 5. 43, 44.

and countenance, and render prosperous our just En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors in this kind; and when we have performed our utmost to prevent Dangers in a lawfull way, and find that our Attempts prove frustrate, then onely is the time to trust to Providence without subordinate endeavors.</p>
               <p>Now what Means may be lawfully pursued, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Constitutions of this Kingdom, for the preventing this aboding Evil, <hi>Divines</hi> should not presume too nicely to determine, who do then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviate when they do meddle <hi>extra Sphaeram The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologiae;</hi> it rather doth become them to leave this Matter to those Persons whose Business and Office it professedly is to be skilfull in the Laws, and who may rationally therefore be presumed men better qualified to pass a Judgment in this Case. This notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I may safely say, That what no Law of Nature or positive Command of God forbids, may lawfully be done, and is expedient to be done, for Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls and Bodies of a whole Community, and their succeeding Generations from the worst of Evils.</p>

               <p n="3">§. XI. 3. This Treatise may be usefull to quicken us, by a due apprehension of this so barbarous Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and inhumane Doctrine, to labor to prevent it by our most serious Reformation, and most importunate Addresses to the Throne of Grace; or, if the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God sees fitting, for the Punishment of our Iniquities, to give us up to this tremendous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to let us see what need we shall then have of the most perfect Patience and undaunted Courage, the most unshaken Faith and stedfast Resolution to undergoe the Fiery Trials, to which we may expect

That any of the Laws here mentioned have been condemned, abrogated or relaxed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> or the <hi>French Church;</hi> 2. That any <hi>Princes</hi> have been blamed for, or in the least deterred by any of her <hi>Prelates</hi> from executing of those Laws, or even exempted from that Oath which, saith the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48415:29"/>
doth bind them to extirpate <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or that by any <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>R.

That any <hi>Country</hi> or <hi>City</hi> hath been rejected from Communion with that <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Massacring Protestants,</hi> and Killing many <hi>Myriads</hi> of them in cold Bloud; if, 4.

               <item>§. XV.

            <head>A DISCOURSE Concerning the LAWS <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Made against HERETICKS BY <hi>POPES, EMPERORS,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MANY of late have excellently discoursed of those Doctrines of the <hi>Romish Faith,</hi> which, when believed and practised, must be highly prejudicial to, or be sufficient to disturb all civil Governments; and have demonstratively proved, that men whose Consciences are guided by the <hi>Romish Casuists,</hi> or who have heartily embraced the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of that <hi>Religion,</hi> can give us no security that they will not disturb the Government by which they are protected: But few (if any) have of late made it professedly their business to speak of what may be expected by such as they are pleased to call <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> when they are so unhappy as to be subject to a <hi>Prince</hi> who hath embraced the <hi>Romish Faith,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48415:34"/>
to a <hi>Clergy</hi> which doth own the <hi>Principles</hi> of that <hi>Communion;</hi> which being in this present Juncture of Affairs a most important Subject, I hope it will not seem either unseasonable or unprofitable to discourse briefly on that head. Now what such persons may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to suffer we may learn from what already hath been decreed by them concerning <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and what they have already practised.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>§. I. The <hi>Laws Ecclesiastical and Civil</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Hereticks,</hi> by <hi>Popes, Kings, Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> may be reduced to these Heads; 1. Laws made for the Preservation of the Members of the <hi>R. Church</hi> from falling into that which they call <hi>Heresie;</hi> 2. The Laws made for the Discovery of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> their Favourers, Abettors, or such as they suspect to be inclinable to <hi>Heresie;</hi> now they are either such as do empower Persons to be active in enquiring after them, and do encourage them to make Discoveries of this nature, or such as lay an Obligation on them to be diligent in making these Enquiries and Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and upon others to assist them in so doing. Or, 3.

                  <hi>Prince</hi> abstain from thus reflecting with himself? Either the <hi>R.

And all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> did well, who, in Obedience to their Commands, and Expectation of these Blessings, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, and lost their Lives, by their Endeavors to extirpate <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or who did <hi>murther</hi> and <hi>massacre</hi> so many <hi>millions</hi> of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And consequently, I also shall do well, and may expect these Blessings, by acting as they did; or else these <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and all those <hi>R.

               <p>2. This further will appear, if we consider that the same <hi>Principles</hi> which do oblige a <hi>Popish Prince</hi> to own that Faith, oblige him also to execute these sanguinary Laws upon the <hi>Heretick,</hi> whatsoever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises or Obligations he hath made unto the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That he is subject to a Power which can absolve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48415:53"/>
him from all Obligations of this nature which he at any time shall make, and which already he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that it is not in his power to make them, or to observe them when they have been made. That they are prejudicial to that <hi>superior Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to which he must be subject, and made concerning <hi>Heresie,</hi> of which, as being a Spiritual Concern, he must not judge, nor of the Punishments belonging to it, or of the Lawfulness of the Suspension of those Punishments. All this 'tis easie to demonstrate. And,</p>
               <p>1. According to plain Reason, <hi>When two Princes, that have distinct Tribunals, make Laws or Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thwarting one the other, the Constitutions of the inferior Tribunal must give place to those of the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior:</hi> but by the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Communion of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunal</hi> is <hi>superior</hi> to that of <hi>Princes;</hi> since then it is decreed by that <hi>Tribunal,</hi> as we have seen already, that all <hi>Catholick Princes</hi> shall faithfully endeavour to extirpate <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> from their Dominions, and that all <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> made to the contrary are <hi>ipso facto</hi> void; no <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> made by <hi>Princes</hi> in favor of <hi>Heretical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> can be observed by them, or be of any moment in prejudice to the Determinations of the <hi>superior Tribunal</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now that, according to the Principles of <hi>R.

The reason is, because it is a Promise made of a thing not pertaining to the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of that <hi>Prince,</hi> nor wholly in his Power to see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:</hi> Which, if I understand any thing, is expresly to say, that though in Cases properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>Prince's Jurisdiction</hi> he must perform his Promise, yet not in this of <hi>Heresie;</hi> because it doth belong to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunal:</hi> When therefore the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> decrees, that no <hi>Secular Power</hi> is obliged by any <hi>safe Conduct</hi> to any thing that may hinder the <hi>Ecclesiastical Tribunal</hi>'s Proceeding in Cases of <hi>Heresie,</hi> what doth it else but declare in express Terms, that <hi>Faith</hi> is not to be kept with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that is, in any thing relating to their <hi>Heresie;</hi> for this it seems the <hi>Magistrates</hi> have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with: and therefore let <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> make never so solemn Promises and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to men suspected of <hi>Heresie,</hi> to their peril be it who rely upon them, for they have nothing to doe to promise in such matters, and though their Faith be given never so publickly and solemnly, they are not bound to keep it: Nay, they are bound not to keep it: For if they should, it would be to the apparent mischief and prejudice of the <hi>Church.</hi> This necessarily follows from their own words, and the distinction here used by them: And also from the words of the <hi>Council,</hi> for if <hi>no safe Conduct of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or Kings can prejudice the Catholick Faith, or</hi>
