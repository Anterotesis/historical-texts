         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Day the Sessions of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> began at the
<hi>Sessions-House</hi> in <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> holden there for the City of
<hi>London,</hi> County of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> and Goal-Delivery of <hi>Newgate,</hi>
until the 2<hi>d.</hi> of the aforesaid Instant, where the Proceedings were
as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elizabeth Hunt</hi> was Indicted for picking the Pocket of <hi>Mary Rome,</hi> of
25 shillings; the manner (as it appeared to be upon Evidence) was thus:
The Prosecutor going through a narrow Lane in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt by a Coach that was coming stood up in a door way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Prisoner and two more, supposed to be of her Gang, Shoulder'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34355:2"/>
her up, and in the mean while the Prisoner picked her Pocket, delivering
the Money to the Comrades, who went off with it; but the Prosecutor
immediately perceiving that she was robbed, apprehended the Prisoner,
who desired her to make no noise and she would give her satisfaction, and
thereupon pulled out a considerable parcel of Money, but upon her Tryal
she denied it, but the proofs being plain, not only by another Witness,
but also by her former Confession, she was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Katherine Cook</hi> was Indicted for Stealing seaven Silver Spoons from
Sir <hi>Robert Iason,</hi> in the Parish of St. <hi>Dunstans</hi> in the <hi>West;</hi> She at that
time living with him in the nature of a Servant, which appeared upon
Evidence thus: The Spoons which were judg'd to the value of 3 pounds,
being used at Dinner, they were delivered to her to make clean, when
as she carried them into the Pantry, from whence she alledged, they
were conveyed by a Woman that came in to ask whether such a person
did not live there, naming a strange name; but the Witness Swore,
that upon her Masters charging her with the Fellony, she offered to
pay one half of the value; but she producing several Witnesses to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
her Honesty and good Behaviour in her former Services, and there
being no positive proof that she stole them, she was acquitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lydia Littleworth</hi> was Tryed for Robbing <hi>William Theed</hi> her Master,
in the Parish of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> in the <hi>Querry,</hi> on the 5th. of <hi>May</hi> last, and
taking from him four broad pieces of Gold, four Guinnies, three and
twenty Shillings in Silver, four Gold Rings, and some other things, the
which she delivered to a Woman to keep for her, and upon inquiry ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
denied the Fact; but the Woman suspecting she had stole the
Gold, made inquiry, so that the Evidence being plain against her, she
in Court confessed that she took the Money, expressing a great deal
of sorrow for her Wickedness, and upon the Jury's return of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
she was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ann Bland</hi> had an Indictment preferred against her, for taking three
Shillings privily from the person of <hi>Elizabeth Bennet,</hi> a Butchers Wife,
on the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last, the Circumstances, as they appeared upon
Oath, being these: The Prisoner coming to her Stall in Honey-Lane-Market,
under pretence of buying a Neck of Veal, began to question
the Sweetness of it, desiring the Prosecutor to smell, the which whilst
she was doing, the Prisoner watching her opportunity, put her hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Apron-pocket, and taking her Money departed; but within a
few hours, she was taken doing such another Exploit; to this she plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Innocence, but it plainly appearing she was an old Offender, and the
Prosecutor Swearing positively that she was the Woman that Robbed
her, the Jury found her Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Cotton</hi> of the Parish of St. <hi>Mary Matpellier,</hi> otherwise <hi>White-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
was Indicted for Stealing a Hood and Scarfe from <hi>Iudith Wheeler;</hi>
whereupon (having well learnt his Lesson in <hi>Newgate)</hi> he pleaded Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to that and all other Indictments within the benefit of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham Kent</hi> was Tryed for Stealing Iron Bolts for Ships and other
things, from <hi>Iames Yeames</hi> of <hi>Wapping,</hi> on the 13<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> last; one
of them upon Evidence, appearing to be found in his Breeches, yet he
denied that he ever Stole any, but that coming through the Yard, he
gathered up some Chips, amongst which was the Bolt; then being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34355:2"/>
why he concealed it in his Breeches, he alledged that his Breeches
being Ragged, it droped into them contrary to his knowledge; but these
silly excuses excused him not, for it appearing that he was a Notorious
Pilferer, the Jury brought him in Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Hermitage</hi> was Indicted for Robbing the Lady <hi>Williamses</hi> house
on the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and taking thence two Feather-Beds, a pair of
Grates, Coverleds, Carpets, and Linnen, to a considerable value, which
upon search, were found at a Broakers, where he had disposed of them,
whereupon he pleaded Guilty to the Indictment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Sutor,</hi> late Servant to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arglass,</hi> deceased, was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for Robbing <hi>William Crelling</hi> his Lords Gentleman, by breaking
open a door, and taking thence a Pormantle, in which was a Gold
Pendilum Watch, valued at 14 pounds, a Gold Locket and Gold But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
28 pieces of broad Gold, 21 Guinnies, 25 Shillings in Silver, a
Siver-Hilted Sword, and other things of value, taking them from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Earls House in <hi>Druery-Lane,</hi> on the the 7<hi>th.</hi> past, for which,
upon his being Apprehended, he confessed that he was privy to the
Robbery, but that it was not he that committed it, but an <hi>Irish</hi> Man
whom he named, alledging that he Renched the door with a Fork,
and then taking the Pormantle, perswaded him to go with him, which
he consented to, and that for his share he gave him the Watch and 20
Guinnies, which Watch was taken about him, but with the Money he
had bought a Horse, but upon his Tryal he at first denied what he
had said; but finding the Evidence to be strong against him, he again
confessed the Fact, and thereupon was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>A Woman was Tryed for Stealing several pieces of Silk out of a
Shop in <hi>Pater-noster-Row,</hi> on the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last, which being taken
about her e're she could dispose of it, notwithstanding she pleaded that
they were given her by a strange Woman; that Excuse prevailed not,
for she was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Stafford</hi> a <hi>Life-Guard-Man,</hi> was Indicted for Killng Mr. <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite,</hi>
another of the Guards, on the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last, which upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
appeared as followeth: The Prisoner and the Deceased came
into a Field near <hi>Knightsbridge,</hi> where they equally drew, and made
several Passes at each other, and often pausing, fought again, which
they continued till the deceased received seven Wounds, one of which
was under the left Pap, 7 Inches, insomuch that he fell to the ground;
whereupon the Prisoner walked off, but being pursued, was taken, the
Prisoner pleaded that he came to take a friendly walk with the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and that being in the Fields, the deceased drew upon him, and that
what he did was in the defence of his life; and indeed, there being no
kind of former Malice between them proved in Court, the Prisoner was
found Guilty of Mans-slaughter only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iane Kent,</hi> a Woman of about 60 years of Age, was Indicted for
<hi>Witch-Craft,</hi> and using several Diabolick Arts, whereby she compassed
the death of one <hi>Elizabeth Chamblet,</hi> a Girl about 5 years of Age; the
Father of the deceased gave Evidence, that she first Bewitched his Swine,
by reason she having bargained with him for two Pigs, which he refused
to deliver her without Money; and that a while after his Daughter
fell into a most piteous Condition, Swelling all over her Body, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34355:3"/>
was discoloured after a strange rate: He farther deposed, that she also Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
his Wife, and that after the death of his Daughter, he went to
one Dr. <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ks</hi> in <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> who advised him to take a quart of his
Wives water, the pairing of her Nails, some of her Hair, and such like,
and boyl them, which he did, in a Pipkin, at which time he Swore he
heard the Prisoners voice at his door, and that she Screimed out as if she
were Murdered, and that the next day she appeared to be much swelled
and bloated: A Woman that searched her likewise Swore, that she had
a Teat on her back, and unusual Holes behind her ears: A Coach-man
likewise Swore, that upon his refusing to carry her and her Goods, his
Coach overthrew; but she producing Evidence that she had lived honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and was a great pains-taker, and that she went to Church, with
many other Circumstances, the Jury found her not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Pursell</hi> who was lately Committed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of violently forcing Mrs. <hi>Selleger</hi> out of her Coach, upon <hi>Hounslow-Heath,</hi>
petitioned the Court that he might be admitted of Bail; but the
Court replyed, There was an Indictment intended against him for
Fellony; upon which, the Gentleman that brought the Petition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that he might be Tryed, whereupon the Court replyed, If the
Evidence for the King were ready he might.</p>
