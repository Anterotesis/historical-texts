            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to the <hi>REASONS</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the <hi>Palace-Court.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT's pretended, That the <hi>Palace-Court</hi> was erected Seventy Years ſince, which is notoriouſly falſe, it being Erected by Letters-Pattents from King <hi>Charles</hi> II. under the Great Seal, <hi>October</hi> the <hi>4th. Anno Regni ſui</hi> 16. And tho' it was of that Antiquity, yet if it be now found to be a Grievance, that can be no reaſon for its continuance.</p>
            <p>The Retale Trade being chiefly uſed among the meaner fort of People, and Trade being uncapable of being carried on without ſome Credit, if there were not ſufficient means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, at ſmall Charges, and in a little time, to enforce Payment, the Retale Trade would ſink, and the meaner ſort of People would periſh for want of Credit. It cannot be deny'd, but that the Erecting a Court of Law (to try ſmall Cauſes by Juries, for the eaſe of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) is extreamly uſeful, in caſe there had been a defect of Juſtice for want of ſuch Courts, but in <hi>Weſtminſter, White-Chapel, Stepney, St. Katharines, Clinke, Southwark,</hi> and almoſt in all places within the limits of the <hi>Palace-Court,</hi> there are ſuch Courts of Record; ſo that unleſs it be for the lucre and benefit of the Steward-Council, and Attornies of the <hi>Palace-Court,</hi> there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or reaſon for that Court to interfere with the other Courts, and encroach upon the Limits and Juriſdictions of the ſeveral Lords of them. And it's to be noted, That Marſhal-Court Bayliffs enter all private Liberties to make their Arreſts, which the Sheriffs Officers don't do, tho' to execute the Proceſs of a ſuperiour Court, unleſs they will ſubject themſelves to the Action of the Bayliff of the private Liberty.</p>
            <p>Beſides the ſeveral Courts above-mention'd, within their Limits and Juriſdictions have (by preſcription time out of mind) try'd Cauſes of three or four Pound Value, as well as the <hi>Palace-Court,</hi> therefore no need for that Court.</p>
            <p>It is for the eaſe of the Subject to have Juſtice adminiſter'd near their own Habitations, but the <hi>Palace-Court</hi> compels Perſons out of <hi>Middleſex, Eſſex, Surry,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> within twelve Miles, to be try'd at that Court held in <hi>Southwark,</hi> which, without doubt, is a great Violence and Oppreſſion to the Subject, to be forc'd from one County to another to receive Juſtice by Proceſs of any inferiour Court.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſuggeſted, That if the <hi>Palace-Court</hi> be ſuppreſs'd, that another of the ſame Nature muſt be erected, which is meerly begging the Queſtion; for there is no need of that, or any other ſuch like Court, the defect being ſupply'd by the aforeſaid Inferiour Courts and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, That the Mayor's and Sheriff's Courts in <hi>London</hi> are Inferiour Courts, and have been found uſeful; but if thoſe Courts had Juriſdiction twelve Miles round <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> they would no doubt, inſtead of being uſeful (as now they muſt be confeſs'd to be) be a great Grievance and Oppreſſion to the People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palace-Court</hi> pretends to diſcharge all Priſoners where the Debt and Damages are under Forty Shillings: This courſe has been in uſe, it may be a little before the ſitting of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as if they foreſaw, that their oppreſſive Court ſhould receive its downfal from the Wiſdom and Juſtice of this Parliament.</p>
            <p>It is pretended, That the Council and Attornies of that Court have bought their Places for Life, and conſequently have a Freehold in them; and therefore it would be an unjuſt thing to take away any Man's Freehold. If this ſhould be allow'd as a ſufficient Objection, then no Act of Parliament could ever be made; for no Act that ever was made, or ever will be made, but muſt be to the prejudice and diſadvantage of a few private Perſons; ſo that this can be no reaſon to continue the <hi>Palace-Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems they are willing to ſubmit to a regulation, knowing that nothing but a total ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this new erected <hi>Palace-Court</hi> can in the leaſt affect them; for a regulation of their Proceedings will be little or no eaſe to the Subject, their vaſt Juriſdiction extending twelve Miles round the Palace, making a Circle above ſeventy Miles in compaſs, being the Grievance complain'd of, which all the Towns and Villages about <hi>London</hi> can teſtifie; and by the reaſon that they obtain'd the Letters-Pattents, for the encreaſe of their Juriſdiction, as to the Perſons, ſo they may obtain Letters-Pattents to enlarge their Juriſdiction as to place; and conſequently gain Power to Arreſt ſeventy Miles round the Palace, and then there would be little left for either inferiour or ſuperiour Court to do.</p>
            <p>It cannot be deny'd, but that the Court of <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> is a very ancient Court, and very uſeful for trying all Cauſes ariſing between any of the King's-Houſhold; but it is plain, that that Court was very early for enlarging its Juriſdiction, and did direct Proceſs againſt all Perſons within the Verge, whether of the Houſhold of the King or not; to obviate which encroachment, it was Enacted by the Parliament, that the Parties Arreſted ſhould have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to averr, that they were not of the Houſhold at the time of the Suit commenc'd; by which Act their Invention to encreaſe their Juriſdiction was ſubverted; and it is to be obſerv'd, that every Act made concerning the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> either reſtrains or explains their Juriſdiction, but no Act enlarges it. And ſince it was thought ſo neceſſary formerly to keep that Court within its due Limits and Juriſdiction, why it ſhould be thought convenient at preſent, that this new erected <hi>Palace-Court</hi> ſhould be favour'd with ſuch ample Authority, is a thing very difficult to imagine.</p>
