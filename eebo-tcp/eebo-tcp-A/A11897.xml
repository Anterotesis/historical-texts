            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Giltles God wot, betrayed in to that towne.</l>
               <l>Was slayne by gunshot, and sodainly put to death,</l>
               <l>Done by the Papists our foes, through fellonous faith.</l>
               <l>Hangman to <hi>Harry,</hi> now <hi>Burrio</hi> to their brother,</l>
               <l>Well may this murther manifest the tother.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶What wight a lyue would not lament his losse?</l>
               <l>Wo is me to want him, is the common voyce:</l>
               <l>For such a Prince shal neuer poore man haue,</l>
               <l>Kylled by a Traytour, stealing vpon him close,</l>
               <l>Purposing of purpose, life for life to lose,</l>
               <l>But no comparison twixt a Kinges sonne and a Knaue</l>
               <l>Sith he is gone, we cannot againe him craue.</l>
               <l>Through al our realme I dare wel make this choise,</l>
               <l>Raigned not his fellow since buried was the <hi>Bruise.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶To kéepe good rule he rode, and tooke no rest,</l>
               <l>Both South and North, and somtime East and West,</l>
               <l>All to decore our common wealth men know:</l>
               <l>By whom let vs sée, was Pirates so opprest?</l>
               <l>Or yet the theeues so throwne downe and drest?</l>

                  <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Huntlye</hi> hid them both for aw,</l>
               <l>And when he might, he was tendant at Law,</l>
               <l>Twyse on a day, and sleeped not in sleuth,</l>
               <l>To see no fauters should beare them by the treuth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶Of this foule fact suppose our foes be fayne,</l>
               <l>Yet after <hi>Moyses, Iosua</hi> comes agayne,</l>
               <l>To guide the people, geue glory therfore to <hi>GOD.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Should they succeede, that haue Lord <hi>Iames</hi> so slayne?</l>
               <l>Beware of that, least that ye feele the payne,</l>
               <l>And haue your weake ones wyrried with the Tode.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>¶Pray, if you please, I warrant you ye haue néede,</l>

               <l>That dayly wayes inuentes to put him downe:</l>
               <l>His Graundsire slayne at <hi>Lythquo</hi> as I it réede,</l>

               <l>That with his leesings all the Laitie peruartes,</l>
               <l>Straight ioyne your forces to the fieldes without feare,</l>

               <l>To <hi>Hammilton</hi> in hast while ye haue hartes.</l>
               <l>Deuise some way to pay your men of warre,</l>
               <l>For if they once begon, ye neede not gather geare.</l>
               <l>Fight well, and war them, and win the riches thore,</l>
               <l>And if ye doe thus, in deede ye neede no more.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>For this foule deede, your neckes the halter stretch,</l>
               <l>If ye two want the withy, they do much wrong you:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Lythquo</hi> lament, your Burgeses may looke bleach,</l>
               <l>In their sayd time your Burrow rueth the leach,</l>
               <l>Because of this murther lately made among you,</l>
               <l>For if I thought it helped ought to hang you,</l>
               <l>So should ye die, and set your towne on fire,</l>
               <l>As some part of punishment to asswage Gods ire.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>¶Ouer these two houses for these déedes inding,</l>
               <l>The hand of <hi>GOD</hi> doth ouer their heades hing,</l>
               <l>Them to destroy, I dout not in these our daies:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Hepburnis</hi> wil go to wracke, for wyrring of the King,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Hamiltons</hi> fye, this was a fouler thing.</l>
               <l>Is this your firme religion, yea is, yea is?</l>
               <l>Such a time shall come I trow as <hi>Thomas</hi> saies:</l>
               <l>Heardmen shal hunt you vp through <hi>Garranis</hi> hill,</l>

               <l>To wreake this world, and wot ye where about?</l>
               <l>Because we want no vice vnder the heauen:</l>
               <l>Sith double murder makers séeke to rule the rout,</l>
               <l>With the <hi>Niniuites</hi> to our <hi>GOD</hi> let vs go cry and shout,</l>
               <l>For to retreate that sentence iustly geuen.</l>
               <l>Yet thou good Lord, that iudgeth al thinges euen,</l>
