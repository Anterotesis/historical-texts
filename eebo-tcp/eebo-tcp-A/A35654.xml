            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>AFter the delivery of your Royal
Father's Person into the hands
of the Army, I undertaking to
the Queen Mother, that I would
find some means to get access to him, she was
pleased to send me, and by the help of <hi>Hugh
Peters</hi> I got my admittance, and coming well
instructed from the Queen (his Majesty
having been long kept in the dark) he was
pleased to discourse very freely with me of
the whole state of his Affairs: But Sir, I will
not lanch into a History, instead of an Epistle.
One morning waiting on him at <hi>Causham,</hi>
smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some
news of my self, which was that he had seen
some Verses of mine the evening before (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those to Sir <hi>R. Fanshaw)</hi> and asking me
when I made them, I told him two or three


<pb facs="tcp:39510:3"/>
years since; he was pleased to say, that
having never seen them before, He was
afraid I had written them since my return
into <hi>England,</hi> and though he liked them
well, he would advise me to write no more,
alleging, that when men are young, and
have little else to do, they might vent the
overflowings of their Fancy that way, but
when they were thought fit for more serious
Employments, if they still persisted in that
course, it would look, as if they minded not
the way to any better.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I stood corrected as long as I
had the honour to wait upon him, and at his
departure from <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, he was
pleased to command me to stay privately at
<hi>London,</hi> to send to him and receive from
him all his Letters from and to all his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents
at home and abroad, and I was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
with nine several Cyphers in order to
it: Which trust I performed with great safety
to the persons with whom we corresponded;
but about nine months after being discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their knowledge of Mr. <hi>Cowleys</hi> hand,


<pb facs="tcp:39510:3"/>
I happily escaped both for my self, and those
that held correspondence with me; that time
was too hot and busie for such idle speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but after I had the good fortune to wait
upon your Majesty in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
you were pleased sometimes to give me argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to divert and put off the evil hours of
our banishment, which now and then fell not
short of your Majesties expectation.</p>
                  <p>After, when your Majesty departing from
St. <hi>Germayns</hi> to <hi>Jersey,</hi> was pleased freely
(without my asking) to confer upon me that
place wherein I have now the honour to
serve you, I then gave over Poetical lines,
and made it my business to draw such others
às might be more serviceable to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and I hope more lasting. Since that
time I never disobeyed my old Masters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
till this Summer at the Wells, my
retirement there tempting me to divert
those melancholy thoughts, which the new
apparitions of Forreign invasion, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
discontent gave us: But these clouds
being now happily blown over, and our Sun


<pb facs="tcp:39510:4"/>
cleerly shining out again, I have recovered
the relapse, it being suspected that it would
have proved the Epidemical disease of age,
which is apt to fall back into the follies in
youth, yet <hi>Socrates, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>
did the same, and <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith that Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> was beyond any thing
that <hi>Pindar</hi> or <hi>Homer</hi> ever wrote. I will
not call this a Dedication, for those Epistles
are commonly greater absurdities than any
that come after, for what Author can reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
believe, that fixing the great name of
some eminent Patron in the forehead of his
book can charm away censure, and that the
first leafe should be a curtain to draw over
and hide all the deformities that stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
it? neither have I any need of such
shifts, for most of the parts of this body
have already had Your, Majesties view,
and having past the Test of so cleer and
sharp-sighted a Iudgment, which has as
good a Title to give Law in Matters of this
Nature as in any other, they who shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to dissent from Your Majesty, will do


<pb facs="tcp:39510:4"/>
more wrong to their own Iudgment, then
their Iudgment can do to me: And for
those latter Parts which have not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Your Majesties favourable Aspect, if
they who have seen them do not flatter me,
(for I dare not trust my own Iudgment)
they will make it appear, that it is not with
me as with most of mankind, who never
forsake their darling vices, till their vices
forsake them; and that this Divorce was
not <hi>Frigiditatis causâ,</hi> but an Act of Choice,
and not of Necessity. Therefore, Sir, I shall
only call it an humble Petition, that Your
Majesty will please to pardon this new amour
to my old Mistress, and my disobedience to his
Commands, to whose memory I look up with
great Reverence and Devotion, and making
a serious reflection upon that wise Advice,
it carries much greater weight with it now,
than when it was given, for when age and
experience has so ripened mans discretion as
to make it fit for use, either in private or
publick Affairs, nothing blasts and corrupts
the fruit of it so much as the empty, airy


<pb facs="tcp:39510:5"/>

                  <l>The stream is so transparent, pure, and clear,</l>

But his proud head the aery Mountain hides</l>
                  <l>Among the Clouds; his shoulders, and his sides</l>
                  <l>A shady mantle cloaths; his curled brows</l>
                  <l>Frown on the gentle stream, which calmly flows,</l>
                  <l>While winds and storms his lofty forehead beat:</l>
                  <l>The common fate of all that's high or great.</l>
                  <l>Low at his foot a spacious plain is plac't,</l>

                  <l>Which shade and shelter from the Hill derives,</l>
                  <l>While the kind river wealth and beauty gives;</l>
                  <l>And in the mixture of all these appears</l>
                  <l>Variety, which all the rest indears.</l>

There <hi>Faunus</hi> and <hi>Sylvanus</hi> keep their Courts,</l>
                  <l>And thither all the horned hoast resorts,</l>
                  <l>To graze the ranker mead, that noble heard</l>

                  <l>Great things are made, but sooner are undone.</l>
                  <l>Here have I seen the King, when great affairs</l>
                  <l>Give leave to slacken, and unbend his cares,</l>
                  <l>Attended to the Chase by all the flower</l>

                  <l>Pleasure with Praise, &amp; danger, they would buy,</l>
                  <l>And wish a foe that would not only fly.</l>
                  <l>The stagg now conscious of his fatal Growth,</l>
                  <l>At once indulgent to his fear and sloth,</l>
                  <l>To some dark covert his retreat had made,</l>
                  <l>Where nor mans eye, nor heavens should invade</l>
                  <l>His soft repose; when th' unexpected sound</l>
                  <l>Of dogs, and men, his wakeful ear doth wound.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:39510:14"/>
Rouz'd with the noise, he scarce believes his ear,</l>
                  <l>Willing to think th' illusions of his fear</l>
                  <l>Had given this false Alarm, but straight his view</l>
                  <l>Confirme, that more than all he fears is true.</l>
                  <l>Betray'd in all his strengths, the wood beset,</l>
                  <l>All instruments, all Arts of ruine met;</l>
                  <l>He calls to mind his strength, and then his speed,</l>
                  <l>His winged heels, and then his armed head;</l>
                  <l>With these t'avoid, with that his Fate to meet:</l>
                  <l>But fear prevails, and bids him trust his feet.</l>
                  <l>So fast he flyes, that his reviewing eye</l>
                  <l>Has lost the chasers, and his ear the cry;</l>
                  <l>Exulting, till he finds, their Nobler sense</l>
                  <l>Their disproportion'd speed does recompense.</l>
                  <l>Then curses his conspiring feet, whose scent</l>
                  <l>Betrays that safety which their swiftness lent.</l>
                  <l>Then tries his friends, among the baser herd,</l>
                  <l>Where he so lately was obey'd, and fear'd,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:39510:14"/>
His safety seeks: the herd, unkindly wise,</l>
                  <l>Or chases him from thence, or from him flies.</l>
                  <l>Like a declining States-man, left forlorn</l>
                  <l>To his friends pity, and pursuers scorn,</l>
                  <l>With shame remembers, while himself was one</l>
                  <l>Of the same herd, himself the same had done.</l>
                  <l>Thence to the coverts, &amp; the conscious Groves,</l>
                  <l>The scenes of his past triumphs, and his loves;</l>
                  <l>Sadly surveying where he rang'd alone</l>
                  <l>Prince of the soyl, and all the herd his own;</l>
                  <l>And like a bold Knight Errant did proclaim</l>
                  <l>Combat to all, and bore away the Dame;</l>
                  <l>And taught the woods to eccho to the stream</l>

                  <l>So much his love was dearer than his life.</l>
                  <l>Now every leaf, and every moving breath</l>
                  <l>Presents a foe, and every foe a death.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:39510:15"/>
Wearied, forsaken, and pursu'd, at last</l>
                  <l>All safety in despair of safety plac'd,</l>
                  <l>Courage he thence resumes, resolv'd to bear</l>
                  <l>All their assaults, since 'tis in vain to fear.</l>
                  <l>And now too late he wishes for the fight</l>
                  <l>That strength he wasted in Ignoble flight:</l>
                  <l>But when he sees the eager chase renew'd,</l>
                  <l>Himself by dogs, the dogs by men pursu'd:</l>
                  <l>He straight revokes his bold resolve, and more</l>
                  <l>Repents his courage, than his fear before;</l>
                  <l>Finds that uncertain waies unsafest are,</l>
                  <l>And Doubt a greater mischief than Despair.</l>
                  <l>Then to the stream, when neither friends, nor
force,</l>
                  <l>Nor speed, nor Art avail, he shapes his course;</l>

But fearless they pursue, nor can the floud</l>
                  <l>Quench their dire thirst; alas, they thirst for
bloud.</l>
                  <l>So towards a Ship the oarefin'd Gallies ply,</l>

                  <l>Tempt the last fury of extream despair.</l>
                  <l>So fares the Stagg among th' enraged Hounds,</l>
                  <l>Repels their force, and wounds returns for wounds.</l>
                  <l>And as a Hero, whom his baser foes</l>

                  <l>Though prodigal of life, disdains to die</l>

                  <l>Some nobler foes approach, to him he calls,</l>
                  <l>And begs his Fate, and then contented falls.</l>
                  <l>So when the King a mortal shaft lets fly</l>

Proud of the wound, to it resigns his bloud,</l>
                  <l>And stains the Crystal with a Purple floud.</l>
                  <l>This a more Innocent, and happy chase,</l>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are so few Translations
which deserve praise, that
I scarce ever saw any which
deserv'd pardon; those
who travel in that kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the most part so unhappy, as to
rob others, without enriching themselves,
pulling down the fame of good Authors,
without raising their own: Neither hath
any Author been more hardly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
than this our Master; and the reason
is evident, for, what is most excellent,
is most inimitable; and if even the worst


<pb facs="tcp:39510:19"/>
thors are yet made worse by their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators,
how impossible is it not to do great
injury to the best? And therefore I
have not the vanity to think my Copy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the Original, nor (consequently)
my self altogether guiltless of what I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
others; but if I can do <hi>Virgil</hi> less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
than others have done, it will be, in
some degree to do him right; and indeed,
the hope of doing him more right, is the
only scope of this Essay, by opening this
new way of translating this Author, to
those whom youth, leisure, and better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
makes fitter for such undertakings.</p>
                  <p>I conceive it a vulgar error in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Poets, to affect being <hi>Fidus Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres;</hi>
let that care be with them who deal
in matters of Fact, or matters of Faith:
but whosoever aims at it in Poetry, as he
attempts what is not required, so he shall
never perform what he attempts; for it is
not his busines alone to translate Language
into Language, but Poesie into Poesie; &amp; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esie


<pb facs="tcp:39510:19"/>
is of so subtile a spirit, that in pouring
out of one Language into another, it will
all evaporate; and if a new spirit be not
added in the transfusion, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
nothing but a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> there
being certain Graces and Happinesses pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to every Language, which gives life
and energy to the words; and whosoever
offers at Verbal Translation, shall have the
misfortune of that young Traveller, who
lost his own language abroad, and brought
home no other instead of it: for the grace
of the Latine will be lost by being turned
into English words; and the grace of the
English, by being turned into the Latine
Phrase. And as speech is the apparel of
our thoughts, so are there certain Garbs
and Modes of speaking, which vary with
the times; the fashion of our clothes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not more subject to alteration, than
that of our speech: and this I think <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
means, by that which he calls <hi>Sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
temporis istius auribus accommodatum;</hi>
the delight of change being as due to the


<pb facs="tcp:39510:20"/>
curiosity of the ear, as of the eye; and
therefore if <hi>Virgil</hi> must needs speak Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
it were fit he should speak not only
as a man of this Nation, but as a man of
this age; and if this disguise I have put
upon him (I wish I could give it a better
name) sit not naturally and easily on so
grave a person, yet it may become him
better than that Fools-Coat wherein the
French and Italian have of late presented
him; at least, I hope, it will not make
him appear deformed, by making any part
enormously bigger or less than the life, (I
having made it my principal care to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, as he made it his to follow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in all his proportions) Neither have
I any where offered such violence to his
sense, as to make it seem mine, and not his.
Where my expressions are not so full as
his, either our Language, or my Art were
defective (but I rather suspect my self;)
but where mine are fuller than his, they
are but the impressions which the often
reading of him, hath left upon my


<pb facs="tcp:39510:20"/>
thoughts; so that if they are not his own
Conceptions, they are at least the results
of them; and if (being conscious of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him speak worse than he did almost
in every line) I erre in endeavouring
sometimes to make him speak better; I
hope it will be judged an error on the
right hand, and such an one as may deserve
pardon, if not imitation.</p>

                  <l>No flight for thoughts, but poorly sticks at
words.</l>
                  <l>A new and nobler way thou dost pursue</l>

                     <head>A Preface to the following Translation.</head>
                     <p>GOing this last Summer to visit the <hi>Wells,</hi> I
took an occasion (by the way) to wait upon an
Ancient and Honourable Friend of mine, whom I
found diverting his (then solitary) retirement
with the Latin Original of this Translation, which
(being out of Print) I had never seen before: when
I looked upon it, I saw that it had formerly passed
through two Learned hands, not without approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which were <hi>Ben Johnson,</hi> and <hi>Sir Kenelme
Digby;</hi> but I found it, (where I shall never find
my self) in the service of a better Master, the <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Bristol,</hi> of whom I shall say no more; for I
love not to improve the Honour of the Living, by
impairing that of the Dead; and my own Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
hath taught me, not to erect new Superstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon an old Ruine. He was pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to me for my companion at the <hi>Wells,</hi>
where I lik'd the entertainment it gave me so well,
that I undertook to redeem it from an obsolete Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
disguise, wherein an old <hi>Monk</hi> had cloathed
it, and to make as becoming a new Vest for it, as I
could.</p>
                     <p>The Author was a Person of Quality in <hi>Italy,</hi> his
name <hi>Mancini,</hi> which Family matched since with
the Sister of <hi>Cardinal Mazarine;</hi> he was co-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
to <hi>Petrarch,</hi> and <hi>Mantuan,</hi> and not long
before <hi>Torquato Tasso;</hi> which shews, that the


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:39510:79"/>
Age they lived in, was not so unlearned, as that
which preceded, or that which followed.</p>
                     <p>The Author writ upon the four Cardinal Vertues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but I have Translated only the two first, not to turn
the kindness I intended to him into an injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the two last are little more then repetitions and
recitals of the first; and (to make a just excuse for
him) they could not well be otherwise, since the two
last Vertues are but descendants from the first;
Prudence being the true Mother of Temperance, and
true Fortitude the Child of Iustice.</p>

choice,</l>

Then Ages, far remote shall understand</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Thule</hi> is not the farthest Land.</l>
                  <l>Sure God, by these Discoveries, did design</l>
                  <l>That his clear Light through all the World
should shine,</l>
                  <l>But the Obstruction from that Discord springs</l>

                  <l>That peaceful age, with happiness to Crown,</l>
                  <l>From Heaven the Prince of Peace himself came

                  <l>And the old dark mysterious Clouds were
clear'd,</l>
                  <l>The heavy Cause of th' old accursed Flood</l>
                  <l>Sunk in the sacred Deluge of his Blood.</l>
                  <l>His Passion, Man from his first fall, redeem'd;</l>
                  <l>Once more to Paradise restor'd we seem'd;</l>
                  <l>Satan himself was bound, till th' Iron chain</l>
                  <l>Our Pride did break, and him let loose again,</l>

Still the Old Sting remain'd, and Man began</l>
                  <l>To tempt the Serpent, as He tempted Man;</l>
                  <l>Then Hell sends forth her Furies, Avarice,
Pride,</l>
                  <l>Fraud, Discord, Force, Hypocrisie their

                  <l>Though the Foundation on a Rock were laid,</l>
                  <l>The Church was undermin'd, and then betray'd;</l>
                  <l>Though the <hi>Apostles,</hi> these events fore-told,</l>
                  <l>Yet, even the Shepherd did devour the Fold:</l>
                  <l>The Fisher to convert the world began,</l>
                  <l>The Pride convincing of vain-glorious Man;</l>
                  <l>But soon, his Follower grew a Soveraign Lord,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys exchang'd for <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sword,</l>
                  <l>Which still maintains for his adopted Son</l>
                  <l>Vast Patrimonies, though himself had none;</l>
                  <l>Wresting the Text, to the old Gyants sense,</l>
                  <l>That Heaven, once more, must suffer violence.</l>

Then subtle Doctors, Scriptures, made their
prize,</l>
                  <l>Casuists, like Cocks, struck out each others
Eyes;</l>
                  <l>Then dark distinctions, Reasons light disguis'd,</l>
                  <l>And into Attoms, Truth anatomiz'd.</l>
                  <l>Then <hi>Mahomets</hi> Crescent by our fewds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast,</l>

                  <l>Made Mother Ignorance Devotions Dame;</l>
                  <l>Then, He, whom <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s own Pride did swell,</l>

                  <l>To possess <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, that <hi>Hildebrand</hi>

                  <l>Whose foot on Miters, then on Crowns did

Then Darkness, <hi>Europe</hi>'s face did over-spread</l>
                  <l>From lazy Cells, where superstition bred,</l>
                  <l>Which, link'd with blind Obedience, so encreast</l>
                  <l>That the whole world, some ages they opprest;</l>
                  <l>Till through those Clouds, the Sun of Knowledg
brake,</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Europe</hi> from her Lethargy did wake:</l>
                  <l>Then, first our Monarchs were acknowledg'd
here</l>
                  <l>That they, their Churches Nursing-Fathers
were.</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Lucifer</hi> no longer could advance</l>
                  <l>His works on the false ground of Ignorance,</l>
                  <l>New Arts he tries, and new designs he laies,</l>
                  <l>Then, his well-study'd Master-piece he plays;</l>
                  <l>Loyola, Luther, Calvin <hi>he inspires</hi>
                  </l>

Wild Controversie then, which long had slept,</l>
                  <l>Into the Press from ruin'd Cloysters leapt;</l>
                  <l>No longer by Implicite faith we erre,</l>

                  <l>Lay-Elders, from their Ends, create their God.</l>
                  <l>But seven wise men, the ancient world did
know,</l>
                  <l>We scarce know seven, who think themselves
not so.</l>
                  <l>When Man learn'd undefil'd Religion,</l>
                  <l>We were commanded to be all as one;</l>
                  <l>Fiery disputes, that Union have calcin'd,</l>
                  <l>Almost as many minds as men we find,</l>
                  <l>And when that flame finds combustible Earth,</l>
                  <l>Thence Fatuus fires and Meteors take their

                  <l>Legions of Sects, and Insects come in throngs;</l>
                  <l>To name them all, would tire a hundred

Such were the Centaures of <hi>Ixions</hi> race</l>
                  <l>Who, a bright Cloud, for <hi>Iuno,</hi> did embrace,</l>

                  <l>Lyons before, and Dragons were behind.</l>
                  <l>Then, from the clashes between Popes and

                  <l>Debate, like sparks from Flints collision, springs:</l>

                  <l>Uncharitable Zeal our Reason whets,</l>

That Sun like this, (from which our fight we

                  <l>Gaz'd on too long, resumes the light he gave;</l>
                  <l>And when thick mists of doubts obscure his
beams,</l>
                  <l>Our Guide is Errour, and our Visions, Dreams;</l>
                  <l>'Twas no false Heraldry, when madness drew</l>
                  <l>Her Pedigree from those, who too much knew;</l>
                  <l>Who in deep Mines, for hidden Knowledg,

                  <l>Like Guns o're-charg'd, breaks, misses, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyls;</l>

Then whilst his Foe, each Gladiator foyls,</l>
                  <l>The Atheist looking on, enjoys the spoyls.</l>

                  <l>Matters of fact, to man are only known,</l>
                  <l>And what seems more, is meer opinion;</l>
                  <l>The standers by, see clearly this event,</l>
                  <l>All parties say they're sure, yet all dissent,</l>

                  <l>All humane wisdom to divine, is folly,</l>
                  <l>This Truth, the wisest man made melancholy,</l>

Hope, or belief, or guess gives some relief,</l>
                  <l>But to be sure we are deceiv'd, brings grief;</l>

                  <l>HIther ye come, dislike, and so undo</l>
                  <l>The Players, and disgrace the Poet too;</l>
                  <l>But he protests against your votes, and swears</l>
                  <l>He'll not be try'd by any, but his Peers;</l>
                  <l>He claims his priviledge, and sayes 'tis fit</l>
                  <l>Nothing should be the Iudge of wit, but Wit.</l>
                  <l>Now you will all be Wits, and be I pray;</l>
                  <l>And you that discommend it, mend the Play:</l>
                  <l>'Tis the best satisfaction, he knows then</l>
                  <l>His turn will come, to laugh at you agen.</l>
                  <l>But Gentlemen, if ye dislike the Play,</l>

                  <l>Or third be past: For we would have you know it,</l>
                  <l>The loss will fall on us, not on the Poet:</l>
                  <l>For he writes not for money, nor for praise,</l>
                  <l>Nor to be call'd a Wit, nor to wear Bayes:</l>
                  <l>Cares not for frowns or smiles: so now you'll say,</l>
                  <l>Then (why the Devil) did he write a Play?</l>
                  <l>He says, 'twas then with him, as now with you,</l>

glory</l>
                           <l>Less swell'd with ostentation, or a mind</l>

spare not:</l>
                        <l>But for those that want either,</l>
                        <l>You'll find it rather dangerous than otherwise;</l>

happen to be State-fools, then 'tis</l>

                        <l>Nature,</l>

That fear of fears, the fear of what we know not,</l>
                        <l>While yet we know it is in vain to fear it:</l>
                        <l>Death, and what follows death, 'twas that that

                        <l>And what can death deprive me of? the sight</l>

                        <l>And whatsoever others lose in death,</l>

                  <l>'TIs done, and we alive again, and now</l>
                  <l>There is no Tragedy, but in your brow.</l>
                  <l>And yet our Author hopes you are pleas'd, if not;</l>
                  <l>This having fail'd, he has a second Plot:</l>
                  <l>'Tis this; the next day send us in your friends,</l>
                  <l>Then laugh at them, and make your selves amends.</l>
                  <l>Thus, whether it be good or bad, yet you</l>
                  <l>May please your selves, and you may please us too:</l>
                  <l>But look you please the Poet, lest he vow</l>
                  <l>A full revenge upon you all, but how?</l>
                  <l>'Tis not to kill you all twenty a day,</l>
                  <l>He'l do't at once, a more compendious way;</l>
                  <l>He means to write again; but so much worse,</l>
                  <l>That seeing that, you'l think it a just curse</l>
                  <l>For censuring this: 'Faith give him your applause,</l>
                  <l>As you give Beggars money; for no cause,</l>
                  <l>But that he's troublesome, and he has swore,</l>
                  <l>As Beggars do, he'l trouble you no more.</l>
