            <title>The tryall and plea of James Earle of Derby, prisoner of war, before a court martiall at Chester, Octob. 1. 1651 The articles were severall particulars of treason, by his invading England, raising forces, &amp;c. The answer is a confession of the fact. The plea is a plea of quarter, which he conceives to be a good bar to a tryall for life, by court martiall or councell of war, though not against a meer civill judicature. His plea was over-ruled by the court upon this account, that the court martiall was directed by Parliament. So that the court proceeded to sentence, only gave him a fortnights time from the first of October. From this sentence he appealeth to his Excellency the Lord Generall.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>UPon the 16th of this inſtant moneth, by an extraordinary Meſſenger from <hi>Cheſter</hi> it is advertized, That the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was brought before the Court-Marſhal, conſiſting of Col. <hi>Duckenfield</hi> and 15 Commiſſion-Officers, where the Judge Advocate brought in, and read the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, conſiſting of High-Treaſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That he had in a moſt traiterous and hoſtile manner, been aiding, abetting, and aſſiſting to <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> (Son to the late Tyrant.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he had held correſpondency and confederacy with the ſaid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29669:3"/>
               <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and his accomplices; and to the utmoſt of his power, indeavoured the ſubverſion and extirpating of this preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as alſo the violating and aboliſhing the Law and Diſcipline, ſo happily by them eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he had trayterouſly indeavoured to involve this <hi>NATION</hi> in another bloody and inteſtine War, by iſſuing forth and ſending War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and ſummoning in the people to a Randevouz.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he had moſt traiterouſly appeared in the head of a party, both in <hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and other places within this Nation, and granted Commiſſions, ſigned <hi>C. R</hi> [being a ſignal uſed by the grand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of this Common-wealth] to divers Gentlemen, Papiſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the raiſing of forces againſt the Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Judge Advocate having read the Charge, his Lordſhip made a ſhort Speech in anſwer thereunto, to wit, That he had not acted in the leaſt, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Commands of his Maſter the King; but what he had done, was in order and obedience to the power and Inſtructions from him receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>After which Col. <hi>Duckenfield</hi> and the reſt of the Councel, proceeded to examination, and ſtated the matters of fact, conſiſting of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; which cauſed his Lordſhip to look very penſively, and moved him ſo far, that he would fain do ſomething which might be conſidered, and himſelf in it; and withall, declares a good inclination to deliver up the Iſle of Man, to the preſent power; only here lies a ſcruple, That he is afraid it will be imputed as a very ignoble and diſhonourable thing, to ſurrender up his Children and Lady in it. But after ſome time ſpent in this buſineſs, the Councel referred the further proceedings in his Tryal until another time.</p>
            <p>The matters of fact exhibited againſt him, are of a very high nature, and its probable may draw a ſevere ſentence upon him: divers other perſons of quality there are which were ingaged alſo in this treaſonable deſign, who are likewiſe to be brought to the Bar of Juſtice: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive it requiſite, to preſent to the free-born people of this Nation: certain Rules and Propoſals, ſhewing the happineſs and joy that will redound to all thoſe at the hour of death that walke ſtedfaſtly in the wayes of Holineſs; and the miſery and torments that will befall on the contrary, to thoſe that are oppoſers, and kick againſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof.

            <head>The Subſtance of the Earle of <hi>Derby's</hi> Speech to enforce his plea.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Underſtand my ſelf to be Convented before you, as well by a Commiſſion from the Lord Generall, as by direction of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 12th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>To the Articles I have given a full and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwer, what may preſent it ſelfe for my advantage, I have gained liberty to offer and urge by Adviſe.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not but in matter of Law the Court will be to me inſtead of Counſell in Court.</p>
            <p>Sir, I ſhall firſt obſerve to you the nature and generall order of a Court Martiall, with the Lawes and Axiomes of it, as far as concerns my Caſe, and then ſhall apply my plea to ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conceive (under favour) that the Laws of a Court Martiall, are as the Laws of Nature and Nations, equally binding all perſons, and in all places Military; and to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inviolably.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is, if a Judgement be given in one Court Martiall, there is no appeal to any other Court Martiall.</p>
            <p>Of which Law Martiall, the Civill Law gives a plentifull Accoun,t far above what the Common Law doth; as <hi>Grotius de iure belli,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is one onely point of Martiall Law, which I am to inſiſt upon for my life, — I ſhall name it, and debate the <hi>Jus,</hi> the right of it, — It is Quarter for life given me by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Edge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:29669:4"/>Which I conceive to be a good bar to avoid tryall by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of War for Life.</p>
            <p>That you are a Councell of VVar, will be admitted, and being ſo, that you must judge and proceed to Laws of VVar, and no otherwiſe, cannot be denyed.</p>
            <p>That Quarter was given me, if it be ſcrupled, I am ready to prove, and being given, that it is pleadable is above diſpute.</p>
            <p>I ſhall onely remove one Objection, which is, that though this be a Court Martiall, yet the ſpeciall Nature of it is directed by Parliament.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, though the Parliament direct the Tryall as it is, yet it limits it to a Court Martiall, which cannot direct it ſelfe, nor is directed of its own nature by any ſuch direction.</p>
            <p>For to appoint a Court Martiall to proceed by any other Laws, than a Court Martiall can, — is a repugnancy in <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as ſuch Court Martiall retains it's proper Lawes and Juriſdictions for the ſupport of it ſelf; ſo the pleas and liberties incident to that cannot be denyed the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>That Quarter, and ſuch Quarter as I had given, is a good plea for life to a Councell of War, I ſhall not endeavour ſo much to evince by Authors (that being the proper work of the learned in Civil Lawes) but by ſuch way as that which we call <hi>ius gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> is proved by common practice, and ſtrong reaſon.</p>
            <p>For the firſt I ſhall not need to bring any Forraign inſtances, being before you whoſe experiences hath made this thing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to you; and I beleeve you will agree with me, That I am not onely the firſt Peer, but the firſt Man, tryed by a Court Martiall after Quarter given; unleſſe ſome matters <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> or ſubſequent to ſuch Quarter, brought them within he <hi>examen</hi> of ſuch Court Martiall.</p>
            <p>And (as I am informed) upon the great Tryall of the Earle of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c that plea of Quarter being throughly urged, it was onely avoyded upon this ground, That it was no good Plea againſt a Civill Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29669:4"/>
there being no colour of diſpute, but tacitely admitted &amp; concluded, that it was a good plea againſt a Military juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>And though the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> and Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> quarter ſeemed to have ſome advantage, as being given by the Generall, and by way of Articles, yet that quarter given to the Earle of <hi>Cambridg</hi> was given him by a particular Captain, and that quarter, as quarter conſidered, as ſtrong as the other, only both avoided by the civill juriſdiction in the high Court of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>It being a rule in war, that quarter hath as much force being given in action, as Articles have in a Ceſſation, both irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by any Military power.</p>
            <p>And though it may be a received opinion in politiques, that no Generals or ſouldiers conceſſions ſhould prejudice the States in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, yet they ſhall be barrs to their owne power.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I love the laws of Peace more then thoſe of war, yet in this caſe I muſt adhere to thoſe of war.</p>
            <p>And I would only know, whether a quarter was given me for a benefit to me, or for a miſchief; it for a benefit, I am now to have it made good; if for a miſchief, then it deſtroys the faith of men in arms.</p>
            <p>And I have read this for a maxime of war, that promiſſes made by Kings, or States Commanders, ought to be obſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably, elſe there never will be any yeelding.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall lay this before you as a Rule, that quarter given by the meaneſt ſouldier (if not forbidden) obliges as farr as if the Generall had done it.</p>
            <p>And I never read or heard, that any Souldiers received to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, were (after 12 howres reſpite) ever denied quarter, or try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Court Marſhall.</p>
            <p>It may be objected then, that it may reſt in the power of no private ſouldier by giving quarter to pardon treaſon.</p>
            <p>To that I ſay, I pleaded it not as an abſolute pardon, but as a barr to a Court Marſhall.</p>
            <p>I shall infer further from concluſions of reaſon.</p>
            <p>The profeſſion of a ſouldier hath danger enough in it, and hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29669:5"/>
need not add any to it, to deſtroy the right of arms. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you as a Court Marſhall, it may be all of you, or moſt, have in ſome action or other ſince theſe troubles began, received quarter for your lives, and would it not be hard meaſure that any Court Marſhall ſhould try you afterwards.</p>
            <p>If this quarter be foyled or nulled, all the Quarter, Articles, termes or concluſions made ſince the warr began may be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by any ſubſequent Court Marſhall, nay, by this the ſword, the Law of Armes, all Millitary intereſt, and your owne ſafety, are judged and jeoparded as well as mine.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not multiply, preſuming you will not judge by the laws of war, in which capacity only you ſitt; and that you wil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
