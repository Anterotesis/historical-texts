         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a way for the ensuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Diseases, by premising these Particulars. 1. What is Age, and the Definition of it? 2. The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35700:11"/>
of Age? 3. The Subject of the Discourse? 4. Why Children are apt to Sickness? 5. Why Childrens Diseases are so call'd? 6. The Order and Method of the Discourse of Childrens Diseases.</p>
               <p>It is answered, 1. Every Age is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to all kinds of Diseases, but one Age is more disposed to some Diseases, then another is; for every Age hath a peculiar temper, and so a similitude with some Diseases, whereby it is more easily affected and changed by them then by other Diseases; nevertheless, Age it self doth not produce Diseases, but only disposes and makes one apt to receive certain sorts of Diseases; for Age is a thing that is natural, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of a time; and it is defined by some to be a Space and Duration of Life, in which the Constitution of the Body is manifestly changed, by the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the natural heat upon the radical Moisture. The Life of Man consists in Heat and Moisture, the Heat consumes by degrees the Moisture, whereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows several Changes of the Temperament, which are called Ages.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35700:11"/>
2. The Division of Age is various by the Ancients; some divide it into 7. parts, other into 6. or 5. parts: But the Modern (considering that in all things there is a Beginning, Increase, State, and Declination) have divided Age into 4. parts (alluding to the 4. Elements, 4. Humours of Mans body, and 4. sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the year.) 1. Adolescency, or growing Age, in which are contained Infancy, Childhood, and Puberty, and it extends to 25. or 30. years. 2. Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness or flourishing Age, extending to 36, or 40. years. 3. Consistent Age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to 45. or 50. years. 4. Old Age, which contains decrepit Age, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the end of Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Subject treated on will be the first Age and Adolescency, as it extends only to 14. years, for then and not before, ought a man to be said perfect, (though some say at 7. years) because as Plants are said then to be perfect, when they first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bear fruit, so Man ought to be called perfect in that time, when he begins to be prolifick and procreable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Children are disposed to very many Diseases for divers reasons, because of the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35700:12"/>
1. Impurity of the nourishment in the Womb by an erroneous Diet or Sickness of the Mother. 2. Great labour and pains in the Birth and Getting out of the womb, being a narrow passage, whereby is weakness, and very often are bruises. 3. Cutting of the Navel String, that the Infant may get forth, whereby pains and Inflamations often follow. 4. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Nourishment, Children in the Womb are nourish'd with the purest blood of the Mother, and they only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the third Concoction, but after Birth they use Milk and other food, and need the help of the Stomach and Liver for the first and second Concoction. 5. Change of place, being not used to the Air, for Infants live in the womb in the greatest Lukewarmness and Tranquility, but as soon they feel the cold Air out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and breath it in; they are hurt, which appears by their crying. 6. The unsoftness and uneasiness of the things they lye upon, for Infants lye very soft in the Womb. 7. Hot and moist tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which is very obnoxious to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 8. The fault and badness of the Milk.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35700:12"/>
5. Diseases of Children are so called, not only such which trouble and affect only Children, as Diseases arising from breeding of Teeth, but also such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which most frequently happen to Children, &amp; are cur'd in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in them then they are in other Ages.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Order and Method in the Discourse of Childrens Diseases will be, 1. Of External Diseases, and such as belong to the outward parts of the body. 2. Universal Diseases, which affect all parts of the body. Thirdly and lastly, Particular and inward Diseases of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and inward parts of the Body, proceeding from the Diseases of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts to the lower parts.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Greatnesse, Dropsie, or Water of the Head.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is somtimes an immense large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the head, vitiating the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions of it; yet the Head is not to be called diseased, as if it needed the


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35700:13"/>
help of a Physician, because it is natural and incurable, that is not here intended; but that which is called the Dropsie of the head, and though sometimes it is in a peculiar part of the Head, yet for the most part it is in the whole capacity of the head, and it is more frequently in Children and Infants newly born, then others of elder years, in regard of the softness of their head and bones.</p>
               <p>It is defined to be a Tumor of the Head, contrary to nature, hapning for the most part to Children; or a Tumor of the Head, caused by the Collection of Waterish humours in some part of the Members constituting the head.</p>
               <p>The immediate cause is either, 1. A Wind, which is seldome, in regard of the rarity and purosity of the head (which appears by the hairiness of it) and the Thumes and Tenuity of the Wind (made of a very thin humour (and so easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and dissipated. 2. Thin and Waterish humour, which is sometimes thick and coloured, by the mixture of the Ichor of other humours with it. This humour is collected more often in the Womb then out of it, and in the head


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35700:13"/>
then other parts; because 1. Of the great moisture of the Brain. 2. The plenty of Vapours which ascend to the head, and by its coldness turne into Water. 3. It being the seat of Waterish humors, for the Head is placed over the Belly, as the Head of a Still over the body of it. 4. The Density of the Skull which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Vapours.</p>
               <p>The Signes by which this Disease is known, relate to the Cause or Place; If Wind be the Cause, the head lightly struck will sound like a Drum, and the Tumor prest by a Finger yeilds to it, and leaves a Dent, which presently fills up again; If an humour be the cause, and not within the Skull, the Tumor is soft, clear; if prest, it slowly returns to its former fulnesse, the Colour of the Skin is unchang'd, and there is crying and want of sleep; If the humour be within the Skull, the Infant hath an heaviness of the head, cryes and cannot sleep; and in those of elder years, the eyes are prominent, and stand out, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and can hardly be shut, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fancy is hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35700:14"/>
The Presage; If the Tumor is within the Skull, some think it incureable, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think it cureable by Cauteries, and by Diaphoreticks. If it is on the outside of the Skull, it is dangerous, because of the Dignity of the Head, and the tenderness of it in an Infant; for every Disease of the head is dangerous, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in an Infant, whose tenderness cannot endure a Disease or Remedy, and if the humor should move inwardly, there is great danger of a <hi>Lethargy</hi> or <hi>Apoplexy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cure is, by discussing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the wind, and evacuating the humour insensibly, or sensibly by purging or manual Operation, for the doing whereof a convenient Diet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, which ought to be directed to the Nurse if the Child suck, otherwise to the Child. Wherefore let the Air be hot and dry where the Nurse and Child is kept; &amp; if it be not so naturally, &amp; by the season of the year, prepare it so by good fires and fumes of sweet and hot woods; If the Child suck, let the Nurse watch much, and if it is wean'd, let it sleep lesse then if it was sound, because watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth much dry the body, as sleep


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35700:14"/>
softens it; Moderate Exercise and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble belly is very convenient, which if need, let it be help'd by a Suppository made of Hony; The Nurse and Child both are to abstain from Wine, and in the place of it a Drink is to be made of Water with Coriander seed prepared, and Anniseed; let the Meat be such as discusses and breaks wind, and dissipates humours; wherefore let the Bread have a little Coriander seed in it, and the Flesh be rather of Wild Fowl, and roasted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then boyled; a Moderate use of spice is profitable; and Coriander canded with Sugar. All Herbs and Waterish Fruits are to be avoided. If the Nurse be sound, avoid purging her, lest you hurt the Milk; if she be unsound, purge her as the quality and nature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour require.</p>
               <p>External Remedies only belong to an Infant (for Purges and other Remedies are to be used to the Nurse) and very carefully, least they hurt, wherefore this Fomentation will be convenient. Take of <hi>Pennyroyal, Maryroom, Savory,</hi> of each an handful; <hi>Cumminseed</hi> and <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed</hi> of each an Ounce, boyl them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

with a little <hi>Castor.</hi> Some commend the Brain of a Wolf dried and sprinkled with Musk, put into the Nose. In the use of these Remedies you are to take notice, that if the water moves from the internal to the external parts, it is incurable: Likewise, if the Water is plentiful which is collected out of the Skull, the use of inward or outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are in vain: because as strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal remedies in this tender Subject are not convenient, so moderate and weak remedies do not prevail; the like is also in external Medicaments, wherefore there is only hope in a sensible evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chyrurgery and Incision, which is to be used if the water be not discuss'd within three weeks; by the preceeding means Incision is dangerous, in regard of the tenderness of the Age, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the distemper, and ought to be the last remedy, and not to be used upon Children newly born, but in others of elder years.</p>
               <p>In the making Incision, if the Tumor hath a great point, the head of the point is to be opened, with two or three Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and in the lowest part for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier

evacuating the humour, which Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation ought not to be at once, but by degrees, lest the Spirits are dissipated, and care is to be taken that the coldness of the Air doth not hurt the Brain. After Incision is made, and the water evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by little and little, Proper Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to wounds are to be used, as Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen wet in Oyl or Wine; which Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments are to be straightly bound if the Child is very strong, but if very tender and weak, the place that is cut is to be only covered with some soft Wool (or the like) dipt in Medicaments proper for wounds. If after Incision the Flesh will not grow, by the fault of the bone, (as if often happens) scrape the bone gently that the fault may be removed, and the flesh grow. If the Water is between the skin and the Temp'ral Muscles, or between the Muscles and the Skin it is mortal to make Incision, but you must expect the setling of the Water in the sides of the Muscles not belonging to them. Some there are that use Caustick Medicaments, and burn many Ulcers in the Childs head, and if it is not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, then they come to Incision, but

it is very dangerous; for exulcerations in the Childs head which is full of water, are never or hardly cureable.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Kings Evill</hi> is a hard or Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tumour contrary to nature, growing for the most about the Neck, and chiefly of Children. The immediate cause is sometimes Flesh, but very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Sometimes the Glandules turn into this Tumour, but most frequently Phlegm, or Melancholy hardned. Some think the Cause is an Alamentary Juyce hardned; because they are not changed into a disgested matter, nor do putrefie, and continue a long time. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent causes are youngness of Age, cold and moist temper, softners of Flesh and Muscles, and shortness of the Neck, thereby the humours fall easily from the head in the neck, and cleave tenaciously.


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35700:19"/>
The external causes are the coldness and moisture of the Climate, Idlenesse, drinking crude and thick waters, the use of Cheese, Fruits, and grosse food; but chiefly voracity, and imoderate eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherefore Children and Infants are principally troubled with this Disease. If the matter is not viscous and glutinous, although it condenses, yet it is not coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or contained in a Membrane; but if part of the matter is glutinous when it is congealed by the cold of the Part or Glandule, a skin is made round about, and consequently a Bladder or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, in which afterwards the matter by degrees thickens, the thinner part being in time consumed. The difference of this Disease, is taken from 1. Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, some being as great as a Melon, others moderate, and little as a Pea. 2. Nature, Some gentle without pain or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, and with a moderate hardness. Some moderate, between a <hi>Schirrus</hi> and an <hi>Aposteme,</hi> or Malignant, with pain and inflamation, and very great hardnesse. 3. Constitution, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elevated, and move hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; others, as if they were impacted


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35700:19"/>
and unmoveable. 4. Place, Some are about the hinder part of the head, others about the auteriour part, some in the Skin, others profound, and about the noble great vessells. 5. Plenty, Some are accumulated into an heap, others not.</p>
               <p>The signs are, Tumour sometimes round, sometimes somewhat long, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the same colour with the Skin, sometimes more red, hard, and without pain, and move not to and fro being handled. The <hi>Kings Evill</hi> is known from hardned Glandules, because 1. The matter of Glandules is more subtile and thin, then the matter of this Disease, which is more thick, viscid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious; hence it is, that as often as the thin and subtile matter is incraffated, the <hi>Kings Evill</hi> is made of the Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. 2. Hardned Glandules are more separated from the next Flesh, that it it is easie to discern them from the flesh, by Feeling, the contrary is in the <hi>Kings Evil.</hi> 3. The <hi>Kings Evill</hi> hath for the most part a Membrane or Coat, the Glandules not. Some distinguish them thus; Take the Leaves of <hi>Ivy</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> and bruise them together, lay them


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35700:20"/>
upon the Tumour, and if in three dayes the Tumour lye hid, it is a sign of the Glandules; but if they are exasperated by the Medicament, then it is a sign that it is the <hi>Kings Evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Presage is, This Disease is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and wearisome to the Patient and Physician; for whatsoever way you deal with them, they are exasperated, and if they seem to be cur'd return again. It is very difficult to cure, but with lesse difficulty and danger in Infants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then in youth, because they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten degenerate into Cancers and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ulcers. The <hi>Kings Evill</hi> that is little, superficial and gentle, are not very dangerous, &amp; are more easily cur'd: but such as are great, deep, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, are pernicious, and for the most part incureable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings Evill</hi> though it is most exactly cur'd, yet it returns again, which is not from the motion of the Moon, as some have thought, because they have return'd after a Month, a year, or two years: but the cause is, 1. The Viscosity thickens, and contumaciousnesse of the matter, which is not perfectly eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35700:20"/>
and extirpated in the Cure, but some part is left, which vitiates and corrupts the temper and nourishment of the part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Coat or Membrane which is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciously infix'd, that it can scarce be extirpated, and so is fill'd with new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if it be extirpated, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains some roots or ligaments, out of which the Membrane or Coat growes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and so the Tumor or <hi>Kings Evill</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, taking away the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cause, and correcting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Parts, which make Phlegme; all which is done by, 1. A Convenient Diet, let the Air be hot and dry, the sleep little, exercise moderate, avoid much rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or kembing of the head, and bearing weight on the Head; avoid all pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the mind (except moderate anger) and Wine that is strong and thick; if you use Wine, do it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and mixe it with water. Let your meat be attenuating and drying, as Bread well bak'd, and with <hi>Anniseeds</hi> or <hi>Coriander-seeds.</hi> Let your flesh be of Wild-fowl, and rather roasted then boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; avoid Spices, as filling the head with


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35700:21"/>
vapours, and all thick, grosse, viscid, and cold meats, as Beef, Cheese, Milk, Eggs fried or hard and the like. Hence it is that the Children of poor persons are more troubled with this Disease then the Children of rich men, because they eat grosse and ill Diet, which makes and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Purging, Take of the Leaves of <hi>Senna</hi> half an Ounce, of <hi>Polypode</hi> two Drams, Ginger 15. grains, half an Ounce of Raisins stoned, <hi>Sebestens Pruins</hi> of each three in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of the Flowers of <hi>Borrage, Violets, Red Roses,</hi> and <hi>Rosemary,</hi> of each half a dram, boil them in a pint of fountain wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter until half be consumed.

The Ashes of <hi>Colworts</hi> mixt with Hony, is also very good. Observe that strong Discutients may not be used, lest Feavers are caused, and the tender Flesh of the Child hurt.</p>
               <p>If the matter be very viscid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious, it is not cur'd but by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or burning it, which is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and turns them into Cancers that are mortall, as is experienc'd in the using such remedies for the <hi>Kings Evill,</hi> in the Neck, Breasts, or Grayn.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PUstules,</hi> or Risings, or Swellings for the most part they are in the Head, but sometimes in the whole body.</p>
               <p>In the beginning they are small and little, afterwards they are sore, and make hard white Scabs and Crusts, by the driness of the humour; In sucking Children they are call'd <hi>Crusta,</hi> in those of elder years they are called <hi>Achores;</hi> they are ulcerous Tubercles, or Ulcers with small risings, perforating the skin with small holes, through which passeth a sanious or filthy matter.</p>
               <p>The cause is, as some think, a nitrous and salt Phlegme mixt with Choler; Others a putrid, corrupted and Ichorous blood: but I consent to them who think the humour is mix'd, partly thick and partly thin, waterish, salt, and nitrous, and according to the various mixture of the humours with the salt waterish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35700:23"/>
the various colours of the Sores arise, being thereby, black, red, white, or yellow, and those humours are either generated in the womb of the Mother, out of the Menstruous blood; or after the Child is born, by the fault of Milk or Diet, nature purifying and purging her self, sends them forth into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the body.</p>
               <p>The signs are manifest to Sight, the Child cries, cannot sleep, and are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the Child Itches, and after Itching they are sore, a bloody humour passes forth, and oftentimes the Child is lowsy. If they proceed from blood, there is a redness, pain, and more easie Itch: but if from a more sharp humour, there is a great Itch.</p>
               <p>The Presage, <hi>Pustules</hi> sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into great Ulcers, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times corrode the Skull by the Malignity and badness of the humour, that the Membranes may be seen. They many times preserve Children from great and many Diseases, as Feavers, Falling-sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and others, by natures purging her self by the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35700:23"/>
They heal frequently of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by Time and Age.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in, 1. A Convenient Diet, by avoiding salt, sharp, hot and sweet things, fish and fruit. If the <hi>Pustules</hi> are moist, a drye Diet is convenient, as the eating of Wild-fowl roasted, bread twice bak'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ought to be us'd only by the Nurse if the Child suck.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Evacuation of the humours by Blood-letting, Leeches, or Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses, and purging the Nurse; if the Child suck not, prepare the humours with <hi>Cichory, Eudave, Fumitory,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimony,</hi> of each an handful, boyle them in a pint and an half of Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til half a pint be consumed; Take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of three Ounces, and add the Syrrup called Syrrup <hi>Byzantius,</hi> and the Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of <hi>Fumitory,</hi> of each half an Ounce, or temper the humour that is faulty with the Syrrups of <hi>Borrage</hi> and <hi>Fumitory.</hi> The humours being prepared, Take of <hi>Rhabarb</hi> one Dram, infuse it all night in three Ounces of <hi>Endive-water,</hi> in the Morning strain it well, and add an Ounce and an half of the Syrrup of Roses so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive. The Body being purged, the


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35700:24"/>
part excoriated is to be cur'd by outward Remedies. A Bath of common Water in which the Leaves of <hi>Scabius, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> and <hi>Plantane</hi> are boyled, is very good. The Ointments of <hi>Litheridge, Cerusse,</hi> or <hi>Diapompholiges</hi> cures it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Lips are made not only for Beauty, but also for use, for the defence of the Mouth and Teeth, and also for Speech and Sucking, so that they being chopt, they cause pain, and hinder Sucking. This Disease is a certain Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Lips with Pustules and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out, and sometimes without them.</p>
               <p>The immediate cause is a salt, sharp, and cholerick humour, or sharp, biting, and exulcerating vapours, proceeding chiefly from the whole body, as in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; many times from the Head, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Lungs, or other principal part


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35700:24"/>
of the Body. These humours and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours produce the Cleavings and Ulcers of the Lips, chiefly in Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the frequent motions of the skin, which draws them to the mouth, and in regard of the tenderness of them, which makes them apt to receive.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are, the use of hot things, hardness of Dugs, kisses of many people, but chiefly an intemperate Air in heat and cold, but most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the coldness and driness of the Air; for though Lips may be so dried by the Air, that they may exulcerate, yet not so frequent as from the coldness and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it, because heat cleaves and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that which is moist, by consuming the moisture; Cold, by compressing and repelling, and it is easier to repell and press moisture out of a thing, then to consume it, especially in soft parts, to which humours continually flowe, as it is in the Lips.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest, as little Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and pains in the Lips; there is also pain, Itching and crying of Children. If a Vapour is the Cause, then the Child hath an Inflamation or a great Feaver.


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35700:25"/>
If humours, then there is <hi>Catarrhs</hi> and Distillations, and the Ulcers are moist, and an humour passeth out of them.</p>
               <p>The Presage is, this Disease is not mortall, unless malignant Ulcers are made by Unskilfulnesse. Ulcers made in a Feaver or afterwards, are a sign of Health, for they shew the humours ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating a Feaver, are dissipated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, if the Choppings of the Lips proceed from an internal cause, a gentle purge is convenient, and Diet that corrects the humours. If from the Sharpnesse of the Milk, let the Nurse use cooling Diet, and things correcting the Milk. If from the hardness of the Nibble, soften it. Medicaments for the Childs Lips, are Oyl of Roses with the white of an Egge, Oyl of Eggs, Oyl of Wax, which is most excellent; Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Roses, of <hi>Cerusse, Campho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Pomatum.</hi> Take an equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Turpentine, Hony,</hi> and <hi>Goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease,</hi> mix them, to which you may add half an Ounce of <hi>Cerusse,</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theridge,</hi> more or lesse, as you would have it drye.

               <p>The Signs are hardnesse, swelling, rednesse, heat, pulsation, and a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. Let the Nurse use a Diet that is cold and moist.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then use such things as may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage the pain, and repell the humours, as the Oyl of Roses, the white Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35700:26"/>
or the Oyntment of <hi>Poppies,</hi> these are to be used untill the beginning of the Inflamation is past; then use the Oyl of <hi>Cammomile,</hi> and the Oyl of <hi>Roses,</hi> and the more distance there is from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the more use Discutients, but have a care of strong Discutients, as the Oyl of <hi>Anniseeds</hi> or <hi>Cammomile,</hi> Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppuration and ripening it, which is to be avoided, if you can help it; Bread or Mallowes boyled in Milk ripen gently, such as ripen more vehemently are painful, and torment the Child.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of a Rupture, and Broken Belly.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Rupture is a falling down of the Guts from their place.</p>
               <p>The Cause is the breaking, or relaxing the Inner rine of the Belly that joyns to the Caul, the latter cause is most frequent in Children in regard of their Moisture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:35700:26"/>
The External Causes are vehement motion, extraordinary Crying, holding of the Breath, abundance of Wind, and a strong Endevour of disburthening the Belly.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the Causes are thus; If the Peritonation be broken, the Tumor was caused and increased suddenly, and the Gut descends to the bottome, but if it be relax'd, the Tumor grew by degrees, neither doth the Gut descend to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
               <p>The Cure is by, 1. Putting the Gut up into the belly; if it hath wind in it, which is known by the noyse, and sending wind out of it, then use Discutients, anoint it with the Isle of <hi>Cammomile</hi> or <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds;</hi> if it hath its ordure hardned in it, soften it by Poultesses, Clysters, and Bathings; if it hath Phlegme in it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate it by degrees with Clysters, and Suppositories, and use things that are hot and dry, and attenuating.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The keeping it in its place after it is put into it, that it fall down no more, which is done by a Trusse, and inward and outward Medicaments. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal are, the Powder of Mouse-eare used


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35700:27"/>
at Meals taken in Water, <hi>Rupterwort</hi> taken from the New of the Moon to the full, Decoctions of great <hi>Comfrey, St. Johnswort,</hi> and <hi>Saniclé.</hi> The internal Medicaments profit little, but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal are more certain, and the only hope is in them. The Seed of <hi>Ameos,</hi> with the white of an Egge is highly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The Emplasters, called <hi>Emplastrum ad Herviam,</hi> and <hi>Emplastrum Caesaris,</hi> will serve in the place of all other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In cutting it, if it be not cur'd by the Medicaments above, which is easie and without danger.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe falling of the Fundament is a going forth of the right and streight Gut (called the Pudding Gut) with the Sphyncter Muscle.</p>
               <p>The Cause is, 1. A weakness of the Muscle by coldness of the humours, or


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35700:27"/>
outwardly, as when Children sit on Stoves, or by a loosness of the Belly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A great Endevour and striving in disburthening the Belly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A great irritation and frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of emptying the belly, which comes from a Dysentery or Tenesme.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest to sight.</p>
               <p>The Presage, This Disease is hard to cure, because all Diseases of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are very difficult to cure; because,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The part is very sensible, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure sharp Medicaments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The passing of the Filth, which if it be hard it exasperates the part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Medicaments are not easily appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this part, nor are kept long enough, by the passing of the Filth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Place is hot and moist, which requires remedies that are cooling and drying, which irritate and exasperate, and therefore scarcely endur'd.</p>
               <p>That which is without an Inflamation, not inveterate, but new, is more easily cur'd.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. By putting it into its place, which is done by a gentle hand; if it be swell'd, bath it with a Decoction


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35700:28"/>
of Mallowes before you put it up, which will likewise cleanse the Filth and slimy humour from it, which is requisite also to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Retaining it in its place, after it is put into it, which is done by astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent remedies, which ought not to be very strong (because they exasperate, cause pain, and want of sleep) to which use serves <hi>Terra Lemnia, Sanguis Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conis, Frankinsence,</hi> and <hi>Cerusse,</hi> which are to be sprinkled upon the part; apply to the Fundament a Spunge, dipp'd in an Astringent Decoction of <hi>Sanicle, Herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robert, Acornes,</hi> or Leaves of <hi>Oake,</hi> or the greater <hi>Comfrey.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of the Galling of Children.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Galling of Children are certain Ulcers in the Skin, or Excoriations which happen to Children between the Thighes; sometimes they are in the Feet, Lips, and between the Thighes in those of elder years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:35700:28"/>
The Cause is, 1. External, sharp Urine (especially in fat Children) sharp and cholerick Filth of the Belly, and Foulness of Cloaths, walking, rough Cloathing, and violent motion drawing the sharp humours to the Skin, or exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating the humours in the Skin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Internal and immediate, a sharp and corroding humour, which is either generated in the part exulcerated, or it flowes from the body into those parts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Antecedent, the fault of the Milk, if the Child suck. In elder ones, an ill Diet, especially meats that are hot, sweet, salt, or corroding.</p>
               <p>The Signs are obvious, because the part is red and pain'd, especially if it be touch'd and rubb'd.</p>
               <p>Presage, If they are neglected they turn into ill Ulcers, and are dangerous, otherwise they are easie to cure.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, if the Child suck, let the Nurse use a good Diet and abstain from Motion, Watching, Anger, Wine, and all meats that are sharp, salt, and corroding. If she be of an unhealthy blood, let her purge; The Child is also to be often wash'd and clens'd from his


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35700:29"/>
filth and excrements, and his Cloathes are to be clean and not hard. If the Child doth not suck, the like Diet is to be used, as is advised for the Nurse, and the same remedies for preparing and purging of the humours, and outwardly to be applied are convenient, which are advised in the Fourth Chapter; to which I refer you. To them may be added Dear-Suet, or the Suet of a Goat. Take a Turnip, make a Hole in it, then fill it with the Oyl of Roses, and Roast it, of which make a Liniament.</p>

               <p>CHilblanes usually follow Tumours and Swellings, and the matter of it is dry, sharp and corroding, and makes an Ulcer, which for the most part is dry, and no matter or humour issues of it. It happens to Children chiefly because they lesse feel the cold, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against it, and so are most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hurt with the cold. It happens to


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35700:29"/>
he hands and Feet, and not other parts of the body; because,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The hands and feet are farthest from the fountain of heat, the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are without Flesh, and have no defence from outward injuries, and do abound with Nerves and Bones, whereby we have great pain, and are more cold in these parts then in other parts, insomuch that these parts many times corrupt and putrefie with cold; by what is said. Chilblanes may be defined</p>
               <p>A dry Ulcer in the hands and feet, chiefly in Infants.</p>
               <p>The Cause is cold, or shoes that hurt being too straight, rough, or hard.</p>
               <p>The Signs are, An Inflamation more or lesse, sometimes Pustules, afterwards exulcerations, a little pain, but the Itching greater, a purulent Ichor comes from it, that seems to be like ripened or thin matter.</p>
               <p>The Presage, It is not dangerous if it be not neglected; if it be, a Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Feet may happen, and so Death.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in, 1. Preservation from it, wherefore avoid straight and hard


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35700:30"/>
shoes, defend your feet from the cold Air, and rub your feet with salt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mingled, which is good in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when the swelling only appears, so is the washing your feet with salt water, or with a Decoction of <hi>Betes.</hi> And when there is only a Swelling these are good, as Turnips boyled and applied in the manner of a Plaister, Bran boyled in Wine. Take of the Gumme <hi>Ammoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum</hi> one Dram, of <hi>Resin</hi> two Drams, dissolve them over the fire, add thereto six Drams of Common Oyl, of Wax half a Dram, let the Wax be dissolved, then add Flower of <hi>Fengreek, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>Mastick,</hi> of each two Drams, mingle them. 2. In curing the Ulcer, <hi>Aloes</hi> alone, or mix'd with sweet wine, cures it being laid to it; if the Ulcer be sordid, clense it with the Ointment called the Ointment of the Apostles; when it is clensed that no filth is left, then skin it with the Plaster called <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma.</hi>

               <p>The Cause is, a corrupted blood mixt with salt Phlegme, and burnt Choler, either generated in the womb of the Mother by the menstruous blood, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Child is born, by the corruption of milk, or fault of Diet, by which the Liver chiefly is intemperately hot, or the blood is corrupted by contagion, which being expell'd to the Skin, there sticks, exulcerates it, and makes it sore.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest, and are in the Definition.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in, 1. A convenient Diet, the meat ought to be boyled not roasted, of an easie Disgestion, not salt, hot, or having ill qualities; unclenliness, and unseasonable exercise are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>

               <p>The Itch is sometimes in the whole body, but most frequently in the Soles of the Feet, by reason of the hardnesse and thicknesse of the Skin, hindering the humours to evaporate.</p>
               <p>The Cause is Choller, or salt or thin Phlegme, thereby insinuating it self into the smallest pars, but it is viscid and clammy, that it may adhere and cleave tenaciously to the parts. It is caused in the Womb of the Mother by the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous blood, or by the corruption or fault of the Milk, or by meats and drinks that are hot, salt, or other things that heat the Liver.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest.</p>
               <p>The Cures are, 1. By attemperating the humours with the Whey of the Milk of Goats, and the Syrrup of <hi>Fumitory.</hi>

A Feaver is an Universal Disease, so is the Small Pox, and a


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35700:33"/>
Consumption, which three Diseases will be considered in this Book.</p>
               <p>Although Feavers and their Causes are common to all Ages, yet in regard In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy is most obnoxious to them, and hath peculiar considerations in the Cure of them; Limiting the strength, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and quantity of the remedy, it will not be altogether improper to call Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Childrens Feavers; Children are subject to Diseases that are accidental, and Symptomatical, proceeding from other Diseases, as in breeding of the Teeth, Inflamation of the Gums, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and also to Feavers essentiall, and of their own accord, and to all sorts of them; but especially a Synoche Feaver, in regard their bodies are hot and moist, their temperament sanguine, and their bodies dense, by which, transpiration of the heat is hindered, which increases and produces a Feaver.</p>
               <p>Children may have a Quartan Feaver though their natural temper be contrary to it; because,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Humours partake aswell of the matter as of the Agent and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body, wherefore as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35700:33"/>
and Excrements of the body do not shew the Temperament (for old men are cold and dry of temper, yet they abound with Phlegme (so do they not only depend on it, but on Diet likewise, which in Children is very often grosse and unorderly eaten, and so Crudities and very thick humours are made.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Mother was elderly and of a Melancholy temper, the menstruous blood, with which the Child was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, may much alter the temper of the Child.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Quartan Feaver is not always made from Melancholy, but may be made from any humour that is thick.</p>
               <p>The Internal Causes are the humours of the body.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are chiefly, 1. The Air, If the Winter be cold and dry, and the Spring hot and moist, bodies cannot be cooled in the Summer, but burn and cause Feavers; besides, in the Summer, Childrens bodies are more thin and spare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unseasonable and immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, being full or empty.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:35700:34"/>
3. Immoderate and ill Diet, whence are Crudities, Obstructions, and Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and so Feavers.</p>
               <p>Presage, All Feavers in Children for the most part are not dangerous, because the natural Faculty is strong and active in them, and can resist powerfully the Causes of Feavers.</p>
               <p>Children sometimes by Feavers have an Hectick Feaver, not by the difficulty of the Curing it, or the greatnesse of the Feaver, but by the morosity of the Child that will not be govern'd.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, If the Child suck, the Nurse is to be cur'd, with such things that alter and purge, as the kind of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seems to require. It is much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how blood is to be lessened in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have Feavers. Some think that after the Fifth Month, Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses may be applied, and blood drawn out by them. Others think not before a year, which opinion is most safe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Age is wont greatly to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by pain and trouble, and Cupping glasses are painful, but after a year Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping glasses may be applied, but only to sanguine and strong Children. And then


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35700:34"/>
not to the part above, but on the Thighs, because the Spirits and strength are not so wasted from those parts, as from above. And only to the taking away an Ounce of blood and no more.</p>
               <p>Besides these remedies, others may be added. Inwardly may be taken the Juice of <hi>Granates</hi> (which is highly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) with <hi>Oxymel</hi> and <hi>Citron.</hi> It may be made thus, Take of the Juice of <hi>Granates</hi> one Ounce, of <hi>Simple Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell</hi> half an Ounce, you may give the Child a Dram at a time unto half an Ounce, but it is better to mixe the lesse quantity of <hi>Oxymel,</hi> because the Childs Nerves are very infirm, and <hi>Oxymel</hi> and all sower things hurt the Nerves, wherefore the Syrrup of <hi>Maidenhair,</hi> Syrrup of <hi>Red Poppies</hi> are good. If the Child is bound in his belly, you may not use purging Medicaments because the Childs body is hot naturally, and is more heated by the Feaver, so it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to add the heat of a purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament, wherefore it is better to use a more gentle Clyster or Suppository. Take of Whey half a pint, of Hony


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35700:35"/>
half an Ounce, of Salt half a Dram, mingle them; make a Suppository of Flesh and Hogs grease, or the common Suppository, for strong Suppositories are dangerous.</p>
               <p>Outward remedies may be used, 1. Things very gentle may be applied to the head or Feet to provoke sweat, as the Root of a Reed; if the Childs body which is Dense be opened by Sweat, the heat and putrid vapours will go forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cloths dipped in <hi>Cichory, Endive, Plantane,</hi> or <hi>Rosewater</hi> applied to the Breast, Side, or Back for cooling.</p>
               <p>The Liver and Stomach ought to be helped in Concoction in all Feavers, much more here, which is done by cooling and binding remedies applied to them. Take of the Oil of <hi>Mastick</hi> half an Ounce, powder of <hi>Red Corall, Sanders,</hi> and <hi>Red Roses,</hi> of each two Scruples, of Wax a little, make an Oyntment of it, but if the Child be between seven and fourteen years, he must be handled in another manner, which shall be set forth in the following Chapter.</p>

               <p>EVery Synoche putrid Feaver in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is from obstruction made by gross humours in hot, moist, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine bodies, and the putrid matter is in all or the greater veins.</p>
               <p>The Cure of it in a Child between 7. and 14. years, will be in removing the obstructions, and tempering the Febrish heat, which will be done by, 1. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Diet, let the Air be cold, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body and mind avoided; if the belly move not, use a Clyster or Suppository; let the Drink be water, or Barly water; the Diet sparing, only Barly broth, or Broth of Meat: But because this will be accounted too strict and hard, to indulge, you may add to the Broth bread, and sometimes the Yelk of an Egge, but be careful you do not nourish too much, because the strength and the Disease are nourish'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The time of eating, let it be


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35700:36"/>
as it was when the Child was well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Blood-letting; Some think that Blood-letting ought not to be before the Child is 14. years old, because that which the opening of a Vein ought to do, nature doth it of its own accord, which consumes daily much of the Childs substance by insensible transpiration, therefore it needs not evacuation, lest the strength be dejected. Others are for Blood-letting, because if a Child can endure a disease from fulnesse, why not the remedy? which is, Blood-letting; otherwise as often as a Disease begins with the imbecility of strength, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which happens out of a natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipation and resolution, so often will that Disease be certain, and necessarily mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: Besides, they which are against Blood-letting allow purges, which are contrary to nature, and is worse then Blood-letting: moreover, they bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table examples for it, as <hi>Avenzoar'</hi>s letting of his son blood at three Months old. In this Feaver, because evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting blood is an excellent remedy, you may in the place of Blood-letting use Leeches which with ease open a vein, and


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35700:36"/>
do not wast the Spirits, they will be most safely safe applied to the Thighs, and also to the Arms: Or you may use Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses, which are not to be used in the upper parts, because they draw humours from the whole body to the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is safer to apply them to the Loyns or Hips, and then they must be oblonge and a narrow mouth, because to draw from profound parts; If you apply them to the Thighes, they are to have a broad mouth, which draws from the parts which are next and remote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Latitude.</p>
               <p>If the Belly be not loose use a Clyster or Suppository, before you use Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses or Leeches, afterwards endevour to remove obstructions by internal and external remedies, that attenuate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terge without any notable heat. Take Barly half a Pugil, the Leaves of <hi>Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop</hi> half an handful, boyl it according to Art; Take of that Decoction two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and an half, of <hi>Simple Oxymel</hi> five Drams, mingle it, and drink it; when you have thus prepared the humours; Purge gently, Take of <hi>Sebestens,</hi> two Drams of Raisins, the Leaves of <hi>Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop,</hi>


                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35700:37"/>
the Flowers of <hi>Borrage</hi> of each one Pugill, make a Decoction accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Art, take thereof three Ounces; of the Hony of Roses solutive, and of <hi>Manna,</hi> of each an Ounce and a half, mingle them; the Purgative Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be lessened or increased as the body requires.</p>
               <p>Outwardly things that open obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are convenient; Such as are gentle, as meal of Barly rubb'd upon the Skin, Barly-water, and a little Oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, cool and moisten the Breast, and prevent the increase of the heat of the Breast. A Bath of fresh Water is very convenient.</p>
               <p>This way may be observed also in a Tertian or Quartan Feaver, respect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had to the humour that is faulty.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Small Pox is a Disease for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35700:37"/>
unknown to the Ancients, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither writ any Book of it, nor described it; and it is not improbable it had a Beginning in our Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as it had in the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> in which parts (it is said by Historians) that in that time in which we were infected by them with the <hi>French Pox</hi> they took from us the <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Meazles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Disease belonging only to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and not to Beasts, not is the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain or Leprosie in Hogs the same Disease with it, as is supposed by some. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Meazles</hi> have the same matter, cause, and Cure, but the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles</hi> are made of the thinner matter, and they differ from the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> in that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Meazles</hi> have little swellings, or that the rising of them can hardly be seen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The matter of them is more dry and subtile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They trouble and affect the eyes lesse then the Pox.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> for the most part


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35700:38"/>
terminates into an Abscessus and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ripened matter, which lasts many days and blemishes the body, but the <hi>Meazles</hi> scarce passeth the seventh day, either then they vanish or are almost wasted, and leave no deformity.</p>
               <p>The Cause as I conceive is not the Impurity of the maternal blood, as by most is supposed, because,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> proceeds for the most part from the fault of the Air and Stars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fault of the menstruous blood was ever since the Sin of <hi>Eve,</hi> and therefore this Disease should have been always, but before the time of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> Physicians, no Author was found that writ of the generation of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, or clearly explain it, which if they had done, they would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from us (it being a great and dangerous Disease) in regard they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in their Books small Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is scarce any man but some time or other hath a greivous Disease which makes an Ebullition or boyling of blood, and putrefaction, until the


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35700:38"/>
body is clensed and purified divers ways, and so the fault from the menstruous blood would be expelled: but it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for it follows immediately other Diseases, and the sanguine man who is most healthy is most troubled. It is granted that the seed of a Disease may lye in part of the body for many years, but the whole blood infected cannot stay long, and resist so many injuries, and if as some think the menstruous blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected should ferment and turn into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill Diseases, as pestilential Feavers, then the rest of the time they would be free from this Evill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sanguineous Beasts that have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous purgation, would have this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as <hi>Bitches, Asses,</hi> and <hi>Mares,</hi> having the matter of the Disease (as menstruous Purgation) and the Agent, (Heat.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. Natures care and wisdome for Preservation, in seperating the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Nourishment in the Womb, the excrements are past into the Tunicles in which the Child is wrapt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after it is born, it purges by stool plentifully, and more then is fit


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35700:39"/>
for its bigness, which is sometimes bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, black and white, and afterwards it hath Sores in the head, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ill humours contracted in the Womb; and though natures care may fail in some, it cannot fail in all. Nor is the cause of this Disease the fault of the Air, as some conceive it to be, because 1. This Disease arises from the Pravity of matter. 2. The quallity of the Air that produces the great effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> would be very strong and powerful, and so young men would not be free from it.</p>
               <p>The true cause is a paternal propriety in the blood and Ichors of it, boyling by heat, which Ichors may be excited in the body divers ways. That the Ichors is the matter, is seen by the 1. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it out into the Skin. 2. All Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noche Feavers arise out of the boyling of the Ichors of blood, which Feaver is always in the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> 3. They are the Ichors (or thin and serosous part of the blood) because they are not sharp, if they were, there would be a concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the body and shaking when they are expelled. That the Disease is made


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35700:39"/>
by the Ichors or thin and serosous and waterish humidity, is manifest, because the humor that goes forth is not a Pus and thick matter; but an Ichor &amp; thin water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish humour, and that it is by Ebullition, appears in the heat, colour, and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that happen. By this we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve our selves, 1. That in our dayes scarce any man but hath this Disease, because it is hereditary, which came first by the fault of the Stars, which affected all, or almost all, and now is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. As <hi>Indians</hi> now generate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with long heads, which in former Ages they endevoured to make by Art, and now is become a natural disposition. 2. This Disease is mortal to some and not to others, by the abundance and badness of humours, and ill constitution of body, that the blood and Ichors boyling, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses an unquenchable Fire and remedilesse putrefaction; besides the badnesse of the Air, and errors in the ordering of the person. 3. They happen most to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, because they are full of blood and thin waterish humidity, and abound with heat, being nearest to the principle of Generation, besides they are given much


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35700:40"/>
Motion. 4. They that have most thin and waterish humours, have most break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out, and the thicker and more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious the humours are, the worse the marks and deformities are. 5. The face is most troubled, because of the Ebullition of the blood, the vapours as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the head, and so impetuously, that neither the Spirits of the head or face, or the Air to which the face is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, can resist; besides, the face is moist and rare, and apt thereby to receive them. 6. The Feet and hands next to the face are chiefly troubled, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Skin is hard, because of the Sympathy between these parts and the Liver, which is seen in a hot Liver by the burning of the hands and feet. 7. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> troubles the eyes more then the <hi>Meazles,</hi> because the matter is thicker, and can be lesse resisted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. 8. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> is contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infectious by the boyling of the blood, which sends vapours at a great distance, which enter into other persons and infect them, as it is in those that have sore eyes, and by the Hereditary Propriety, so that consanguineous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35700:40"/>
are more easily affected in regard of the Similitude of their temper, and for that reason whole Families in a Plague are destroy'd. 8. Some have this Disease twice, very rarely thrice, almost all once, because this Hereditary Disposition only disposes, and continues as long as the Seminary parts in which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted doth remain, which most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is consum'd the first time the Blood is inflam'd, and set on fire, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the second time when the Blood Ferments. 9. Scars and blemishes are left chiefly in the Face, Lips, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin, because the Skin of them is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Flesh, or hath but very little, and therefore difficult to heal.</p>
               <p>The mediate causes of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> are, 1. Internall, hot and moist tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, soft and fat habit of body, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of Age. Boys are more dispos'd to it then Girles, by the disparity of heat in them, boys being hotter. 2. External, hot and moist Air, Southern constitution, Spring time and an hot and moist region, or Contagion, or other things that move, or corrupt the thin and waterish part of the Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:35700:41"/>
By what hath been said, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> may be defin'd to be a disease having Pustules in an outward part of the Skin, with a continual <hi>Feaver,</hi> by the peculiar Effervessency and Ebullition of the Ichorous Blood excited by the expulsive faculty.</p>
               <p>The Signes that this Disease is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and coming, which either immediately accompany the Disease, or proceed it, are Pain in the Neck and Breast, with a heavinesse of the Eyes, Itching of the Nose, Shortnesse of Breath, Suddain trembling and starting, Often Sneesing, Urine sometimes mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, sometimes sound weepings of the Eyes and tears falling of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord from them, a continuall <hi>Feaver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Signes of the Disease present are manifest, being little swellings and spots; in the <hi>Meazles</hi> they are Red and not high; in the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> they first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as the head of an Needle or Pin, immediately after they are greater, and red, and daily increase untill they are ripen'd, grow white, are made an Ulcers and Soars, and are dryed up.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:35700:41"/>
Presage, If the <hi>Small Pox</hi> and <hi>Meazles</hi> are White and a few, appear without any other accident; or if many appear and the <hi>Feaver</hi> is diminish'd and other accidents, and the breathing easie, there is no danger. If the <hi>Small Pox</hi> are black or green, or if few or many appear, and the other accidents are worse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated and the breathing difficult, then it is pernitious and Mortall. They who dye of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> dye either with a Sounding, an Inflamation (with which they are strangled) or a looseness of the Belly, which destroys the strength of the Child.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in, 1. Preserving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward parts, the outward are call'd so because they are seen, and they are the Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Mouth. The internall are Liver, Lungs, and chiefly the Guts; the eyes are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently troubled with heat, and a tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ichor that Exulcerates them, whereby the Children cannot sleep, which is helpt by cooling and moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binding Medicaments, as the water of Roses or Plantain mix'd with <hi>Sumach:</hi> Take of the water of Roses and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35700:42"/>
of each five Ounces, <hi>Sumach</hi> half an Ounce, infuse them all night, and with a little white of an Egge mix them, wet a little Cotten in it, and wet the eye often with it; if there be pain and Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take the water of roses and milk, and add a little Myrrh to them; the scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eyes are to be avoided: If the Ears be pain'd, itch, and run, let them be kept open, if the pain be great, dip a Spunge in hot water with the Oyle of roses, and lay it to the Ear, the scratching whereof is very hurtfull. The Nose is defended from Ulcers if Roses or Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be boil'd in water, and the steam taken in at the Nosthrills. The Mouth is helpt by this <hi>Gargarisme;</hi> Take of the water of Barly one Pint and an half, the leaves of Plantain and Flowers of Roses, of each one Dram, to which you may adde the Juice of <hi>Barbaries</hi> or <hi>Orange,</hi> and wash the mouth with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In helping of nature, in expelling the humour, which is perform'd by, 1. Dyet that is convenient. The Air is to be temperate, or rather somewhat hot, that the Pores may be opened, and the coming forth of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35700:42"/>
therefore let the child be kept in a close room, that the cold Air by no means may come in (by the opposition of the Air, many Children have dyed with a Benigne and gentle <hi>Small Pox,</hi> the matter of the Disease being repercuss'd to the interior Parts; let a red cloth be laid next the Skin, which is conceiv'd by divers to be helpfull by a similitude it hath with the boyling Blood.</p>
               <p>Be carefull your cloathing be not too much, lest the Child be Smothered and Swound; and so provide that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts are rather hot then cold, but that neither the heat of the Air, or weight of Cloathing, encrease the <hi>Feaverish</hi> heat of the Child; and if the tongue waxes black with heat, the breathing is short, and Swounding is fear'd, let some cold water be near the Childs mouth, that he may suck the cold Air in, Sleep is helpfull, but the troubles of the mind (especially Fear) is to be avoided, only a little Anger may be admitted, which help the expelling the humour. If the Belly be bound, a very easie Clyster or Suppository may be used, which doth not hinder the motion of nature, because


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35700:43"/>
they only work in the Guts, and the motion of nature is to the Skin and in the Veins: besides Clysters do not deject us that they may be fear'd, contrary to what some think. Avoid fulnesse and emptinesse, let the body be kept in quiet and rubb'd a little, for it expells the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: let the drink be Barly Water, with the Juice of Limmons or Barberies, or a Decoction of the roots of Sorrell, or a Decoction of Ivory or Hartshorn, especially in the beginning, and whilest the Feaver is vehement. If the Feaver is not very vehement, a Decoction of Barly and Figs will be most convenient, and commonly with successe hath been used by most eminent Physicians, for that effectually expells the humours to the Skin. If Wine be permitted it must be but a little, and in it steep <hi>Lettice, Endive,</hi> or <hi>Sorrell.</hi> Avoid gross meats, Spice, Salt, and Sweet meats, for sweet things destroy, and so doth bitter things, being dry, and contrary to the Childs nature, which is moist, wherefore the meat must be easie to concoct, cooling, as Barly Broth, or Broth in which cooling Hearbs are boyled; and when


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35700:43"/>
the danger is over, you may feed them with Broth and Yelks of Egs put into it, with some Juice of <hi>Limon</hi> or <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> A dried Fig is good meat, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells the humour to the skin. 2. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying of the blood before the Eruption and breaking forth of the Small Pox or Meazles: If the Feaver is great, and there be a fulnesse of blood, then it may be admitted, unlesse the Age is very tender, or something else hinders it. It may not be used upon Children, that are weake, and forbeare the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying of blood in Children before they are 10. Months old, though the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> appoint at five months. The lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of blood ought to be upon the first visit of the Physician, because of the beginning of the Ebullition of the blood, which is commonly then, the Fervour whereof ought to be abated, and nature eased; so that one ought not to stay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the fourth day, but it may be done when one will, before that time and not after. The lessening of blood is done se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, as by letting blood (which ought to be very seldome) Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses or Leeches, the latter is most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35700:44"/>
and one or two may suffice in the place of Cupping-glasses, or opening a Vein. 3. Medicaments, All Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians agree vehement remedies are not to be used, but some think gentle means may be used in the beginning of this Disease; but I conceive that Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may not be used in the beginning, because the operation of it will trouble nature in her work, which is critical (the Physician being called when the blood is boyling) and it is a rule, there is nothing to be done unlesse nature act imperfectly, which cannot be known in the beginning, but a Clyster may be then and at any time used, for that works only on the Guts, as is said a little before. Take a pint of <hi>Barly-water,</hi> 4 Ounces of the Syrrup of Violets, three Ounces of Butter, and an Ounce of red and course Sugar, mingle them for a Clyster, the quantity is to be altered, as the capacity of the Child is. A dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fig is a convenient Suppository, and one made of hony. Where the humour moves forth, and the whole matter comes forth, there no evacuation must be used, for there the Child and all things are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et:


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35700:44"/>
But if the Child is troubled, the trouble may be taken away with a Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Take of <hi>Tamarinds</hi> half an Ounce, <hi>Sebestens</hi> 15. of Barly two drams; of the Flowers of <hi>Borrage, Violets,</hi> and <hi>Roses,</hi> of each a Dram, boyl them in a pint of water to half a pint. Take 4. Ounces of this Decoction, and an Ounce of <hi>Manna</hi> or more, as the Child is. Some think a gentle purge before the eruption, breaking out, and appearance of the Pox and Meazles, if the Child abound with ill humours, and the Feaver rage, may be used, for it lessens the ill humours, that thereby nature doth expel more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if the Small Pox begins to break forth, then a Purge is pernicious and mortall. The rest of the Cure is in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature in expulsion; wherefore if Nature doth not expell readily, and strongly, but slowly, use such a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as cools, binds, and opens. Take of <hi>Lents</hi> one Ounce, of Figs 10. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denhair</hi> two Drams, <hi>Smalledge</hi> roots half an Ounce, <hi>Sorrell</hi> half a handful, boil them in a pint and an half of water to a pint, use it morning and Evening, from four Ounces to six, as the Child is; If


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35700:45"/>
nature expels strongly, omit the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, in regard of the Feaver which is great, and the openings are not then to be used; but when nature expels slowly, which is known by the fewnesse and slownesse of their coming forth, This expels. Take of <hi>Lents</hi> two drams, of Figs fifteen, of Barly one dram, of Lettice and Sorrell of each an handful, boyl them in a pint and an half of water to a pint, use 6, 7, or 8. Ounces of it Morning and Evening, as the Child is: Note, that <hi>Lents</hi> boyled alone loosens the Belly, from whence are mortal Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor it is not to be used alone for a remedy, because of its thickness and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding qualities. Take of French Barly one Pugil, slic'd Liquorish half a dram, red <hi>Cicers</hi> one dram, of the greater <hi>Cold seeds</hi> of each half a dram, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Flowers of each one Pugill, three Figs, boyl them well in water to 6 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after it is strained dissolve in it half an Ounce of the Syrrup of <hi>Granat</hi> which is to be taken at twice, it is very good; it mitigates and tempers the Feaver. These that follow are also good to expell, as Confection of <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynth,</hi>


                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:35700:45"/>

Observe that Medicaments that are Cordials and expelling, are to be used from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and first coming forth of the Small Pox, to the Eleventh day, which some call the increase and state of Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ebullition. If the Scabs dry not of themselves, and have matter in them, and are ripe, they are not to be opened, unlesse they be malignant, for if they be ripe and white, their heat and fervour, and eating of the flesh is gone, and they will dry and fall of themselves, and so there is no danger of its putrefying and leaving holes and marks. If the Scabs drye not of themselves fast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, use <hi>Aloes, Litharidge, Cerusse,</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> and wash them in salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which Plantain, Roses, or some other drying thing is, that may take away the acrimony of the Salt. If they do not ripen fast enough, boil Figs and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes together, and dip a Cloth in it, and


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35700:46"/>
touch them often with it being warm, it mitigates pain and ripens them. In the end of the Disease the Scabs sometimes turn into Ulcers, which are cur'd with the Ointment of <hi>Litharidge</hi> and <hi>Cerusse,</hi> and an ill colour is left, which is taken away thus. Take of <hi>Lupine</hi> Barly and Beans of each two Drams, bruise them and boil them in a convenient quantity of water until it is thick, and with it wash morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening the Childs hands and face, until the Scales fall off. The Scars and holes left by the <hi>Pox</hi> is hardly curea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the fat of a man, and the Oil of Egs is very much commended.</p>

               <head>Chap. IV. <hi>Of the Consumption.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Consumption is called Leanness, Gracility, and Tenuity. If it be considered as an habit and a certain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and permanent state of the body, and as hurting the Actions of the body, it is a Disease; if as it depends on a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated Nutrition, and as a simple Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35700:46"/>
then it is rather to be called a Symptome and an effect of a Disease.</p>
               <p>A Consumption is an Extabescency and Exiccation of the whole body, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from a want of nourishing of the body.</p>
               <p>The Subject is the whole body, the harder part whereof may be dried and diminish'd, the Veins and Nerves may be so extenuated, that they may seem to be much lesse, that a great vein may seem to be a little vein, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but these parts cannot be so lessened as that the whole body should decrease, wherefore the whole body is said to be extenuated in respect of the more soft parts, as the fat and flesh; the fat is first consumed because it is caused by cold, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is concreted by cold (unlesse it be vehement) is easily dissolved by heat. Moreover, fat hath scarce any other use but to preserve the natural heat. After the fat, the flesh is consumed, which is as a bond of the Constitution of mans Body, but not necessary to Life; but the seminary parts, as Veins, Nerves, Arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the foundation of Life, and cannot be consumed with the


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35700:47"/>
preservation of Life as the flesh can be which is not necessary for Life; and it is of three sorts 1. Musculous, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of Veins, Membranes, and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; 2. Glandulous, as that of the Breast anp Testicles. 3. Pure Flesh, as that which is between the Teeth, and in the top of the Yard. These three sorts of Flesh consume in this order. First the the Musculous Flesh. Secondly, the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and last of all the pure flesh.</p>
               <p>The immediate cause of this Disease, is the frustration of nourishing, either by the fault, 1. of the Aliment, being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and too little or vitious, that it is not assimilated, or attracted by the parts of the Body; 2. or fault of the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty, when the naturall heat and radicall moisture is Defective. The nourishment and food is too little, when the appetite in the Stomach and other parts is wanting (as in an Universal weaknesse, or) when it is not distributed, the Meseraick Veins by their drynesse are often so shut and close, that the Chile cannot passe from the Stomach into the rest of the Body, and so the parts are extenuated. So likewise as often as


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35700:47"/>
the meat is prepar'd and sent another way, there is Leannesse as in Vomiting and Fluxes, so it is by worms consuming the nourishment that ought to be turned into flesh. The Blood is faulty &amp; cause of Leanness when it is too Melancholical, for where the Spleen flourishes the rest of the body growes Lean, and where the rest of the body consumes, the Spleen growes: So likewise when the Blood is too Cholerick, for then it is offensive to nature, for no blood can be turn'd into the substance of the body that hath Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler mixt with it, or if it be waterish, whereby bodies also consume, as in Dropsies; so likewise if the blood be Salt, leannesse is caused, for Salt things are Earthy, Dry and contrary to nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dry the body and is not assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated, and therefore consume and extenuate directly and naturally; by accident Salt may conduce to nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by exciting an Appetite, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing the Food, but naturally it is contrary to nourishment, insomuch that some have Writ that Fishes are not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd with Water or Juyces that are Salt, but with sweet things, or other things that


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35700:48"/>
are found in the Sea. Nourishment is also hindered by the fault or distemper of the Part that should assimilate the nourishment, when it is too dry; so it happens to old walls to which Lime cannot be agglutinated by reason of the great drynesse of it: Moreover, Leanness is also made by causes that dissolve the fat and flesh, as great <hi>Feavers</hi> do; but in Children it is caused for the most part by the defect of nourishment, being either too little or vitious and unusefull, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the fault of the milk; (wherefore it is, that Children by one Nurse fattens, and consume by another) or Worms destroying their nourishment; and sometimes by a distemper of some principall part, as the Stomach, Liver, or Heart, and it is observ'd that an old and contumations and native consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be, without the Liver be affected and the temperament dry, but that which is new may be from any one of the causes aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The external causes of a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are a hot or dry Air, hence it is that most <hi>Aethiopians</hi> are lean and most men consume in Summer, Watching and Care


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35700:48"/>
consumes a Body and as it were eats it; Meditation, Grief, Study, Immoderate Venery, natural Bathes that drye, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Food and feeding once a day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume men and Children, of which quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are sharp things. It is also conceived that Children by reason of the softnesse and tendernesse of their body grow lean and consume by Fascination, proceeding from their touching unhealthy bodies, or the unwholsome vapours out of the Eyes or Mouthes of Women not well; which truely is not Fascination, for Witchcraft is rather the work of the Devil, then by any proper power of the Sages.</p>
               <p>The Signs of a Consumption are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, for the Flesh and Fat are visibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd, the face like one that is dead, and the figure of the whole hody deprav'd. If it is from a cause that melts and dissolves the Fat and Flesh, there was or is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Feaver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If from want of food, it is known in elder Children by their not taking what is necessary; in Sucking Children, by the Flagginess and Emptiness of the Nurses Breast, the ill dyet of Nurses, the Child


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35700:49"/>
pisses little and doth not wet his Cloaths, cryes and Sucks eagerly. If the want of food is the cause, because nourishment goes into other parts, it is known by the loosness of the Belly, plenty of Urine and worms. If the defect is, because the meat is not exactly prepar'd in the Stomach, there is belching of Wind, Vomiting, and want of Appetite, or some hot distemper. If from the fault of food, if in Infants, the Nurses milk is not good (for milk is made of food) by the colour and ill constitution of the Nurse it is easily known, if the Milk is bad, it will not be very white, have an ill taste, not sweet, of an ill smell, and more thick and fluid then it ought to be. The thickness and thinnesse of the Milk is known, if some Milk is Milk'd upon the Nail of the Thombe, and if it presently runs off, it is too thin, if it stayes and moves not off, it is too thick; Or if you curdle it, the whey and curds ought to be equall, else it is to thin or to thick, besides if the Milk be thin andsharp, the Child is troubled with Pain, loosenesse, and very ill breakings out. If the milk is thick, the Child is costive and there are little Inflamations,


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35700:49"/>
Swellings and Vomitings, they pisse lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, move and breath with difficulty, and are full of Phlegm.</p>
               <p>In those that are elder, the badnesse of food is known by the colour of the Skin and out-side of the body, wherefore if the countenance be ill colour'd, scabby or pimpell'd; or if any other part is weak, as the head Stomach or Liver; or if their be any infirmities, distempers or passions of mind, it is certain the Leanness is from the fault of the food. Also it happens by the weaknesse from some Disease. If these things had not been, the Child would have had a florid and fresh colour, good appetite, and would eat and not complain. If Leannesse be from Fascina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no art or natural means is effectual, and there is no internal or external cause of Leannesse in regard of the Nurse or Child.</p>
               <p>Presage, 1. All Suddain Leannesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a <hi>Feaver</hi> is mortal, because of the Vehemency of the cause, weakness of the strength, tenuity of the humour, and laxity of the whole Body. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions that are seldome and not from <hi>Feavers,</hi> especially those that are great


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35700:50"/>
and ill, are sometimes cureable. 3. Lean bodies that are moist and have a moist Skin may be made fat, because all soft bodies are apt and fit to be extended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any dimension. 4. Bodies that are dry and have their Skin hard and rough, can scarce be fatned. 5. Bodies that have the Skin dry and cleaving to the bones, that neither by the hand nor Art can be stretch'd out, there is no hope of fatning them; but if the Skin be wrinkled and rugged so that it may be drawn forth, and as it were seperated from the bones, there is some hope of making them fat.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. in Children that suck, if the Milk be too little or bad, change the Nurse and choose one who hath good Milk, the notes whereof you have before, let her be of a good constitution, of a white and red colour, of a good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and behaviour, not under 20. nor above 40. years old, having had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren twice, and being not above 2 or 3 moneths from her last delivery, broad chested, having breasts neither big nor small, but moderate. If the Nurse may not be chang'd, let her be in a temperate


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35700:50"/>
Air, let her Sleep well, it augments Milk, let her avoid Passions, especially Anger, Grief, and Love, (for they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Milk) and congresse with a man spoils the Milk, or provokes the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous Flux that the Milk is lessened. A Nurse that lives with her husband is allowed coition and congresse with him, lest She be disturbed by desire of it, and by experience we see that Mothers that live with their Husbands, and use con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, Nurse the Child without any hurt. The Nurse ought to use moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive, rubbing of her bosome and breasts before she eats is convenient, let her not drink, or very little, and that which is sweet which lest offends the head, lest by increasing Milk the Child hath the <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sicknesse;</hi> The meat ought to be of a good and plentifull nourishment, avoiding sharp, salt and bitter things, the best bread, the Flesh of Birds, Veal, Mutton, and the like, Fish is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, Broath especially, with the Milk of Almonds increase Milk. If the Milk be faulty by the coldnesse, moisture and thinnesse of it, the Dyet must be hot for the correcting of it. If the Nurses bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35700:51"/>
abound with cold and moist humours, prepare and purge them, but with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Purgatives, as the Syrrup of Roses or <hi>Rhabarbe,</hi> whose weak vertues are extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd before they are communicated to the blood; if you purge strongly, let not the Child suck the Nurse two or three days after. If the Milk is too thick the Diet is to be attenuating, <hi>Vinegar, Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishes</hi> and the like are good, a gentle Vomit is more convenient then a Purge. If the Milk be sharp and hot, the Nurse is to be kept in a cold Air, Rest, Baths of fresh water are convenient, Wine is hurtful; let the meat be Barly broth, with cooling Herbs, especially <hi>Lettice,</hi> which cools and thickens the blood, and increases Milk, avoiding salt, and things acrimonious, and Spices.</p>
               <p>If the fault be not in the Milk, but in some part of the Infant, the Nurse is to be dieted and purged, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is to take no inward Medicament, but external, because these Ages bears not vehement Medicaments, wherefore external remedies are only to be used; and therefore if the Childs Stomach be cold and moist, hot or dry Plaisters,


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35700:51"/>
Bathings, and Oyntments are to be used, for the correcting of them. Take the Leaves of <hi>Marjoram, Mint,</hi> of each one handful, the Aromatick Reed, and the Flowers of red roses, of each half a handful, the water of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint one Pint, of Sweet Wine two Ounces, boyle them well, and with a Cloth dipp'd in it, bath the Stomach if it be cold; Afterwards annoint it with this: Take the Oyl of <hi>Mastick</hi> half an Ounce, the Powder of <hi>Cinamon</hi> and <hi>Cloves</hi> of each half a Dram, mixe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wax with them, and make an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If the Stomach be dry, bath it with Milk, and annoint it with this. Take fresh Butter, the fat of an Hen, of each half an Ounce, <hi>Saffron</hi> four grains, the Oyl of <hi>Wormwood</hi> three Ounces, mingle them and make a Liniament. If the Leannesse is from heat, Take <hi>Cichory, Endive, Water-lilly,</hi> and <hi>Wormwood</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of each four Ounces, <hi>Vinegar</hi> two Ounces, make a fomentation for the Liver, afterwards annoint the side with this: Take of the Oyntment of <hi>Sanders, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hory,</hi> and <hi>Liverwort</hi> waters of each two Ounces, of the <hi>Vinegar</hi> of <hi>Roses,</hi>


                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:35700:52"/>
one Ounce, make a Liniament. If Leanness is from Loosness, the Nurse is to use binding meats, as <hi>Quinces, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, Rice, Medlers,</hi> or Broth of an old Hen, and Calves feet, Corral or Jaspers Stone hung about the childs neck is convenient. So is this, Take of <hi>Mirrh</hi> and <hi>Quince</hi> of each half an Ounce, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Red Coral two Ounces, of <hi>Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi> two Ounces, the powder of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> and <hi>Tormentill,</hi> of each half a Dram, mingle them, and make a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niament, the senting of the Clothes with Fumes of things that are binding, are also convenient. If Leannesse arise from the drynesse of the whole body, use Bathing with fresh water, in which are boyled <hi>Mallowes, Lettice, Water-Lillies,</hi> or <hi>Endive;</hi> and a Liniament may he made of the Oyl of <hi>Roses, Violets, Butter</hi> without Salt, and Hogs grease; Clysters are also good in these cases made of Milk, or Bread boyled in broth, or made of Eggs, because they may nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Children, being they are next to Generation, that is, the state which they had in the womb, in which they were nourish'd by the Navil, without the


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35700:52"/>
Concoction and preparation of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Observe, that Plaisters to draw nourishments to the parts, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Children, because their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are as Wax, and that sort of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the heat of it, doth enervate and wast the flesh of Infants.</p>
               <p>If the Child is bewitcht, a Saphir or Carbuncle hung about the Childs Neck is conceived good; so is Hartsthorn hung in the house, and many more which I omit as superstitious or false.</p>
               <p>If the Child doth not suck, but is nourish'd with solid Meats, then the Cure is by removing, 1. The External Cause, or the Internal Disease (if it be the cause of it) caused by proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to it. Afterwards, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a good Nourishment distributed and assimulated, which is done by a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Diet. Let the Air be temperate and moist, heat hurts, and be careful the Child is not Clothed too hot; Let the sleep be long, the mind quiet, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise moderate, and that which is slow, fatness and swift exercise consumes, the Belly moderately loose, Baths used sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably, Wine that is thin (thick Wine

obstructs, and is not vehicle for the meat) Odoriferous, somewhat sweet, not sharp, but very moderately used. The Meat nourishing somewhat fatty, Juicy, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther salt nor acide (unless it be to provoke a Stomach) as the Flesh of Fowl, Veal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eggs, the Brains of a Calf, or Hog-bread boyled in Broth, Rice boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Milk. Parsnip steep'd in Milk, Raisins, and Almonds. Besides these, there are meats that fatten either by a quality, 1. Manifest, by helping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, as Spices, by being gratefu to the Stomach, and increasing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat of it, as <hi>Cinamon, Cloves,</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs.</hi> Take the Pulpe of a boyled <hi>Capon</hi> and <hi>Patridge,</hi> of each half an Ounce, of the Pine Kernell, <hi>Pistack</hi> Nut steep'd in <hi>Mallagoe</hi> Wine half an Ounce, of Sweet <hi>Almonds</hi> an Ounce, <hi>Cinamon, Clove,</hi> and <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> of each an Ounce, and an half; Fine Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as much as suffices; make <hi>Lozenges,</hi> they are pleasant and fatten much, or by apposing and fastning the meat, as all Diureticks and Diaphereticks do which opens the wayes and carries the nourishment to the parts: So doth


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35700:53"/>
Drinking likewise between Meals, or by apposing and fastning the meat to the parts by their tenacious and viscid humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, which humidity in hot and drye bodies is to be cold, and in cold bodies, hot: 2. By a Propriety and an occult quality, as <hi>Sarcocolla;</hi> now the <hi>Indian</hi> Nut is in great use, the Marrow whereof being finely bruised, an Ounce, or two, or half an Ounce, is mix'd with broth. Take of sweet Wafers and <hi>Sarcocolla</hi> of each one pound, make a past with But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and drye them; then powder it, and use five Ounces in cold water. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve cold water is praised by many, and cold meats, but this is by a manifest quality, and good where Leanesse is by the great heat of the Liver.</p>

parts of the body, but in regard Children especially before 7. years of Age have not the use of reason, reason being as it were drowned and drunk with moisture and humours, which made one say, the Souls of Children differ nothing from the Souls of Beasts, for whilst we are Infants we all live the Lives of Beast, using only the faculties of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Animal Souls, therefore the faults of the Actions of the rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty (as Phrenzy and Madness) are not considered by Physicians amongst Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Diseases, which likewise I omit in this Book.</p>
               <p>The Epilepsy hath several Names, I shall only mention three of them here. It is called, 1. A Childs Disease, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Children are most frequently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with it, by the cold distemper and large moisture of the Brain. 2. An holy and divine Disease, so divers of the Ancients testifie in their Writings. 3. Lunatick (26. <hi>Matth.</hi> the Lunatick there was the same with this) because as one excellently says, they who are conceived in the change of the Moon, when the Moon is in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35700:55"/>
with the Sun, without Light, they have the Falling Sicknesse.</p>
               <p>The Falling Sicknesse is a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral involuntary and intermitting contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and retraction of all the Muscles and Nerves.</p>
               <p>The mediate cause of an Epilepsy by consent, is a Vapour raised from the lower parts, to the head (which some think is but seldome) whether it be from fear, corrupted Milk in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Worms, breeding of Teeth, the Small Pox, Meazles, or Feavers.</p>
               <p>The immediate Cause of the Falling Sickness, when the Brain is primarily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, is a thin humour or vapour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is made and gone quickly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter of it must be such as may go away and return quickly, which cannot be in a thick humour, which must be dissolved by concoction, which is done in time and not suddenly; which vapour or thin humour, by a peculiar vertue, doth prick the Membrane of the Brain, and part where the Nerves begins, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Constriction of the passages, and exciting the sensible parts to an Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of what is hurtful, thence is the


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35700:55"/>
shutting out and Retraction of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sique Spirits, and by a defect of them, follows a diminution, or cessation, or abolition of the Actions of the mind, and thereby all the parts of the body have a convulsive motion.</p>
               <p>A cold and moist temper of the Body, hereditary Disposition, and the Nativity being in the Eclipse of the Moon, are Dispositions to this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</p>
               <p>The external Causes are, 1. Things which administer matter, as grosse and vaporous meat, as old <hi>Pigeons, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Eales,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Things that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it, as Moon-shine, the smell of stinking things, also great fear, and tickling.</p>
               <p>Signs of the coming of it in children are because the Child is born of Parents that have the Falling Sicknesse; in those that are elder, Pains of neck, back, heart, fears, and inordinate motions in the sleep, often spitting.</p>
               <p>Signs of the Paroxysme, and when it is upon the Child, are as 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> a noise crying out, falls in the fire, foames out of his mouth, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

sense, so was the Child cur'd by Christ in the Chapter aforesaid, but that Child was Epileptick and possest with a Devil, as one learnedly sayes, or as another sayes, the Child was Epileptick, but the Disease made in him by the Evil of the Divel. The froth in the mouth, is made, because the Spirits, and Fume which come from the Lungs is mixt with the Spittle and Phlegme that comes from the head, which moved and exagitated to and fro turns into froth, as the Sea-water agitated and broken with many winds.

2. Those that are once cur'd, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again Epileptick, because the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive faculty continually expells, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of humours the same way it did when the Disease was removed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it cannot be gathered into the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to offend.</p>

               <p>If it happen after the change of Age, that is after 25. years, it is most difficult and impossible to cure, because then the faculties are strong, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genited moisture lessned, &amp; cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the cause of the Disease, which is very powerful and as it produceth it can preserve the Disease; and because the humours which makes the Episepsy, are Melancholy and dry, and so difficult of


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35700:57"/>
themselves to be taken away, and daily increase by Age.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. A convenient Diet, which belongs to the Nurse, for a suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Child, and the same is to be used by a Child that doth not suck; You are to choose and prepare the Air to be hot and dry, they that live in cold Countries, their Children are often Epileptick, use moderate sleep, for this Disease is as it were asleep; avoid unseasonable exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, fears, and frighting (which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought the Disease) Bathes, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are hurtful, so is much fasting, it fills the head. So Wine hurts the Nerves, and is to be avoided, the Drink is to be such that heats, but not hurting the head, the meat hot and attenuating, which hath cur'd many: but that which breeds gross humours, is windy, and with a certain propriety offends the head, is to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Child suck, and the Disease be by consent from the Stomach (which is most frequent) being oppress'd with too much Milk, let the Child suck seldome; Or from the ill quality and sharpnesse of the Milk, correct the Milk and apply


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35700:57"/>
this Plaister to the Stomach, Take of the Powder of <hi>Aloes</hi> and <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> of each half a Scruple, the Powder of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> one Scruple, and mingle them with a little <hi>Wax</hi> and <hi>Rosine,</hi> and apply it to the mouth of the Childs Stomach. If it be by the fault onely in the head, which is most frequently, the use of <hi>Hony</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. Take of <hi>Paeony</hi> half a Scruple, of the Leaves of <hi>Stocados</hi> and <hi>Betony</hi> half a Pugill, <hi>Cyperus</hi> one Scruple, powder them finely, put of this Powder in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spoon, and put it into the Childs mouth and presently give him the Breast, that he may Swallow the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Seton</hi> in the neck is very profitable, so is the following Powder sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the head: Take <hi>Maidenhair, Cypresse, Iridis</hi> of each two Drams, <hi>Cloves</hi> one Scruple, powder them finely and mix them.

                  <hi>Paeony</hi> and <hi>Smaradge</hi> is much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be hung about the Childs neck that it may reach to the Stomach.</p>
               <p>If the Child be somewhat great, and the Epilepsy be by consent, and from other parts sending a thin humour or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour to the brain, Purge him as he is able to suffer and alter the distemper of the part. If it be outwardly in the Arm, Thigh, Hip, or other part, rubbing is good and a discutient Plaister applyed to the part, then if it will not do, Blister the part. If the Disease be by the fault only of the head, use first this Clyster, Take of the lesser <hi>Centaury</hi> half an handfull, of <hi>Mallowes</hi> one handfull, of <hi>Bran</hi> tyed in a Cloth half a Pugill, boyle them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art, Take of that Decoction 8 Ounces, of <hi>Hony</hi> an Ounce and half, of <hi>Chamomile</hi> 2 Ounces and an half, of <hi>Salt,</hi> half a Dram; mingle them and make a Clyster, then prepare the humours, Take of the Leaves of <hi>Stocados, Betony,</hi> of each half a handfull, the seed of <hi>Paeony</hi> one Dram, boyle them according to Art, Take of that Decoction 3 Ounces more or lesse, as the Childs age will bear, of the Syrrup of <hi>Stocados</hi> and <hi>Oxymel,</hi>

Simple, of each half an Ounce, mingle. When the humors are prepared, then Purge; but although this Disease require vehement remedies, yet they are not to be used, by reason of the Age. Two Scruples of <hi>Pillulae Aureae</hi> are sufficient; or take of the <hi>Trochische</hi> of <hi>Agarick</hi> two Drams, infuse it all night in two Ounces of <hi>Betony-water,</hi> strain it hard, then add two Ounces of the <hi>Hony</hi> of Roses solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the Electuary <hi>di Psillie</hi> one Dram, mingle and make a Potion: this Disease many times appears not in two or three moneths and is very stubborn, therefore for the perfect curing it, Take of <hi>Guya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> two Ounces, of the Water of <hi>Betony</hi> two pints, infuse it 24. hours, and boyle them to the consumption of a third part, and in the end add two Drams of the seed of <hi>Paeony</hi> finely powdered, of <hi>Oak Misselto</hi> one Dram and half, of <hi>Coriander-seed</hi> one Dram, afterwards Strain it and make a Syrrup of it, then take the same <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acum</hi> and put four pints of common water to it, and boyle the fourth part away, and in the end add two Ounces of <hi>Anniseed,</hi> and use it as ordinary drink, and give of the Syrrup three or four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Convulsion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>CHildren often fall into a Convulsion by the weakness of the Nerves, plentiful use of thick Milk, Crudities, and by breeding of Teeth.</p>
               <p>The matter of it is the same as is in the Falling Sicknesse, and it is very like to it, so that an Eminent Physician said a Convulsion was an Epilepsie of a part, and an Epilepsy a Convulsion of the whole body, both being a Contraction of the Muscles: but they differ one from another, because in an Epilepsy the Internal and External senses are hurt; but in a Convulsion the Brain is not so affected, and the sense is not lost: in the Epilepsy the matter in the Muscles is quickly discuss'd, in the Convulsion not, which is only also a contraction of the part, but the Epilepsy is a Convulsion of the whole body.</p>
               <p>A Convulsion is a preternatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of one or many parts of the


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35700:60"/>
body: If it be a Contraction of the Anteriour parts of the Neck towards, it is called <hi>Emprostonos,</hi> or a Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts before us; If the hinder parts <hi>Opistotonos;</hi> if both the hinder and anterior parts are contracted, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tetanos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cause of a Convulsion, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is when the knawing or pricking of the Mouth, or Stomach, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, hurts the beginning of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Cause of an essential Convulsion is either repletion or exiccation, for as strings fil'd with too much humour, or are too much dryed, they are contracted and break, so it is with the Nerves, if they imbibe too much humor, they grow broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and shorter, and so contract; and if to drye they shrink up. Repletion is from a Phlegmatick humour; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iccation and dryness, is from a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Feaver, which doth not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally dry the whole body, but wast the Nerves more then the flesh, and that violently; So that though a Hectick Feaver doth very much drye the body, yet it produces no Convulsion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35700:60"/>
the dryness is made leisurely and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily in all parts, so that the Nerves are not dryed with any great vehemence. Some saye that this dryness proceeds from any immoderate evacuation, or things that vehemently heat and dry.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are a moist Air, wherefore Children have the Convulsion most often in the full of the Moon, the Air being the most moist, hurting the Nerves of the Child, Watching, Fear, which making the Spirits retire, the Nerves are contracted; Bathes, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiveness, and binding of the Belly, Drinking of strong Wine, Milk plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully taken, or thick, crying, the ill Diet of the Nurse, and from other parts.</p>
               <p>Signs are manifest, if it be made by consent, it is in a moment; if by essence, it is always; if from repletion, it is made suddenly, and in a small time; if by dryness and inanition, it is caused by degrees, and in a longer time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The Convulsion that begins from the back is mortal.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Convulsions in Children are more easily cur'd then in men, because their humidity is Airy, and is easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Convulsions from a perfect and consummated drynesse is incureable, but that which is not from a perfect dryness is cureable, which as the dryness is more or lesse, is easier, or with more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
               <p>The Cure of a Convulsion from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion and moisture, is the same as in an Epilepsy. The Members and parts contracted are to be restored gently by hands to its straightnesse, then annoint and rub the part with a convenient Oyl, as of Lillies or Cammomile; The Syrrup of <hi>Betony</hi> and <hi>Staecados,</hi> with the Spirit of Black Cherries, may be used; <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus</hi> Water is very good. If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion is from drynesse, the Cure is by moistning of the body by Diet, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, a Bath that is hot and moist is convenient; and annointing the part with the Oyle of sweet Almonds, sweet Butter, and such things that soften and moisten.</p>

               <p>IN the two preceeding Chapters were considered the depravation of Motion; in this place the Abolition and diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of motion will be discoursed of; not abolition of the whole body, for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are never troubled with a universal Palsy and privation of sense and motion in the whole body, which is called an Appoplexy, appears by experience and observation; and Apoplexies are made for the most part from 40. years to 60.</p>
               <p>Although Children have often the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sicknesse, which hath the same matter and part affected, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, and differs from an Apoplexy, because it is a Privation of motion, and an Epilepsy the Depravation: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless a Child is not troubled with the Apoplexy, not because it proceeds from a Melancholy humour, as some think, which a Child hath not, which is untrue; for a Child may have a Quartan


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35700:62"/>
Ague, which is caused by Melancholy, as you may see in the Chapter of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but because the matter in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsy is not so thick, as that which makes the Apoplexy, being only Phlegme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Phlegme of Children is Airy and flatulent; Moreover the expulsive faculty of the Brain is strong in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, so that it more effectually expells the humour, that it stop not the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Brain, which happens not in those Ages in which the humour is thick and lesse flatulent, and the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive faculty more weak.</p>
               <p>A Numness and Palsy, is a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the same kind, and differ only in degree, for a Numness is but as it were an imperfect Palsy, and a Palsy is as it were a certain great Numness.</p>
               <p>The cause is a pituitous humour which by coldness &amp; moistness thickens &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs the Nerves, that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the animal Spirits, or Influence of thea nimal faculty; &amp; as this obstruction and condensation of the nerves and ways of the faculties is more or lesse, so it makes numnesse or weak motion or want of motion. In a <hi>Palsy</hi> there is no motion


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35700:62"/>
because the wayes of the faculties are totally stopt, in a numnesse they are not stopt completely, therefore the faculty operates, and there is a weak motion.</p>
               <p>The external causes are compressions by falls, blowes, binding tumours or other causes which can compresse and condensate the nerves that a free ingresse of the faculty is hindered.</p>
               <p>Signs, if a part is affected with the <hi>Palsy</hi> it cannot move, and is called the <hi>Dead Palsy;</hi> if with numnesse, the party can move but weakly and with difficulty. If the Disease be in the <hi>Spinalis medulla</hi> the Arms and all the inferiour parts are hurt; if the right part of it is affected, all the parts on the right side, if the left, the left parts. If in the <hi>Osse sacro</hi> the parts above it are well and the parts inferiour to it are hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> every <hi>Palsy</hi> especially that which is inveterate is difficult to cure in Children but numnesse is more easie to cure.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Feaver</hi> or trembling comes upon a <hi>Palsy</hi> or numnesse it is very helpfull, for the <hi>Feaver</hi> dissolves the matter of the Disease and the trembling drives the

               <p>The Cure is the same as in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsy and Convulsion, and greater reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to be used to the <hi>Palsy</hi> then Numnesse: Take of Earth, worms a large quantity, burn them in a clean pot, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards let them be powdered, take of that powder half a pound, of <hi>Ginger</hi> and and <hi>Galangle</hi> of each half an Ounce, make a Liniament of them with clarified hony with which annoynt the Child three nights, binding his Arm upon his Belly and covering well the Child, and beware that the Child is not expos'd to the cold unto the third day; &amp; so in three days the Child will be cured either of the <hi>Palsy</hi> or <hi>Convulsion</hi> as divers affirm.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35700:63"/>
sense, which in Children are Dreams and immoderate Watching.</p>
               <p>Children never sleep moderately, for they are opprest with sleep in the womb and after they are born they sleep for the most part, because the infant is mindfull of the perpetual sleep he had in the Womb and because his body is very moist, not only by the abounding with humours, but by the sollid parts being moist and soft, the want whereof in old men and their having sollid and dry parts of their heads (though they abound with humours) makes them most watchfull. 2. But this sleep is natural, but when sleep which should be for the restoring of the spirits and natural heat consumed by watching, is unquiet, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and terrifying, this is a distemper hapenning to Children here intended. Disturb'd sleep is an effect in the kind of depraved actions of the Common sense.</p>
               <p>This distemper in an infant is like to the <hi>Incubus</hi> or <hi>Night-mare</hi> in these that are elder, and as that foreruns an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy,</hi> so terrifying dreams are Signes of an Epilepsy and other ill Diseases.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:35700:64"/>
The internal cause is a corrupted meat in the Stomach, they are made in Children by the debility of the Stomach, (from which arises sad Phantasies, for as men are sad and troubled as often as the Stomach is grieved) and the notable sense of the mouth of it; the manner of it is this, Melancholly arises out of the corrupted meat of the Stomach whose Phantasmes are carryed to the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they necessarily deterre and consequently make terrifying Dreams, which are the operations of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Phantasmes offered from the senses.</p>
               <p>The externall cause is milk or meat corrupted, and by its acrimony knawing the mouth of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>Signs are the groaning of Children, shaking, crying out of Children in their sleep, an unnaturall colour and heat and a stinking breath, by which many are deceived and think they have the worms.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, if the Milk be bad from the constitution of the Nurse change her, if from dyet, correct it, if it be good, it is vitiated and corrupted in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach by the plenty of it, therefore let


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35700:64"/>
the Child suck lesse. If the Child suck not, let him not eat too much nor bad meat, and remove what is corrupted in the Stomach, to this end the giving of hony to Children is commended because it clenses the Stomach and Guts. A Suppository is convenient, so is a Clyster; Take of whey six or eight Ounces, of Hony an Ounce and half, Salt a scruple; mingle them and make a Clister. If the Child be somewhat big <hi>Hiera Pietra</hi> may be used which wonderfully clears the Stomach, which being done, the Stomach is to be comforted with half a Scruple of the powder called <hi>Diamosce,</hi> or as much of <hi>London Treacle,</hi> may be used by the Child; or take of the <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Diamoschi</hi> one Scruple, of <hi>Diacalamint</hi> one Scruple and half, Sugar and Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water as much as suffices to make them into small Lozenges, one whereof pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered may be given every morning in Milk and suck presently after it. If the Child is wean'd, give it powdered in Broth or Milk.</p>
               <p>Outwardly Ointments comforts the Stomach, annoint it with the oyle of <hi>Wormwood, Mint, Nutmegs,</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick,</hi>

               <p>The cause is not drynesse, as in men but the corruption of the Milk and meat in the Stomach, from which sharp va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ascend to the brain and offending the Membrane hinder sleep.

               <p>IN regard the Diseases of the Sight and Hearing in Children have nothing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them from the same Diseases in men, they are here omitted, and the Diseases belonging to the natural faculty of the Head considered.</p>
               <p>This Disease is called by a Word deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from another Greek word, which the Latins interpret a Hole, because the Head is perceived as it were excava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made hollow, in the former part of the Head; it is called by some the heat and burning of the head.</p>
               <p>It is an Inflamation of the parts about the Brain and the Membranes.</p>
               <p>The Cause is a humour, whilest it putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, it doth resemble the nature of Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, not that it is true pure Choler, because it cannot be imagin'd how heat, before the Disease or in it, can make the most hot humour (as Choler is) in the head


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35700:66"/>
that is moist and almost water nor pure Phlegme, because it is cold and moist, and the humidities of Children are hot, therefore old men waxe gray, because they abound with Phlegme; Children not, because they abound not with Phlegme that is cold and moist.</p>
               <p>The External causes are a very hot Air, blows, falls, Milk that is very hot, by the Nursés using hot drinks; Milk hath the power of making one drunk, and one observes well, tender Kids of Goats are made mad with Milk, and there is no doubt but the tender Brain of Children are much offended by the Milk of Nurses.</p>
               <p>The Signs are, the Hole and cavity of the Anterior part of the head, because the heat of the Inflammation dries the Brain, which being drye, the Skull is deprest, and sunk with its own weight and makes a hollownesse of the eyes; by the same cause is a heat of the whole body and dryness, continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, palenesse of Countenance, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, losse of Appetite, want of sleep, and a loosness of the Belly.</p>

in Children, because they are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily extenuated by their heat, it is wont to kill in three days, afterwards there is hopes, the Disease declines, and the strength increases.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in 1. Dyet, let the Nurse drink only water, and use such Meats which greatly cool, as <hi>Ptisan,</hi> and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Broth, with the Emulsions of the Seeds of Poppy-Broths, with Lettice and Endive; the Nurse and Child are to be kept in a cold Air, in great quiet of mind and body. Purges are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or hurtful, but if the Child be costive, his belly may be loosned with a common Suppository, or this Clyster: Take of Barly water Three Ounces, of Whey Five Ounces, red Sugar half an Ounce, mingle them. Outwardly use two Ounces of the Oyl of Roses, with the Yelk of an Egge, it mitigates pain, concocts and dissolves the humour; the Juice of Lettice, Pomkins, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, the flesh whereof may be poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Juyce prest out, and the Leaves of Lettice steep'd in it, and laid upon the head, or a Cloth dipp'd in


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35700:68"/>
the Juice. These Medicaments are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be changed, lest by staying too long on the head, they heat, and dry, and hurt as much as help; and in the Winter they are to be laid on lukewarm; in the Summer cold: Nor is it safe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed these cold remedies, and use the coldest, lest the temper of the Brain is destroyed.</p>
               <p>When the Inflamation is appeased, then leave the use of the cooling reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and use discussive ones; and first such as are gentle, the yelk of an Egge, of Oyl of Cammomile two Ounces, mingle them; afterwards a stronger discutient, Take the Flowers of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, the Leaves of Penny-royal and Dill, Bran tyed in a Cloth half a Pugill, boyl them according to Art, then take half a pint of the said Decoction, the Oyl of Cammomile and Anniseed, of each an Ounce, shake them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and apply them warm to the Head.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe running at the Nose, Cough, and difficult Breathing in Children, are the effects and issue of a Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which as some observe, is the mother of all Evill, and is a deslux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of a petuitous humour, into the parts subjected; if the matter flowes to the Nose, it is called the Pose and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Nose; if it descends to the breast, and is expelled by the Spirit that goes out, it's called a Cough, but if the same matter falls upon the Lungs, and stops the ways of the Spirit, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the body of the Lungs, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a difficulty in breathing; this matter seldome makes hoarsness in Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sucking Children by their daily use of Milk, cleanses the Phlegme that it doth not stick about the Jawes; in those that are elder, hoarsnesse is seldome,


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35700:69"/>
because they are hot about the Jawes; which dryes up the Phlegme.</p>
               <p>These Distempers are Symptomes and effects of a very moist Brain, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cold, because Infants draw Air more cold then they were used to, which cools the Brain; and it is sometimes hot by its natural temper, which is very hot, by Air that is hot, Fire, Smoake, too hot cloathing of the head, and the glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and intemperance of the Nurse.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest of the Cough, Poze, and difficulty of Breathing; if they come from a hot cause, the Child sneezes often, the colour of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Child is florid and red, the Jawes are red, and whilest the Child sucks, the Breasts are heated, that the Nurse perceives the heat. If from a cold cause, there is seldome sneezing, no change of the Colour of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, no heat perceived in the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> These Distempers are not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous if they be not neglected, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they produce Broken Bellies, and other Diseases, and often Death.</p>
               <p>The Cure is 1. in Diet, let the Air be temperate without Excesse, avoid


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35700:70"/>
Wine, and Meats that are windy and grosse, and such as flye to the head, as Spice, and meats prepared with them; If the matter is cold, a little Spice and hot meats may be allowed, but sparingly, for all which fly to the head are apt to attenuate and loosen both the cold and hot matter, which causes these Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and many others. 2. Evacuating and diverting the humour, by loosning the Belly of the Child by a Clyster or Suppository, or by a Vomit, which is very good to evacuate the Phlegme; which you may do by dipping your finger in Hony, and pressing down the Tongue of the Child; also to evacuate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Take of the Hony of Violets one Ounce, of the Powder of <hi>Ocymi</hi> one dram, mingle it, and put it in the Mouth of the Infant, and then give him the Breast; in a cold cause Mirrh and Hony are commended. In a hot cause, Take one dram of the Seed of White Poppy, of <hi>Tragacanthy</hi> half a Dram, of the Seed of a Goard three Drams, bruise them all, and with a Decoction of <hi>Sobestens,</hi> make a Liquor; or you may powder them, and take half a Scruple, &amp;


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35700:70"/>
mingle them with a little hony of Violets and give it the Infant to lick. If the Breath be difficult with the Cough, use the Syrrup of Hyssop, in the place of the Hony of Violets. It is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to keep the Breast of the Child easie, and not straight, that it may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, wherefore annoint the Breast and Back with the Oyl of sweet Almonds, which is also good if it be swallowed, and taken inwardly.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the pain and humidity of the Ears.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe pain of the Ears, is reckoned by all Physicians amongst the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of Children. It is a grievous sense which vehemently affects the parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the passage of hearing, which is very sharp, in regard the inward parts of the Ear are very nerveous. Note, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the ear is fleshy and carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous.</p>
               <p>The humidities of the ears are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongst Childrens Diseases by some,


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35700:71"/>
but not the humidities of the Nose or Palate, because the Expurgation by the Nose and Palate is natural to men and Children, but the expurgation by the Ears is not natural. The Cause of it is the great humidity of the Brain, which cannot be all evacuated by the Mouth and Palate, so that excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which abound are evacuated by all Passages; wherefore many will not drye up this humidity, unlesse it ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or threaten obstruction, or deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The Cause of the pain in the ear, are the humours, especially Choller, Icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter, Wind, or Worms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The Pain of the Ear is very dangerous.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. The mitigation of the Pain, with luke warm milk, or Water, and the Oyl of Roses mix'd, and a Cloth dipp'd in it, and laid upon the Ear, a Decoction of the heads of Poppy, and as the Causes of the Pain are, so ought remedies to be for the taking them away; If the pain is from hot humours, the part is red and hot, and cur'd by cold things; if from cold, by


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35700:71"/>
luke-warm things; if from Wind, the Diet ought to be such as discusses Wind, for which purpose Coriander is good for the Nurse to use, and that the Child sleep upon the ear which pains him, thereby natural heat is augmented, and dissipates the Wind, the Oyl of Cammomile or Anniseeds poured into the Childs ear is very good; if the pain be from an Icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous matter, wipe and clense continually the Ear with Hony, or Hony and water; if from Worms, put into the Ear bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things that kill the Worms, as the Oyl of bitter Almonds. See the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Worms.</p>
               <p>If there be humidity of the Ears, and the Child old enough to be purged, let him take three dayes this drink, Take of the Leaves of Mirtles, Bettony, Staecados, Violets, of each half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, let a Decoction be made according unto Art, then take thereof two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and an half, of the Syrrup of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and Staecados, of each two drams, mingle them; afterwards purge the head thus, Take of the Pills of Agarick half a dram, of Castor one grain, two Cloves, mingle them, and with the


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35700:72"/>
Hony of Roses solutive, make five little Pills. The head being purged for the drying up of the humidity, if it be cold, infuse into the Ears the Oyle of Irnie or Rue. If hot, the Oyl of Roses with the Oyl of Cammomile. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the use of remedies, that they be always lukewarm when you use them, neither hot nor cold; not in a great quantity, but by drops, and that the Child lye on the Ear that pains; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the moisture flowing out of the Ears is not to be stopp'd.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Inflamation of these <hi>Glandules</hi> is reckoned by some amongst Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Diseases, but onely in Children after breeding of Teeth. Others say this Disease may be in Infants, but in them it would then be very mortall by the plentifull flowing of humours, which


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35700:72"/>
often strangles. If the Gums, are inflamed in Infants, and the <hi>Glandules</hi> ulcerated before breeding of Teeth, why may they not be inflamed, what should hinder that an infant may not have this disease some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and not be choak'd? as I conceive;</p>
               <p>The inflamation of these <hi>Glandules,</hi> is an <hi>Intumescency</hi> of them made by a flux of humours.</p>
               <p>The internal cause are all the humours especially Phlegm.</p>

               <p>The Cure is 1. in a good Dyet, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any excesse of the air, smoak, the Sun, all exercises of the body, vehement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, especially anger, bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35700:73"/>
if the belly be bound, move it with a gentle Clyster or suppository, not by a remedy at the mouth, for it is dangerous; abstain from wine and use <hi>Barly</hi> water with the Juyce of <hi>Granates</hi> and <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries</hi> and <hi>Quinces,</hi> let the meat be such as may be supt, as <hi>Barly Broth,</hi> bread boyled in broth with the Juice of the Seeds of <hi>Limmon,</hi> the Yelks of Eggs in broth, with the Juice of <hi>Granates.</hi> 2. In revulsion of the humour, by daily rubbing Ligatures, especially Cupping-glasses applyed to the Loins and lower parts, not the upper parts, lest it draw the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to the part affected. 3. Repelling the humour by cooling and astringing reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as the Sirrup of <hi>Mulberry, Granate, Mirtle,</hi> with <hi>Barly</hi> water, <hi>Rose</hi> water, <hi>Plantain</hi> or <hi>Oak-bud</hi> water, and wash the mouth with it, to which purpose may be red Roses powdered finely and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent powders. 3.

               <p>THe Ulcers of the mouth in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Ulcers of the Superficies of the mouth, (that is the whole inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the mouth) with a fiery heat.</p>
               <p>They are easily caused in Infants, by reason of the tendernesse and softnesse of the Palat of Children, they being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to meat being newly born, and by their greedinesse and sucking more then they can digest, wherefore it is a


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35700:74"/>
great fault in Nurses, that whensoever the Child cryes to quiet them with giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Breast, for it is a rule amongst Physicians, that milk should not be given not above three or four times in a day.</p>
               <p>The cause is whatsoever is corroding or accrimonious or sharp, whether the humours of the body, meat or medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In Children they are chiefly caused by the sharpnesse and corruption of the Milk, whereby ill vapours are sent from the Stomach into the mouth.</p>
               <p>The external causes are whatsoever may heat the head of the Child, as the air being hot, the use of hot meats, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exercises, and drinking of strong Wine.</p>
               <p>The Signes are Swallowing with pain and difficulty, if they are malignant they for the most part follow ill and pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall <hi>Feavers,</hi> besides they are fetid, black or livid, causing pain, and are profound. If benigne and not malignant, they are without a Swelling or profoundity. If from blood, they are hot and red. If from Phlegm, they are lesse hot, lesse painfull,


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35700:74"/>

               <p>The Cure, if the Ulcers are benigne they are cured by altering the temper and cicatrizing with cooling and astring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedies: If the milk be bad change the Nurse or correct the Milk by dyet and purging the Nurseas hath bin shewn; the Ulcers are healed with Hony of <hi>Mulberries,</hi> or Sirrup of <hi>Pomegranates, Mirtles</hi> or <hi>Red Roses</hi> dryed, with which the Nurse dipping her finger is to touch the Ulcers, and if they be contumacious, mingle a little powdered <hi>Alum,</hi> with the Sirrup of <hi>Mulberries,</hi> for the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Alum</hi> hinders the spreading of the Ulcer, and without any notable pain.</p>
               <p>If the Child is somewhat great, the dyet ought to be cooling, and meats that

If the Ulcers are great commonly causing inflamations and drawing of the humours, Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses applyed to the Loins are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and to evacuate by them what the age and constitution of the body will permit then purge Gently; the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments to be applyed to the Ulcers are the same as in Infants, or make a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Millefoyle,</hi> or <hi>Plantain,</hi> with <hi>Red Roses, Sanders,</hi> and take of it four Ounces and mix with it an Ounce of the Sirrup of <hi>Mulberries,</hi> wash the mouth with it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Of Dentition and breeding of Teeth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE generation and perfection of Teeth, is the work and intent of Nature, but in regard the matter out of which they are made, suffers not that this Work can be done without trouble and pain; It causes that a Disease followes the generating of Teeth, which Disease is not intended by Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:35700:77"/>
Dentition is an Eruption or breaking forth of Teeth, first conceived in their proper holes. It is said by some, to be a violent work of Nature, and the gums are as it were prick'd with needles whereby great pain is caused, and a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural heat in those parts is excited, which drawes the humours thither which are made putrid, salt and sharp in those parts, and being precipitated to the Stomach and guts strongly excites the expulsive faculty, and consequently causes loosnesse, and sometimes Dysen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>
               <p>Bones and Teeth are the same accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to kind and matter, but differ in Species and name. The difference of Bones and Teeth in their nature and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular beings, appears, 1. Teeth are made after the Birth of a Child, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bones before grow to a certain time and have no sense, and never are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, but Teeth grow during the whole life, have an acute sense and grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It's observed, that amongst the Bones the Teeth only cannot be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by fire: Neverthelesse they are corrupted, and consumed by a putrid


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35700:77"/>
Phlegme; besides Teeth have no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fat as other Bones have, and therefore they are the most hard body: They are corrupted with hot things, as by washing them with warm water, but preserved by moderate cold, as by wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with cold water, nor are they hurt by an actual extraordinary cold (for in Frost they are not troubled) but by a cold that is potential, because Teeth have but a little heat, and cannot resist a great cold.</p>
               <p>Teeth were made for the breaking of hard meat, for speaking, and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tasts, and therefore they have soft Nerves in them; and although Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries relate several have been born with Teeth, yet for the most part they break forth in Children about the 7th. month, sometimes sooner, as in them which use more hot milk. They are very slow in some, sometimes to the Third or fourth year, either by weakness or the fault of the matter of the Teeth, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not sufficiently glutinous and earthy) or by a privation of matter by Worms, or a loosnesse, in the seventh year Teeth fall out, and others grow in their places,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35700:78"/>
growing of Teeth continues until four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, &amp; afterwards very few grow, unlesse they be those called <hi>Posteriores Gemini,</hi> which sometimes grow at 80 years. The sooner Teeth come forth, the less pain; but they are the weaker; Teeth come forth in the Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer more easily, but with worse Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes and effects, in the Winter with more difficulty, but with lesse danger, for they are lesse troubled with a Feaver Loosness, or Vomit, because their inward heat is more strong. But a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Author says, that in every time of the year, some are more troubled, some lesse, according to the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Children, which the times of the year cannot hinder. The Teeth are of an equal number in men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being 32. The Cutting Teeth which are four above and below, grow first, which are made of a thin matter, and as they are made first so weaker, and are broke, fall out sooner then the rest; the next are the Teeth called Dogs Teeth, whose use is to break the meat, as to cut is before breaking, so the Teeth that cut are first, afterwards the Teeth that


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35700:78"/>
break the meat, afterwards the great and grinding Teeth grow, whose matter is more hard and earthy, and therefore they break out the more slowly, and last of all the <hi>Gemini,</hi> which never are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and grow again. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears why the breeding of Teeth causes so many evils, if they should grow in the Womb they would not be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, but growing after the Birth of the Child, and in that time when the Gums are most soft, which being brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and crushed by a hard body as the Bone is, causes great pain.</p>
               <p>The Signs are the Childs crying, loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pinching the Paps whilest they suck, the Inflammation, and heat of their mouths, and when their Gums are rubbed, they are eased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The breeding of Teeth is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes dangerous by reason of the great and grievous Symptomes and effects it produces, as Convulsions, Feavers, and other evils. If the Child is loose he is lesse troubled with Convulsions, and fat Children more than lean; yet there may be Convulsions by the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of pain. If the Child hath an


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35700:79"/>
acute Feaver there is seldome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions by fulnesse, it being remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Feaver. Teeth come forth more slowly most commonly, with a little Cough, because there is a deflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in the mouth, which argues the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the brain.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, in a cold dyet of the Nurse, and the pap kept cool, which much refreshes the Child; the Child is not to eat any hard meat, and the Gums are to be cooled and relax'd; the Juice of <hi>Mallowes</hi> and <hi>Lettice</hi> cools. Take the Juice of <hi>Mallowes,</hi> half an Ounce, of <hi>Butter,</hi> washt in <hi>Mallow-</hi>water half one Ounce, half the yelke of an egge, mingle and anoint the Gums with it; this that followes is stronger. Take of the Juice of <hi>Night-shade</hi> half an Ounce, of the Oyle of <hi>Roses,</hi> six Drams, of <hi>Butter</hi> washt in <hi>Lettice-water</hi> three Drams, mingle them and anoint the Gums with it, it being cold, rubbing the Gums with your finger, for it often mitigates pain.</p>
               <p>The Gums are relax'd by things that are fat, as all fat of a Hen, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Oyl


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35700:79"/>
of <hi>Almonds,</hi> and the Brains of a Hare boyled, in the place whereof may be the brains of a Hen; Hony boyled is much commended. It is conceived by some that the breeding of Teeth is the more easie by hanging about the neck, <hi>Corral,</hi> a <hi>Jaspis-stone,</hi> or the Root of wilde <hi>Colothwiths,</hi> which others think su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious.</p>

               <p>CHildren are more chiefly affected with Diseases in the lower <hi>Venter,</hi> in three parts, the Stomach, Bladder, and Guts, which follow in their order.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hiccough</hi> is a motion like to a Convulsion, in which the Stomach en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to expell what is hurtful infixt in the mouth of it.</p>
               <p>The cause is in Children the plenty or quality of the Milk or nourishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too cold, sharp, or corroding vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently irritating the expulsive faculty sometimes but rarely it comes from emptiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:35700:80"/>
The external causes are a cold Air, hot and sharp meats as Pepper.</p>
               <p>The Signes are manifest, for as the Proverb is <hi>Love</hi> and the <hi>Hiccough</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid; if it is from fullnesse the Child is greedy and Vomits, if from cold, it is known by rhe Nurses using cold meats and externall injuries that preceeded it, if the Childs Stomach is fomented with hot Cloathes it ceases presently, if from evacuation, fasting, flux or vomit preceeded it, if from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony the meats are corrupted or the milk is sharp and biting, and the Child often mourns and grieves, and there are pains of the Belly, besides the <hi>Ordure</hi> shewes it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The <hi>Hiccough</hi> in Children for the most part is safe, if it be made from emptiness it is mortal for Children which are naturally full and very moist, if they are vehemently dryed by a great cause they are hardly restored.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Hiccough</hi> be with the <hi>Falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicknesse,</hi> or another kind of Convulsion it is Mortall.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, if the <hi>Hiccough</hi> be from 1 cold, use hot things inwardly and


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35700:80"/>
and outwardly, Take the Syrrup of <hi>Mint</hi> or <hi>Betony</hi> outwardly, the Oyl of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed, Chamomile,</hi> and <hi>Wormwood,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Plaisters and Ointments that are hot, and set forth in several Chapters. 2. Plenty or quality of Milk, correct it as is shewed in several Chapters; and if it be from the Acrimony of the Milk, let the Child use a little quantity of this, Take of <hi>Saccharum Rosatum</hi> half an Ounce, of <hi>Bole Armenick</hi> half a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, mingle them. If from Evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same remedies are good, as are for Leannesse from Evacuation, see the Chapter of Leannesse; Bathing with sweet Water, and Broth is good in elder Children, the Yelks of Eggs, and all Meats that easily nourish. It is related by some, that the Herb called <hi>Alyssus,</hi> held in the hand, look'd upon, or smell'd to, cures the Hiccough by Propriety of Substance. Others say, that Sneezing, and holding the Breath, cures all Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coughs: but these Helps are too difficult for Children and Infants, Sneezing and Vomiting because they evacuate the matter, is commended.</p>

               <p>BEsides the Hiccough, the vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Vomiting, and Vomiting happens to Children, for the matter that troubles the Stomach, is either infixed deeply in the mouth of the Stomach, and so makes a Hiccough, or infixed, but not profoundly, and either in the Mouth or Tunicles of the Stomach, whence it is a vain desire of Vomiting, or else the matter is contained in the Space of the Stomach, and so makes a Vomiting.</p>
               <p>The Causes of Vomiting, or a vain desire of Vomiting in Children, are, The humidity and laxity of the Stomach, the plenty of cold humours falling from the head, the plenty of Milk or Meat, the Acrimony and coldnesse of the same Milk.</p>
               <p>The External causes are, a bad Air, stinck, or an ill tast, the use of Oyly and fat things.</p>

it is known, if it be from 1. Coldness, by the cold Diet of the Nurse preceding it, and the help from hot things: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Milk is kept some time; if the Stomach be cold, it presently rejects the Milk. 2. Acrimony, then Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren languish, and are afflicted before and after Vomiting. 3. Plenty, then Vomiting eases, evacuating the cause of Laxity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> Vomiting, which is from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more then the Stomach is able to bear, and Vomiting only that which offended, and retaining and correcting the rest, the Child is not sick, but more cheerful, the Stomach being strong, and the fault only in the quantity of the Milk.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vomiting immediately only what is taken, if it continue, causes a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and Death.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, The Milk is to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by lessening the quantity of it in suckling the Child, and altering by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and correcting the temper of the Nurse, as is directed in several Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. If the fault be in the Childs Stomach, by the weaknesse of it,

Cloves or Coriander chewed by the Nurse, and instill it into the Mouth of the Child, sometimes alone, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the Syrrup of Mirtles, Quince or Granates is commended. Outwardly apply the Plaister called <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastrum de Crusta Panis;</hi> or take the Oyl of Mirtles two drams of the Juice of unripe Grapes, or one dram and an half, red Wine one dram, boyl them to the Consumption of the Wine, then add Mastick, Mirrh, Acaciae and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense of each half a dram, Wax and refine as much as will susfice to a soft Plaister, let the Child wear this constantly above the Stomach.</p>

               <p>INvoluntary pissing, or not holding of the Water, in Children is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to them then those that are elder, because Children are rather governed by their appetite then will, and cannot hold

their water longer, but this Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Urine is not here intended, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a Disease; but the involuntary pissing here meant, is an Affection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural, by which Children are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and involuntarily make water at all times.</p>
               <p>The cause is in Children, an Imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and cold, and moist temper of the Muscle of the Bladder called Sphincter, proceeding from pituitous and thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; Sometimes the resolution of the Sphincter, the motive faculty being not sent to it, by reason of the obstruction of the Nerves, especially about the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Marrow from the like humour.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are the coldness of Air, and Meat, drinking of cold water, blowes about the Back, and falls.</p>
               <p>The Signs are, elder Childrens wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their Clothes, their inward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being always wet with pisse; but in Children newly born, it is hard to know whither in an often sucking, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pissing is involuntary, and that Age gives no testimony of voluntary pissing.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35700:83"/>
then cold and moisture. If it comes from an External Cause it is mortal, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially from a fall or Luxation.</p>
               <p>The Cure is in, 1. By a Diet which is hot and dry, as you have in several Chapters; you are to abstain from meats that move Urine. 2. The Belly loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Clyster or Suppository; use this Syrrup, Take of the Leaves of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint, Plantane, and Mint, of each half a handful, the Seeds of Rue, two drams, boyl them according to Art. Take of the Syrrup of Purslane, Red Roses, and Wormwood, of each half a dram, mingle them together. After the humours are prepared, purge with two Scruples of Pill <hi>Hiera cum Agarico:</hi> or, Take of <hi>Mirabuline, Chebuline</hi> one dram, of the Seed of Rue half a dram, of the Flowers of Violets and Roses of each half a Pugil, boyl them according to Art. Take thereof three Ounces, Trochische of Agarick two Scruples and an half, infuse it all night, then presse it, and add the Syrrup of Roses Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, two Ounces; the body being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, outward remedies are to be used, as Baths which heat, drye, and are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35700:83"/>
it is good to annoint the Loyns and Parts nearest to the Bladder with the Oyl of Wormwood, or the Oyl of Worms; foment those parts with this, Take of Calamint, Mint, Rue, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jerome, red Roses, of each an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; Galengal, and Cyprus, of each two drams, boyl them in red Wine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art. If these will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then Blisters will be useful. Divers remedies are propounded by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that are supposed by a Propriety to cure this Distemper, as the Brain and Testicles of a Hare burnt and given to drink in White-wine, the Bladder of a Sheep or Sow used in the like manner; and divers others.</p>

               <p>THe difficulty of Urine is either when that no Urine is made, which is called Ischury, or when the Urine is made by Drops, which is called a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury,


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35700:84"/>
both which distempers differ only in degree.</p>
               <p>The Causes are a coldnesse, sometimes alone, sometimes with moisture, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the expulsive faculty, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expell the Urine, or if it doth, not in such a manner as it ought, so that the expulsive faculty is essentially hurt, or the cause is either from a Stone, or the humours viscid and thick.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are, an Air that is cold, grosse, thick and cold meats and drinks, especially the Milk of the Nurse, for as the manner of Diet is, such is the Milk; as the Milk is, such are the Children that suck it.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest, for the Child makes no water, or by drops, and with groaning. If it be from a cold distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then if the parts be rubb'd, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or compress'd, the Urine comes forth; if from Obstruction, if you compresse them, no Urine is made, it is known also by the course of Life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to it, and by the Childs being said before to have Urine that was thick and muddy.</p>

               <p>CHildren are very obnoxious to the Stone of the Bladder, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten troubled with it by their much eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, causing much crude humours, which stay not in the Reyns, but is expelled into the Bladder. Female Children are seldome troubled with it, because they have the Channel of the Bladder broad


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35700:85"/>
straight, not contorted and crooked.</p>
               <p>The Stone of the Bladder, which is immediately made in the Bladder, is more often made in Children then in old men, because Children are great Eaters, &amp; thereby abound with much crude hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which is the matter of the Stone, and falls into the Bladder; besides, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens native heat is strong, which easily hardens the matter into a Stone; old men although they abound with crude and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy humours, because their heat is weak in the Bladder, the Stone is not made, to which may be added the strength of the expulsive faculty, the narrowness of the passage, and the tenuity of the humour in Children.</p>
               <p>The Stone which is first made in the Reins, is in old men more often then in Children, as is proved by experience, because old mens expulsive faculty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and the Ureters wide, so that the thickest and grosse matter, is detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Reins, and consequently turn then into a Stone.</p>
               <p>The material causes are humours thick petuitous, and tenacious; the efficient cause is the greatnesse of the heat.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:35700:86"/>
               <p>The immediate internal causes are chiefly the narrownesse and straightnesse of the passage or Channel, then the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry disposition and propriety from parts, and the Milk of the Nurse being bad, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Diet or temper; for when the Child doth suck impure Milk, if the Child hath large Veins, from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to the Bladder, the impure matter is carried to the Bladder, where it settles with the Urine as muddy water shak'd together in some Vessell, and then rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes a Sediment in the middle, which Sediment of the Urine afterwards is conglobated and made round, by Phlegme, like a little hill, and is hardned as Iron in a Furnace.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are the same as in the Strangury.</p>
               <p>The Signes are, 1. Groaning, and pain in making water. 2. The making water by drops. 3. The Blood is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mix'd with the Urine. 4. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is somewhat white, crude, sometimes with a slimy, sometimes with a Sandy Sediment. 5. Inflamation of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 6. Itching of the Preputium and foreskin, and frequently scratching of the Privities.


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35700:86"/>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The Stone of the Bladder is very dangerous, and difficult, by reason of the pain, and in curing Suppression of the Urine, which often happens.</p>
               <p>The Stone if it cannot be cur'd by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it is mortal for the most part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Stone growes in Children so great, that as the years increase, Nature cannot sustain it.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, If the Stone be Small, and newly begun, by such things that break and diminish the Stone by a quality that is either, 1.

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of Costivenesse and being bound in the Belly.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COstivenesse is a preternatural dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in Children, by which they discharge not the filfth and Ordure of the Body, either in a due hour and time, or in a due measure; The Filth ought every day to be expelled, and if much be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or that is not nourishing, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the quality of the Excrements ought to be expelled.</p>
               <p>The Causes are, the offending the Guts either not by sending the expulsive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, by a resolution of some Nerve or Muscle, by a distemper or obstruction, or because Choller is not sent to the Guts, by which the Guts are stimulated and excited to an Expulsion. Or the Expulsive faculty of the Guts


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35700:87"/>
is hurt by some Tumor or Skin, or some distemper.</p>
               <p>The Guts are offended also by some Errors within, by viscid and thick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors wrapp'd and mix'd with the Filth, and so gather the Filth together, that they fasten them to the Guts, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go forth, or with great difficulty, or Externally by the coldness of the Air, for it is certain that Costivenesse is more in the Winter than Summer; much sleep, idleness, great Meditations, (they drye the Belly) drink that is thick and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and sparingly used; the same Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors also in meats, as also preposterous eating, taking first astringent things, afterwards liquid, and they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to dine, and omit it, are bound in their Bellies.</p>
               <p>The Signs are the Childs not dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Belly every day, and complaining and if the Child is somewhat great, it is troubled in the head, and when the Child empties it self it is with pain &amp; groaning.</p>
               <p>If it proceed from a cold distemper, the body consumes, is pale, windy and belching; if from gross and viscid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, they will appear in the Filth; if


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35700:88"/>
from the want of Choller sent to the Guts; the Colour of the body will be muddy, and the Filth of the Guts white or somewhat Ash-coloured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> The Astriction of the Belly in most are dangerous, especially in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which great eaters, for which Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are generated in them in time, and in the Time of breeding of Teeth, cause Inflamation, Feavers, and Convulsions, the body being full.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. In moving the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in sucking Children, that the Nurse use meat that loosen the Belly, as <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Dry Figs, Raisins,</hi> and the Broth of <hi>Coleworts,</hi> and all such meats which can loosen the Belly; for as the Milk is made out of Blood, and it out of meat, so it is not to be doubted that the Milk is affected with such meats as the Nurse eats: The remedies that are to be used to the sucking Child, ought raiher to be External then Internal; The External are Suppositories made out of hard Hony or the roots of <hi>Mallowes; Garlick</hi> roasted in Ashes, and put into the fundament of the Child provokes Stool; So doth <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> Candied with <hi>Sugar,</hi> put into the


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35700:88"/>
Fundament, for it tickles the expulsive faculty and causes no pain. Besides these remedies to make the body soluble, there are others to be applied to the Navil; as half the White of an Egg boyled hard, and fill'd with Butter, and a little <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida,</hi> or two Grains of <hi>Scammony,</hi> the Gall of <hi>Beef</hi> laid to the Navil doth the same; so doth the Juice of <hi>Cyclami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> with an equal portion of the Oyle of <hi>Sweet Almonds,</hi> and <hi>Hens grease.</hi> If the Child is somewhat great, the use of <hi>Turpentine</hi> is much commended, it clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Liver and Spleen; Likewise Bread that hath some Bran in it, and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins continually used. The broth of <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts</hi> and <hi>Mallowes</hi> may be likewise used or the Suppositories directed above.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In removing not only Astriction, but also the Causes of it, therefore if it be in an Infant, that the Nurse uses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Diet, and such as doth not bind, avoiding idlenesse, the use of Wine that is sharp and binding, meats that are grosse and binding, as <hi>Barberies, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Cervices,</hi> and the like, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is binding. If the Astriction of the Belly be in a Child that is somewhat


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35700:89"/>
great, he is to use meats that loosen the belly, and to abstain from those that are binding, his sleep, watching and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are to be moderate, and to avoid North winds. If Astriction be from a cold distemper of the Guts, if in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the Milk ought to be corrected with meats that heat, or the Nurse chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and remedies applied to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or Navil of the Child. Take half a Pint of the best Wine, of the Leaves of <hi>Calamint, Abrotanum, Mint, Marjerome,</hi> of each half a handful, boyl them, and with a Sponge foment the whole Belly: or use this Oyntment, Take the Oyle of <hi>Spikenard,</hi> or <hi>Mint,</hi> of each three drams; the powder of <hi>Cloves</hi> half a Scruple, a little Wax, mingle them &amp; make an Ointment. If Astriction is from cold and viscid humours, use such things that are attenuating, as <hi>Oxymel,</hi> and the Syrrup of <hi>Harehound,</hi> these are very useful if the Child lick them, or the Nurse take them. If from the want of the coming of Choller to the Guts, then obstructions are to be removed, in a Child that is somewhat great, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of <hi>Rubra Tinctorum, Red Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi>


                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:35700:89"/>
the Roots of <hi>Fennell,</hi> or <hi>Aspara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and the use of <hi>Maidenhaire</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; stronger remedies in Children are not to be used.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Flux, is too great a Laxity of the Belly, by which Children do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel more filth, &amp; more often then ought to be by reason of the Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>The cause is a cold Distemper of the Guts, by which the Concoction is viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ared, and so the corrupted Meats cause the Flux, and also a moist distemper, whereby the retentive faculty, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in dryness, is weakned, and being not able to retain the filth, causes that the expulsive faculty excited by them, expells more and more often then it ought; to which may be added the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity that comes from the head to the Stomach, and from thence to the Guts;


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35700:90"/>
also corrupt meats, which when they have Acrimony, and are past to the Guts, irritate their expulsive faculty; likewise sharp and biting thin humours, do the same; such as are in the Breeding of Teeth.</p>
               <p>The External Causes are the South Wind, immoderate exercises of body, the use of liquid meats, and such as are apt to loosen the Belly.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest, Children ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often evacuate the Filth of their Belly, and it is more fluid and liquid then it ought; If it be caused by the Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meats, the Ordure and Filth stink, and appear unconcocted, and the Child breaks Wind often; if from breeding of Teeth, the Signs you have in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Breeding of Teeth; If from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and Ichorous humours, the Filth and Dung is bilious, and yellow, and if they have hurt the Guts, the Dung will be bloody, and covered with a bloody slime; If from a distemper, there will be the Signs of a moist or cold distemper, and no Signs of any other causes; If from a Distillation, the Child will have a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhe, not falling to the Lungs, and the


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35700:90"/>
Filth will be frothy; It it be from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Causes, it is known by a careful and diligent observation of the manners and life of Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> A Dysentory in Children is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous.</p>
               <p>The loosness of the Belly one or more dayes is healthful, if there be no Feaver, and if it is stopt within 7 dayes.</p>
               <p>An unseasonable stopping of the Flux in Children is mortal.</p>
               <p>If the Flux continues and perseveres, and is very long, it causes a Consumption and Death.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. In an Infant, if the Milk be bad, by changing the Nurse, in long Fluxes nothing hath been found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it cannot be corrected; If the Cause is hot, the Nurse is to use a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diet, abstaining from Wine, and using water in which Steel hath been quench'd, or Wine somewhat binding, but a very little of it; also meats some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what astringing and cooling, as Barly Broth, with the Juice of <hi>Quinces, Rice,</hi> and the like; Annoint the Childs Navil and Stomach with this, Take the Oyl of <hi>Mirtles, Quinces,</hi> of each three drams;


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35700:91"/>
the Powder of <hi>Mastick, Red Corall,</hi> and <hi>Acaciae,</hi> of each half a Scruple, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wax, make a Liniament. If the Cause be cold, the Nurse is to use a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et that is hot, as Wine somewhat bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Spice, the best Flesh, <hi>Mint, Marjerome,</hi> boyled in Broths. Take the Oyle of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> and <hi>Mastick,</hi> of each three drams; the Powder of <hi>Sothernwood, Comfrey,</hi> and <hi>Bole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick,</hi> of each half a Scruple, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wax, mingle them, and make a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niament; the Bag of a Hare is very good, but the Child is not to suck when it is used; but let the Child take <hi>Panna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> with the Milk of <hi>Almonds,</hi> for as the Bag thickens Milk outwardly, so if it should be used unseasonably it would be dangerous if it should do the same, and not above half a Scruple at a time is to be used.</p>
               <p>The Cure of a Child somewhat great, is; If the Flux comes from, 1. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Meat, stop them not nor retain them, but only comfort and strengthen the Stomach; Take of the Oyls of <hi>Spick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and <hi>Mastick,</hi> of each five drams; of the powder of <hi>Red Corral</hi> one dram


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35700:91"/>
and an half; of Wax a little, mingle them. 2. If from petuitous humours falling from the head, provoke Urine with a Decoction of the common Seeds of the Roots of <hi>Parsley, Fennel, Asparagus, Birtcher Broom,</hi> for they divert the Phlegme from the Guts. 3. If from bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours, temper them, and take care they do not exulcerate the Guts, wherefore let the Child abstain from Wine, meats that are hot, salt, acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and sweet, and use Barly Btoth with the Syrrup of <hi>Barberies, Quinces,</hi> or <hi>Granate.</hi> Take of the Decoction of all the <hi>Myrabulous</hi> six Ounces, the Juice of <hi>Millet</hi> strained four Ounces, mingle them, and make a Clyster, which is very good; So is this, Take of <hi>Mullen,</hi> the greater <hi>Comfrey,</hi> of each half a handful, boyl them according to Art; Take thereof two Ounces and an half, of the Syrrup <hi>Deribes</hi> one Ounce, mingle them; <hi>Whey</hi> in which Steel is quench'd is good, and may be given to six or eight Ounces at once; If the Guts are sore, this Confection is very useful, Take of the Conserve of <hi>Barberies</hi> one Ounce; of <hi>Thus</hi> one dram; of <hi>Mastick</hi>


                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:35700:92"/>
half a dram; of the powder of the great <hi>Comfrey</hi> two Scruples, mingle them; the quantity to be used is two or three drams every morning. The Broth of an old Hen in which <hi>Mullen</hi> is boyled, is good for all old and petuitous Fluxes; So is the heart of a <hi>Beef</hi> burnt and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, taken in Milk, in which Steel is quench'd, or in the Decoction of <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> half a Scruple of it, or a Scruple is to be used at once. Clysters are good, Take the Water of <hi>Barly</hi> in which Steel is quench'd eight Ounces, <hi>Red Sugar</hi> one Ounce, make a Clyster, this is good in the beginning, because it moderately dries, absterges, and mundifies the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; afterwards the Ulcers are to be dryed and healed, to which purpose use this, Take of <hi>Whey</hi> in which Steel is quench'd, nine Ounces, of <hi>Thus, Bole-Armonick,</hi> and of <hi>Comfrey</hi> the great, of each three drams, <hi>Sanguis Draconis</hi> five drams, mingle them and make a Clyster.</p>

               <p>The Cause is, A hot or cold distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Spyncter of the great Gut, most commonly from a humour thick, viscid and sharp, adhereing to it, where it stimulates the expulsive faculty, which endevouring to expel the viscous and sharp matter, but cannot in regard of the tenacity of the humour; the Tunicle of the Gut is as it were strain'd into pieces, and in the same divulsion the appetite and pain is made.</p>
               <p>The antecedent causes most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are Preceeding Fluxes, for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors continually touching the great Gut, distempers it; if the humours are hot, the distemper is hot; if cold, the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is cold; whereby sometimes there is


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35700:93"/>
not only made a distemper but an Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>The Signs are manifest, because the Child desires and endevours often to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the filth of the Belly, and with such endevours, that sometimes the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falls and comes down; the Filth that is evacuated is very little, slimy, and bloody; if it be from a hot cause, a heat is perceived by the Children in the Fundament, there is a rednesse; and cold remedies help; if from cold, there is a lesser pain, a little or no heat, no rednesse, and hot things help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> This Disease if it be diligently handled in the beginning, ends well; but it sometimes happens by continual pains, watchings, and crying of Children, that it brings them into mortal Feavers and Consumptions.</p>
               <p>The Cure is of sucking Children by ordering the Nurse; if a Child some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what great by abstaining from meats that are acid, sharp, salt, and sweet, and to use such as provoke Urine.

               </head>
               <p>VVORMS are very familiar to Children, by reason of crudity and corrupt Phlegme, from their eating of fruits and milk after other meats, for it is observed that sucking Children which eat Flesh are most troubled with Worms because their tender Stomach cannot concoct solid meat, and therefore it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts and breeds Worms, besides Milk is presently concocted and passes into the Guts, if flesh unconcocted be mingled with Milk, and passes with it into the Guts, it putrifies there.</p>
               <p>Worms are Annimals generated in the body, variously hurting the Operations of the Body.</p>
               <p>Worms are found almost in all parts of the body, as appears by the diffection of Bodies, and the Excretion of Worms, but it is doubted, whether the Worms were bred in those parts, or crept there, especially Worms found in the Stomach.


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35700:96"/>
Some think Worms may be bred in the Stomach, because the matter of Worms is no lesse communicated from food or defluxion, or otherwise from other parts, and that the efficient cause being also not wanting in the Stomach, but more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent they breed in the Guts.</p>
               <p>The Cause is, a petuitous crude and viscous humour, which ariseth from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate eating, meat easily putrefying and causing a thick Juice, as Cheese, Milk, Summer fruits, things that are sweet, sugared, honied, and the like, having something that hath an analogy to seed, instructed with a formative virtue, which disposes the matter to receive this form of a Worm, and not another, and informs the matter so disposed; as we see peculiar Worms to proceed out of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> the Salt of the Sea, Milk, Hony, and other things.</p>
               <p>The difference of Worms according to their Figure is threefold, some are round and long, others broad and long, and some small, compared with the other two sorts. Worms differ in their colours, being white, red, livid, ash-colour, or yellow, the variety of which colours


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35700:96"/>
proceeds either from the crudity or cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, out of which they are made, or from the variety of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment or diversity of corrupted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, out of which they are generated.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the three sorts of Worms in common are many, a Stinking breath, unquiet sleep, with starting, trembling, grating of the Teeth, Itching, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten rubbing of the Nose, paleness of the Face, red by Intervals, the Eyes hollow and darkish, the white whereof being turned pale or yellow, spitting much Phlegme, the swelling of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with murmuring and noise in it, the Griping of the Belly which is worse, when one is fasting, sometimes looses, Vomiting and Epilepsy.</p>
               <p>The Signs of the particular Worms; if they be long, then the biting of the Belly is more vehement, a little drye Cough, Hiccough, a vain desire of Vomiting, abominating meat, sounding, troublesome dreams, with trembling, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up, and crying out.</p>
               <p>If the Worms are broad, they are known by Excrements, not unlike the Seeds of <hi>Goardes,</hi> an unsatiable desire of


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35700:97"/>
eating, sudden dejection of things new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, leanness and consuming, a great pain sometimes in the right side some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the left.</p>
               <p>If short Worms, the pain is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, a most troublesome Itch about the Fundament, with a continual desire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prog.</hi> Broad Worms are the worst, because for the most part they continue longest.</p>
               <p>The short Worms are the least hurtful because they are little, and thin, and are bred in the thick Guts, most remote from the noblest parts, and easie to be expelled with the Excrements, and for Medicaments to be applied to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Worms that are great, fat, thick, and fill'd with blood, are worse then thin, short, and extenuated, because these showe the scarcity of matter, those the abundance of matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. White Worms are scarce dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but Worms that are yellow, livid, or red, are much worse.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Worms that are expelled dead, where there is no Feaver, or a Feaver that is benigne, dye by the scarcity of the


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:35700:97"/>
matter, but in malignaut Feavers they dye, rather by the venome, and so worse then living Worms.</p>
               <p>The Cure is, 1. In a convenient Diet, the Air is to be temperate and inclining to drynesse, sleep, and watching mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, avoiding sleep immediately after meat, immoderate Exercise, avoiding idleness, and rest, the Belly soluble, if it be bound loosen it with a Clyster or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository; the Drink, if there be no Feaver, ought to be Wine and Water somewhat binding, bitter or sharp, not sweet; Vinegar and Water is good, so is sharp Wine: but if there be a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the place of Wine let there be a Decoction of <hi>Pruines</hi> that are sharp or facid, <hi>Cherries</hi> or <hi>Granates,</hi> The meat ought to be easie to digest, attenuating, and penetrating, wherefore convenient meats, are such as are sharp, acid, &amp; bitter, &amp; oyly, and sweet things, viscid, thick, and fat things, are hurtful; the flesh of <hi>Birds</hi> is much commended; <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Veale</hi> are greatly discommended, with what is not convenient, mix'd <hi>Vinegar, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juice,</hi> the Juice of <hi>Granates,</hi> or some other sharp Juice; avoid all Fish and


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:35700:98"/>
things made of Milk, only such fruits are to be used which are acid, as <hi>Granates, Oranges, Limons, Services, Medlars, sharp Pruines,</hi> avoiding all crudities and indigestable meats, either from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or quantity of them. 2. In the use of <hi>Sena, Tamarinds,</hi> or <hi>Mirabulous;</hi> but above all, <hi>Aloes,</hi> for the consuming of the matter of <hi>Worms</hi> which is in the Stomach or Guts. Take of <hi>Aloes Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotrinae</hi> two drams, <hi>Mirrhae, Scordum, White Dictamus</hi> of each a Scruple, with the Syrrup of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> make Pills, the quantity at once is half a dram or forty grains. 3. In the killing or dulling of them, that they cannot resist the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which is done by things that are bitter, sharp, salt, acid, oyly; in the use of which observe, 1. That bitter or salt things, or such as kill <hi>Worms</hi> are to be mixed with sweet things which delight them, and drawes them to that which kills them, otherwise they avoid it. 2. Remedies used by the Fundament ought either to be sweet things alone, or else to prevail in sweetnesse above other things which are mix'd with them, for the Worms drawn by sweetnesse, move


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35700:98"/>
the lower parts of the Guts; but reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies taken in at the mouth, ought to be more sharp, and bitter, then sweet, otherwise the Worms would move into che Stomach, and cannot be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently kill'd. 3. The remedies ought not to be vehement, because they would offend the Stomach, and the Worms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by them would be more grievous, and offensive. 4. The Stomach ought to be empty when the remedies are used, else they would be obtruded and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, in regard they are weak. 5. There is no remedy which commonly kills all Worms, and there is no remedy so present as <hi>Coralline</hi> and <hi>Sea Mosse.</hi> 6. If the Child hath a Feaver, then reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are cold ought to be used, if not, then hot remedies may be used.</p>
               <p>Every kind of <hi>Worm</hi> hath its proper remedies, and the <hi>Long Worm</hi> being in the next place to the Stomach, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not such strong remedies as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Worms do; wherefore <hi>Wormwood, Southernwood, Coriander seed,</hi> or the Decoction of <hi>Calament</hi> are sufficient, which may be used in powder, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:35700:99"/>

               <p>The Broad <hi>Worms</hi> are cured like the Long <hi>Worms,</hi> but require stronger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, because this <hi>Worm</hi> is greater, <hi>Ferne, Cardamon, Costos,</hi> and <hi>Treacle</hi> are commended.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ascarides</hi> or Little <hi>Worm</hi> require stronger remedies then the Long and Broad <hi>Worms</hi> do, because they are most remote from the Mouth and Stomach, wrapt in viscid humours, and are made of viscid and thick humours; These <hi>Worms</hi> have also peculiar remedies. Take the Leaves of <hi>Wormwood</hi> one handiul, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> one Pugil and an half, boyle them, then take of that Decoction 12. Ounces, <hi>Hony of Roses</hi> 3 Ounces, of <hi>Salt</hi> one dram and an half, mingle and make a Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
