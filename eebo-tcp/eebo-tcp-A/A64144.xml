            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>EACE is so great a Blessing, and Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and Questions in Religion are so
little friends to Peace, that I have
thought no mans time can be better
spent then in propositions and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Peace, and consequently in finding expedients,
and putting periods to all contentious Learning. I have
already in a discourse before the Right Honourable the
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prov'd that Obedience is the best <hi>medium</hi> of
Peace and true <hi>Religion</hi>; and <hi>Lawes</hi> are the only
common term and certain rule and measure of it. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catâ
ad concionem multitudine, quae coalesce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in populum Unius corporis nullâ re praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
legibus poterat,</hi> said <hi>Livy. Obedience to
Man</hi> is the externall instrument; and the best in the
World. To which I now add, that <hi>Obedience to
God</hi> is the best internall instrument; and I have prov'd
it in this discourse. Peace and Holiness are twin-Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
<pb facs="tcp:53464:3"/>
after which because every man is bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and he that does not shall never see God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that the office of a Bishop is in nothing so signally
to be exhibited as in declaring by what means these
great duties and blessings are to be acquir'd. This
way I have here describ'd is an old way; for it was
Christs way, and therefore it is truth and life: but it
hath been so little regarded and so seldom taught, that
when I first spake my thoughts of it in the following
words before the Little, but Excellent, University of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> they consented to it so perfectly, and so
piously entertain'd it, that they were pleas'd with some
earnestness to desire me to publish it to the World, and
to consigne it to them as a perpetual memorial of their
duty, and of my regards to them, and care over them in
my Station. I was very desirous to serve and please
them in all their worthy desires, but had found so much
reason to distrust my own abilities, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to do what I fain would have done; till by a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
communication of those thoughts, though in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
words, I had publish'd it also to my <hi>Clergy</hi> at
the <hi>Metropolitical Visitation</hi> of the most Reverend
and Learned Lord <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi> in my own
Diocese. But when I found that they also thought it
very reasonable and pious, and joyn'd in the desire of
making it publick, I consented perfectly, and now only
pray to God it may do that Work which I intended. I
have often thought of those excellent words of Mr.
<pb facs="tcp:53464:3"/>
               <hi>Hooker</hi> in his very learned discourse of <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>;<q>[Such is the untoward constitution of our Nature,
that we do neither so perfectly understand the way
and knowledge of the Lord, nor so stedfastly embrace
it when it is understood, nor so graciously utter it
when it is embraced, nor so peaceably maintain it
when it is uttered, but that the best of us are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
sometime through blindness, sometime through
hastiness, sometime through impatience, sometime
through other passions of the mind, whereunto (God
knows) we are too subject]</q>That I find by true expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
the best way of Learning and Peace is that
which cures all these evils, as far as in this World they
are curable; and that is the wayes of Holiness, which
are therefore the best and only way of Truth. In Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
there is no end, and but very little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
but the way of godliness hath in it no Error, and
no Doubtfulness. By this therefore I hop'd best to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Counsel of the Wise man: <hi>Stand thou fast in
thy sure Understanding, in the way and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord, and have but one manner of
word, and follow the word of peace and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 5. 10. <hi>Vulg. edit. Lat.</hi>
               </note>
I have reason to be confident that they who
desir'd me to publish this discourse will make use of it,
and find benefit by it: and if any others do so too, both
they and I shall still more and more give God all thanks,
and praise, and glory.</p>

Learning tell us, that when
<hi>Jupiter</hi> espyed the men of the
World striving for Truth, and
pulling her in pieces to secure
her to themselves, he sent <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
down amongst them, and he with his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall

left them to contend still: and though then,
by Contention men were sure to get but little
Truth, yet they were as earnest as ever, and lost
Peace too, in their Importune Contentions for
the very Image of Truth. And this indeed is
no wonder: but when Truth and Peace are
brought into the world together, and bound
up in the same bundle of life; when we are
taught a Religion by the Prince of Peace, who
is the Truth it self, to see men Contending for
<hi>this Truth</hi> to the breach of <hi>that Peace</hi>; and when
men fall out, to see that they should make
<pb facs="tcp:53464:5"/>
Christianity their theme, that is one of the
greatest wonders in the World. For Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
is <gap reason="foreign">

of humane nature, and to cure the Barbarities
of evil men, and the Contentions of the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

               </gap>, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
Nation is destroyed by their own fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
That is, a Christian fighting and
wrangling with a Christian; and indeed that's
very sad: but wrangling about Peace too;
that Peace it self should be the argument of a
War, that's unnaturall; and if it were not
that there are many who are <hi>homines multae reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionis,
nullius penè pietatis,</hi> Men of much Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and little Godliness, it would not be that
there should be so many Quarrells in and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Religion which is wholly made
up of Truth and Peace, and was sent amongst
us to reconcile the hearts of men when they
were tempted to uncharitablenesse by any other
unhappy argument. <hi>Disputation</hi> cures no vice,
but kindles a great many, and makes Passion
evaporate into sin: and though men esteem
it Learning, yet it is the most uselesse Learning
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53464:5"/>
in the world. When <hi>Eudamidas</hi> the Son of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamas</hi>
heard old <hi>Xenocrates</hi> disputing about
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> he asked very soberly, If the old Man
be yet disputing and enquiring concerning
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> what time will he have to make use
of it? Christianity is all for Practice, and so
much time as is spent in quarrells about it is a
diminution to its Interest: men inquire so
much what it is, that they have but little time
left to <hi>be Christians.</hi> I remember a saying of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus,</hi>
that when he first read the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with fear and a good mind, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to understand it and obey it, he found
it very usefull and very pleasant: but when
afterwards he fell on reading the vast differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Commentaries, then he understood it
lesse then he did before, then he began <hi>not</hi> to
understand it. For indeed the Truths of God
are best dressed in the plain Culture and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the <hi>Spirit</hi>; but the Truths that men
commonly teach are like the reflexions of a
Multiplying-glasse: for one piece of good
money you shall have forty that are fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;
and it is forty to one if your finger hit
upon the right. Men have wearied themselves
in the dark, having been amused with false
fires: and instead of going home, have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

uneasie wayes; but have not found out
what their Soul desires. But therefore since
we are so miserable, and are in error, and have
wandered very far, we must do as wandring
Travellers use to do, go back just to that place
from whence they wandered, and begin upon
a new Account. Let us go to the Truth it self,
to Christ, and he will tell us an easie way of
ending all our Quarrells. For we shall find
Christianity to be the easiest and the hardest
thing in the World: it is like a secret in <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,</hi>
infinitely hard till it be found out by
a right operation, and then it is so plain, we
wonder we did not understand it earlier.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ's</hi> way of finding out of truth is by <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the will of God.</hi> We will try that by and by,
if possibly we may find <hi>that</hi> easie and certain:
in the mean time let us consider what wayes
men have propounded to find out Truth, and
upon the foundation of that to establish Peace
in Christendom.</p>
            <p>1. That there is but one true way is agreed
upon; and therefore almost every Church of
one denomination that lives under Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
propounds to you a Systeme or collective
Body of Articles, and tells you, <hi>that</hi>'s the true
<hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>Church,</hi> and the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
people of <hi>God</hi>: like <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53464:6"/>
whom one sayes, <hi>Ubicunque ipsi essent, praetexebant
esse rempublicam,</hi> they suppos'd themselves were
the Commonwealth; and <hi>these</hi> are the Church,
and out of this Church they will hardly allow
salvation. But of this there can be no end. For
divide the Church into Twenty parts, and in
what part soever your lot falls, you and your
party are Damned by the other Nineteen; and
men on all hands almost keep their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
by affrighting them with the fearful
Sermons of Damnation: but in the mean time
here is no security to them that are not able to
judge for themselves, and no Peace for them
that are.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Others</hi> cast about to cure this evil, and
conclude that it must be done by submission
to an Infallible Guide; this must do it or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
and this is the way of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Follow but the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergie,
and you are safe, at least as safe as their warrant
can make you. Indeed this were a very good
way, if it were a way at all; but it is none; for
this can never end our Controversies: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because the greatest Controversies are about
this Infallible Guide; but also because, 1. We
cannot find that there is upon Earth any such
Guide at all. 2. We do not find it necessary
that there should. 3. We find that they who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53464:7"/>
pretend to be this Infallible Guide are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
infinitely deceiv'd. 4. That they do not
believe themselves to be Infallible whatever
they say to us; because they do not put an end
to all their own Questions that trouble them.
5. Because they have no peace but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by force and Government. 6. And
lastly, because if there were such a Guide, we
should fail of Truth by many other causes:
for it may be that Guide would not do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
or we are fallible followers of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Leader; or we should not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his meaning at all times, or we should
be perverse at some times, or something
as bad: because we all confesse that <hi>God</hi>
is an Infallible Guide, and that some way or
other he does teach us sufficiently, and yet it
does come to passe by our faults that we are
as far to seek for Peace and Truth as ever.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Some</hi> very wise men finding this to fail,
have undertaken to reconcile the differences of
Christendom by a way of moderation. Thus
they have projected to reconcile the <hi>Papists</hi> and
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> and <hi>Contra-emonstrants,</hi> and
project that each side should abate of their
asperities, and pare away something of their
propositions, and joyn in Common terms and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53464:7"/>
phrases of Accommodation, each of them
sparing something, and promising they shall
have a great deal of peace for the exchange of a
little of their opinion. This was the way of
<hi>Cassander, Modrevius, Andreas Frisius, Erasmus,</hi>
               <hi>Spalato, Grotius,</hi> and indeed of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
in part, but something more heartily of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
the Second. This device produced the
conferences at <hi>Poissy,</hi> at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi>
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> at many places more: and what
was the event of these? Their parties when
their Delegates returned, either disclaimed
their Moderation, or their respective <hi>Princes</hi>
had some other ends to serve, or they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Meetings upon uncertain hopes, and a
triall if any good might come; or it may be
they were both in the wrong, and their
mutuall abatement was nothing but a mutuall
quitting of what they could not get, and the
shaking hands of false friends; or it may be it
was all of it nothing but Hypocrisie and Arts of
Craftiness, and, like <hi>Lucian's</hi> man, every one
could be a Man and a Pestle when he pleased.
And the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> though under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cover, made use of the artifice, but made
the secret manifest and common: for at this
day the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in the Questions <hi>de auxiliis Divinae
gratiae</hi> have prevailed with the <hi>Dominicans</hi> to use
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53464:8"/>
               <hi>their</hi> expressions, and yet they think they still
keep the sentence of their own Order. From
hence can succeed nothing but folly and a
phantastick peace. This is but the skinning
of an old sore, it will break out upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Others,</hi> who understand things beyond
the common rate, observing that many of our
Controversies and peevish wranglings are kept
up by the ill stating of the Question, endeavour
to declare things wisely, and make the matter
intelligible, and the words cleare; hoping by
this meanes to cut off all disputes. Indeed this
is a very good way, so far as it can go; and
would prevaile very much, if all men were wise,
and would consent to those stateings, and would
not fall out upon the main enquiry when it
were well stated: but we find by a sad experience
that few Questions are well stated; and when
they are, they are not consented to; and when
they are agreed on by both sides that they are
well stated, it is nothing else but a drawing up
the Armies in <hi>Battalia</hi> with great skill and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
the next thing they do is, they thrust
their Swords into one anothers sides.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What remedy after all this? Some other
good men have propounded one way yet: but
that is a way of Peace rather then Truth; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53464:8"/>
this is, that all Opinions should be tolerated
and none persecuted; and then all the World
will be at peace. Indeed this relies upon a
great reasonableness: not onely because Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
cannot be forced; but because if men
receive no hurt, it is to be hoped they will do
none. But we find that this alone will not
do it. For besides that all men are not so just
as not to do any Injury (for some men begin
the evil) besides this (I say) there are very
many men amongst us who are not content
that you permit them; for they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you, but <hi>rule over your faith,</hi> and say that
their way is not only true, but necessary; and
therefore the Truth of God is at stake, and all
Indifference and moderation is carnall Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and want of Zeal for God: nay more
then so, they preach for Toleration when
themselves are under the rod, who when they
got the rod into their own hands thought To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
it self to be Intolerable. Thus do the
<hi>Papists,</hi> and thus the <hi>Calvinists</hi>: and for their
Cruelty they pretend Charity. They will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>force</hi> you to come in, but it is in true Zeal
for your Soul: and if they do you violence, it
is no more then if they pull your Arme out of
joynt, when to save you from drowning they
draw you out of a River; and if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53464:9"/>
it is no more to be regarded then the
out-cries of Children against their Rulers, or
sick men against Physicians. But as to the
thing it self, the truth is, it is better in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
then in Practice: for reckon all
that is got by it when you come to handle it,
and it can never satisfie for the infinite disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
happening in the Government; the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to Religion, the secret dangers to publick
Societies, the growth of Heresie, the nursing
up of parties to a grandeur so considerable as
to be able in their own time to change the
Lawes and the Government. So that if the
Question be whether meer Opinions are to be
persecuted, it is certainly true, they ought not.
But if it be considered how by Opinions men
rifle the affaires of Kingdoms, it is also as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they ought not to be made publick and
permitted. And what is now to be done?
must Truth be for ever in the dark, and the
World for ever be divided, and Societies dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed,
and Governments weakned, and our
Spirits debauched with Error and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Opinions and the Pedantery of talking
men? Certainly there is a way to cure all this
evil; and the wise Governour of all the World
hath not been wanting in so necessary a matter
as to lead us into all Truth. But the way
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53464:9"/>
hath not yet been hit upon, and yet I have told
you all the wayes of Man and his Imaginations
in order to Truth and Peace: and you see these
will not do; we can find no rest for the soles
of our feet amidst all the waters of Contention
and disputations, and little artifices of divided
Schools. <hi>Every man is a lyar,</hi> and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is weak, and his Propositions uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and his Opinions trifling, and his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
imperfect: and neither Truth nor
Peace does come from man. I know I am in
an Auditory of inquisitive persons, whose bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
is to study for Truth, that they may
find it for themselves, and teach it unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
I am in a School of Prophets and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
Sons, who all ask <hi>Pilate's</hi> Question, <hi>What
is Truth?</hi> You look for it in your Books, and
you tug hard for it in your Disputations, and
you derive it from the Cisterns of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
and you enquire after the old wayes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are taken with new appearances, and
you rejoyce in false lights, or are delighted
with little umbrages and peep of Day. But
where is there a man, or a Society of men, that
can be at rest in his enquiry, and is sure he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
all the truths of God? where is
there a man but the more he studies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
still he discovers nothing so clearly as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53464:10"/>
his own Ignorance? This is a demonstration
that we are not in the right way, that we do
not inquire wisely, that our Method is not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall.
If men did fall upon the right way, it
were impossible so many learned men should
be engaged in contrary parties and opinions.
We have examined all wayes but one, all but
<hi>God's</hi> way: Let us (having missed in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
try this: let us go to God for Truth;
for <hi>Truth</hi> comes from God only, and his wayes
are plain, and his sayings are true, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>: and if we miss the Truth,
it is because we will not find it: for certain it
is, that all that Truth which God hath made
necessarie, he hath also made legible and plain,
and if we will open our eyes, we shall see the
Sun, and if <hi>we will walk in the light, we shall rejoyce
in the light</hi>: only let us withdraw the Curtains,
let us remove the <hi>impediments and the sin that doth
so easily beset us</hi>; thats Gods way. Every man
must in his station do that portion of duty
which God requires of him, and then he shall
be taught of God all that is fit for him to learn:
there is no other way for him but this. <hi>The
feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and a good
understanding have all they that do thereafter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 111. ver. 10.</note> And
so said <hi>David</hi> of himself, <hi>I have more understanding
then my Teachers; because I keep thy Commandements.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53464:10"/>
And this is the only way which Christ hath
taught us: if you ask, <hi>What is truth?</hi> you must not
doe as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, ask the Question, and then go
away from him that only can give you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
for as God is the author of Truth, so he
is the teacher of it; and the way to learn it is
this of my Text: For so saith our blessed Lord,
<hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine,
whether it be of God or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> is simple as Truth it self, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Comprehensive, and contains a truth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
will enable you to understand all <hi>Mysteries,</hi>
and to expound all <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and to interpret
all <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to search into all Secrets, all
(I mean) which concern our happinesse and
our duty: and it being an affirmative hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall,
is plainly to be resolved into this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>The way to judge of Religion is by doing of
our duty, and Theology is rather a Divine life then a
Divine knowledge.</hi> In Heaven indeed we shall
first see, and then love; but here on Earth we
must first love, and love will open our eyes as
well as our hearts, and we shall then see and
perceive and understand.</p>
            <p>In the handling of which Proposition I shall
first represent to you that <hi>the certain causes of our
Errors are nothing but direct sins,</hi> nothing makes us
Fools and <hi>Ignorants,</hi> but living vicious lives; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53464:11"/>
then I shall proceed to the direct demonstration
of the Article in question, that <hi>Holinesse is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way of truth and understanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. No man understands the <hi>Word of God</hi> as it
ought to be understood, unlesse he layes aside
all affections to Sin: of which because we have
taken very little care, the product hath been
that we have had very little wisdom, and very
little knowledge in the wayes of God. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
said <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Wickedness does cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
a mans reasoning, it gives him false prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and evil measures of things: the sweet
Wine that <hi>Ulysses</hi> gave to the <hi>Cyclops</hi> put his eye
out; and a man that hath contracted evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and made a League with sin, sees only
by those measures. A Covetous man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
nothing to be good that is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and a Voluptuous man likes your reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
well enough if you discourse of <hi>Bonum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum,</hi>
the pleasures of the sense, the ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of lust, the noises and inadvertencies, the
mirth and songs of merry Company. But if
you talk to him of the melancholy Lectures of
the Cross, the content of Resignation, the peace
of Meeknesse, and the Joyes of the holy Ghost,
and of rest in God; after your long discourse
and his great silence he cryes out, What's the
matter? He knows not what you meane. Either
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53464:11"/>
you must fit his humour, or change your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>I remember that <hi>Arianus</hi> tells of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that was banished from <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his
sorrow visited the Philosopher, and he heard
him talk wisely, and believed him, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to leave all the thoughts of <hi>Rome</hi> and
splendours of the Court, and retire to the course
of a severe Philosophy: but before the good
mans Lectures were done, there came <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
letters from <hi>Caesar</hi> to recall him
home, to give him pardon, and promise him
great Imployment. He presently grew weary
of the good mans <hi>Sermon,</hi> and wished he would
make an end, thought his discourse was dull
and flat; for his head and heart were full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
storie and new principles; and by these
measures he could heare only and he could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
            <p>Every man understands by his Affections
more then by his Reason: and when the <hi>Wolfe</hi>
in the Fable went to School to learn to spell,
whatever letters were told him, he could never
make any thing of them but <hi>Agnus</hi>; he thought
of nothing but his belly: and if a man be very
hungry, you must give him meate before you
give him counsell. A mans mind must be like
your proposition before it can be entertained:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53464:12"/>
for whatever you put into a man it will smell of
the Vessell: it is a mans mind that gives the
<hi>emphasis,</hi> and makes your argument to prevail.</p>
            <p>And upon this account it is that there are so
many false Doctrines in the only Article of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
Men know they must repent, but the
definition of Repentance they take from the
convenience of their own affaires: what they
will not part with, that is not necessary to be
parted with, and they will repent, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store:
they will say <hi>nollem factum,</hi> they wish
they had never done it; but since it is done, you
must give them leave to rejoyce in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase:
they will ask forgivenesse of God; but
they sooner forgive themselves, and suppose that
God is of their mind. If you tye them to hard
termes, your Doctrine is not to be understood,
or it is but one Doctors opinion, and therefore
they will fairly take their leave, and get them
another Teacher.</p>
            <p>What makes these evil, these dangerous and
desperate Doctrines? not the obscurity of the
thing, but the cloud upon the heart; for say you
what you will, He that hears must be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder,
and we can never suppose but a man
will give sentence in behalf of what he passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
loves. And so it comes to pass that, as
<hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> observ'd that God for the greatest
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53464:12"/>
Sin imposed the least Oblation, as a she-Goat
for the sin of Idolatry; for a woman accused of
Adultery, a Barly-cake: so do most men; they
think to expiate the worst of their sins with a
trifling, with a pretended, little, insignificant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
God indeed did so, that the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the oblation might teach them to hope
for pardon; not from the Ceremony, but from
a severe internal repentance. But men take any
argument to lessen their repentance, that they
may not lessen their pleasures or their estates,
and that Repentance may be nothing but a
word, and Mortification signifie nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their pleasures, but be a term of Art on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
fitted for the Schools or for the Pulpit, but
nothing relative to practice, or the exterminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sin. So that it is no wonder we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
so little of Religion: it is because we
are in love with that which destroyes it; and as
a man does not care to hear what does not
please him, so neither does he believe it; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
he will not understand it.</p>
            <p>And the same is the Case in the matter of
<hi>Pride</hi>; the Church hath extremely suffer'd by
it in many ages. <hi>Arius</hi> missed a Bishoprick, and
therefore turned Heretick; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>
Church; for he did not understand this Truth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53464:13"/>
[<hi>That the peace of the Church was better then
the satisfaction of his person, or the promoting
his foolish Opinion.</hi>] And do not we see and
feel that at this very day the Pride of men makes
it seem impossible for many persons to obey
their <hi>Superiors</hi>? and they do not see what they
can read every day, that it is a sin <hi>to speak evill of
Dignities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man would think it a very easie thing to
understand the 13. Chapter to the <hi>Romans, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
resisteth the power, resisteth the Ordinance of
God</hi>: and yet we know a generation of men to
whom these words were so obscure, that they
thought it lawfull to fight against their <hi>King.</hi>
A man would think it easie to believe that those
who were <hi>in the gain-saying of Corah,</hi> who rose up
against the high Priest, were in a very sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and yet there are too many amongst us
who are in the gain-saying of <hi>Corah,</hi> and think
they do very well; that they are the <hi>Godly party,</hi>
and the good people of God. Why? what's the
matter? In the world there can be nothing plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then these words, <hi>Let every soul be subject to
the higher powers,</hi> and that you need not make
a scruple who are these higher powers, it is as
plainly said, <hi>there is no power but of God</hi>; all that
are set over you by the Laws of your Nation,
these are <hi>over you in the Lord</hi>: and yet men will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53464:13"/>
not understand these plain things; they deny to
doe their notorious duty, and yet believe they
are in the right, and if they sometimes obey <hi>for
wrath,</hi> they oftner disobey for <hi>Conscience sake.</hi>
Where is the fault? The words are plain, the
duty is certain, the Book lyes open; but, alas! <hi>it
is Sealed within,</hi> that is, <hi>men have eyes and will not
see, eares and will not heare.</hi> But the wonder is the
lesse; for we know when God said to <hi>Jonas,</hi>
               <hi>doest thou well to be angry</hi>? he answered God to his
face, <hi>I do well to be angry even unto the death.</hi> Let
God declare his mind never so plainly, if men
will not lay aside the evil principle that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
their open love to their secret sin, they may
kill an Apostle, and yet be so ignorant as to
<hi>think they do God good service</hi>; they may disturb
Kingdomes, and break the peace of a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Church, and rise up against their Fathers,
and be cruell to their Brethren, and stir up the
people to Sedition; and all this with a cold sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
and a hot liver, with a hard heart and a
tender Conscience, with humble carriage and a
proud spirit. For thus men hate Repentance,
because they scorn to confesse an Errour; they
will not return to Peace and Truth, because they
feare to lose the good opinion of the people
whom themselves have couzened; they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be good, lest they should confess they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53464:14"/>
have formerly done amisse: and he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
how much evil is done, and how many
Heresies are risen, and how much obstinacy and
unreasonable perseverance in folly dwells in the
World upon the stock of Pride, may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that no learning is sufficient to make a
proud man understand the truth of God, unless
he first learn to be humble. But <hi>Obedite &amp; intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligetis</hi>
(saith the Prophet) obey and be humble,
leave the foolish affections of sin, and then ye
shall understand. That's the First particular:
All remaining affections to sin hinder the
learning and understanding of the things of
God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that means to understand the will of
God and the truth of Religion must lay aside <hi>all
inordinate affections to the world.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 14. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
complained that there was at <hi>that day a veile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heart of the</hi> Jews <hi>in the reading of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>:
they looked for a Temporall Prince to
be their <hi>Messias,</hi> and their affections and hopes
dwelt in secular advantages; and so long as that
veile was there, they could not see, and they
would not accept the poore despised JESUS.</p>
            <p>For the things of the world, besides that they
entangle one another, and make much business,
and spend much time, they also take up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of a mans mind, &amp; spend his faculties,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53464:14"/>
and make them trifling and secular with the
very handling and conversation. And therefore
the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> taught their Disciples <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a separation from the
things of the body, if they would purely find
out truth and the excellencies of wisdom. Had
not he lost his labour that would have discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
wisely to <hi>Apicius,</hi> and told him of the books
of Fate and the secrets of the other World, the
abstractions of the Soul and its brisker Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
that Saints and Angels eate not, and that
the Spirit of a man lives for ever upon wisdom
and holinesse and contemplation? The fat
<hi>Glutton</hi> would have stared a while upon the
Preacher, and then have fallen asleep. But if
you had discoursed well and knowingly of a
Lamprey, a large Mullet, or a Boare, <hi>animal
propter Convivia natum,</hi> and have sent him a Cook
from <hi>Asia</hi> to make new <hi>Sawces,</hi> he would have
attended carefully, and taken in your discourses
<hi>greedily.</hi> And so it is in the Questions and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of Christianity: which made St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
when he intended to convert <hi>Felix,</hi> discourse
first with him about <hi>Temperance, Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Judgement to come.</hi> He began in the right
point; he knew it was to no purpose to preach
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> crucified to an intemperate person,
to an Usurper of other mens rights, to one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53464:15"/>
whose soul dwelt in the World, and cared not
for the sentence of the last day. The <hi>Philosophers</hi>
began their Wisdom with the meditation of
death, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> his with a discourse of the
day of Judgment: to take the heart off from
this world and the amabilities of it, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
and baffle the understanding, and made
<hi>Solomon</hi> himself become a child and fool'd into
Idolatry, by the prettinesse of a talking woman.
Men now-a-dayes love not a Religion that will
cost them deare. If your Doctrine calls upon
men to part with any considerable part of their
estates, you must pardon them if they cannot
believe you; they understand it not. I shall
give you one great instance of it.</p>
            <p>When we consider the infinite unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is in the Popish Religion, how against
Common sense their Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
is, how against the common Experience
of humane nature is the Doctrine of the Popes
Infallibility, how against Scripture is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Indulgences and Purgatory; we may
well think it a wonder that no more men are
perswaded to leave such unlearned follies. But
then on the other side, the wonder will cease, if
we mark how many temporal ends are served
by these Doctrines. If you destroy the Doctrine
of Purgatory and Indulgences you take away
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53464:15"/>
the Priests Income, and make the <hi>See Apostolic</hi> to
be poor; if you deny the Popes Infallibility,
you will despise his Authority, and examine
his Propositions, and discover his Failings, and
put him to answer hard Arguments, and lessen
his Power: and indeed, when we run through
all the Propositions of difference between them
and us, and see that in every one of them they
serve an end of money or of power; it will be
very visible that the way to confute them is not
by learned disputations; (for we see they have
been too long without effect, and without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity)
the men must be cured of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the World, <hi>ut nudi nudum sequantur cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixum,</hi>
that with naked and devested affections
they might follow the naked Crucified <hi>Jesus,</hi>
and then they would soone learne the truths of
God, which till then will be impossible to be
apprehended. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Men (as St. <hi>Basil</hi> sayes) when they expound
Scripture, alwayes bring in something of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
but till there be (as one said) <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
a rising out from their own seats, untill
they go out from their dark dungeons, they can
never see the light of Heaven. And how many
men are there amongst us who are therefore
enemies to the Religion, because it seems to be
against their profit? The argument of <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53464:16"/>
is unanswerable; <hi>by this craft they get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>:
leave them in their Livings, and they will
let your Religion alone; if not, they think they
have reason to speak against it. When mens
souls are possessed with the World, their souls
cannot be invested with holy Truths. <gap reason="foreign">

as St. <hi>Isidor</hi> said: the Soul

never do any good, or get Disciples to Christ.
Now because a man cannot serve two Masters;
because he cannot vigorously attend two <hi>objects</hi>;
because there can be but one soul in any living
Creature; if the World have got possession,
talk no more of your Questions, shut your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

them, for they cannot tell of <hi>the Doctrine, whether
it be of God, or of the World.</hi> That is the Second

said the wise <hi>Boethius.</hi> A man must first

<hi>anger</hi> and <hi>desire,</hi> he can never have any thing but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a knowledge partly moral and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
naturall: his whole life is but Imagination;
his knowledge is Inclination and opinion; he
judges of Heavenly things by the measures of
his feares and his desires, and his Reason is half

of sense. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, then a man learns
well when he is a Philosopher in his Passions.<note place="margin">Nazianz. ad Philagrium.</note>
Passionate men are to be taught the first ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Religion: and let men pretend to as
much learning as they please, they must begin
again at <hi>Christs Crosse</hi>; they must learn true
mortification and crucifixion of their anger
and desires, before they can be good Scholars in
Christs School, or be admitted into the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
enquiries of Religion, or profit in spirituall
understanding. It was an excellent Proverb of
the Jews, <hi>In passionibus Spiritus Sanctus non habitat,</hi>
the Holy Ghost never dwells in the house of
Passion. Truth enters into the heart of Man
when it is empty and cleane and still; but when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53464:17"/>
the mind is shaken with Passion as with a
storme, you can never heare <hi>the voyce of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
though he charm very wisely</hi>: and you will very
hardly sheath a sword when it is held by a loose
and a paralytic Arme. He that means to learn
the secrets of Gods wisdom must be, as <hi>Plato</hi>
sayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his soul must be
Consubstantiated with <hi>Reason,</hi> not invested
with <hi>Passion</hi>: to him that is otherwise, things
are but in the dark, his notion is obscure and
his sight troubled; and therefore though we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
meet with passionate Fools, yet we seldom
or never heare of a very passionate wise man.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the First part of my
undertaking, and proved to you that our evill
life is the cause of our Controversies and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in the Religion of the things of God.
You see what hinders us from becoming good
Divines. But all this while we are but in the
preparation to the Mysteries of Godlinesse.
When we have thrown off all affections to sin;
when we have stript our selves from all
fond adherencies to the things of the world,
and have broken the chains and dominion of
our Passions; then we may say with <hi>David, Ecce paratum
est Cor meum, Deus</hi>; <hi>My heart is ready, O God,
my heart is ready</hi>: then we may say, <hi>Speak, Lord,
for thy servant heareth</hi>: but we are not yet instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53464:17"/>
It remaines therefore that we enquire
what is that immediate principle or meanes by
which we shall certainly and infallibly be led
into all truth, and be taught the mind of God,
and understand all his secrets: and this is worth
our knowledge. I cannot say that this will end
your labours, and put a period to your studies,
and make your learning easie: it may possibly
increase your labour, but it will make it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
it will not end your Studies, but it will
direct them; it will not make humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
easie, but will make it <hi>wise unto salvation,</hi>
and conduct it into true notices and wayes of
wisdom.</p>
            <p>I am now to describe to you the right way of
knowledge. <hi>Qui facit voluntatem Patris mei</hi> (saith
Christ) that's the way: <hi>do Gods will, and you shall
understand Gods Word.</hi> And it was an excellent
saying of St. <hi>Peter, Add to your faith Vertue,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>If these things be in you and abound, ye shall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note>
For in this case it is not enough that all our hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
of knowledge are removed; for that
is but the opening of the covering of the Book
of God: but when it is opened, it is written
with a hand that every eye cannot read.
Though the windowes of the East be open, yet
every eye cannot behold the glories of the Sun.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53464:18"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, saith <hi>Plotinus</hi>;
the eye that is not made Solar cannot see the
Sun; the eye must be fitted to the splendor: and
is not the wit of the man, but the spirit of the
man; not so much his head as his heart, that
learnes the Divine Philosophy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now in this inquiry I must take one
thing for a <hi>praecognitum,</hi> that every good man is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he is <hi>taught of God</hi>: and indeed unless
he teach us, we shall make but ill Scholars our
selves, and worse guides to others. <hi>Nemo potest
Deum scire, nisi à Deo doceatur,</hi> said St. <hi>Jrenaeus,</hi>
(<hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14.) If God teaches us, then all is well:
but if we do not learn wisdom at his feet, from
whence should we have it? it can come from
no other spring. And therefore it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
that by how much nearer we are to God,
by so much better we are like to be instructed.</p>
            <p>But this being supposed, as being most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
we can easily proceed by wonderfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and steps of progression in the Oeconomy
of this Divine Philosophy. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is in every righteous man a new
vital principle: the Spirit of Grace is the spirit
of Wisdome, and teaches us by secret inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by proper arguments, by actuall perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
by personall applications, by effects and
energies: and as the soul of a man is the cause
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53464:18"/>
of all his vitall operations, so is the Spirit of
God the life of that life, and the cause of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and productions Spirituall. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this is what St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us of; <hi>Ye
have received the Unction from above: and that anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teacheth you all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 27.</note> All things of some one
kind: that is, certainly, <hi>all things that pertain to
life and Godlinesse</hi>; all that by which a <hi>man</hi> is wise
and happy. We see this by common experience.
Unlesse the soul have a new life put into it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
there be a vital principle within, unlesse
the spirit of life be the Informer of the spirit of
the man, the Word of God will be as dead in
the operation as the body in its powers and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities.
<hi>Sol &amp; Homo generant hominem,</hi> saith our
Philosophy. A Man alone does not beget a
man; but a Man and the Sun: for without the
influence of the Celestiall bodyes all natural
actions are ineffective: and so it is in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>Which principle divers Fanatics, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us and in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
look for new Revelations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be conducted by ecstasy, and will not
pray but in a transfiguration, and live upon rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and extravagant expectations, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselves from the conversation of men
by affectations, by new measures and singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53464:19"/>
and destroy order and despise Government,
and live upon illiterate phantasmes and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
discourses. These men do <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>they bely the holy Ghost</hi>: For the Spirit of
God makes men wise; it is an evil Spirit that
makes them Fools. The Spirit of God makes us
<hi>Wise unto Salvation,</hi> it does not spend its holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
in disguises and convulsions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Gods spirit does not destroy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but heightens it: he never disorders the
beauties of Government, but is a God of Order;
it is the spirit of Humility, and teaches no Pride:
he is to be found in Churches and Pulpits,
upon Altars and in the Doctors Chaires; not in
Conventicles and mutinous corners of a
house: he goes in company with his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and makes progressions by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of life: his infusions are just as our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and his Graces pursue the methods of
nature: that which was imperfect he leads on
to perfection, and that which was weake he
makes strong: he opens the heart, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
murmurs, or to attend to secret whispers,
but to hear the Word of God; and then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
the heart, and creates a new one; and
without this new creation, this new principle
of life, we may heare the Word of God, but we
can never understand it; we heare the sound,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53464:19"/>
but are never the better; unlesse there be in our
hearts a secret conviction by the spirit of God,
the Gospel it self is a dead Letter, and worketh
not in us the light and righteousness of God.</p>
            <p>Do not we see this by a daily experience?
Even those things which a good man and an
evil man know, they do not know them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
A wicked man does know that good is
lovely, and sin is of an evill and destructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and when he is reproved, he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
and when he is observed, he is ashamed;
and when he hath done, he is unsatisfied; and
when he pursues his sin, he does it in the dark.
Tell him he shall dye, and he sighs deeply, but
he knows it as well as you: proceed, and say
that after death comes Judgement, and the
poor man believes and trembles. He knows
that God is angry with him; and if you tell
him that for ought he knows he may be in Hell
to morrow, he knows that it is an intolerable
truth, but it it also undeniable. And yet after
all this he runs to commit his sin with as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an event and resolution, as if he knew no
argument against it. These notices of things
terrible and true passe through his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as an Eagle through the Air: as long as her
flight lasted, the Air was shaken; but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
no path behind her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53464:20"/>
Now since at the same time we see other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
not so learned it may be, not so much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Scriptures, yet they say a thing is good
and lay hold of it, they believe glorious things
of Heaven, and they live accordingly, as men
that believe themselves; halfe a word is enough
to make them understand; a nod is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reproof; the Crowing of a Cock, the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Lark, the dawning of the day, and
the washing their hands are to them competent
memorialls of Religion and warnings of their
duty: What is the reason of this difference?
They both read the Scriptures, they read and
heare the same <hi>Sermons,</hi> they have capable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
they both believe what they heare
and what they read, and yet the event is vastly
different. The reason is that which I am now
speaking of: the one understands by one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
the other by another; the one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
by Nature, and the other by Grace; the
one by humane Learning, and the other by
Divine; the one reads the Scriptures without,
and the other within; the one understands as a
son of man, the other as a son of <hi>God</hi>; the one
perceives by the proportions of the World, and
the other by the measures of the Spirit; the one
understands by Reason, and the other by Love;
and therefore he does not only understand the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53464:20"/>
               <hi>Sermons</hi> of the Spirit, and perceives their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but he pierces deeper, and knows the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that meaning, that is, the secret of the
Spirit, that which is spiritually discerned, that
which gives life to the Proposition, and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Soul.</p>
            <p>And the reason is, because he hath a Divine
principle within him, and a new understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
that is plainly, he hath Love, and that's
more then Knowledge; as was rarely well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by St. Paul, <hi>Knowledge puffethup, but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
edifieth</hi>; that is, Charity makes the best Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
No <hi>Sermons</hi> can edify you, no Scriptures
can build you up a holy building to God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the love of God, be in your hearts; and
<hi>purifie your souls from all filthinesse of the Flesh and
spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But so it is in the regions of <hi>Starrs,</hi> where a
vast body of fire is so divided by excentric mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that it looks as if Nature had parted them
into Orbes and round shells of plain and purest
materialls: but where the cause is simple and
the matter without variety, the motions must
be uniforme; and in Heaven we should either
espy no motion, or no variety. But God, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the Heavens to be the causes of all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and motions here below, hath placed his
Angels in their houses of light, and given to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53464:21"/>
every one of his appointed officers a portion of
the fiery matter to circumagitate and roll; and
now the wonder ceases: for if it be enquired
why this part of the fire runs Eastward and the
other to the South, they being both indifferent
to either, it is because an Angel of God sits in
the Centre, and makes the same matter turne,
not by the bent of its own mobility and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but in order to the needs of Man and
the great purposes of God; and so it is in the
understandings of men: When they all receive
the same notions, and are taught by the same
Master, and give full consent to all the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and can of themselves have nothing to
distinguish them in the events, it is because God
hath sent his Divine spirit, and kindles a new
fire, and creates a braver capacity, and applies
the actives to the passives, and blesses their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For there is in the heart of man such a
dead sea, and an indisposition to holy flames,
like as in the cold Rivers in the North, so as the
fires will not burn them, and the Sun it self will
never warme them, till Gods holy Spirit does
from the Temple of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> bring a
holy flame, and make it shine and burn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Naturall man</hi> (saith the holy Apostle) <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive the things of the Spirit</hi>: <hi>they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

he that discourses of things by the measures of
sense, thinks nothing good but that which is
delicious to the palat, or pleases the brutish part
of man; and therefore while he estimates the
secrets of Religion by such measures, they must
needs seeme as insipid as Cork, or the uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

said St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>: the fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can never mingle; so neither can sensuality
and the watchfulnesse and wise discerning of
the spirit. <hi>Pilato interroganti de veritate, Christus
non respondit</hi>: When the wicked Governour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of Christ concerning truth, Christ gave him
no answer. He was not fit to heare it.</p>
            <p>He therefore who so understands the Words
of God, that he not only believes, but loves the
proposition; he who consents with all his
heart, and being convinced of the truth does
also apprehend the necessity, and obeys the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and delights in the discovery, and layes his
hand upon his heart, and reduces the notices of
things to the practice of duty; he who dares
trust his proposition, and drives it on to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53464:22"/>
ssue, resolving to goe after it whither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it can invite him; this Man walks in the
spirit: at least thus far he is gone towards it, his
Understanding is brought <hi>in obsequium Christi,</hi>
into the obedience of Christ. This is a <hi>loving
God with all our mind</hi>; and whatever goes less then
this, is but Memory, and not Understanding;
or else such notice of things by which a man is
neither the wiser nor the better.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes God gives to his choicest, his
most elect and precious Servants, a knowledge
even of secret things, which he communicates
not to others. We find it greatly remark'd in
the case of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18. 17. <hi>And the Lord
said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing that I do?</hi>
Why not from <hi>Abraham</hi>? God tells us. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>For
I know him, that he will command his Children and his
houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the
Lord, to doe justice and judgement.</hi> And though this
be irregular and infrequent, yet it is a reward of
their piety, and the proper increase also of the
spirituall man. We find this spoken by God to
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and promised to be the lot of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man in the dayes of the <hi>Messias</hi>; <hi>Many shall

man is a Fool and an Ignorant: it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said that <hi>None of the wicked shall understand</hi> the
wisdome and mysteriousnesse of the Kingdome
of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A <hi>good life</hi> is the best way to understand Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Religion, because by the experiences
and relishes of Religion there is conveyed to
them such a sweetnesse, to which all wicked
men are strangers: there is in the things of God
to them which practice them a deliciousnesse
that makes us love them, and that love admits
us into Gods Cabinet, and strangely clarifies the
understanding by the purification of the heart.
For when our reason is raised up by the spirit of
Christ, it is turned quickly into experience:
when our Faith relyes upon the principles of
Christ, it is changed into vision: &amp; so long as we
know God only in the wayes of man, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
Learning, by arguing and dispute, we
see nothing but the shadow of him, and in that
shadow we meet with many dark appearances,
little certainty and much conjecture: But when
we know him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with the
eyes of holinesse and the intuition of gracious
experiences, with a quiet spirit and the peace of
Enjoyment; then we shall heare what we never
heard, and see what our eyes never saw; then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53464:23"/>
the mysteries of Godlinesse shall be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and cleare as the windows of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And this is rarely well expressed by the
Apostle, <hi>If we stand up from the dead and awake from
sleep, then Christ shall give us light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For although the Scriptures themselves are
written by the Spirit of God, yet they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
within and without: and besides the light
that shines upon the face of them, unlesse there
be a light shining within our hearts, unfolding
the leaves and interpreting the mysterious sense
of the spirit, convincing our Consciences and
preaching to our hearts; to look for Christ in
the leaves of the Gospell, is to look for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
amongst the dead. There is a life in them,
but that life is (according to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<hi>hid with Christ in God</hi>: and unlesse the spirit
of God be the <hi>Promo-condus,</hi> we shall never draw
it forth.</p>
            <p>Humane Learning brings excellent ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
towards this: it is admirably usefull for the
reproof of Heresies, for the detection of Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
for the Letter of the Scripture, for Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
testimonies, for exterior advantages; but
there is something beyond this, that <hi>humane</hi>
Learning without the addition of <hi>Divine</hi> can
never teach. <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in all the learning
of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; and the holy men of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53464:23"/>
the glories of God in the admirable
order, motion and influences of the Heaven:
but besides all this, they were taught of God
something far beyond these prettinesses. <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
read <hi>Moses</hi>'s Books, and so did <hi>Plato</hi>; and yet
they became not Proselytes of the Religion,
though they were learned Scholars of such a
Master. The reason is, because that which they
drew forth from thence was not the life and
secret of it.</p>
            <q>Tradidit arcano quodcunque Volumine Moses.</q>
            <p>There is a secret in these Books, which few men,
none but the Godly, did understand: and
though much of this secret is made manifest in
the Gospel, yet even here also there is a <hi>Letter</hi>
and there is a <hi>Spirit</hi>: still there is a reserve for
Gods secret ones, even all those deep mysteries
which the old Testament covered in Figures, and
stories, and names, and prophesies, and which
Christ hath, and by his Spirit will yet reveale
more plainly to all that will understand them
by their proper measures. For although the
Gospel is infinitely more legible and plain then
the obscurer Leaves of the Law, yet there is a
seale upon them also: <hi>which Seale no man shall open
but he that is worthy.</hi> We may understand some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it by the three Children of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
they were all skil'd in all the wisdom of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53464:24"/>
the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> and so was <hi>Daniel</hi>: but there was
something beyond that in him; <hi>the wisdom of the
most high God was in him,</hi> and that taught him a
learning beyond his learning.</p>
            <p>In all Scripture there is a spirituall sense, a
spirituall <hi>Cabala,</hi> which as it tends directly to
holiness, so it is best and truest understood by
the sons of the Spirit, who love God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
know him. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, every
thing is best known by its own similitudes and
analogies.</p>
            <p>But I must take some other time to speak ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of these things. I have but one thing more
to say, and then I shall make my Applications
of this Doctrine, and so conclude.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, there is a sort of Gods deare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
who walk in perfectnesse, who <hi>perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
in the feare of God</hi>; and they have a degree
of Clarity and divine knowledge more then
we can discourse of, and more certain then the
Demonstrations of Geometry, brighter then
the Sun, and indeficient as the light of Heaven.
This is called by the Apostle the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
Christ is this brightnesse of God, manifested in
the hearts of his dearest servants.</p>

            </q>
            <p>But I shall say no more of this at this time,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53464:24"/>
for this is to be felt and not to be talked of; and
they that never touched it with their finger,
may secretly perhaps laugh at it in their heart,
and be never the wiser. All that I shall now
say of it is, that a good man is united unto God
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as a flame touches a flame, and
combines into splendor and to glory: so is the
Spirit of a man united unto Christ by the spirit
of God. These are the friends of God, and they
best know Gods mind, and they only that are so
know how much such men do know. They
have a special <hi>Unction from above.</hi> So that now
you are come to the top of all: this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
round of the Ladder, and the Angels stand
upon it: they dwell in love and Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they worship and obey, but dispute not;
and our quarrels and impertinent wranglings
about Religion are nothing else but the want of
the measures of this State. Our light is like a
Candle, every wind of vain Doctrine blows it
out, or spends the wax, and makes the light
tremulous; but the lights of Heaven are sixed
and bright, and shine for ever.</p>
            <p>But that we may speak not only things myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
but things intelligible; how does it come
to passe, by what means and what Oeconomy
is it effected, that a holy life is the best determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all Questions, and the surest way of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53464:25"/>
knowledge? Is it to be supposed that a Godly
man is better enabled to determine the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Purgatory or Transubstantiation? is the
gift of Chastity the best way to reconcile <hi>Thomas</hi>
and <hi>Scotus</hi>? and is a temperate man alwayes a
better Scholar then a Drunkard? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that in all things in which true wisdom
consists, Holinesse, which is the best wisdom,
is the surest way of understanding them. And
this</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is effected by Holinesse as a proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
instrument: for naturally every thing is
best discerned by its proper light and congenial
instrument.</p>
            <q>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</q>
            <p>For as the eye sees visible objects, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
perceives the Intellectual; so does
the spirit the things of the Spirit. <hi>The naturall
man</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>) <hi>knows not the things of God, for
they are Spiritually discerned</hi>: that is, they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by a proper light, and concerning
these things an unsanctified man discourses
pittifully, with an imperfect <hi>Idea,</hi> as a blind
man does of Light and Colours which he never
saw.</p>
            <p>A good man, though unlearned in secular
notices, is like the windows of the Temple,
narrow without and broad within: he sees not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53464:25"/>
so much of what profits not abroad, but what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is within, and concerns Religion and the
glorifications of God, that he sees with a broad
inspection. But all humane learning without
God is but blindnesse and ignorant folly.</p>
            <p>But when it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
righteousnesse dipt in the wells of Truth, it
is like an eye of Gold in a rich Garment, or like
the light of Heaven, it shews it self by its own
splendor. What Learning is it to discourse of
the Philosophy of the Sacrament, if you do
not feel the virtue of it? and the man that can
with eloquence and subtilty discourse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
efficacy of Baptismal waters, talkes
ignorantly in respect of him who hath <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of a good Conscience</hi> within, and is cleansed by
the purifications of the Spirit. If the Question
concern any thing that can perfect a man and
make him happy, all that is the proper know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and notice of the good man. How can a
wicked man understand the purities of the
heart? and how can an evil and unworthy
Communicant tell what it is to have received
Christ by faith, to dwell with him, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, to receive him in his heart? The
good man only understands that: the one sees
the colour, and the other feels the substance;
the one discourses of the Sacrament, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53464:26"/>
receives Christ; the one discourses for or
against Transubstantiation, but the good man
feels himself to be changed and so joyn'd to
Christ, that he only understands the true sense
of Transubstantiation, while he becomes to
Christ bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, and of
the same spirit with his Lord.</p>
            <p>We talk much of Reformation, and (blessed
be God) once we have felt the good of it: But
of late we have smarted under the name and
pretension. The Woman that lost her groate,
<hi>everrit domum,</hi> not <hi>evertit</hi>; she swept the house,
she did not turn the house out of doors. That
was but an ill Reformation that untiled the
Roof, and broak the Walls, and was digging
down the Foundation.</p>
            <p>Now among all the pretensions of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
who can tell better what is, and what is
not, true Reformation, then he that is truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
himself? He knows what pleases God,
and can best tell by what instruments he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
<hi>The mouth of the just bringeth forth wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>;
<hi>and the lips of the righteous know what is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
saith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 31, 32.</note> He cannot be cousen'd by
names of things, and feels that Reformation to
be Imposture that is Sacrilegious: himself is
humble and obedient, and therefore knows
that is not Truth that perswades to Schisme and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53464:26"/>
Disobedience: and most of the Questions of
Christendom are such which either are good
for nothing, and therefore to be layd aside; or
if they be complicated with action, and are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteries
of practice, no man can judge them so
well as the spirituall man. <hi>That which best pleases
God, that which does good to our Neighbour, that which
teaches sobriety, that which combines with Government,
that which speaks honour of God and does him honour,</hi>
that only is Truth. Holinesse therefore is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and naturall instrument of Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and must needs be the best way of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Questions of Christendom, because
in the most of them a Duty is complicated with
the Proposition.</p>
            <p>No man that intends to live holily can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffer any pretences of Religion to be made
to teach him to fight against his <hi>King.</hi> And
when the men of <hi>Geneva</hi> turned their Bishop
out of doors, they might easily have considered
that the same person was their Prince too; and
that must needs be a strange Religion that rose
up against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> at the same time: but
that hath been the method ever since. There
was no Church till then was ever Governed
without an Apostle or a <hi>Bishop</hi>: and since then,
they who go from their Bishop have said very
often to their <hi>King</hi> too, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare</hi>:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53464:27"/>
and when we see men pretending Religion, and
yet refuse to own the Kings Supremacy, they
may upon the stock of holinesse easily reprove
their own folly; by considering that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusancy
does introduce into our Churches the
very worst, the most intolerable parts of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For <hi>perfect submission to</hi> Kings <hi>is the glory of the</hi>
Protestant <hi>cause</hi>: and really the reproveable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are by nothing so
much confuted, as that they destroy good life
by consequent and evident deduction; as by
an Induction of particulars were easie to make
apparent, if this were the proper season for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Holinesse is not only an advantage to the
learning all wisdom and holinesse, but for the
discerning that which is wise and holy from
what is trifling and uselesse and contentious:
and to one of these heads all Questions will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
and therefore in all, from Holinesse we
have the best Instructions. And this brings me
to the next Particle of the generall Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For that which we are taught by the holy
Spirit of God, this <hi>new nature,</hi> this <hi>vital principle</hi>
within us, it is that which is worth our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
not vaine and empty, idle and insignificant
notions, in which when you have laboured till
your eyes are fixed in their Orbes and your flesh
unfixed from its bones, you are no better and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53464:27"/>
no wiser. If the Spirit of God be your Teacher,
he will teach you such truths as will make you
know and love God, and become like to him,
and enjoy him for ever, by passing from simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to union and eternal fruition. But what
are you the better if any man should pretend to
teach you whether every Angel makes a <hi>species</hi>?
and what is the individuation of the Soul in the
state of separation? what are you the wiser if
you should study and find out what place <hi>Adam</hi>
should for ever have lived in if he had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len?
and what is any man the more learned if
he heares the disputes, whether <hi>Adam</hi> should
have multiplied Children in the state of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and what would have been the event of
things if one Child had been born before his
Fathers sin?</p>
            <p>Too many Scholars have lived upon Air and
empty notions for many ages past, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themselves with tying and untying Knots,
like <hi>Hypochondriacs</hi> in a fit of Melancholy, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>nothing,</hi> and troubling themselves with
<hi>nothing,</hi> and falling out about <hi>nothings,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very wise and very learned in things that
are not and work not, and were never planted
in <hi>Paradise</hi> by the finger of God. Mens notions
are too often like the Mules, begotten by aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall
and unnaturall Generations; but they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53464:28"/>
make no <hi>species</hi>: they are begotten, but they can
beget nothing: they are the effects of long study,
but they can do no good when they are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
they are not that which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls <hi>viam
intelligentiae, the way of understanding.</hi> If the Spirit
of God be our Teacher, we shall learn to avoid
evil, and to do good, to be wise and to be holy,
to be profitable and carefull: and they that
walk in this way shall find more peace in their
Consciences, more skill in the Scriptures, more
satisfaction in their doubts, then can be obtain'd
by all the polemical and impertinent disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the world. And if the holy spirit can
teach us how vain a thing it is to do foolish
things, he also will teach us how vain a thing it
is to trouble the world with foolish Questions,
to disturb the Church for interest or pride, to
resist Government in things indifferent, to
spend the peoples zeale in things unprofitable,
to make Religion to consist in outsides, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to circumstances and trifling regards.
No, no, the Man that is wise, he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by the Spirit of God, knows better in
what Christs Kingdom does consist, then to
throw away his time and interest and peace and
safety; for what? for Religion? no: for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Religion? not so much: for the garment
of the body of Religion? no, not for so much:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53464:28"/>
but for the <hi>Fringes</hi> of the <hi>garment</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of
<hi>Religion</hi>; for such and no better are the disputes
that trouble our discontented Brethren; they
are <hi>things,</hi> or rather <hi>Circumstances</hi> and <hi>manners</hi>
of <hi>things,</hi> in which the Soul and spirit is not at all
concerned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Holinesse of life is the best way of finding
out truth and understanding; not only as a
<hi>Naturall medium,</hi> nor only as a <hi>prudent medium, but
as a means by way of Divine blessing. He that hath my
Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,
and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 21.</note>
Here we have a promise for it; and upon that
we may rely.</p>
            <p>The old man that confuted the <hi>Arian</hi> Priest
by a plain recitall of his <hi>Creed,</hi> found a mighty
power of God effecting his own Work by a
strange manner, and by a very plain instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
it wrought a divine blessing just as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
use to doe: and this Lightning some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
comes in a strange manner as a peculiar
blessing to good men. For God kept the secrets
of his Kingdom from the wise Heathens and
the learned <hi>Jewes,</hi> revealing them to Babes, not
because they had less learning, but because they
had more love; they were children and Babes
in <hi>Malice,</hi> they loved Christ, and so he became
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53464:29"/>
to them a light and a glory. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had more
learning then they all; and <hi>Moses</hi> was instructed
in all the Learning of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>: yet because
he was the meekest man upon Earth, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the wisest, and to his humane Learning in
which he was excellent, he had a divine light
and excellent wisdome superadded to him by
way of spiritual blessings. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though
he went very far to the knowledge of many
great and excellent truths by the force of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
learning, yet he was far short of perfective
truth and true wisdom till he learned a new
lesson in a new School, at the feet of one greater
then his <hi>Ganialiel</hi>: his learning grew much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
his notions brighter, his skill deeper, by the
love of Christ, and his desires, his passionate
desires after <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The force and use of humane learning and
of this <hi>Divine learning</hi> I am now speaking of, are
both well expressed by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 29.
11, 12. <hi>And the vision of all is become unto you as the
words of a Book that is sealed, which men deliver to one
that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he
saith, I cannot, for it is seal'd. And the Book is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray
thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</hi> He that is no
learned man, who is not bred up in the Schools
of the Prophets, cannot read Gods Book for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53464:29"/>
want of learning. For humane Learning is the
gate and first entrance of Divine vision; not the
only one indeed, but the common gate. But
beyond this, there must be another learning;
for he that is learned, bring the Book to him,
and you are not much the better as to the secret
part of it, if the Book be sealed, if his eyes be
closed, if his heart be not opened, if God does
not speak to him in the secret way of discipline.
Humane learning is an excellent Foundation;
but the top-stone is laid by Love and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the will of God. For we may further
observe, that blindnesse, errour and Ignorance
are the punishments which God sends upon
wicked and ungodly men. <hi>Etiamsi propter nostrae
intelligentiae tarditatem &amp; vitae demeritum veritas non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
se apertissime ostenderit,</hi> was St. <hi>Austin's</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The truth hath not yet been manifested
fully to us, <hi>by reason of our demerits</hi>: our sins have
hindred the brightnesse of the truth from shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon us. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> observes, that when
the Heathens gave themselves <hi>over to lusts, God
gave them over to strong delusions, and to believe a Lie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 25, 26.</note>
But <hi>God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom
and knowledge and joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 2. 26.</note> said the wise <hi>Preacher.</hi> But
this is most expresly promised in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and particularly in that admirable <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
which our blessed Saviour preach'd a little
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53464:30"/>
before his death. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy
Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall
teach you all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14. 26.</note> Well: there's our Teacher
told of plainly. But how shall we obtain this
teacher, and how shall we be taught? <hi>v.</hi> 15,
16, 17. Christ will pray for us that we may
have this spirit. That's well: but shall all
Christians have the spirit? Yes, all that will live
like Christians: for so said Christ, <hi>If ye love me,
keep my Commandements; and I will pray the Father,
and he will give you another Comforter, that may abide
with you for ever; even the spirit of truth, whom
the World cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knoweth him.</hi> Mark these things. The Spirit
of God is our teacher: he will abide with
us for ever to be our teacher: he will teach us all
things; but how? <hi>if ye love Christ,</hi> if ye keep his
Commandments, but not else: if ye be of the
World, that is, of worldly affections, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see him, ye cannot know him. And this
is the particular I am now to speak to, The
way by which the Spirit of God teaches us in
all the wayes and secrets of God is Love and
Holinesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secreta Dei Deo nostro et filiis domus ejus,</hi> Gods
secrets are to himself and the sons of his House,
saith the <hi>Jewish</hi> Proverb. Love is the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Divine knowledge, that is the

               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the height of all that is to be
taught or learned. Love is Obedience, and we
learn his words best when we practise them:
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, said <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>:<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Ethic. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note>
those things which they that learn ought
to practise, even while they practise they will
best learn.<note place="margin">Nullum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num perfectè noscitur quod non perfectè amatur.</note> 
               <hi>Quisquis non venit, profectò nec didicit:
Ita enim Dominus docet per Spiritus gratiam, ut quod
quisque didicerit, non tantum cognoscendo videat, sed
etiam volendo appetat &amp; agendo perficiat.</hi> St. <hi>Austin
De gratia Christi lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 83. qu. de gratia Christi.</note> Unlesse we come to
Christ, we shall never learn: for so our Blessed
Lord teaches us by the grace of his spirit, that
what any one learns, he not only sees it by
knowledge, but desires it by choice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it by practice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When this is reduced to practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
we find not only in things of practise,
but even in deepest mysteries, not only the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
and most eminent Saints, but even every
good man can best tell what is true, and best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
an error.</p>
            <p>He that goes about to speak of and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>mysterious Trinity,</hi> and does it by words
and names of mans invention, or by such which
signifie contingently, if he reckons this mystery
by the Mythology of Numbers, by the <hi>Cabala</hi>
of Letters, by the distinctions of the School, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53464:31"/>
by the weak inventions of disputing people; if he
only talks of Essences and existencies, Hypostases
and personalities, distinctions without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and priority in Coequalities, and unity
in Pluralities, and of superior Praedicates of no
larger extent then the inferior Subjects, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
himself, and find his understanding will be
like St. <hi>Peters</hi> upon the Mount of <hi>Tabor</hi> at
the Transfiguration: he may build three Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles
in his head, and talke something, but
he knows not what. But the good man that
feels the <hi>power of the Father,</hi> and he to whom the
Son is become <hi>Wisdom, Righteousnesse, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
and <hi>Redemption</hi>; he in <hi>whose heart the love of
the Spirit of God is spread,</hi> to whom God hath
communicated the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Comforter</hi>;
this man, though he understands nothing of
that which is unintelligible, yet <hi>he only</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the mysteriousnesse of the Holy Trinity.
No man can be convinced well and wisely of
the Article of the <hi>Holy, Blessed</hi> and <hi>Undivided
Trinity,</hi> but he that feels the mightiness of the
Father begetting him to <hi>a new life,</hi> the wisdome
of the Son <hi>building him up in a most holy Faith,</hi> and
the <hi>love of the spirit of God</hi> making him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like unto God.</p>
            <p>He that hath passed from his Childhood in
Grace under the spirituall generation of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53464:31"/>
and is gone forward to be <hi>a young man</hi> in
Christ, strong and vigorous in holy actions and
holy undertakings, and from thence is become
an old Disciple, and strong and grown old in
Religion, and the conversation of the Spirit;
this man best understands the secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discernable
Oeconomie, he feels this unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
mysterie, and sees with his heart what his
tongue can never express, and his Metaphysics
can never prove. In these cases Faith and Love
are the best Knowledge, and <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ is best
known by <hi>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi>; and if
the Kingdom of God be <hi>in us,</hi> then we know
God, and are known of him: and when we
communicate of the Spirit of God, when we
pray for him, and have received him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him, and dwelt with him, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
our selves by his holy fires, then we
know him too. But there is no other satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
knowledge of the Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> but this:
And therefore whatever thing is spoken of God
<hi>Metaphysically,</hi> there is no knowing of God <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically</hi>
and as he ought to be known, but by the
measures of Holinesse and the proper light of
the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this case Experience is the best learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Christianity is the best institution, and
the Spirit of God is the best teacher, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53464:32"/>
is the greatest wisdome; and he that sins
most is the most Ignorant, and the humble and
obedient man is the best Scholar. <hi>For the Spirit
of God is a loving Spirit, and will not enter into a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Soul: But he that keepeth the Law getteth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
thereof, and the perfection of the fear of the
Lord is wisdom,</hi> said the wise <hi>Ben-Sirach.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 21. 11.</note> And
now give me leave to apply the Doctrine to you,
and so I shall dismisse you from this attention.</p>
            <p>Many wayes have been attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the differences of the Church in matters
of Religion, and all the Counsels of man have
yet proved ineffective. Let us now try Gods
Method, let us betake our selves to live holily,
and then the spirit of God will lead us into all
truth. And indeed <hi>it matters not what Religion any
man is of, if he be a Villaine</hi>; the opinion of his
Sect, as it will not save his Soul, so neither will
it do good to the publick. But this is a sure
Rule; If the holy man best understands Wisdom
and Religion, then by the proportions of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
we shall best measure the Doctrines that
are obtruded to the disturbance of our peace,
and the dishonour of the Gospell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is no good Religion whose Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
destroy any duty of Religion. He that shall
maintain it to be lawfull to make a <hi>War</hi> for
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53464:32"/>
the defence of his <hi>Opinion</hi> be it what it will, his
Doctrine is against Godlinesse. Any thing that
is proud, any thing that is peevish and scornful,
any thing that is uncharitable, is against the
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that <hi>forme of sound Doctrine</hi> which
the Apostle speaks of. And I remember that
<hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> telling of <hi>George</hi> a proud
and factious Minister, that he was an Informer
against his Brethren, he sayes, he did it <hi>oblitus
professionis suae, quae nil nisi justum suadet &amp; lene</hi>; He
forgot his profession, which teaches nothing but
justice and meeknesse, kindnesses and charity.
And however <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others are pleased
to take but indirect and imperfect notice of it,
yet <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is the best note of the true Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is but an ill sign of Holinesse when a
man is busie in troubling himself and his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
in little Scruples and Phantastick Opinions
about things not concerning the life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or the pleasure of God, or the excellencies of
the Spirit. A good man knows how to please
God, how to converse with him, how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Kingdome of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> to
set forwards Holinesse and the love of God and
of his Brother; and he knows also that there is
no Godliness in spending our time and our talk,
our heart and our spirits, about the garments
and outsides of Religion. And they can ill teach
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53464:33"/>
others, that do not know that Religion does not
consist in these things; but Obedience may, and
<hi>reductively</hi> that is Religion; and he that for that
which is no part of Religion destroys Religion
directly, by neglecting that duty that is adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into Religion, is a man of fancy and of the
World: but he gives but an ill account that
he is a man of God, and a son of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Spend not your time in that which profits
not; for your labour and your health, your
time and your studies are very valuable; and it
is a thousand pitties to see a diligent and a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
person spend himself in gathering Cockle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells
and little pebbles, in telling Sands upon
the shores, and making Garlands of uselesse
Daisies. Study that which is profitable, that
which will make you useful to Churches and
Common-wealths, that which will make
you desirable and wise. Onely I shall add
this to you, That in <hi>Learning</hi> there are variety of
things as well as in <hi>Religion</hi>: there is Mint and
Cummin, and there are the weighty things of
the Law; so there are studies more and lesse
usefull, and every thing that is usefull will be
required in its time: and I may in this also use
the words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>These things
ought you to</hi> look after, and <hi>not to leave the other</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded.
But your great care is to be in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53464:33"/>
things of God and of Religion, in holiness and
true wisdom, remembring the saying of <hi>Origen,</hi>
that the knowledge that arises from goodnesse
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, something that is more
certain and more divine then all demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then all other Learnings of the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That's no good Religion that disturbs
Governments, or shakes a foundation of publick
peace. <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> are the foundations
and the great principles of unity, of peace and
Government; like <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> they build
up the house of <hi>Israel</hi>: and those blind <hi>Samsons</hi>
that shake these Pillars intend to pull the house
down. <hi>My Son, fear God and the King,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon</hi>;
<hi>and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> That
is not Truth that loves changes: and the new-nothings
of Heretical &amp; Schismatical Preachers
are infinitely far from the blessings of Truth.</p>
            <p>In the only Language <hi>Truth</hi> hath a Mysterious
Name, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Emet</hi>; it consists of three Letters, the
first and the last and the middle most of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Letters: implying to us that <hi>Truth</hi> is first,
and will be last, and it is the same all the way,
and combines and unites all extreams; it tyes all
ends together. <hi>Truth is lasting, and ever full of
blessing.</hi> For the <hi>Jews</hi> observe that those Letters
which signifie <hi>Truth,</hi> are both in the figure and
the number <hi>Quadrate,</hi> firme and cubical; these
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53464:34"/>
signifie a foundation, and an abode for ever.
Whereas on the other side, the word which in
<hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies <hi>a lye,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Secher,</hi> is made of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whose numbers are imperfect, and their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
pointed and voluble: to signifie that a <hi>Lye
hath no foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this very observation will give good
light in our Questions and disputes. And I give
my instance in <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> which hath
been of so lasting an abode, of so long a blessing,
hath its firmament by the principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
hath been blessed by the issues of that
stabiliment, it hath for sixteen hundred yeares
combined with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and hath been taught
by the spirit which hath so long dwelt in Gods
Church, and hath now (according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that sayes <hi>the gates of Hell shall never
prevail against the Church</hi>) been restored amongst
us by a heap of Miracles; and as it went away,
so now it is returned againe in the hand of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
and in the bosome of our Fundamental
Laws. Now that Doctrine must needs be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of Error and an intolerable Lye that
speaks against this Truth, which hath had so
long a testimony from God, and from the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and experience of so many ages, of all our
<hi>Ancestors,</hi> and all our <hi>Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Spirit of God wrote in <hi>Greek,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53464:34"/>
Christ is call'd A and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: if he had spoken <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
he had been called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is Christ is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>Emet,</hi> he is <hi>Truth,</hi> the same yesterday and to day
and for ever: and whoever opposes this holy
Sanction which Christs Spirit hath sanctifyed,
his word hath warranted, his blessings have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared,
his promises have ratifyed, and his
Church hath alwayes kept, he fights against this

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Emet,</hi> and <hi>Secher</hi> is his portion; his Lot is
<hi>a Lie,</hi> his portion is there where holiness can
never dwell.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, to you <hi>Fathers</hi> and
<hi>Brethren,</hi> you who are, or intend to be of the
<hi>Clergie</hi>; you see here the best <hi>Compendium</hi> of your
Studies, the best abbreviature of your labours,
the truest method of wisdom, and the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the only way of judging concerning the
Disputes and Questions in Christendom. It is
not by reading multitude of Books, but by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
the truth of God: it is not by laborious
Commentaries of the <hi>Doctors</hi> that you can fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
your work, but by the expositions of the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi>: is is not by the Rules of <hi>Metaphysics,</hi>
but by the proportions of <hi>Holinesse</hi>: and when
all Books are read, and all Arguments examined,
and all Authorities alledged, nothing can be
found to be true that is unholy. <hi>Give your selves
to reading, to exhortation, and to Doctrine,</hi> saith St.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53464:35"/>
               <hi>Paul. Read</hi> all good Books you can: but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>
unto good life is the best Instrument,
and the best teacher of true <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of that
which is <hi>according to Godlinesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let me tell you this, The great learning
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> was more owing to their piety
then to their skill; more to God then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and to this purpose is that excellent eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> with which I will
conclude.<q>O blessed and happy men, whose
names are in the Book of life, from whom the
Devils fled and Heretics did feare them, who
(by Holinesse) have stopp'd the mouthes of
them that spake perverse things! But I, like
<hi>David,</hi> will cry out, <hi>Where are thy loving-kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which have been ever of old?</hi> Where is the

like lights in the World, and contained
the <hi>Word of Life</hi>? <hi>Dulce est meminisse</hi>; their very

               </q>These were the men that prevailed against Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
because they lived according to Truth:
and whoever shall oppose you and the truth
you walk by, may better be confuted by your

cozen none but the wicked and the negligent,
them that love a lye and live according to it.
