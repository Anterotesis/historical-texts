            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A TRACT ON THE SACRAMENT OF THE Lord's Supper.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Kind SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN peruſal of your Letters together with the Schedule incloſed, no Circumſtance did ſo much move me as this, that ſo ordinary Points as are diſcuſs'd there, and that in a bare and ordinary manner, ſhould amuſe either your ſelf or any Man elſe, that pretends to ordinary Knowledge in Controverſies in Chriſtian Religion. For the Points therein diſcuſs'd are no other than the ſubject of every common Pamphlet, and ſufficiently known (that I may ſo ſay) in every Barber's Shop. Yet becauſe you require my Opinion of matters there in queſtion, I willingly afford it you, though I fear I ſhall more amuſe you with telling you the Truth, than the Diſputants there did, by abuſing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38505:3"/>
you with Error. For the plain and neceſſary (though perhaps unwelcome) Truth is, That in the greater part of the Diſpute, both Parties much miſtook themſelves, and that fell out which is in the common Proverb <hi>ſc, Whilſt the one milks the Ram, the other holds under the Sieve,</hi> That you may ſee this Truth with your Eyes, I divide your whole Diſpute into two Heads; the one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the other concerning the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es miſtaking it ſelf about fundamentals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> it conſiſteth of two parts; of a Propoſition, and of a Reply: The Propoſition expreſſes (at leaſt he that made it intended it ſo to do, though he miſtakes) the Doctrine of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, concerning the preſence of Chriſt in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The Reply doth the like for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſame Argument. Now that you may ſee how indifferently I walk, I will open the miſtakes of both Parties, that ſo the truth of the thing it ſelf (being unclouded of Errors) may the more clearly ſhine forth.</p>
            <p>The firſt miſtake common to both is, That they ground themſelves much upon the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, as they are called, and ſuppoſe, That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pronouncing of thoſe words, ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls that action, which otherwiſe would not; and that without thoſe words the action were lame. <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt confeſs my ignorance unto you. I find no ground for the neceſſity of this doing. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour inſtituting that Holy Ceremony, commands us to do what he did, but leaves us no Precept of ſaying any words; neither will it be made appear, that either the bleſſed Apoſtles, or Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had any ſuch Cuſtom: Nay the contrary will be made probably to appear out of ſome of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt Writings of the Churches Ceremonials. Our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38505:3"/>
Saviour indeed uſed the Word, but it was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what his meaning was; had he barely acted the thing, without expreſſing himſelf by ſome ſuch Form of Words, we could never have known what it was he did. But what neceſſity as there now of ſo doing? for when the Congregation is met together, to the breaking of Bread and Prayer, and ſee Bread and Wine upon the Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is there any Man can doubt of the meaning of it, although the Canon be not read? It was the farther ſolemnizing, and beautifying that holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which brought the Canon in; and not an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of adding any thing to the ſubſtance of the action. For that the words were uſed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to work any thing upon the Bread and Wine, can never out of Scripture or Reaſon be deduced; and beyond theſe two, I have no ground for my Religion, neither in Subſtance nor in Ceremony. The main Foundation that upholds the neceſſity of this form of action now in uſe, is Church-Cuſtom and Church-Error.</p>
            <p>Now for that Topick place of Church-Cuſtom, it is generally too much abuſed: For whereas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the neceſſity of the thing ought to give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the practice of the Church, I know not by what device matters are turned about, and the cuſtomary practice of the Church is alledged to prove the neceſſity of the thing; as if things had received their Original from the Church-Authority, and not as the truth is, from an higher Hand. As for the Church's Error, on which I told you this Form of action is founded, it conſiſts in the uncaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous taking up an unſound ungrounded concluſion of the Fathers, for a religious Maxim. St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> I trow, was he that ſaid it, and poſterity hath too generally applauded it, <hi>Accedat verbum ad elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38505:4"/>
&amp; fiat Sacramentum.</hi> By which they would perſwade us, againſt all experience, That to make up a Sacrament, there muſt be ſomething ſaid and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done; whereas indeed to the perfection of a Sacrament, or holy Myſtery (for both theſe are one) it is ſufficient that one thing be done whereby ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ſignified, though nothing be ſaid at all. When <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was walking in his Garden, a Meſſenger came and asked him, what he would have done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town of <hi>Gabii,</hi> then newly taken? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered nothing, but with his Wand ſtruck off the tops of the higheſt <hi>Poppies</hi>; and the Meſſenger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding his meaning, cut off the Heads of the chief of the City. Had this been done in <hi>Sacris,</hi>it had been forthwith truly a Sacrament, or holy Myſtery. <hi>Cùm in omnibus Scientiis voces ſignificent res, hoc habet proprium Theologia, quòd ipſae res ſignificatae per voces etiam ſignificent aliquid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecond ſignification are all Spiritual and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſenſes founded: So that <hi>in Sacris,</hi> a Myſtery or Sacrament is then acted, when one thing is done and another is ſignified, as it is in the Holy Communion, though nothing be ſaid at all. The ancient Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether weekly, monthly, or yearly, their Paſſover, their ſitting in Booths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe were all Sacraments, yet we find not any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred forms of words, uſed by the Prieſts or People in the execution of them. To ſum up that which we have to ſay in this Point, the calling upon the words of conſecration in the Euchariſt, is too weakly found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made argumentative; for the action is perfect whether thoſe words be uſed or forborn: And in truth to ſpeak my opinion, I ſee no great harm could enſue, were they quite omitted. Certainly thus much good would follow, That ſome part (though not a little one) of the ſuperſtition that adheres to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38505:4"/>
that action, by reaſon of an ungrounded conceit of the neceſſity and force of the words in it, would forthwith pill off and fall away: I would not have you underſtand me ſo, as if I would preſcribe for, or deſire the diſuſe of the words; only two things I would commend to you, Firſt, That the uſe of the Canon is a thing indifferent. And, Secondly, That in this knack of making Sacraments, Chriſtians have taken a greater Liberty than they can well juſtify: Firſt in forging Sacraments, more than God (for ought doth or can appear) did ever intend: And Secondly, in adding to the Sacraments inſtituted of God many formalities, and ceremonial circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon no warrant but their own; which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by long uſe, begat in the minds of Men a conceit, That they were eſſential parts of that to which indeed they were but appendant; and that only by the device of ſome who practiſed a power in the Church more than was convenient.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt common miſtake.</p>
            <p>The Second is worſe than it; You ſee that both Parties agree in the acknowledgement of the real preſence of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though they differ in the manner of his Preſence, and application of himſelf to the receiver; though the Proteſtant Diſputant ſeems to have gone a little beyond his Leader: Had he expreſs'd himſelf in the point of Bread and Wine, what became of it, whether it remain'd in its proper nature yea or no, I could the better have fathom'd him: Now theſe words of his, That the Bread and Wine after conſecration are truly and really the Body of Chriſt, howſoever they are ſuppled and allayed; with that clauſe, <hi>not after a carnal but after a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> yet ſtill remain too crude and raw, and betray the ſpeaker for a <hi>Lutheran</hi> at leaſt, if not for a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38505:5"/>
favourer of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; for as for that Phraſe, <hi>of a ſpiritual manner,</hi> which ſeems to give ſeaſon and moderation to his concluſion, it can yield him but ſmall relief: For firſt, To ſay the fleſh of Chriſt is in the Bread, but <hi>not after a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner,</hi> is but the ſame nonſenſe, which the Divines of <hi>Rome</hi> put upon us on the like occaſion, when telling us, That the Blood of Chriſt is really ſacrificed, and ſhed in the Sacrament, they add by way of Gloſs, that it is done <hi>incruentè,</hi> unbloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by the like Analogy they may tell us, if they pleaſe, That the body of Chriſt is there incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unbodily, Fleſh not carnally may paſs the Preſs jointly the next Edition of the Book of Bulls. Again, in another reſpect, That clauſe, <hi>of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner</hi> doth your Proteſtant Diſputer but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſervice, if any at all; for the Catholick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant contriving with himſelf how to ſeat the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God in the Euchariſt, as may be moſt for his eaſe, tells us, That he is there as Spirits and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Bodies (which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>ſpiritual</hi>) are in the places they poſſeſs; ſo then, the one tells you the Body of Chriſt is there really, but ſpiritually; the other, That he is there really, but as a Spirit in a place, and what now, I pray you, is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them? By the way, in the paſſage you may ſee what account to make of your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſputer. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and with him common ſenſe, tells us thus much, <hi>That he that compares two Bodies together, muſt know them both</hi>; Doth this Gentleman know any thing concerning the ſite and locality of Spirits, and Bodies glorified? if he doth, let him do us the courteſy as to ſhew us, at what price he purchaſed that degree of knowledge, that ſo we may try our Credit, and ſee if we can buy it at the ſame rate; <q>Tertius è Coelo cecidit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</q>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:38505:5"/>
Is he like a ſecond <hi>Paul,</hi> lately deſcended out of the third Heavens, and there hath made us the diſcovery? for by what other means he could at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that knowledge, my dulneſs cannot ſuggeſt. But if he doth not know (as indeed he neither doth nor can, for there is no means left to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that way) then with what congruity can he tell us, That the Body of Chriſt is in the Bread, as Spirits, and glorified Bodies are in their places, if he know not what manner of location and ſite, Spirits and glorified Bodies have? I ſhall not need to prompt your diſcretion thus far, as that you ought not to make dainties of ſuch fruitleſs and deſperate Diſputers; who, as the Apoſtle notes, thruſt themſelves into things they have not ſeen, and upon a falſe ſhew of knowledge, abuſe eaſie Hearers, and of things they know not, adventure to ſpeak they know not what.</p>
            <p>To return then, and conſider a little more of this ſecond miſtake common to both your Diſputants, I will deal as favourably as I can with your Proteſtant Diſputer; for though I think he miſtakes himſelf (for I know no Proteſtant that teacheth, that the common Bread, after the word ſpoken is really made the Body of Chriſt) yet he might well take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus to err out of ſome Proteſtant Writings: For generally the reformed Divines do falſly report that Holy Action, whether you regard the Eſſence or Uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>For firſt, if in regard of the Eſſence, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and that of chief note, ſtick not to ſay, That the words of Conſecration are not a meer <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> and from hence it muſt needs follow, that in ſome ſenſe they muſt needs be taken literally, which is enough to plead authority for the Gentleman's Error. But that which they preach concerning a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38505:6"/>
real preſence and participation of Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament; they expound not by a ſuppoſal that the Bread becomes God's Body, but that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Sacramental Elements, there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the Soul of the worthy Receiver, the very Body and Blood of God; but after a ſecret, ineffable, and wonderfull manner. From hence, as I take it, have proceeded theſe crude ſpeeches of the Learned of the Reformed Parts, ſome dead ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, wherein they take upon them to aſſure the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Rome,</hi> That we acknowledge a Real Preſence as well as they; but for the manner how, <hi>con,</hi> or <hi>trans, or ſub,</hi> or <hi>in,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we play the <hi>Secpticks,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine not. This conceit, beſides the falſhood of it, is a meer novelty, neither is it to be found in the Books of any of the Ancients, till <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> roſe. He out of an unſeaſonable baſhfulneſs, and fear to ſeem to recede too far from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taught to the purpoſe now related, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of Chriſt's Preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and from him it deſcended into the Writings of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> whoſe Authority have well-near ſpread it over the face of the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. This is an Error which, as I ſaid, touches the Eſſence of that holy Action; but there are many now which touch the end and uſe of it, which are practiſed by the Reformed Parts; for out of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant fancy they have of it, they abuſe it to many ends of which we may think the firſt Inſtituter (ſave that he was God, and knew all things) never thought of: For we make it an Arbitrator of Civil buſineſſes; and imploy it in ending Controverſies; and for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of what we ſay or do, we commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to take the Sacrament upon it; we teach, That it confirms our Faith in Chriſt, whereas indeed the receiving of it is a ſign of Faith confirmed, and Men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38505:6"/>
come to it to teſtifie that they do believe, not to procure that they may believe: For if a Man doubt of the truth of Chriſtianity, think you that his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would be removed upon the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? I would it were ſo; we ſhould not have ſo many doubting Chriſtians, who yet receive the Sacrament oft enough: We teach it to be <hi>Viaticum morientium,</hi> whereby we abuſe many diſtreſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſick Bodies, who ſeek for comfort there, and finding it not, conclude from thence (I ſpeak what I know) ſome defect in their Faith. The participation of the Sacrament to ſick and weak Perſons, what unſeemly events hath it occaſioned, the vomiting up of the Elements anon, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of them; the reſurging the Wine into the Cup, before the Miniſter could remove his hand to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the action? Now all theſe Miſtakes and Errors have riſen upon ſome ungrounded and fond practices, crept long ſince (God knows how) into the Church, and as yet not ſufficiently purged out. I will be bold to inform you what it is, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the main fundamental fallacy, whence all theſe abuſes have ſprung. There hath been a fancy of long ſubſiſtance in the Churches, That in the Communion there is ſomething given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Bread and Wine, of which <hi>the Numerality</hi> given, Men have not yet agreed: Some ſay it is the Body of God into which the Bread is tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; Some ſay it is the ſame Body with which the Bread is conſubſtantiated; Some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining what it was, there paſſes with it to the Soul the real Body of God, in a ſecret unknown manner; Some that a further degree of Faith is ſupplied us; Others, that ſome degree of God's grace, whatſoever it be, is exhibited, which otherwiſe would be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: All which variety of conceits muſt needs fall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38505:7"/>
out, as having no other ground, but conjecture weakly founded. To ſettle you therefore in your Judgment, both of the thing it ſelf, and of the true uſe of it, I will commend to your conſideration theſe few Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Communion, there is nothing given but Bread, and Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Bread and Wine are ſigns indeed, but not of any thing there exhibited, but of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what given long ſince, even of Chriſt given for us upon the Croſs ſixteen hundred years ago, and more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is eaten at the Communion-Table in no ſenſe, neither Spiritually, by virtue of any thing done there, nor really; neither Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, nor Literally. Indeed that which is eaten (I mean the Bread) is called Chriſt by a Metaphor; but it is eaten truly and properly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Spiritual eating of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all places, as well as the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt of all,</hi> The Uſes and Ends of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can be no more than ſuch as are mentioned in the Scriptures, and they are but two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The commemoration of the Death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Son of God, ſpecified by himſelf at the Inſtitution of the Ceremony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To teſtify our Union with Chriſt, and Communion one with another; which end St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us.</p>
            <p>In theſe few Concluſions the whole Doctrine and Uſe of the Lord's Supper is fully ſet down; and whoſo leadeth you beyond this, doth but abuſe you. <hi>Quicquid ultra quaeritur, non intelligitur.</hi> The proof of theſe Propoſitions would require more than the Limits of a Letter will admit of; and I ſee my ſelf already to have exceeded theſe Bounds. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38505:7"/>
paſs away to conſider the ſecond part of your Letter.</p>
            <p>In this ſecond Part, I would you had pleaſed to have done as in the firſt you did, That is, not only ſet down the Propoſition of the Catholick, but ſome Anſwer of the Proteſtant, by which we might have diſcovered his Judgment; I might perchance have uſed the ſame Liberty as I have done before, namely diſcovered the miſtakes of both Parties; for I ſuſpect that as there they did, ſo here they would have given me cauſe enough. Now I content my ſelf barely to ſpeak to the Queſtion. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the Church may Err in Fundamentals?</hi> By the <hi>Church</hi> I will not trifle as your Catholick doth, and mean only the Proteſtant Party, as he profeſſeth he doth only the <hi>Roman Faction.</hi> But I ſhall underſtand all Factions in Chriſtianity, All that entitle themſelves to Chriſt, whereſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed all the World over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That every Chriſtian may err that will: for if Men might not err wilfully, then there could be no Hereſie; Hereſie being nothing elſe but wilful Error: For if we account miſtakes, befallen us through humane Frailties to be Hereſies then it will follow, That every Man ſince the Apoſtles time was an Heretick; for never yet was there any Chriſtian, the Apoſtles only excepted, who did not in ſomething concerning the Chriſtian Faith miſtake himſelf, either by addition or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or miſinterpretation of ſomething. An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign of this Truth you may ſee in this; by the Providence of God, the Writings of many learned Chriſtians from the Spring of Chriſtianity, have been left unto poſterity; and amongſt all thoſe, ſcarcely any is to be found who is not confeſs'd on all
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38505:8"/>
hands to have miſtaken ſome things, and thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for the moſt part ſtand upon Record by ſome who purpoſely obſerved them. Neither let this (I beſeech you) beget in you a conceit, as if I meant to diſgrace thoſe whoſe Labours have been and are of infinite benefit in the Church. For if <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Aphrodiſeus,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Excellent Men whom God had indued with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary portions of natural Knowledge, have with all thankful and ingenuous Men throughout all Generations retained their Credit entire, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is acknowledged that they have all of them in many things, ſwerved from the Truth; Then, why ſhould not Chriſtians expreſs the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity to thoſe who have laboured before us in the Expoſition of the Chriſtian Faith, and highly eſteem them for their Works ſake, their many infirmities notwithſtanding? You will ſay, that for private Perſons it is confeſs'd they may and daily do err; but can Chriſtians err by whole Shoals, by Armies meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the defence of the Truth in Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, eſpecially General, which are countenanced by the great Fable of all the World, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, To ſay that Councils may not err, though private Perſons may, at firſt ſight is a merry ſpeech; as if a Man ſhould ſay, That every ſingle Soldier indeed may run away, but a whole Army cannot, eſpecially having <hi>Hannibal</hi> for their Captain; and ſince it is confeſs'd, That all ſingle Perſons not only may, but do err, it will prove a very hard matter, to gather out of theſe a multitude, of whom being gathered together, we may be ſecured they cannot err. I muſt for mine own part confeſs, That Councils, and Synods not only may and have erred, but conſidering the means how they are managed, it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38505:8"/>
were a great marvel if they did not err: For what Men are they of whom thoſe great Meetings do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? are they the beſt, the moſt learned, the moſt vertuous, the moſt likely to walk uprightly? No, the greateſt, the moſt ambitious, and many times Men, neither of Judgment, nor Learning; ſuch are they of whom theſe Bodies do conſiſt: And are theſe Men in common equity likely to determine for Truth? <hi>Qui ut in vita, ſic in cauſis, ſpes quoque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probas alunt,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſpeaks. Again, when ſuch Perſons are thus met, their way to procede to concluſion, is not by weight of Reaſon but by multitude of Votes and Suffrages; as if it were a maxim in nature, That the greater part muſt needs be better; whereas our common experience ſhews, That, <hi>Nunquam it a benè agitur cum rebus humanis ut plures ſint meliores.</hi> It was never heard in any profeſſion, That Concluſion of Truth went, by plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Voices, the Chriſtian profeſſion only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and I have often muſed how it comes to paſs, That the way which in all other Sciences is not able to warrant the pooreſt Concluſion, ſhould be thought ſufficient to give authority to Concluſions in Divinity, the Supreme Empreſs of Sciences. But I ſee what it is that is uſually pleaded, and with your leave I will a little conſider of it.</p>
            <p>If it be given out, That Chriſtian meetings have ſuch an aſſiſtance of God, and his bleſſed Spirit, that let their Perſons be what they will, they may aſſure themſelves againſt all poſſibility of miſtaking; and this is that they ſay, which to this way of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Controverſies, which in all other Sciences is ſo contemptible, gives a determining to Theolgical Diſputes of ſo great Authority. And this Muſick of the Spirit, it is ſo pleaſing, that it has taken the Reformed Party too; for with them likewiſe all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38505:9"/>
things at lengh end in this Spirit; but with this difference, that thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> confine the Spirit to the Biſhops and Counſels of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant enlargeth this working of the Spirit, and makes it the Director of private meditations. I ſhould doubtleſs do great injury to the goodneſs of God, if I ſhould deny the ſufficient aſſiſtance of God to the whole World, to preſerve them both from ſin in their Actions, and damnable errors in their opinions; much more ſhould I do it, if I denied it to the Church of God; but this aſſiſtance of God may very well be, and yet Men may fall into ſin and errors. St. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tells them, That God was with them in ſo palpable a manner, that even by the groping they might have found him; yet both he and we know what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did. Chriſt hath promiſed his perpetual aſſiſtance to his Church; but hath he left any Prophecy, that the Church ſhould perpetually adhere to him? if any Man think he hath, it is his part to inform us, where this Prophecy is to be found. That matters may go well with Men, two things muſt concur, the aſſiſtance of God to Men, and the adherence of Men to God; if either of theſe be deficient, there will be a little good done: Now the firſt of theſe is never deficient, but the ſecond is very often; ſo that the Promiſe of Chriſt's perpetual preſence made unto the Church, infers not at all any preſumption of Infabillity. As for that term of Spirit, which is ſo much taken up; to open the danger that lurks under it, we muſt a little diſtinguiſh upon the Word. This term <hi>[Spirit of God,]</hi> either it ſignifies the third Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, or elſe the wonderful power of Miracles, of Tongues, of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was given to the Apoſtles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Primitive Chriſtians, at the firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38505:9"/>
of the Goſpel, but both theſe meanings are ſtrangers to our purpoſe. The Spirit of God, as it concerns the Queſtion here in hand, ſignifies either ſomething within us, or ſomething without us: Without us, it ſignifies the written Word, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Books of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, which are metonymically called the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Holy Ghoſt ſpake thoſe things by their mouths when they lived, and now ſpeaks us by their pens when they are dead. If you pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, this alone is left as Chriſt's Vicar in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to give us directions both in our actions and opinions; he that tells you of another Spirit in the Church, to direct you in your way, may as well tell you a tale of a Puck, or a walking Spirit in the Church-Yard. But that this Spirit ſpeaking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us may be beneficial to us, <hi>oportet aliquid intus eſſe,</hi> there muſt be ſomething within us which alſo we call the Spirit; and this is twofold: For either it ſignifies a ſecret Illapſe, or ſupernatural Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, upon the hearts of Men, by which he is ſuppoſed inwardly, to incline, inform, and direct Men in their ways, and wills, and to preſerve them from ſin and Miſtake; or elſe it ſignifies that in us, which is oppoſed againſt the fleſh, and which denominates us ſpiritual Men, and by which we are ſaid <hi>to walk according to the Spirit</hi>; that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> means, when he tells us, <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh,</hi> (Rom. 7.) <hi>ſo that we may not do what we liſt.</hi> Now of theſe two, the former it is, which the Church ſeems to appeal unto in determining Controverſies by way of Counſel: But to this I have little to ſay. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe I know not whether there be any ſuch thing yea, or no. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews, That the pretence of the Spirit in this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38505:10"/>
ſenſe is very dangerous, as being next at hand to give countenance to impoſture and abuſe: which is a thing ſufficiently ſeen, and acknowledged both by the Papiſt and Proteſtant Party; as it appears by this, that though both pretend unto it, yet both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid each other with the pretence of it. But the Spirit in the ſecond ſenſe, is that I contend for; and this is nothing but the Reaſon illuminated by Revelation out of the written Word. For when the Mind and Spirit humbly conform and ſubmit to the written Will of God, then you are properly ſaid to have the Spirit of God, and to walk according to the Spirit, not according to the Fleſh. This alone is that Spirit which preſerves us from ſtraying from the Truth: For he indeed that hath the Spirit, errs not at all, or if he do, it is with as little hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as may be; which is the higheſt point of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, which either private Perſons or Churches can arrive unto. Yet would I not have you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That I deny that at this day the Holy Ghoſt communicates himſelf to any, in this ſecret and ſupernatural manner, as in foregoing times He had been wont to do; indeed my own many unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are ſufficient reaſons to hinder that good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to participate himſelf unto me, after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed to come down like a Dove; <hi>Veniunt ad candida tecta Columbae, Accipict nullas ſordida Turris Aves.</hi> Now it is no reaſon to conclude the Holy Ghoſt imparts himſelf in this manner to none, becauſe he hath not done that favour unto me. But thus much will I ſay, that the benefit of that ſacred Influence is confined to thoſe happy Souls in whom it is, and cannot extend it ſelf to the Church in publick: And if any Catholick except againſt you for ſaying ſo, warrant your ſelf and me out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> whoſe words are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38505:10"/>
theſe, <hi>Innititur fidei natura revelationi Apoſtolis &amp; Prophetis factae, qui Canonicos Libros ſcripſerunt, non autem Revelationi, ſiqua fuit, aliis Doctoribus factae.</hi> It being granted then, that Churches can err, it remains then, in the ſecond place, to conſider how far they may err; I anſwer for Churches as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for private Perſons, Churches may err in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals if they liſt, for they may be heretical; for Churches may be wicked, they may be Idolaters, and why then not heretical? Is Hereſy a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing than Idolatry? For whereas it is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Churches cannot fall into Hereſie, becauſe of that promiſe of our Saviour, <hi>That the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church,</hi> is but out of miſtake of the meaning of that place; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have often muſed how ſo plain a place could ſo long and ſo generally be miſconſtrued: To ſecure you therefore, that you be not abuſed with theſe words hereafter, (for they are often quoted to prove the Church's Infallibility) I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give you the natural meaning of them, For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> is an Hebraiſm; for in the Hebrew Expreſſion, the Gates of a thing ſignifies the thing it ſelf, as the gates of <hi>Sion, Sion</hi> it ſelf, and by the ſame proportion the gates of Hell ſignifies Hell it ſelf: Now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which we Engliſh Hell, as in no place of Scripture it ſignifies Hereſie, ſo very frequently in Scripture it ſignifies Death, or rather the ſtate of the dead, and indifferently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to good and bad: Let us then take the Word in that meaning, for what greater means can we have to warrant the ſignification of a Scripture-word, than the general meaning of it in Scripture? So that when our Saviour ſpake theſe words, he made no promiſe to the Church of perſevering in the Truth, but to thoſe that did perſevere in the Truth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38505:11"/>
he made a promiſe of Victory againſt Death and hell: And what he there ſays, ſounds to no other purpoſe, but this, That thoſe who ſhall continue his, although they dye, yet Death ſhall not have the Dominion over them; but the time ſhall come, that the bands of Death ſhall be broken; and as Chriſt is riſen, ſo ſhall they that are his riſe again to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: For any help therefore that this Text affords, Churches may err in Fundamentals. But to ſpeak the Truth, I much wonder, not only how any Churches, but how any private Man, that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to know and follow the Truth, can err in Fundamentals: For ſince it is moſt certain, That the Scripture contains at leaſt the Fundamental Parts of Chriſtian Faith, how is it poſſible, that any Man, that is careful to ſtudy and believe the Scripture, ſhould be ignorant of any neceſſary part of his Faith? Now whether the Chucrh of <hi>Rome</hi> err in Fundamentals, yea or no? To anſwer this, I muſt crave leave to uſe this Diſtinction; To err in Fundamentals, is either to be ignorant of, or deny ſomething to be Fundamental, that is; or to entertain ſomething for Fundamental, which is not. In the firſt ſenſe, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> entertaining the Scriptures as ſhe doth, cannot poſſibly be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any principal part of Chriſtian Faith; all her error is, in entertaining in her ſelf, and obtruding upon others, a multitude of things for Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which no way concern our Faith at all: Now how dangerous it is thus to do, except I know whether ſhe did this willingly or wittingly, yea or no, is not eaſy to define: If willingly ſhe doth it; it is certainly high and damnable preſumption, if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, I know not what mercies God hath in ſtore for them that ſin, not out of malicious wickedneſs.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38505:11"/>
Now concerning the merriment newly ſtarted; I mean the requiring of a Catalogue of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, I need no anſwer no more, but what <hi>Abraham</hi> tells the rich Man in Hell, <hi>Habent Moſen &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas,</hi> They have <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and the Evangeliſts, let them ſeek them there; for if they find them not there, in vain ſhall they ſeek them in all the World beſides. But yet come a little nearer to the Particulars, If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would needs know what is Fundamental, in our conceit, and what not; the Anſwer, as far as my ſelf in Perſon am concerned in the Buſineſs, ſhall be no other than this; Let her obſerve what Points they are, wherein we agree with her, and let her think, if ſhe pleaſe, that we account of them as Fundamentals, eſpecially if they be in the Scriptures; and on the other hand, let her mark in what Points we refuſe Communion with her, and let her aſſure her ſelf, we eſteem thoſe as no Fundamentals. If ſhe deſire a Liſt and Catalogue made of all thoſe, ſhe is at leiſure enough, for ought I know, to do it her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, Concerning the imputation of Rebellion and Schiſm againſt Church-Authority, with which your Catholick Diſputant meant to affright you; all that is but meerly Powder without Shot, and can never hurt you: For ſince it hath been ſufficiently evidenced unto us, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath adulterated the Truth of God, by mixing with it ſundry Inventions of her own; it was the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our duty to God, that made us to ſeparate: For where the Truth of God doth once ſuffer, there Union is Conſpiracy, Authority is but Tyranny, and Churches are but Routs: And ſuppoſe we, that we miſtook, and made our Separation upon Error, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being right in all her Ways, though we think otherwiſe; yet could not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38505:12"/>
this much prejudice us: For it is Schiſm upon wilfulneſs that brings danger with it, Schiſm upon miſtake, and Schiſm upon juſt occaſion, hath in it ſelf little hurt, if any at all.</p>

            <head>A TRACT Concerning the Power of the KEYS. AND Auricular Confeſſion.</head>
            <p>IN opening the Point concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> I will follow thoſe Lines, that Tract, which your ſelf hath been pleaſed to ſet me. Yet firſt, ere I come to your particulars, I will diſcover, as far as generality will give me leave, what it is which we intend, when we uſe this phraſe of Speech. At the firſt appearance, it is plain, the form of words is not Proper, but Metaphorical. Now ſome Truth there is in that which you learnt in the Books of your Minority, from your <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38505:13"/>
this, is to ſee what the Uſe of <hi>Keys,</hi> properly taken, is; and after that, what means they are, which in our endeavours to attain to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> have ſomething proportionable to the Uſe of <hi>Keys</hi>: and this being once diſcovered, there can remain no Queſtion, What are the <hi>Keys?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now nothing is more known, than that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Uſe of <hi>Keys</hi> is to open and Shut, to admit us Unto, or exclude us from the poſſeſſion of what we ſeek. Now ſince the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is compared to a Houſe, from which all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> by Nature are excluded; whatſoever then it is that gives us way, that removes all Obſtacles which hinder us from entrance of that Houſe, that certainly muſt be underſtood by the Name of <hi>Keys.</hi> Now all theſe means, or whatſoever elſe it is which doth further us towards the poſſeſſing our ſelves of Eternal Life, they were all laid down in the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, committed by him fully and firſt of all to the diſpenſation of the bleſſed Apoſtles, to be reported by them, or their means, all the World over. So that I think I may ſafely lay thus much for the firſt ground of the Queſtion betwixt your ſelf and me, <hi>Clavis Regni Caelorum ſunt Doctrina Evangelii.</hi>

            <p>Now ſince Keys are nothing without ſome Hand to manage them, we muſt in the ſecond place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover into whoſe Hands they are committed. And for this purpoſe, firſt of all, It muſt not be denied that principally and properly, (I might well enough add only, if I liſted, but that I ſpare you) the Hand of God it is, that manages and applies theſe <hi>Keys</hi>: For of God and Chriſt it is written, <hi>He hath the Keys, he opens, and no Man ſhuts; he ſhuts, and no Man opens.</hi> Yet ſince it hath pleaſed God to uſe the Miniſtery of Men, to the ſaving of Men,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38505:13"/>
and bringing them into the Kingdom of Heaven; In a ſecondary ſenſe, the <hi>Keys</hi> of that Kingdom are ſaid to be put into the hands of Men. In as much as it hath pleaſed the Wiſdom of God, not to uſe theſe <hi>Keys,</hi> at leaſt as far as concerns the beneficial and opening part, ſome act of Man not firſt premiſed; for ſince that Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is the ſum of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and Faith cometh not but by hearing, and hearing cometh not but by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preaching is the act of Men alone, (for God employs not Angels in that behalf,) It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this Preaching, or manifeſtation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel not performed, the <hi>Keys</hi> muſt needs be unprofitable. By the manifeſtation of the Goſpel of God, I mean not only the labour of the lip, in expounding, praying, reproving, or the like, but the adminiſtration of Sacraments, the acting (if any thing beyond this is to be acted) whatſoever the manifeſtation of the Goſpel requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. So that I think I may ſet down for a ſecond Ground towards the ſettling of the Point in queſtion, thus much, That the managing or application of the <hi>Keys,</hi> ſo far forth as Men are intruſted with them, is, <hi>The Manifeſtation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi> Thus far have we opened in general the Subſtance of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and the Uſe of them. I come now to your <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You ask of the quality of the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this Power, Whether they had it as Judges <hi>Authoritativè,</hi> or as Meſſengers, <hi>Declarativè</hi> only to <hi>propound,</hi> or <hi>denounce?</hi> You manifeſt your ſelf for the former, and Reaſons you bring, ſuch as they be. Your Reaſons I ſhall conſider in their place, but I muſt firſt tell you that you ask amiſs; for your queſtion is concerning the whole Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> but you anſwer only of a part, that is, of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38505:14"/>
Sacramental Abſolution only, as if all the Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> reſided there. So that here you uſe the Fallacy <hi>plurium Interrogationum</hi>; and I might well grant you, That indeed that part were <hi>Judicativè</hi> but yet contend that all the reſt were only <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè.</hi> To reduce you therefore I muſt do with you as Phyſicians in ſome caſes deal with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; ere I can come to purge the humour you are ſick of, I muſt a little prepare you. The power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> is expreſs'd by the Learned in three yokes, or pairs of Words.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>To remit, and to retain.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>To looſe, and to bind.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>To open, and to ſhut.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>On the one ſide to <hi>remit,</hi> to <hi>looſe,</hi> to <hi>open,</hi> which is the one half of the power, agree in one, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the ſame thing; ſo do the other three, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> to <hi>bind,</hi> to <hi>ſhut,</hi> which contain the other half. To your Queſtion then, Whether the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> be declarative only? I anſwer firſt: For this latter part or half, it is meerly declarative, neither can it be otherwiſe; which that you may ſee with your eyes, I muſt requeſt you to obſerve, That all ſhutting of the Kingdom of Heaven, is either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, or caſual, befalling only ſome. The common Excluſion is that ſtate of Nature, wherein we all are involved, as we ſpring from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>; The ſecond Excluſion is that which befals Chriſtians relapſing into ſin. The firſt ſhutting was at the fall, and was then Prefigured unto us, by the barring up of the way unto the Tree of Life. What active, what Judiciary part can any Miniſter of the Goſpel have here? all that the Apoſtles could do here, was but to open to Men this their miſery, a thing before the death of our Saviour, either very ſparingly, or not at all revealed. Of this therefore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38505:14"/>
you muſt needs quit your hands, and ſo you muſt of the other, I mean excluſion upon caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and relapſe. For when a Man converted to Chriſtianity falleth eftſoon into ſome mortal ſin, doth the Gate of Heaven ſtand open to him, till he fall upon ſome curſt Prieſt, that uſed his Key to ſhut it?</p>
            <p>There are in the World a kind of deceitful Locks with ſliding Bolts, I have ſeen my ſelf and others much deceived by them, when the doors have fallen at our heels, and lockt us out, when we intended no ſuch thing. <hi>Sir,</hi> Heaven-door hath a ſliding-Lock; upon occaſion of mortal ſin, it will ſhut without any uſe of a Key.</p>
            <p>Perchance I do nor well, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, yet the ſober meaning of what I have ſpoken merrily, is but this, That either you muſt make the Miniſtery of the Goſpel only Declarative, or elſe it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that every impenitent Relapſer, that hath the good fortune to eſcape the Prieſts being privy to his Sin, is like to find Heaven open at the laſt. So then it is apparent, That notwithſtanding your heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Interrogatories, and your preſſing of <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritis &amp; vos,</hi> and telling me what I never knew, that <hi>Solvere</hi> and <hi>Ligare</hi> be Actives; yet in this part of our Power, all your Activity is loſt, and there remains nothing for you but to report upon good evidence, what you find done by your betters to your hand.</p>
            <p>Half your Juriſdiction then is fallen, and if I had no other <hi>Medium</hi> but this; I might with good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability conclude againſt you for the other part. For if the one half made in the ſame Form, in the like phraſe and garb of ſpeech, yet enforceth no more but Declaration and Denouncing: then why ſhould you think the other half, (which in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38505:15"/>
is homogeneal to the former) to be more? Nay, there is far more natural Equity that you ſhould be here only Declarative than in the other. Politicians tell us, That it is Wiſdom for Princes, who deſire to gain the love of their Subjects, to adminiſter themſelves all Favours and Graces, but to leave action of Juſtice and Harſhneſs to be performed by others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> No Prince can be ſo ambitious of the Love of his Subjects, as God is of the Love of Mankind: why then ſhould I think him ſo ill a Politician, as to make himſelf the adminiſtrator of the Rough, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, Love-killing Offices, of <hi>Binding, Shutting, Retaining</hi>; and then paſs over to the Prieſt, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Fair, Well-ſpoken, Ingratiating Offices of <hi>Remitting, Looſing,</hi> and <hi>Opening?</hi> But I will leave this kind of Topick and Dialectical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, becauſe you are a pretender to convincing Reaſons: I will directly enter even upon that part of your power of <hi>Opening,</hi> and <hi>Remitting,</hi> being the other part of your Territory, and by main ſtrength, take all activity from you there too. Give me leave to ask you one Queſtion, you may very well favour me ſo far, for you have asked me very many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Converſion of a Sinner, is it an act of the Keys, yea or no</hi>?</p>
            <p>By your Principles it is not; for you make the power of the <hi>Keys</hi> to be judiciary, and therefore the Converſion of an Infidel pertains not to them: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will help you with a <hi>Medium</hi> to make this Argument good. <hi>Do we not judge thoſe that are within? for thoſe that are without, God ſhall judge,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>: Whence ſhe infers, That a converted Infidel, not yet admitted to the Church, is a Stranger to the Judiciary Power of the <hi>Keys</hi>; but being once admitted into the Church, he is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38505:15"/>
now become the Church's Subject, and ſo fit matter for the Prieſt to work on upon his next Relapſe. What think you of this Reaſon? Do you take it to be good? Take heed; or elſe it will give you a deadly ſtripe. For the Converſion of an Infidel, out of queſtion is a moſt proper act of the <hi>Keys.</hi> For ſince, the opening of the Kingdom of Heaven, is confeſs'd to belong unto the <hi>Keys</hi>; and Heaven which was ſhut againſt the Infidel in time of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, upon his Converſion is acknowledged to be opened unto him; certainly whoever converted him, uſed the <hi>Keys</hi>; or elſe he muſt pretend to have either a <hi>Pick-lock,</hi> or the Herb <hi>Lunaria,</hi> which, they ſay, makes Locks fall off from Doors, and the Fetters from Horſes heels. If then the Converſion of a Sinner be an act of the <hi>Keys,</hi> and by the Argument of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it be not judiciary, it follows then, That all Acts of the <hi>Keys</hi> are not Judiciary; and if not Judiciary, then Declarative only. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two I know no mean.</p>
            <p>But becauſe to diſpute againſt a Man out of his own Principles, which perchance are falſe (for this oft we know falls out, that by the power of <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> Men may and do draw True Concluſions from Falſe Premiſes) becauſe, I ſay, thus to do, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> leaves a Man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and I am willing not only to perſwade you, but to better you: I will draw the little which remains to be ſaid in this Point from other Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In all the Apoſtles practice in Converting <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> find you any thing like unto the act of any Judiciary Power? They neither did, nor could uſe any ſuch thing. That they did not, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Philip,</hi> who having Catechized the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and finding him deſirous of Baptiſm, immediately upon profeſſion of his Faith, admitted him into the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38505:16"/>
Church. That they neither did nor could, appears by <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who could never in the ſpace of an afternoon, being none but themſelves, have converted three thouſand Souls, had they taken any ſuch way, as you ſeem to misfancy. Again, imagine with your ſelf all circumſtances you can, which are of force to make a power judiciary, apply them all to the practice of the Apoſtles, in the Converſion of Infidels, and if you find any one of them agree to that action, let me be challenged upon it, and be thought to have abuſed you with a Fallacy.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, ſince your <hi>Ligaveritis,</hi> which is the one half of your pretended Juriſdiction, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to nothing above Declarative: And ſince your <hi>Solveritis,</hi> in ſo great an act as is the Converſion of Infidels, lays claim to no more, what act of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Keys</hi> is it, wherein we may conceive hope of finding any thing active or judiciary? I ſee what you will ſay, There yet remains a part, you think, wherein you have hope to ſpeed, and that is the reconciling of relapſing Chriſtians: As you fancy that in every ſinning Chriſtian, there is a duty binding him to repair, and lay his ſin open to the Miniſter of the Goſpel, and him a power to conſider of the ſins of ſuch as repair unto him, to weigh particulars, to conſider circumſtances, and occaſions, and according to true Judgment, either upon penance impoſed to abſolve ſin, (which you call re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of the ſin) or to with-hold him for a time, from participation of holy duties with Catholick Chriſtians, which you call retaining of ſins, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that God doth the like in Heaven, as it is written, <hi>What you bind in Earth, is bound in Heaven, and what you looſe in Earth, is looſed in Heaven.</hi> Now the Rock on which you labour to found ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38505:16"/>
extravagant a Conceit, is no other than the Words which I have quoted out of Scripture; you preſs earneſtly the <hi>Ligaveritis &amp; vos,</hi> all which can yield you ſmall relief; for if they help you not at all in thoſe weighty parts of the Power of the <hi>Keys,</hi> which but now were laid before you; by what Analogy can you expect they ſhould afford you any aſſiſtance here? As is <hi>Ligare,</hi> ſo is <hi>Solvere</hi>; as is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of an Infidel, ſo is the reconciling of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing Chriſtian, for any thing you can make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: Either all is <hi>Declarative,</hi> which is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and in many caſes neceſſary, or all <hi>Judicative,</hi> which in ſome caſes is impoſſible, and in none ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſo that to fit the Scripture to your Fancy, you are conſtrained to diſtract and rend it without any Warrant at all. But you have found out in the Text a ſtronger Argument againſt the declarative Power, I contend for: You eſpie an <hi>Inſufflavit,</hi> a great, a ſolemn, and unwonted Ceremony, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly concluding ſome greater matter than a poor power declarative: <hi>What? did our ſerious Maſter thus ſpend his breath to no purpoſe, and like a</hi> Hocus Pocus <hi>with ſo much ſhew act us a ſolemn nothing</hi>? I pray whoſe words are theſe? I ſhould have thought them to have been <hi>Porphyry's,</hi> or <hi>Julian's,</hi> (but that I know your hand) for you ſubſcribed not your name to your letters: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: They are the Words of your <hi>Pindarus,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an occaſion not much unlike unto this.</p>
            <p>Sir, you have no Skill to judge, or ſet a price upon ſo divine an act: He loſt not his breath, when he ſpent his <hi>Inſuflavit</hi>; he opened their wits, that they might underſtand the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he revealed to them the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, dying and riſing again for the World's ſalvation, the greateſt news that ever was reported in the World, and till
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38505:17"/>
then concealed; He commanded them to be the firſt bringers of this good News, and that they might the more undauntedly perform their Charge, he endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with Infallibility, with infinite Conſtancy and Fortitude, with Power of working ſuch Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as none could do unleſs God were with them. <hi>Appello Conſcientiam tuam</hi>: Were thoſe things ſuch nothings, that they deſerve to be thus jeered? But that befalls you which befalls the Stares that dwell in the Steeple, who fear not the Bells, becauſe they hear them every day. Theſe wonderful Benefits of God have every day founded in your ears, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of them hath taught you to forget your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to them. Yet all this <hi>Inſufflavit,</hi> this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, was for no other end but to further a <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> power: Their undaunted Fortitude, their power of Miracling, their Infallibility did but add countenance and ſtrength to their <hi>Declarative</hi> Power, by which they went up and down the World, to manifeſt the good tidings of Salvation. So that even theſe which ſerved thus to ſet off the Goſpel, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but means of the better manifeſtation of it; therefore may they very well paſs, if not amongſt the <hi>Keys,</hi> yet amongſt the neceſſary Wards. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your Fancy of an active or judicative Power in the Prieſt, concurring with God in reconciling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing Chriſtians, is neither one nor other, but is indeed like unto the work of ſome deceitful Smith, who the better to countenance and grace his works, adds to his Key ſuperfluous and idle Wards, which in the opening of the Lock, are of no uſe at all.</p>
            <p>To your ſecond Query, Whether the <hi>Keys</hi> were confined to the Apoſtles only? The Anſwer is in no caſe hard to give, it may perchance in ſome caſe be dangerous; for there is a Generation of Men in the World (the Clergy they call them) who impropriate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38505:17"/>
the <hi>Keys</hi> unto themſelves, and would be very angry to underſtand, that others from themſelves ſhould claim a right unto them. To your Queſtion then, no doubt but originally none received the <hi>Keys</hi> from the Mouth of our Saviour, but the Apoſtles only; none did, nor ever could manage them with that authority and ſplendour as the Apoſtles did, who were above all moſt amply furniſ hed with all things fitting ſo great a work. For whereas you ſeem to intimate that the preaching Miſſion was communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to others, as the ſeventy two Diſciples, as well as the Apoſtles; you do but miſtake your ſelf, if you conceive that the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Goſpel were any way committed to them; for concerning the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified for the ſins of the World (wherein indeed the opening of the Kingdom of Heaven did conſiſt) they received it not, they knew it not. To be the prime Reporters of this, was an honour imparted only to the Apoſtles: Yet were they not ſo imparted, as that they ſhould be confined to them. Every one that heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Light of the ſaving Doctrine from them, ſo far forth as he had underſtanding in the ways of Life, had now the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven committed to his power, both for his own and others uſe. Every own, of what ſtate or condition ſoever, that hath any occaſion offered him, to ſerve another in the ways of Life, Clergy, or Lay, male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, whatever he be, hath theſe <hi>Keys,</hi> not only for himſelf, but for the benefit of others. For if natural Goodneſs teach every Man, <hi>Lumen de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Erranti comiter monſtrare viam,</hi> &amp;c. Then how much more doth Chriſtian Goodneſs require of every one, to his ability to be a Light to thoſe who ſit in darkneſs, and direct their ſteps, who moſt dangerouſly miſtake their way? To Save a Soul, every Man is a Prieſt. To whom I pray you, is,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38505:18"/>
that ſaid in <hi>Leviticus, Thou ſhalt not ſee thy Brother ſin, but thou ſhalt reprove, and ſave thy Brother?</hi> And if the Law binds a Man, when he ſaw his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Cattel to ſtray, to put them into their way; How much more doth it oblige him to do the like for the Man himſelf? See you not how the whole World conſpires with me in the ſame opinion? Doth not every Father teach his Son, every Maſter his Servant, every Man his Friend. How many of the Laity in this age, and from time to time, in all ages, have by writing for the publick good, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the Goſpel of Chriſt, as if ſome ſecret inſtinct of nature had put into Mens minds thus to do. I ſhame to dwell ſo long upon ſo plain a Theme, yet becauſe I feel your pulſe, and perceive what it is that troubles you, I muſt ſay ſomething to an Objection, which I know you make. You conceive that forthwith upon this which I have ſaid, muſt needs follow ſome great Confuſion of eſtates, and degrees, the Laity will ſtraitway get up into our Pulpits, we ſhall loſe our credit, and the adoration which the ſimple ſort do yield us is in danger to be loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Fear you not, the ſufficient and able of the Clergy, will reap no diſcountenance, but honour by this: For he that knows how to do well himſelf, will moſt willingly approve what is well done by another. It is extreme poverty of mind to ground your Reputation upon another Man's Ignorance, and to ſecure your ſelf, you do well, becauſe you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive perchance, that none can judge how ill you do. Be not angry then to ſee others joyn with you in part of your Charge. <hi>I would all the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did Preach,</hi> and that every Man did think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, bound to diſcharge a part of the Common Good: and make account that the Care of other Mens Souls concerned him as well as of his own.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38505:18"/>
When the Apoſtles took order to ordain ſome, upon whom the publick burden of Preaching the Goſpel ſhould lie, it was not their purpoſe to impropriate the thing to thoſe Perſons alone; but knowing that what was left to the care of all, was commonly worſt lookt unto, in wiſe and moſt Chriſtian Care, they deſigned ſome whoſe duty it ſhould be to wait upon the Goſpel alone, the better to preſerve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the World's end: It hath been the wiſdom of thoſe, who have taken care of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Arts, and Sciences, not only to appoint means, that multitudes ſhould ſtudy and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion privately, but that ſome ſhould be conſtituted publick Profeſſors to teach <hi>è Cathedra,</hi> that ſo all might know to whom to repair, in the doubts incident to their faculties, and this hath been thought a ſovereign way to preſerve Sciences. <hi>Sir,</hi> we are the publick Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, we ſpeak <hi>è Cathedra,</hi> which none can do, but ſuch as are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let the private profeſſion and practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity improve it ſelf never ſo much, yet the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Publick Profeſſor, ſo he deſerves his place, can never impair. It grieves me to ſtand ſo long upon ſo plain, ſo unwelcome a Leſſon, I will eaſe my ſelf and you, and reflect upon your third Query.</p>
            <p>In the third place, you require to know, What neceſſity, or what convenience there is of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? You mean, I think, that confeſſion, which is as fooliſhly as commonly called Sacramental, for it hath nothing of a Sacrament in it. Did I know your mind a little more in particular, what form of Confeſſion you ſpeak of, whether as it is uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or in ſome refined Guiſe, as it ſeems ſome would, who have of late called for it in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſhould ſpeak perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture more appoſitely to what you deſire. But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38505:19"/>
you have propoſed Confeſſion only in generality, my anſwer ſhall be in like manner. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Confeſſion of ſins is a thing, not only convenient, but unavoidably neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which none ſhall ever ſee God. And thus far I ſuppoſe all Chriſtians do agree. The main Difference is in the manner of practiſing it, the Queſtion being, What Parties are to be intereſſed in it? Natural Equity informeth us, That unto every Party, juſtly offended, Satisfaction ſome way or other is due. The firſt Party wronged in every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is God againſt whoſe Honour, and expreſs Command every ſin is committed. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the firſt place, Satisfaction is due by ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and acknowledgment, ſince there remains no other way of compoſition with God. But there are ſome ſins committed againſt God, ſome committed againſt God and Men. In the former, it is ſufficient if we pacifie God alone; in the latter, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, againſt whom we have treſpaſs'd, muſt receive Satisfaction for the wrong done him, at leaſt, if it be in the power of the Treſpaſſer. Your Primer of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> will tell you, <hi>That not to make reſtitution, if you be able, and not to pardon, unavoidably excludes from the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now might the Doctrine of Confeſſion and acknowledgement in caſe of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given, have been permitted to run fair and clear, as it deſcends from God, and good reaſon, the firſt Fountains of it. There needed no more to be ſaid in this argument, than I already told you. But I know not what intempeſtive fooliſh Ambition hath troubled the ſtream, and it hath paſs'd now for a long time (till the Reformation altered it) for a general Doctrine in the Church, That in all kind of ſins, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt God, or our Neighbour, there can be no reconciliation betwixt the Parties offending and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but by interpoſition of a Prieſt, a thing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38505:19"/>
utterly beſides all reaſon and common ſenſe that you ſhould open your private imperfections to one whom they concern not, (for it is granted, that all Parties concerned in an Offence, muſt have reaſon at the hands of the Offender) and who can no ways help you: For he that is conſcious of his ſin, (and without trouble of Conſcience I think none would ever repair to his Confeſſor) knows very well, That there is no ſin ſo great, but upon ſubmiſſion, God both can and will pardon it; and none ſo small, but pardon for it muſt be ſought, or elſe he hath been ill catechized. And more than this, what can any Prieſt tell him: <note n="*" rend="inter">Plin. Nat. Hiſt. l. <hi>28.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
               </note> Your <hi>Pliny,</hi> ſomewhere tells you, <hi>That he that is ſtricken by a Scorpion, if he go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and whiſper it into the ear of an Aſs, ſhall find himſelf immediately eaſed</hi>: That Sin is a Scorpion, and bites deadly, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed, but that to cure the bite of it, was a Sovereign Remedy to whiſper it into the Ear of an [] a Prieſt, I do as well believe as I do that of <hi>Pliny.</hi> The Patrons of this Fancy for defect of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common congruity, are fain to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Scripture; and the miſchief is, there is there no direct Text for it, and therefore they are conſtrained to help themſelves with a meer conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural conſequence: For ſince it is taken for certain, that there is a Power to Remit and to retain ſins, how ſhall they who have this Power given them, know how fit it is to Remit or to retain a ſin, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they know the ſin, and know it they cannot, but by Confeſſion. For anſwer to this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We have found and proved, That the Words of Scripture muſt receive ſuch a ſenſe, as from whence no ſuch Conſequence can be inferred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>; we have indeavoured to prove, That the Diſpenſation or Application of the Keys of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38505:20"/>
Kingdom of Heaven, (being nothing elſe, but the duty of ſaving of Souls) is a Duty, which <hi>pro Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione oblatâ,</hi> lies upon every Chriſtian: Which if it be true, (as in good faith I think it,) and the Clergy perceive it, I think they would never go about to urge that Text, although we ſhould yield it them in their own meaning. For they muſt needs ſee, That it follows, that you may as well make your Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etter, (if you have one) your Confeſſor, as your Pariſh-Prieſt. Tell me in good earneſt, if you can, out of what good intent can this deſire to know another Man's ſin, which concerns you not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? Is it to teach him that it is a ſin? He knew that, or elſe he had never repaired to you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it: Is it to tell him, that he is to repent, to reſtore, to pray, to give alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this he knew, or elſe he hath had his breeding under an evil Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. Yea, but how ſhall the Phyſician cure the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, if he know it not? Suppoſe all Diſeaſes had one Remedy (as all Spiritual have) and what matters it if the Patient be ſick, to know whether it be an Ague, or Meazles, or Pleurifie, ſince one Potion cures them all? Yea, but if he know not the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, how ſhall he judge of the Quantity of the Doſes? For the ſame Diſeaſe upon ſundry circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may require <hi>Majus</hi> or <hi>Minus</hi> in the Phyſick. This is the pooreſt ſcruple of a thouſand; for in the Regiment of Patients ſpiritually ſick there can be but one miſtake, that is, if you give too little: Be ſure you give enough, and teach your Patients to think no ſin to be little, (which in Men ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick is <hi>Error ſaluberrimus</hi>) and you can never err: For natural Phyſick is only Phyſick; but ſpiritual Phyſick is both Phyſick and Diet, and may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently adminiſtred both to the ſick and the ſound; Repentance perchance only excepted, of which upon occaſion, aſſure your ſelf can hardly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38505:20"/>
take too much. What reaſon now can you give me, why you ſhould deſire to dive into any Man's Breaſt, <hi>&amp; ſcire Secreta Domûs</hi>? Except it be that which follows in the next Verſe, <hi>indè teneri,</hi> as I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I ſuſpect it is. The truth is, ſome miſtaken Cuſtoms of the ancient Church, the craft and power of the Clergy, the ſimplicity and ignorance of the Laity, theſe begat the <hi>Tragelaphus,</hi> of which we now ſpeak. It may be you take the practice of the ancient Church, and the Point of Excomunication, to make ſomewhat for you: When thoſe Cards ſhall come to be play'd (though that of Church-cuſtom is not greatly material, which way ſoever it looks) I believe you will not find the Game you look for. Indeed I was once minded to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſomething of that: But I think you look for a Letter, not for a Book, and I perceive my ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to have gone beyond the compaſs of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Another Parley therefore, if you pleaſe, ſhall put an end to thoſe and other Scruples, if any do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe. And for the preſent give, I pray you, a little reſpite unto.</p>

            <head>A TRACT Concerning SCHISM.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> as they are in common uſe, are two Theological <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows,</hi> which they, who uphold a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Religion, uſe to fright away ſuch, as making inquiry into it, are ready to relinquiſh and oppoſe it, if it appear either erroneous or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious. For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of a Painter who having unskilfully painted a Cock, chaſed away all Cocks and Hens, that ſo the imperfection of Art might not appear by compariſon with Nature; ſo Men willing for ends to admit of no fancy but their own, endeavour to hinder an inquiry into it by way of compariſon of ſomewhat with it, peradventure tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that ſo the deformity of their own might not appear. But howſoever in the common manage, <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi> are but ridiculous Terms, yet the things in themſelves are of very conſiderable moment, the one offending againſt Truth, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt Charity, and therefore both deadly, where they are not by imputation, but in deed.</p>
            <p>It is then a matter of no ſmall importance, truly to deſcry the nature of them, that ſo they may fear,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38505:21"/>
who are guilty of them, and they on the contrary ſtrengthen themſelves, who through the iniquity of Men and times, are injuriouſly charged with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Schiſm</hi> (for of <hi>Hereſie</hi> we ſhall not now treat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by accident, and that by occaſion of a general miſtake ſpread throughout all the writings of the Ancients, in which their names are familiarly confounded) <hi>Schiſm,</hi> I ſay, upon the very ſound of the word, imports Diviſion; <hi>Diviſion</hi> is not, but where <hi>Communion</hi> is or ought to be. Now <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the ſtrength and ground of all Society, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi>: Whoſoever therefore they be, that offend againſt this common Society and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Men, and cauſe ſeparation and breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: If it be in civil occaſions, are guilty of Sedition or Rebellion; if it be by occaſion of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical</hi> difference, they are guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi>: So that <hi>Schiſm</hi> is an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Sedition,</hi> as <hi>Sedition</hi> is a <hi>Lay-Schiſm.</hi> Yet the great benefit of <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> notwithſtanding, in regard of divers diſtempers Men are ſubject to, Diſſenſion and Diſunion are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neceſſary: For when either falſe or uncertain Concluſions are obtruded for Truth, and Acts ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawful, or miniſtring juſt ſcruple, are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us to be perform'd; in theſe caſes, Conſent were conſpiracy, and open Conteſtation is not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or <hi>Schiſm,</hi> but due Chriſtian Animoſity.</p>
            <p>For the further opening therefore of the nature of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> ſomething muſt be added by way of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to diſtinguiſh it from neceſſary Separation, and that is, that the cauſes upon which Diviſion is attempted, proceed not from Paſſion, or Diſtemper, or from Ambition, or Avarice, or ſuch other Ends, as humane folly is apt to purſue; but from well weighed and neceſſary Reaſons, and that, when all other means having been tryed, nothing will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38505:22"/>
ſerve to ſave us from guilt of Conſcience, but open Separation. So that <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if we would define it is nothing elſe but an unneceſſary Separation of Chriſtians from that part of the viſible Church, of which they were once Members. Now as in Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Civil Diſſenſions, there are two Attendants in ordinary belonging unto them; one the choice of one <hi>Elector</hi> or Guide in place of the General, or ordinary Governour, to rule and guide; the other the appointing of ſome publick place or Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, where publick Meetings muſt be celebrated: So in Church-Diſſenſions and Quarrels, two Appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances there are, which ſerve to make a <hi>Schiſm</hi> compleat.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The choice of a Biſhop in oppoſition to the former, (a thing very frequent amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and which many times was both the cauſe and effect of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Secondly, The erecting of a new Church and Oratory, for the Dividing-party to meet in publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For till this be done, the <hi>Schiſm</hi> is but yet in the Womb.</p>
            <p>In that late famous Controverſy in <hi>Holland, De Praedeſtinatione, &amp; Auxiliis,</hi> as long as the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing Parties went no further than Diſputes and Pen-combats, the <hi>Schiſm</hi> was all that while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatched; but as ſoon as one Party ſwept an old Cloyſter and by a pretty Art ſuddenly made it a Church, by putting a new pulpit in it, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Party there to meet; now, what before was a Controverſy, became a formal <hi>Schiſm.</hi> To know no more than this, if you take it to be true, had been enough to direct how you are to judge, and what to think of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Shiſmaticks</hi>; yet becauſe in the <hi>Ancients,</hi> (by whom many Men are more affrighted than hurt) much is ſaid, and many fearful Dooms are pronounced in this caſe; will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38505:22"/>
we deſcend a little to conſider of <hi>Schiſms,</hi> as it were by way of Story, and that partly further to open that which we have ſaid in general, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in particulars; and partly to diſabuſe thoſe who reverencing Antiquity more than needs, have ſuffered themſelves to be ſcared with imputation of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> above due meaſure; for what the Ancients ſpake by way of cenſure of <hi>Schiſm</hi> in general, is moſt true; for they ſaw (and it is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee ſo much) that unadviſedly, and upon fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to break the knot of Union betwixt Man and Man (eſpecially amongſt Chriſtians, upon whom above all other kind of Men, the tye of Love and Communion doth moſt eſpecially reſt) was a Crime hardly pardonable, and that nothing Abſolves a Man from the guilt of it, but true and unpretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience; yet when they came to pronounce of <hi>Schiſms</hi> in particular (whether it were becauſe of their own intereſts, or that they ſaw not the Truth, or for what other cauſe God only doth know) their Judgments many times (to ſpeak moſt gently) are juſtly to be ſuſpected: Which that you may ſee, we will range all <hi>Schiſm</hi> into two ranks.</p>
            <p>For there is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in which only one Party is the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi>; for where cauſe of <hi>Schiſm</hi> is neceſſary, there not he that ſeparates, but he that occaſions the ſeparation is the <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> wherein both Parties are the <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi>: For where the occaſion of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is unneceſſary, neither ſide can be excuſed from the guilt of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ask, Who ſhall be the Judge what is neceſſary? Indeed that is a Queſtion, which hath been often made, but I think ſcarcely ever truly anſwered; not becauſe it is a Point of great depth or difficulty truly to aſſoil it, but becauſe the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38505:23"/>
true ſolution carries fire in the tail of it. For it bringeth with it a piece of Doctrine which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pleaſing to Superiours. To you for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this ſhall ſuffice. If ſo be you be <hi>Animo defoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato,</hi> if you have cleared your ſelf from froath and grounds; if neither ſloth, nor fears, nor ambition nor any tempting Spirits of that nature abuſe you (for theſe and ſuch as theſe are the true Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, why both that, and other Queſtions of the like danger are not truly anſwered) if all this be and yet you ſee not how to frame your reſolution, and ſettle your ſelf for that doubt; I will ſay no more of you than was ſaid of <hi>Papias,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s own Scholar, you are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, your abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are not ſo good as I preſumed.</p>
            <p>But to go on with what I intended, and from which that interloping Queſtion diverted me; that you may the better judge of the nature of <hi>Schiſms</hi> by their occaſions; you ſhall find that all <hi>Schiſms</hi> have crept into the Church by one of theſe three ways; either upon matter of Fact, or matter of Opinion, or point of Ambition. For the firſt; I call that matter of Fact, when ſomething is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be done by us, which either we know, or ſtrongly ſuſpect to be unlawful: So the firſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Schiſm,</hi> of which we read in the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it matter of fact; for it being upon Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror taken for neceſſary, that an <hi>Eaſter</hi> muſt be kept; and upon worſe than Error, if I may ſo ſpeak (for it was no leſs than a point of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> forced upon the Church,) upon worſe than Error, I ſay, thought further neceſſary, that the ground for the time of our keeping that Feaſt, muſt be the rule left by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi>; there aroſe a ſtout Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether we were to celebrate with the <hi>Jews,</hi> on the 14th Moon, or the <hi>Sunday</hi> following? This matter, though moſt unneceſſary, moſt vain, yet cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38505:23"/>
as great a Combuſtion, as ever was in the Church; the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſeparating and refuſing Communion with the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> for many years together. In this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Hurry, I cannot ſee but all the World were <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi>: neither can any thing excuſe them from that imputation; excepting only this, that we charitably ſuppoſe that all Parties out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did what they did. A thing which befel them through the ignorance of their Guides; (for I will not ſay their malice) and that through the juſt judgment of God; becauſe through ſloth and blind obedience, Men examined not the things which they were taught, but like Beaſts of Burden pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently couched down, and indifferently underwent whatſoever their Superiours laid upon them. By the way; by this you may plainly ſee the danger of our appeal unto Antiquity, for reſolution in controverted points of Faith, and how ſmall relief we are to expect from thence. For if the diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chiefeſt Guides and Directors of the Church, did in a Point ſo trivial, ſo inconſiderable, ſo mainly fail them, as not to ſee the Truth in a Subject, wherein it is the greateſt Marvel how they could avoid the ſight of it; can we without imputation of extreme groſneſs and folly, think ſo poor-ſpirited Perſons, competent Judges of the Queſtions now on foot betwixt the Churches? Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me; I know not what Temptation drew that Note from me.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which had in it matter of fact, is that of the <hi>Donatiſt</hi>: who was perſwaded (at leaſt ſo he pretended) that it was unlawful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or communicate in holy Duties with Men ſtained with any notorious Sin. (For howſoever <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others do ſpecify only the <hi>Thurificati &amp; Traditores,</hi> and <hi>Libellatici,</hi> and the like, as if he ſeparated only from thoſe, whom he found to be ſuch;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38505:24"/>
yet by neceſſary proportion, he muſt refer to all notorious Sinners) Upon this he taught, that in all places where good and bad were mixt together, there could be no Church, by reaſon of Pollution, evaporating as it were from Sinners, which blaſted righteous Perſons who converſed with them, and made all unclean. On this ground ſeparating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all whom he liſt to ſuſpect, he gave out, that the Church was no where to be found but in him and his Aſſociates, as being the only Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom wicked Perſons found no ſhelter; and by conſequence, the only clean and unpolluted Company, and therefore the only Church. Againſt this Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> laid down this Concluſion, <hi>Unitatem Eccleſiae per totum orbem diſperſae propter nonnullorum peccata non eſſe deſerendam</hi>; which is indeed, the whole ſum of that Father's Diſputation againſt the <hi>Donatiſt.</hi> Now in one part of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> there is one thing is very remarkable. The Truth was there where it was by meer chance, and might have been on either ſide, any Reaſons brought by either Party notwithſtanding. For though it were <hi>de facto</hi> falſe, that <hi>pars Donati,</hi> ſhut up in <hi>Africk,</hi> was the only Orthodox Party, yet it might have been true, notwithſtanding any thing St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings to confute it; and on the contrary, though it were <hi>de facto</hi> true, that the part of Chriſtians diſperſed over the Earth were Orthodox; yet it might have been falſe notwithſtanding any thing St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> brings to confirm it. For where, or amongſt whom or amongſt how many the Church ſhall be, or is, is a thing indifferent; it may be in any Number more or leſs, it may be in any Place, Country, or Nation; it may be in All, and (for ought I know) it may be in none, without any prejudice to the definition of the Church, or the Truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38505:24"/>
               <hi>North or South,</hi> many or few, diſperſed in many places, or confined to one; none of theſe either prove or diſprove a Church.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and likewiſe the former, to a wiſe Man that well underſtands the matter in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; may afford perchance matter of pity, to ſee Men ſo ſtrangely diſtracted upon fancy; but of doubt or trouble what to do, it can yield none. For though in this <hi>Schiſm</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> be the <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi> and in the former both Parties be equally engaged in the <hi>Schiſm</hi>; yet you may ſafely upon your occaſions communicate with either, ſo be you flatter neither in their <hi>Schiſm</hi>: For why might it not be lawful to go to Church with the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> or to celebrate <hi>Eaſter</hi> with the <hi>Quartodeciman,</hi> if occaſion ſo require? ſince neither Nature nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor Reaſon doth ſuggeſt any thing to the contrary: For in all publick Meetings pretending Holineſs, ſo there be nothing done, but what true Devotion and Piety brook, why may not I be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in them, and uſe communication with them? Nay, what if thoſe to whoſe care the execution of the publick Service is committed, do ſomething either unſeemly or ſuſpicious, or peradventure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful? what if the garments they wear be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as, nay indeed be ſuperſtitious? what if the Geſture of adoration be uſed at the Altar, as now we have learned to ſpeak? What if the <hi>Homiliſt</hi> or Preacher deliver any Doctrine of the truth of which we are not well perſwaded; (a thing which very often falls out) yet for all this we may not ſeparate, except we be conſtrained perſonally to bear a part in them our ſelves. The Prieſts under <hi>Eli</hi> had ſo ill demeaned themſelves about the daily Sacrifice, that the Scripture tells us, they made it to ſtink, yet the People refuſed not to come to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, nor to bring their Sacrifice to the Prieſt. For in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38505:25"/>
theſe <hi>Schiſms,</hi> which concern Fact, nothing can be a juſt cauſe of refuſal of Communion, but only to require the execution of ſome unlawful or ſuſpected act: For not only in Reaſon, but in Religion too, that Maxim admits of no releaſe, <hi>Cautiſſimi cujuſ<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Praeceptum quod dubitas, ne feceris.</hi> Long it was ere the Church fell upon <hi>Schiſm</hi> upon this occaſion, though of late it hath had very many; for until the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (in which concilable Superſtition and Ignorance did conſpire) I ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that Rout did ſet up Image-worſhip, there was not any remarkable <hi>Schiſm,</hi> upon juſt occaſion of Fact: All the reſt of <hi>Schiſms</hi> of that kind were but Wantonneſs, this was truly ſerious. In this the <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> Party was the Synod it ſelf, and ſuch as conſpired with it. For concerning the uſe of Images in <hi>Sacris,</hi> Firſt, It is ackowledged by all, That it is not a thing neceſſary: <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is by moſt ſuſpected: Thirdly it is by many held utterly unlawful. Can then the enjoyning of the practice of ſuch a thing be ought elſe but abuſe? Or can the refuſal of Communion here, be thought any other thing than duty? Here, or upon the like occaſion, to ſeparate, may peradventure bring perſonal trouble and danger, (againſt which it concerns every honeſt Man to have <hi>Pectus benè praeparatum</hi>) further harm it cannot do. So that in theſe caſes, you cannot be to ſeek what to think, or what you have to do.</p>
            <p>Come we then to conſider a little of the ſecond ſort of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> ariſing upon occaſion of variety of opinion. It hath been the common diſeaſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from the beginning, not to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that meaſure of Faith, which God and Scriptures have expreſly afforded us; but out of a vain deſire to know more than is revealed, they have attempted to diſcuſs things, of which we can have no light, neither from Reaſon nor Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

neither have they reſted here, but upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Church-authority, which is none, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which for the moſt part is but figment; they have peremptorily concluded, and confidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon others, a neceſſity of entertaining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of that nature; and to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, have broken out into Diviſions and Factions, oppoſing Man to Man, Synod to Synod, till the Peace of the Church vaniſhed, without all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of recall. Hence aroſe thoſe ancient and many ſeparations amongſt Chriſtians, occaſioned by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm, Eutychianiſm, Neſtorianiſm, Photinianiſm, Sabellianiſm,</hi> and many more both ancient and in our time; all which indeed are but names of <hi>Schiſm</hi>; howſoever in the common Language of the Fathers, they were called <hi>Hereſies.</hi> For <hi>Hereſie</hi> is an act of the Will, not of Reaſon; and is indeed a Lye, not a miſtake: Elſe how could that known ſpeech of <hi>Auſtine</hi> go for true, <hi>Errare poſſum, Haereticus eſſe nolo.</hi> Indeed <hi>Manichaeiſm, Valentianiſm, Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, Mahometaniſm,</hi> are truly and properly <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi>; For we know that the Authors of them received them not, but minted them themſelves, and ſo knew that which they taught to be a Lye. But can any Man avouch that <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Noſtorius,</hi> and others that taught erroneouſly concerning the Trinity, or the Perſon of our Saviour, did maliciouſly invent what they taught, and not rather fall upon it by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orr and miſtake? Till that be done, and that upon good Evidence, we will think no worſe of all Parties than needs we muſt, and take theſe Rents in the Church to be at the worſt but <hi>Schiſms</hi> upon matter of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. In which caſe what we are to do, is not a point of any great depth of underſtanding to diſcover, ſo be Diſtemper and Partiality do not intervene. I do not yet ſee, that <hi>Opinionum Varietas, &amp; Opinontium

               </gap>, or that Men of different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Chriſtian Religion, may not hold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Sacris,</hi> and both go to one Church. Why may I not go, if occaſion require, to and <hi>Arrian</hi> Church, ſo there be no <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> expreſt in their Liturgy? And were Liturgies and publick Forms of Service ſo framed, as that they admitted not of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and private fancies, but contained only ſuch things, as in which all Chriſtians do agree, <hi>Schiſms</hi> on Opinion were utterly vaniſhed. For conſider of all the Liturgies that are or ever have been, and remove from them whatſoever is ſcandalous to any Party, and leave nothing but what all agree on, and the event ſhall be, that the Publick Service and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God ſhall no ways ſuffer: Whereas to load our Publick Forms with the Private Fancies upon which we differ, is the moſt ſovereign way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate <hi>Schiſm</hi> unto the Worlds end. Prayer, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Thankſgiving, Reading of Scriptures, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Scripture, Adminiſtration of Sacraments in the plaineſt and ſimpleſt manner, were matter enough to furniſh out a ſufficient Liturgy, though nothing either of private Opinion, or of Church Pomp, of Garments, of preſcribed Geſtures, of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magery, of Muſick, of matter concerning the Dead, of many ſuperfluities, which creep into the Churches under the name of Order and Decency, did interpoſe it ſelf. For to charge Churches Liturgies with things unneceſſary, was the firſt beginning of all ſuperſtition, and when ſcruples of Conſcience began to be made or pretended, then Schiſms began to break in. If the ſpiritual Guides and Fathers of the Church would be a little ſparing of incumbring Churches with ſuperfluities, and not over rigid either in reviving obſolete Cuſtoms, or impoſing new, there were far
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38505:26"/>
leſs danger of <hi>Schiſm</hi> or <hi>Superſtition</hi>; and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience were likely to enſue, would be but this, they ſhould in ſo doing, yield a little to the imbecilities of Inferiors, a thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have refuſed to do. Mean while, whereſoever falſe or ſuſpected Opinions are made a piece of the Church Liturgy, he that ſeperates is not the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi>; For it is alike unlawful to make profeſſion of known or ſuſpected falſhoods, as to put in practice unlawful or ſuſpect actions.</p>
            <p>The third thing I noted for matter of <hi>Schiſm</hi> was <hi>Ambition,</hi> I mean <hi>Epiſcopal Ambition,</hi> ſhewing it ſelf eſpecially in two heads; one concerning Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the ſame See, another the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Biſhops in divers Sees. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us, that Neceſſity cauſeth but ſmall faults, but Avarice and Ambition were the Mothers of great Crimes; <hi>Epiſcopal Ambition</hi> hath made this true: For no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hath produced more frequent, more continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more ſanguinary <hi>Schiſms,</hi> than this hath done. The Sees of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and above all of <hi>Rome,</hi> do abundantly ſhew thus much, and our Eccleſiaſtical Stories witneſs no leſs, of which the greateſt part conſiſts in the factio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating and tumultuating of great and potent <hi>Biſhops. Socrates</hi> Apologizing for himſelf, that profeſſing to write an Eccleſiaſtical Story, he did oft-times inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace the actions of ſecular Princes and other civil bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes; tells us, That he did thus to refreſh his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who otherwiſe were in danger to be cloy'd by reading ſo much of the Acts of unquiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Biſhops, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (that I may ſhew you a caſt out of my old Office, and open you a Myſtery in Grammer) properly ſignifieth to make Butter and Cheeſe: Now becauſe theſe are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38505:27"/>
not made without much agitation of the Milk, hence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by a borrowed and tranſlated ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſignifies to do things with much agitation and tumult.</p>
            <p>But that I may a little conſider of the two Heads which I but now ſpecified; The firſt I mentioned was the <hi>Plurality of Biſhops</hi> in one See. For the general practice of the Church from the beginning, at leaſt ſince the original of Epiſcopacy, as now it is, was never to admit at once more than one Biſhop in one See; And ſo far in this point have they been careful to preſerve Unity, that they would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Biſhop in his See to have two Cathedral Churches, which thing lately brought us a Book out of <hi>France, De Monogamia Epiſcoporum,</hi> written by occaſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Langres,</hi> who, I know not upon what fancy, could not be content with one Cathedral Church in his Dioceſs, but would needs have two, which to the Author of that work ſeems to be a kind of ſpiritual Polygamy. It fell out amongſt the Ancients very often; ſometimes upon occaſion of difference in Opinion, ſometimes becauſe of difference amongſt thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the choice of Biſhops, that two Biſhops and ſometimes more were ſet up, and all Parties ſtriving to maintain their own Biſhop, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeveral Churches, ſeveral Congregations, each refuſing to participate with others, and many times proceeding to mutual Excommunication. This is that which <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls <hi>Erigere Altare contra Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>: to this doth he impute the Original of all Church diſorders; and if you read him, you would think he thought no other Church-Tumult to be a <hi>Schiſm</hi> but this. This perchance might plead ſome excuſe; For though in regard of Religion it ſelf, it matters not whether there be one or more Biſhops in the ſame
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38505:27"/>
Dioceſs, and ſometimes two are known to have ſat at once (for <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reckoning up the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> makes <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the firſt: and St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> acknowledgeth, that for a time he ſat fellow Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop with his Predeceſſor, though he excuſeth it, that he did ſo by being ignorant that the contrary had been decreed by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>) yet it being a thing very convenient for the Peace of the Church to have it ſo; neither doth it any way ſavour of Vice or Miſdemeanor; their Puniſhment ſleeps not, who unneceſſarily and wantonly go about to infringe it.</p>
            <p>But that other Head of <hi>Epiſcopal Ambition,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Supremacy of Biſhops</hi> in divers Sees, one claiming Superority over another, as it hath been from time to time, a great Treſpaſſer againſt the Churches Peace, ſo it is now the final Ruin of it. The <hi>Eaſt</hi> and the <hi>Weſt,</hi> through the fury of the two prime Biſhops, being irremediably ſeparated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope of Reconcilement. And beſides all this miſchief, it is founded in a vice contrary to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian humility, without which no Man ſhall ſee his Saviour; For they do but abuſe themſelves and others, that would perſwade us, that Biſhops, by Chriſt's Inſtitution, have any Superiority over other Men, further than of Reverence; or that any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is Superiour to another, further than poſitive order agreed upon amongſt Chriſtians, hath preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For we have believed him that hath told us, <hi>That in Jeſus Chriſt there is neither high nor low; and that in giving honour, every Man ſhould be ready to prefer another before himſelf</hi>; which ſayings cut of all claim moſt certainly to Superiority, by title of Chriſtianity; except Men can think that theſe things were ſpoken only to poor and private Men. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Religion agree in this, that neither of them hath a hand in this Heraldry of <hi>ſecundum ſub &amp;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38505:28"/>
ſupra</hi>; all this comes from Compoſition and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men among themſelves. Wherefore this abuſe of Chriſtianity, to make it Lacquey to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, is a vice for which I have no extraordinary name of Ignominy, and an ordinary I will not give it, leaſt you ſhould take ſo tranſcendent a vice to be but trivial.</p>
            <p>Now concerning <hi>Schiſm</hi> ariſing upon theſe Heads, you cannot be for behaviour much to ſeek; for you may ſafely communicate with all Parties as Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall call you, and the <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> here are all thoſe who are heads of the Faction, together with all thoſe who foment it: for private and indifferent Perſons, they may be Spectators of theſe contentions as ſecurely in regard of any peril of Conſcience (for of danger in Purſe or Perſon, I keep no account) as at a Cock fight. Where Serpents fight, who cares who hath the better? The beſt Wiſh is, that both may periſh in the fight.</p>
            <p>Now for Conventicles, of the nature of which you deſire to be informed, thus much in general. It evidently appears, that all Meetings upon unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Occaſions of Separation are to be ſtiled, ſo that in this ſenſe, a Conventicle is nothing elſe but a Congregation of <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi>; Yet Time hath taken leave ſometimes to fix this Name upon good and honeſt Meetings, and that perchance not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without good reaſon; For with publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings thus it fares: Firſt, it hath been at all times confeſſed neceſſary, that God requires not only inward and private Devotion, when Men either in their Hearts and Cloſets, or within their private walls, pray, praiſe, confeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but he further requires all thoſe things to be done in Publick, by troops and ſhoals of Men, and from hence have proceeded publick Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38505:28"/>
Forms of Service, appointed Times, and the like, which are required for open Aſſemblies; yet whilſt Men were truly pious, all Meetings of Men for mutual help of Piety and Devotion, whereſoever and by whomſoever celebrated, were permitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception.</p>
            <p>But when it was eſpied that ill affected Perſons abus'd private Meetings, whether Religious or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to evil ends, Religiouſneſs to groſs, impiety, (as appears in the <hi>Ethnick Eleuſmia,</hi> and <hi>Baecchanalia</hi>; and Chriſtian Meetings under the Pagan Princes, when for fear they durſt not come together in open view, were charged with foul imputations, as by the report of Chriſtians themſelves plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and Civil Meetings many times under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of friendly and neighbourly Viſits, ſheltered treaſonable Attempts Againſt Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals:) Hence both Church and State joyned, and jointly gave order for Forms, Times, Places of Publick Concourſe, whether for Religious or Civil Ends; and all other Meetings whatſoever, beſides thoſe of which both Time and Place were limited, they cenſured for Routs and Riots, and unlawful Aſſemblies in the State, and in the Church for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles.</p>
            <p>So that it is not lawful, no not for Prayer, for Hearing, for Conference, for any other Religious Office whatſoever, for people to aſſemble otherwiſe, than by Publick Order is allowed. Neither may we complain of this in Times of Incorruption, for why ſhould Men deſire to do that ſuſpiciouſly in private which warrantably may be performed in publick? But in Times of manifeſt Corruptions and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein Religious Aſſembling is dangerous, private Meetings, howſoever beſides publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, are not only lawful, but they are of Neceſſity
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38505:29"/>
and Duty; elſe how ſhall we excuſe the Meetings of Chriſtians for publick Service, in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and perſecutions, and of our ſelves in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days? And how will thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church amongſt us, put off the imputation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticling, who are known amongſt us privately to aſſemble for Religious Exerciſe againſt all eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Order, both in State and Church? For indeed all pious Aſſemblies in times of perſecution and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions howſoever practiſed, are indeed, or rather alone the lawful Congregations; and publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, though according to form of Law, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing elſe but Riots and Conventicles, if they be ſtained with Corruption, and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

Earth.

               <head>How Chriſt is the Head of the Church.</head>
               <p>From the Worlds beginning, till the laſt hour of it, the Church is eſſentially one and the ſame, howſoever perchance in Garment, and outward Ceremony, it admits of Difference. And as it was from the beginning of the World, ſo was it Chriſtian; there being no other difference betwixt the Fathers before Chriſt and us, but this, As we believe in Chriſt that <hi>is Come,</hi> ſo they believed in Chriſt that <hi>was to Come. Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi> Reference unto Chriſt is the very Eſſence of the Church, and there neither is, nor ever was any Church but Chriſt's; and therefore the Church, amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> was properly and truly <hi>Chriſtian, quoad rem,</hi> as we are. Now as this Church at all times is Chriſt's Body, ſo is Chriſt the Head of it. For it is as impoſſible for the Church, as for the Body, to be without its Head; it is not therefore as your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38505:30"/>
dreams. Chriſt came not to found a New Church, or to profeſs a Viſible Headſhip of it. That Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Church, which we expreſs when we call him the Head of it, is one and the ſame, from the Beginning to all Eternity, neither receives it any alteration in this reſpect, becauſe the Perſon in whom this Relation, is founded, is ſometimes Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſometimes not. 'Tis true indeed, the Head of the Church ſometimes became Viſible, but this is but contingent and by Concomitancy. For Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, becoming Man to Redeem this Church, and manifeſt the way of Truth unto it; It ſo fell out that the Head of the Church became Viſible. Of this Viſibility he left no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, no Doctrine, no Uſe, as being a thing meerly accidental: I ask, Had the Church before Chriſt any Viſible Head? if it had, then was not Chriſt the firſt, as here our Teacher tells us; If it had none, why then ſhould the Church more require a Viſible Head, than it did from the Beginning. To ſpeak the Truth at once. All theſe Queſtions, concerning the Notes, the Viſibility, the Government of the Church, if we look upon the Subſtance and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Church, they are meerly Idle and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: If upon the End, why Learned Men do handle them, it is nothing elſe but Faction.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of <hi>Peter's</hi> Miniſterial Headſhip of the Church.</head>
               <p>In your Author's Paragraphs concerning the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Encreaſe, or Succeſſion of the Church, there is no Difference betwixt us. As for the Proofs of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Miniſterial Headſhip, this firſt concerning his being the <hi>Rock</hi> of the Church, that cannot prove-it;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38505:31"/>
For <hi>Peter</hi> was the <hi>Rock</hi> then; when our Saviour ſpake, but then could he not be the viſible Head, for Chriſt himſelf then was living, and by our Teachers Doctrine, ſupplied that room himſelf. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore howſoever, or in what ſenſe ſoever he were the <hi>Rock,</hi> yet could he not be the viſible Head, except we will grant the Church to have had two viſible Heads at once.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Keys of Heaven committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and Command to feed his Sheep, import no more, than that common Duty laid upon all the Diſciples, To <hi>teach all Nations</hi>; for this Duty in ſeveral reſpects, is expreſt by ſeveral Metaphors. <hi>Teaching,</hi> as it ſignifies the opening of the way to Life, ſo is it called by the name of <hi>Keys</hi>; but as it ſignifies the Strengthning of the Soul of Man by the Word, which is the Souls ſpiritual Food, ſo is it called <hi>Feeding.</hi> Thus much is ſeen by the Defenders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore they fly for refuge to a Circumſtance: It is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Saviour delivered this Doctrine to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> alone (as indeed ſometimes he did) in this it is ſuppoſed that ſome great Myſtery reſts: For why ſhould our Saviour thus ſingle out <hi>Peter,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a common Duty to him, if there were not ſomething extraordinary in it, which concerned him above the reſt? This they interpret a Pre-eminence that <hi>Peter</hi> had in his Buſineſs of Teaching, which they ſay is a Primacy and Head-ſhip; inforcing thus much, that all the reſt were to depend from Him, and from Him receive what they were to preach. For Anſwer, Grant me there were ſome great Myſtery in it, yet whence is it proved, that this is that Myſtery? For if our Saviour did not manifeſt it, then might there be a thouſand Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which Mans Conjecture may eaſily miſs: It is great boldneſs, out of Cauſes concealed, to pick
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38505:31"/>
ſo great Conſequences, and to found Matters of ſo great weight upon meer Conjectures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Prayer for Confirmation of <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, whence it came, the Courſe of the Story ſet down in the Text doth ſhew, It was our Saviours Previſion of <hi>Peters</hi> danger to relapſe, which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he had certainly run into, had not our Saviour extraordinarily prayed for confirmation of his Faith. And the Precept of confirming his Brethren, is but that charitable Office, which is exacted at every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hand, that when himſelf had eſcaped ſo great a Wrack, to be careful in warning and reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others whom common frailty drives into the like Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe Circumſtances, that <hi>Peter</hi> is firſt named amongſt the Diſciples, that he made the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the like, are two weak Grounds to build the Soveraignty over the World upon; and that he ſpake <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> dead, argues ſpiritual Power, but not temporal. But that <hi>Peter</hi> called the firſt Council in the <hi>Acts,</hi> is a Circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Text; for concerning the calling of the Council there is no word, all that is ſaid is but this, <hi>that the Diſciples and Elders met,</hi> no Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Peters</hi> calling them together.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Peter</hi> was 25 Years Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not to be proved out of Antiquity, before St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who ſhuffled it into <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Chronicle, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuch thing extant in his Story. Yea, that he was Biſhop at all (as now the name of Biſhop is taken) may be very queſtionable: For the Ancients that reckon up the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> until their times, as <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and before him <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and before them both <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> never account <hi>Peter</hi> as Biſhop of that See: And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were both Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> at once;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38505:32"/>
by which it is plain he took the Title of Biſhop in another ſenſe than now it is uſed: For now, and ſo for a long time upward, two Biſhops can no more poſſeſs one See, than two Hedge-Sparrows dwell in one Buſh. St. <hi>Peters</hi> time was a little too early for Biſhops to riſe.</p>

                  </gap>, the Words of <hi>Euſebius</hi>; and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> wrote againſt him for it.</p>
               <p>To the third, That the firſt four Councils were called by the Popes, is an open Falſhood, for in the two firſt, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> are not ſo much as mentioned, ſave only as perſons cited. In the two laſt they are mentioned only as Petitioners to the Emperour. There are extant the Stories of <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, Socrates, Ruffinus, Theodoret, Sozomenus, the Acts of the Councils themſelves,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them, <hi>the Writings and Epiſtles of</hi> Leo <hi>Biſhop of Rome.</hi> In all theſe there is not one word of the <hi>Pope</hi> farther than a Supplicant, and the whole cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Biſhops together is attributed to the Emperour. Take for Example but the laſt of them <hi>Leo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was deſirous that ſome things done in a meeting of Divines at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſhould be diſannulled; for this he becomes a Suitor to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:38505:32"/>
the <hi>junior,</hi> to have a General Council, but could never procure it of him. After his death he continues his ſuit to <hi>Marcianus</hi> Succeſſor to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi> who granted his requeſt; But whereas <hi>Leo</hi> had requeſted the Council might be held in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the Emperour would not hear him; nay which is more, the Pope upon good reaſon, had beſought the Emperour to put off the day deſign'd for the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Council, but the Emperour would not hear him. So that <hi>Leo</hi> could do nothing, neither for the calling the Council, nor for the Place nor for the Time. And all this appears by <hi>Leo</hi>'s own Epiſtles. If the Popes could do ſo little well near 500 years after Chriſt, how little could they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when their horns were not yet ſo long.</p>
               <p>The Plea of the Proteſtants concerning the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by them is confeſſed ſometimes to have been pure, is no more prejudicial to Chriſts Promiſe to his Church, <hi>that the Gaits of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her,</hi> than the known corruption of the Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time, or of other Churches after.</p>
               <p>The Cloſe of all is a Demonſtration. A Word unfortunately uſed by your Author, to bewray his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick: For indeed a Reaſon drawn from ſo poor and empty a ſign, falls many bows wide of demonſtrative Proof. Firſt, it is falſe that all the reſt of Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Sees are extinct. The See of <hi>Conſtantinopel</hi> yet ſtands, and ſhews her Succeſſion of Biſhops from St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> till this day, as well as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The See of <hi>Alexandria</hi> yet ſubſiſts and the Biſhop of that place calls him, <gap reason="foreign">

in miſery, in perſecution and affliction: this can make no difference, ſince with Chriſt there is neither <hi>rich</hi> nor <hi>poor,</hi> but a new Creature. And again, their caſe now is as good as was the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> under the <hi>Ethnick</hi> Emperors; for their Lot then was no other than thoſe Biſhops is now. But grant that it had laſted longeſt, what then? Some of them muſt needs have conſiſted longer than the other, except we would ſuppoſe that they ſhould have fallen all together. Peradventure the reaſon of her ſo long laſting is no other, but that which the <hi>Cyclops</hi> gives <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi>
