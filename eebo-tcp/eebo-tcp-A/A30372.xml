            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know no other Address to you, but this of the Press, which I hope will find you out: you have forced me to deal so publickly with you, by your beginning with me; and, which is yet worse, by your refusing to give your own Eyes that Satisfaction which I desired a neighbouring Clergyman of yours to offer you.</p>
            <p>When I saw your Letters to the two Deans, in which you accused the Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s for his <hi>copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out unfaithfully the Papers of</hi> Cranmer <hi>and the other Deans,</hi> which he had published, and added, <hi>that I had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47935:2"/>
also printed them imperfect, and so had abused the House of Commons unto an approbation of my History of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> (where by the way, I cannot imagine why you left out the House of Lords, whose Approbation is printed with the other.) I confess, I wondred upon what you could found so heavy a Charge: I printed no Record in that Collection without comparing the Copies exactly with the Original, for I thought that too important a thing to trust it to any Person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: Therefore finding my self accused of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Fraud, which, if true, must needs shake the credit of my whole Book; I did what I could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your bringing that Shame upon your self, which I do now unwillingly lay on you, not so much for the support of my own Credit, as for maintaining the Reputation of that Work. I therefore desired your Neighbour to tell you, that I was sure I had printed all those Papers faithfully and exactly, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Originals in any thing but the spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: I added, that if you thought fit to fall on any Discourse or Inference of mine, you might do as you pleased, but if you accused me of Unfaithfulness, in publishing any of the Papers that are in my Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>imperfect,</hi> I should be forced to justify my self, tho to your cost: for in such Accusations a Man ought not to be over patient. I bid him also tell you, that as I had printed those Papers exactly, so if you had a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47935:2"/>
mind to see the Originals themselves, I should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them for you: this was done many Months a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. He brought me an Answer from you, that I could make nothing of; but now I see it in Print, and so I will examine it.</p>
            <p>You say that if you may believe the Dean of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Durel,</hi> there is among these Papers in Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s MS. one of Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s, in which there are two Assertions contrary to <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning Church-power, and that <hi>Cranmer</hi> sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Paper; from which he infers that <hi>Cranmer</hi> changed his Mind, and subscribed to <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Opinion; and of all this, you say <hi>I have given no account to the World, but have omitted it in two Impressions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would willingly believe the best of every Man, and make the best of all things that I can, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I should have imputed this to an extream care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness in you; but since you have charged me so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for Unfaithfulness, and abusing the House of Commons in it, and since you refused to accept of the Satisfaction which I had offered you, I must crave leave to tell you (for it is a hard thing, and needs a Preface to soften it) that you have accused me both uncharitably as to the manner of it, and unjustly as to the matter: Since these very things that you say I have left out, are in my Collection, taken <hi>verbatim</hi> from the Original, which will appear by my setting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47935:3"/>
down that which you cite from the Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and that which is in my Collection, over against one another.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a variation in the Words, tho none in the Sense: mine is exactly according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: and the Variations of the Dean of <hi>Windsor</hi> from it, tho they make no change in the Sense, yet are too many to be the Mistakes of a Transcriber: therefore I am apt to think that as Dr. <hi>Durel</hi> writ them out, he put them either in <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending perhaps to make use of them in one of these Tongues, and that afterwards he translated them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own <hi>English</hi> when the Manuscript might be perhaps no more in his power to copy them from the Original. The Reasonableness of this Conjecture will appear from a view of the Words themselves, as he and I have published them; for I have published all <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Paper together with <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription at the end of it.</p>

I wish that instead of reading any other Books, you would read
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47935:4"/>
the Gospels and Epistles more carefully; and before you venture to treat of such tender points as Church-power, that you will learn to practise the Rules of Justice and Christian Charity (not to speak of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and common Discretion); and then the Advices of your Friends will prevail more with you than your own Heats: for tho you flatter your self so far as to fancy (as you began your Preface) that there was a <hi>huged in and noise, Pannick almost and universal, raised in</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>and else-where, for two full Years and upwards, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by your Treatise;</hi> I assure you I never heard of any; tho none, after the two worthy Deans, were more concerned in it than I was; all that look'd into it (for I spoke with none that had quite read it) said it could hurt no body but the Bookseller or your self: tho I have not heard that the Chancery ever gave Equity against an Author for an unsaleable Book. Many wished for the Churches sake, and for your own sake, that she might not suffer by so ill an Advocate, and that you would not discharge your Spleen on two such eminent Men, whose Works (as well as their Persons) will be had in Honour, long after both you and your Book will be forgotten. You are indeed proud of the Honour of assaulting two such Men, and tell the World that their Eminence was no small Motive to you to undertake this Work, and give this modest account of your self (<hi>Preface,</hi> pag. 7.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47935:4"/>
l. 22.) <hi>Doth the King of</hi> Israel <hi>go out as against a Flea?</hi> I confess this is a lofty Figure, and the Application of it to your self is somewhat extraordinary. But there was a Roman Emperor that used to be shut up <hi>catching Flies,</hi> and I am afraid some will think that since you will borrow a Figure from a Crowned Head, this had become you better; but you have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured your self by writing in a Stile so unintelligible, that as I hear few read your Book, so I am confident no body can understand it, and so to be sure they will not answer it. Yet since you tell the World that here <hi>is a Course of Studies upon full Thoughts and a thorough Consideration</hi>: you had best do as another Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror did, write <hi>of your self,</hi> and illustrate your Book with Annotations, and I suppose the Bookseller will take care that it shall only be <hi>to your self.</hi> You tell us that your Book <hi>is born with a Beard, as the Iews say</hi> Esau <hi>was:</hi> it is indeed hairy all over, and so rough is the shag, that it will not submit to the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a <hi>Comb.</hi> I shall only offer to your Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, one Passage which I hope you will not forget in your Annotations: it comes just after that humble comparing of your self to the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and I suppose your Spirits were a little exalted upon so glorious a figure, and so you have risen above my pitch. The words are remarkable: <hi>Nor do those of meaner Order and Qualily undertake that Authority which is

in it self none, falls of it self to the ground, nor was ever influential upon any?</hi> This is but one of many, and is the shortest I could pick out. I suppose you had a meaning when you writ it, tho perhaps in the two full Years and upwards in which it stuck so that it is over grown with Hair, you may have lost it. I shall conclude with two short Advices; the first is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if you intend to write any more, you will learn first to write true English, and then to write good Sense: but I believe this will prove so very hard a Task, that the best and easiest Advice can b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
