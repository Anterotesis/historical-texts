            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE, Sir <hi>Robert Sinclair</hi> OF STEVÈNSTOUN, SHIRREFF of the Shire of <hi>Haddingtoun:</hi> And One of the Members of Their Majeſties moſt Honourable PRIVY COUNCIL.</head>
            <opener>

            </opener>
            <p>MY Deſign in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to you this Small and Mean Eſſay, is neither to keep it or my ſelf from Cenſure; nor yet to take occaſion to divulge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35727:3"/>
your Praiſes. As for the former it is ordinarly ſpoke in a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without all Cauſe, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as ſuch without any Effect: For it neither preſerveth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from Reproach, nor the Book from an Anſwer, when any of them are deſerved. And if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do the latter, I could hardly ſay that which would be thought too litle, to ſuch as know you; but I muſt of neceſſity run the risk of being eſteemed a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, by them, who are neither acquaint with you, nor your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Enduements and great Deſert.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is only to ſhew both to your ſelf and others, how ſenſible I am of the manifold Favours, I have received at your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35727:3"/>
Hands, in a Countrey where I was a Stranger, and you are, amongſt the Gentlemen, the moſt eminent.</p>
            <p>Yea further, you may challenge ſome Right to it as a Domeſtick, it being both Conceived and brought Forth within your Walls, while I had the Honour to attend your incomparable Lady, and ſome of your excellent Children.</p>
            <p>Take it then, Sir, as an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my Gratitude &amp; Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and yet be pleaſed to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with your Favour and Friendſhip, whoſe great Ambition it is, to Subſcribe himſelf,</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT may be thought no ſmall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in me, a Stripling, to enter the Liſts with this Man of <hi>Gath;</hi> he being a ſeven Years older Phyſician as I am a Man. For in the 36 page of <hi>Philander's Second Letter,</hi> publiſhed two Years ago, he boaſteth himſelf to have been a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, for near thirty Years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I as yet have never ſeen Twenty ſix Summers. However, I ſhall ſay no more for my Vindication in this: But, that if I chance to Over-come, my Victory will be the more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and if it be my ill Luck to be Foiled, the Cauſe for which I Fight, will ſuffer the leſs prejudice; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Youngeſt, as well as Meaneſt, of its Patriots, who hath undertaken the Defence.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35727:5"/>
I am more ſolicitous to ſatisfy my Reader, why I, whoſe young Years, ſmall Experience, and weak Ability, might have been a ſufficient Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive from ſuch an Attempt: Do yet nevertheleſs undertake That, which ſeems to have been declined by far abler Pens. And my Reaſons are the following Two,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I thought it not unfit that ſo weak a Brother, as I am, ſhould enter the Combat, that ſo the World ſeeing what can be done againſt him, by ſo mean and obſcure an Author; might thereby judge, what would have been the Event, if any of the more Learned had engaged in the Quarrel: Yea, I looked on the Book which I was to conſider, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy the ſpare Hours of an experienced Man: And I was afraid leſt it might give the <hi>Doctor</hi> too juſt cauſe of Boaſting, if any other as a young Phyſician had given him an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35727:5"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> My Reſentments for Learning in general, and for Phyſick in particular, are ſo great; that I could hardly think to ſee any of them ſuffer ſo much, as they both do, by the <hi>Vindicatory Schedule,</hi> without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring my outmoſt, to procure its Relief from his rapacious Hands, who, providing his own Intereſt may be advanced, careth not ſuppoſe it be upon the Ruines of all others, yea of Learning it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I am abundantly ſenſible, with how much greater Advantage it could have been managed by any other Man whatſomever: But I think when a Houſe is on Fire, it becometh the weakeſt therein, to do what he can to extinguiſh the Flames.</p>
            <p>It was no vain Conceit of my own Knowledge, my Pretenſions to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being as few as my Right can be ſmall, that prompt me to undertake this youthly Eſſay. I had far rather had the ſatisfaction, to have ſeen it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35727:6"/>
well done by others, as to have run the leaſt hazard, of either wronging it, or expoſing my ſelf. However, albeit I have not the Happineſs to be Learned my ſelf, yet I have the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both to value it, and ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it.</p>
            <p>Nor yet was it any contradicting Humour, or prejudice at It, or its Author, that cauſed me proſecute the undertaken Deſign. For I know no honeſt nor ingenuous Man, who will not embrace a Truth, eſpecially in Phyſick, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi luditur de corio humano,</hi> albeit preſented by a mean Hand. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary Proverb tells us, and Reaſon with daily Experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it: That a Fool may give a Wiſe-man Counſel at a time. So that if either Reaſon or Experience could perſwade us of the Advantage the <hi>New Method</hi> hath to the <hi>Old,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould deterr us, at leaſt me, from its thankful Acceptance and conſtant Practice. I ever having (and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35727:6"/>
I hope with God's Aſſiſtance ſtill ſhall) preferred the Safety of my Patient and the quiet of my Conſcience, not only to my Gain and Advantage; but even to my Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I am ſo far from promiſing either Advantage or Eſteem to my ſelf, by this ſmall and abortive Eſſay: That had it not been my deſign to leave the Countrey in a ſhort time, it had never ſeen Light: And were it not to take all occaſion of Glorying from my Antagoniſt, as if I durſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Adverſary, I had concealed my Name. I know there is ſo litle either of Learning or Experience therein, that perhaps I may only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcover my Weakneſs to ſome, who had conceived a better Opinion of my Studies, as ever they deſerved. Nay, it cannot otherways be, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun and ended in ſome Five or Six Days, when I was obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in an Honourable Family, and ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35727:7"/>
was denied that help, I might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have expected from my Books. Neither could I afterwards have the time, or be at the pains, to lick my own Bleeding and untimous Birth, but ſuffered it to creep into the World in the ſame dreſs, in which it had ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from my negligent Pen.</p>
            <p>If it be not good, I have given as litle of it as poſſibly I could, noways imitating Doctor <hi>Brown,</hi> who hath tranſcribed a large Book conſiſting of 14 Sheets, beſides Dedication and Prefaces, from Authors, (ſometimes expreſſing, but oftner concealing their Names) whereas all that any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to <hi>Fevers,</hi> which is the ſubject of his Book, may be eaſily contained in Four.</p>
            <p>I hope nothing herein is repugnant to <hi>Anatomy</hi> or <hi>Phyſiology</hi> in particular, nor yet to any of the known Rules of Phyſick in general: For ſmaller Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein Men may have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinions, without being in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35727:7"/>
any great Errour, I am not much concerned. All who know me, know alſo how far my Humour is from Boaſting, and I know my ſelf how very good Reaſon I have ſo to be, my Parts either Natural or Acquired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but very ſober: Yet I'll boldly affirm, that the Arguments here brought for Sudorificks, are ſuch, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſhall never ſolve, till <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſhall change her Courſe. and as often Cure Fevers by Stool, when left to her ſelf, as now ſhe does by Sweating.</p>
            <p>No doubt my Language will be Cenſured, and I confeſs deſervedly, as Courſe and Barbarous: I ſhall not labour to excuſe it, but ſhall only add ſome Three Things, which may ſerve ſomewhat to Apologize for its Roughneſs. <hi>First,</hi> The Subject is ſuch, as altogether refuſeth a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Dreſs: For here I am not only obliged to adhere to, and frequently uſe again the ſame Terms of Art,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35727:8"/>
which nevertheleſs found pretty harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Mother Tongue, but alſo I am neceſſitat to keep cloſs to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom I endeavour to Refute, ſo that I may ſay with the Poet:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ornari res ipſa negat, contenta doceri.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I reſolved to Inſtruct, not to Complement the <hi>Doctor,</hi> therefore I was not ſcrupulous in chooſing my Words, providing they were proper and did expreſs my meaning.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As I ſaid before, it was only the haſty product of ſome five or ſix idle Days, while I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that Aſſiſtance I might otherways have had, both as to its Mater and Form.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may think it very unexcuſable, to obtrude upon the World a Book, which I acknowledge to be ſo unpoliſhed. I readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that without any great Loſs to Learning both the <hi>Vindicatory Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule</hi> and this <hi>Defence</hi> might have been a wanting: And had it not been for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35727:8"/>
the one it ſhould never have been troubled with the other. But ſeing the Offence was given, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to do ſomewhat to remove the Scandal. And for as litle as this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer may contain, yet I hope, by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and Learned, it will be found a ſufficient Refutation of the <hi>New Method:</hi> As for the Vulgar, I never eſteemed their Applauſe, however, ſeing the very writing of a Book is enough to prevail with them (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways certainly the <hi>Vindicatory Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule</hi> had never taken much) who knows but this, being the laſt, may be thought the beſt?</p>
            <p>Others may probably ſay, Why do I now, after the elapſing of near Three Years, firſt give that Book an Anſwer? To which I Reply, That all along the <hi>V. S.</hi> diſpleaſed me, and ſo much the more, when I conſidered the Deſign upon which it was write, which could be no other, as to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a Name amongſt the ignorant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35727:9"/>
Vulgar, and thereby to be the eaſilier twiſted into the larger Imployment. I was not a litle confirmed in this my Opinion, when ſome ſhort time after my Arival to the Kingdom, in a <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi> the <hi>Vindicatory Schedule</hi> was ſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled into my Hands. I knew not the Author then, neither do I yet, but I inſtantly concluded him ſome empty <hi>Emperick,</hi> who, it not being the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom here as in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, to affix their Libels and Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Poſts and Corners, did chooſe the next ordinary, as well as effectual way, of diſtributing it through Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and Coffee-houſes. I was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry, that one who carried the Honourable Name of a <hi>Doctor in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,</hi> ſhould abaſe himſelf ſo far, as to join Hands with the Scum of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, naughty <hi>Quacks;</hi> who to cheat ſimple people of ſome Money, do not care to rob them of their Lives. This made me ever deſirous that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other ſhould Chaſtiſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35727:9"/>
Impudence as well as Ignorance. And accordingly I am informed it was done (I never having ſeen it my ſelf) in a very fit, and the only deſerved way, in a <hi>Dialogue</hi> betwixt <hi>D. Brown</hi> and <hi>D. Black:</hi> For a Book that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains neither Learning nor Reaſon, ſhould only be Anſwered with Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Scorn. Nevertheleſs the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> glorying in that which ſhould have been his Shame, inſulted the more, as if his Book were altogether unanſwerable. Therefore I thought it not amiſs to give ſome Reaſons why we imploy this Old and Reaſonable Method: Although the Authority and Experience of Phyſicians in all Ages, might be proof enough againſt him, who really, for the Defence of his New Method, brings no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as, <hi>That he ſayes it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, that which engaged me at this time, was this, A Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night ago being in the Company of a Grave and Judicious Miniſter, who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35727:10"/>
as he is a near Relation of the <hi>Doctor's;</hi> ſo he is a great Admirer of his New Method: Where among other things, happening to ſpeak of the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his <hi>Book,</hi> and he obſerving me not much to value it, did freely offer to lend me (for it ſeems the Author is careful to diſperſe them) the <hi>V.</hi> S. with the Two Letters (I having told him, that I had never ſeen only heared thereof) thereby deſigning perhaps to proſelite me. And ſome few Days after, I being obliged, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to attend a Week in an Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Family, did for my Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, write this Anſwer, and return the Books to their worthy Owner. But now I think I may be at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to Buy the Book, which I have been at the pains to Confute. for to this moment I do not poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>I have altogether ſhunned perſonal Reflections, for I love to ſpeak of things freely, but of perſons honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. And if any perſon, either of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35727:10"/>
the one party or other, ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with offended, I ſhall be extremely grieved: For all that I ſay, is only for love of the Truth, I noways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to engage in any Man's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Quarrel. Only that Atteſtation annexed to the Tail of his Book, I cannot away with: For ſurely any knowing Man will think theſe Perſons, though otherways ſenſible and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, very unfit Judges in ſuch a Caſe; yea I ſay, that both <hi>Doctor Brown</hi> and I, ought to give Ear, when ſuch Eminent Men as <hi>Doctor Burnet</hi> and <hi>Doctor Bruce</hi> ſpeak. I have the Honour to be Acquaint with Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Burnet,</hi> and I remember he was pleaſed to inform me, that it was not a <hi>Fever,</hi> but an other Diſtemper which then afflicted the honourable Perſon: And as his great Candor and Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will never ſuffer him to be capable of making a Lye; ſo his great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge in Phyſick, do abundantly free him from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35727:11"/>
of flying to any ſuch baſe and mean Refuge.</p>
            <p>And now to draw to a Cloſe, if the D. ſhall think this <hi>Defence</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any Reply, I hope he will alſo grant me the following Requeſts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways I'le hardly think my ſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to return him any Anſwer. <hi>First,</hi> To oppoſe Reaſon to Reaſon, ſtill conſulting Anatomy and Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy: And neither inſiſting on Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, while I can oppoſe a Thouſand to One; nor yet uſing Railery and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, which are by me all along de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, they being moſt averſe to my Humor, and I often have obſerved, that in ſtead of uniting Mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, they rather ſeparat and disjoin their Minds and Affections. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I wiſh it may be in the Latine Tongue in which the Controverſy cannot only be better managed, it being very hard to expreſs Terms of Art in the Engliſh Language; but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35727:11"/>
alſo our Debates will be thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the Vulgar, who ſeing us blame one another, may be apt to conclude us both in the wrong. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I hope he will do it ſhortly, left when he is pleaſed to appear, I may perhaps be removed.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let not the frequent uſe of the Word <hi>Nature,</hi> offend the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reader. I have read <hi>Boyle</hi> on that Subject, and means nothing thereby, ſave the different Figure, Structure, Texture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Parts, by which they are enabled to act as Second Cauſes.</p>

            <p>ALthough it be a Work of no ſmall pains, and require the knowledge of no few things, rightly to act the part of a <hi>Phyſician:</hi> Yet not a few there be, aiming more at their own profit than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſafety, who, as they find it moſt Eaſie, ſo they think it moſt Safe, to acquire in ſome few Years, I had almoſt ſaid Months, ſome general Compend and univerſal Method of Curing, which they ignorantly and dangerouſly apply to all Diſtempers.

Not unlike to that Medicaſter ſpoken of by the <hi>Learned</hi> Wedelius <hi>in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Pharmacy,</hi> who ſhufling all the Phyſical Receipts he had heired from his Father in a Bag, deſired the Patient to try his own Fortune: And if the Cure chance at any time to be as ſucceſsful as his was, when called to a <hi>Counteſs</hi> lying ſick of a Squinancy, who trying her Luck, did obtain a Clyſter, which cauſing her laugh, did break the Impoſthum; immediatly they ſet up for Maſters, and are not ſatisfied to uſe the ſame Remedy in all other Diſtempers, though never ſo different, themſelves; unleſs it be alſo imployed &amp; approven by others.</p>
            <p>It's far from my Deſign to apply this to the perſon, againſt whom I am now engaged, at whom I have neither any Prejudice, nor of whom I know any Evil, ſave the Writing of the <hi>Vindicatory Schedule.</hi> My In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention being only to endeavour the Vindication, not only of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

From one of which, providing it be true, what the Author of the <hi>V. S.</hi> moſt falſly alledges, they cannot be abſolved.</p>
            <p>Among all theſe Miſeries and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, unto which Man by his Fall was made liable, a <hi>Fever</hi> perhaps, is the moſt frequent. A <hi>Fever</hi> it is which in all Countries, and in all Seaſons, without reſpect to either Sex or Age, does daily Invade, Afflict, yea and Kill many Perſons. Neither can it other ways be, ſeing our Life ſeems no depend upon the circular and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35727:14"/>
Motion of our Blood: Which Motion can hardly be troubled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the production of one ſort of <hi>Fever</hi> or other. So of neceſſity a <hi>Fever</hi> muſt be of all Diſtempers, the moſt frequent as well as moſt dangerous.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant my ſelf, far leſs I'm ſure any of theſe in whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I write, how many and great Debates there be among Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Definition as well as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Fevers:</hi> However I ſhall concern my ſelf in none of them here, where I only reſolve to give a ſhort, and for what appears to me, the moſt probable Account of the Diſeaſe, in ſo far as it may ſerve for clearing its Method of Curing. For as I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from preſumiug (being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly conſcious of my own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to uſurp the part of a <hi>Teacher.</hi> So I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

remote from, and alien unto the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they treat of, into their own Books, and thereby make them as Ridiculous as the Picture deſcribed by <hi>Horace,</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Art.

            </p>
            <p>To me then it ſeems not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Formalitie, Eſſence, or if you pleaſe a Term of Art, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Cauſe of a <hi>Fever,</hi> conſiſts in a Commotion or Exagitation of the Inteſtine as well as Circular Motion of the Blood: Whereby the Oécono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the Body is diſturbed, with divers and ſometimes right grievous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35727:15"/>
Symptoms. Which Commotion, for the moſt part, may ariſe from ſome Heterogeneous Body conveyed into it.</p>
            <p>That the Blood is the Subject of <hi>Fevers,</hi> I ſuppoſe will be called in queſtion by none, ſeing not only the Changes, and ſometimes Advantages, which do accrue to the Patient by its Evacuations, are very obſervable; but alſo the Crudity and Coction of the morbiſick Matter in the Urine is diſcernable: In a word, the <hi>Jaundice</hi> which ſometimes ſolves the Diſeaſe. the Alterations of the Pulſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſufficient to perſwade the moroſeſt of Antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>I look upon it as needleſs, either to trouble the Reader or my ſelf here, with that more curious as uſeful Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Which of the Blood's two parts is moſt frequently affected: It being, in my Opinion, not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to acknowledge in the ſame, a more liquorous and craſs Subſtance
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35727:15"/>
which is moved, beſides another more Spiritual or Aetherecal which moves. All the Arguments alledged in favours of the Aetherecal Portion, ſuch as the power of Opiats in Curing <hi>Fevers,</hi> and theſe continual as well as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, the Effects of the Fancy and Apprehenſion in the ſame Caſe, the unchangableneſs of the Urin and Pulſe in malign <hi>Fevers,</hi> and the like: By any judicious and skilled Phyſician will be as ſoon Anſwered as they can be Propoſed. Yea, it ſeems to me highly probable, that ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other, but moſt frequently both, may be the Theatre of this unlucky Tragedy.</p>
            <p>It was not unadviſedly that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the word Exagitation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to that of Fermentation: For by this means I not only evite all theſe Debates and Altercations, which I have obſerved betwixt <hi>Willis, Bonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koe,</hi> and others. But alſo I am fully convinced, that Fermentation proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35727:16"/>
taken, is very improperly, either in a Natural or Praeternatural State. adſcribed to the Blood. For to let alone many other Reaſons, reiterate Experience hath taught me, that no ardent or ſulphureous Spirit, can be diſtilled from the Blood of feveriſh perſons: Which nevertheleſs the ſame Authors tell us, ſhould always be obtained from fermented Liquors. However if theſe Learned Men who delight in the word Fermentation, underſtand only an extraordinary Commotion, Ebulition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I aſſent to what they ſay, and think as they write, never loving to conteſt about Words (my Humor being moſt averſe to Diſputes and Debates) when we can agree in Things.</p>
            <p>Some there be, and theſe none of the Unlearnedſt, as particularly that excellent Anatomiſt and Phyſician, <hi>Barbette,</hi> who maintain the Eſſence of a <hi>Fever</hi> to conſiſt ſolely in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion augmented, But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35727:16"/>
ſome Arguments to be had from <hi>Barbette</hi> himſelf: Not only the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pulſe in the beginning of all <hi>Fevers,</hi> and through the whole Courſe of malign ones: But alſo the very nature of a Fluid Body, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the perpetual inteſtine Motion of its Minute or ſmall Particles (which clearly appears by the diſſolution of Sugar, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any Menſtruum, the gathering together of the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Particles of Silver to the injected Copper, beſides ſeveral other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, to be met with in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Boyle his History of Fluid: and Firm,</hi> (does ſufficiently, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, overturn this ingenious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. Howbeit, I ſhall adventure to ſay, that the inteſtine Motion of the Blood being troubled) with its Circulation ſometimes diminiſhed, but oftner augmented, does conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that Diſeaſe which is known to the Vulgar, by the Name of a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:35727:17"/>
From this Exagitation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, it will be no hard matter, to derive all the other Symptoms which in different Subjects do differently invade: Yea, which is no ſmall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to confirm the Truth of what I have ſaid, with this Exagitation they ordinarly increaſe and remit. I do not incline to treat of them all, therefore ſhall only take notice, as the moſt frequent and principal of the following Four.</p>
            <p>And to begin with Heat, in which the Ancients either ſought the Patho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnomonick Sign, or placed the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a <hi>Fever</hi> (for betwixt theſe two there is no ſmall difference, which were eaſie to ſhow, if my intended Brevity did not forbid me) it eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſerves our Conſideration. The Opinion of the Schools placing the Formality of <hi>Fevers</hi> in Heat, albeit it prevailed long with Phyſicians, yet at length it was exploded by <hi>Helmont, Sylvius,</hi> and other: And that (1) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35727:17"/>
in the beginning of <hi>Fevers,</hi> which by all is acklowledged as one of their parts, Cold creats greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Heat, Yea (2) ſome malign <hi>Fevers</hi> there be, in which the Patients are never heard to complain of Heat, but rather at ſometimes do tremble with extream Cold. Nevertheleſs by admitting a diſtinction betwixt the Beginning and Status of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and betwixt Internal and Suppreſt, and External and Manifeſt Heat, I had far rather grant to the Ancients that the Formality of a <hi>Fever</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Heat, as ſay with D. <hi>Brown,</hi> that Heat is the genuine Effect of ſlow Motion in the Blood. Whether it be the ſublimity of his Diſcourſe, or my ſhallow Capacity, I ſhall not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine But forced I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. that I can hardly underſtand what he there intends, only by the Title of the 8. §. <hi>p.</hi> 111. I find he reſolves to prove Heat to be the genuine Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſlow Motion in the Blood:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35727:18"/>
The contrary of which I have ever been taught, and ſhall here endeavour to evince.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> I would have it obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the inteſtine Motion of any Fluid, or Body whatſomever, deſerves as well the denomination of Motion, as the progreſſive does; yea the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> himſelf, in the end of the Section, by his Inſtance of the Breath and Hand, ſeems alſo to acknowledge it: And if I thought he doubted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I could ſend him to Cooks, to behold their boiling Liquors, not now to mention the Experiments afforded us by the <hi>Incomparable</hi> Boyle <hi>in his Mechanical production of Heat.</hi> Now conſequently Heat cannot be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſlow Motion abſolutely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſince the Inteſtine, which is moſt properly ſo called, is with it and in it exceedingly intended. The <hi>Doctor</hi> ought at leaſt to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed betwixt the Two, and not to have attributed indefinitly to both,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35727:18"/>
that which Experience denies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to any of them, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as I noted before, to one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Cauſe why by ſwift progreſſive Motion the Heat is abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I think, is not becauſe that Motion is intended, but rather that the determinate Inteſtine Motion, <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum deorſum &amp; ad utraque latera,</hi> is thereby diminiſhed, or at leaſt not proportionably therewith augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So that if the Inteſtine, can be conform to the Local, as you ſhall intend the progreſſive Motion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably you ſhall increaſe the Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I cannot enough admire, how the <hi>Doctor</hi> comes to aſſert, that Heat is the genuine Effect of groſs Blood, ſince, with all others, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will acknowledge Heat to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with inteſtine Motion: For ſure I am the more groſs and thick any Body is, the more unfit it is for Motion whatſomever, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35727:19"/>
rendered the more innept to procure Heat. This is a thing ſo clearly demonſtrat by Philoſophers, that it were but a conſuming of time, to inſiſt in its probation, and had it come from ſome old Peripatetick I could eaſily have pardoned it, but in the <hi>Doctor</hi> who pretends ſo much Skill to the New and Experimental Philoſophy, I can hardly forgive it. Nay I have a greater eſteem of our Author's Knowledge, than to think him ignorant of this common and perpetual Truth: But the matter is, his falſe and precarious Hypotheſis does neceſſarly extort it: For grant one Abſurdity a hundred will follow.</p>
            <p>More excuſable had he been to have ſaid. That craſſneſs of Blood was the native product of Heat, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that be but alſo accidental. For whatſomever cauſeth Heat in the Body <hi>v. g.</hi> volatile Salts, the Sun, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the Body and Mind, do all of them immediatly and neceſſarly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35727:19"/>
bring along with them Thinneſs of the Blood, and only accidentally Craſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>viz.</hi> By accelerating its Motion they do augment Tranſpiration, by which the thinner Particles are exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the remainder conſequently turns thicker, and ſo much the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo much the unfiter to produce Heat. Hereby it is clearly evinced how falſly the <hi>Doctor</hi> philoſophizeth; when he would perſwade us that Craſſneſs of the Blood is the Cauſe of Heat: When on the contrary it is rather the Effect, and that but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally too: For whoever can ſtop or impede the Conſumption of the thinner Particles in Tranſpiration, ſhall alſo prevent the Thickneſs of the Blood, notwithſtanding its Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> So far is it from being true what the <hi>Doctor</hi> averrs, <hi>P.</hi> 111. that Heat is cauſed by the Attrition the Muſcles make on themſelves and the adjacent Parts; that the <hi>Doctor,</hi> nor none for him, ſhall ever by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35727:20"/>
or Attrition, procure Heat to a ſphacelat Member: Where neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be Muſcles and Bones both, but wants Blood and Spirits.</p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I humbly think that not only Motion, but the Motion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminat, Sulphureous, Oyly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, is requiſite to excite Heat. Which in my Judgement may hence be proven: That not only Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies are moſt ready to contract Heat, Flame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and according as there is more or leſs Sulphur in the Body, ſo the Heat will be the greater, leſſer or none at all; but alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine and confuſed Motion of the Minute Particles, may ſometimes be intended without the increaſe of Heat, yea with the production of a ſenſible degree of Cold to the very ſame Hand, as may be learned from <hi>Boyle in his Mech. Orig. of Heat and Cold:</hi> I being at the time removed from my Books, can neither Inſtance the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment nor Page, but ſure I am
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35727:20"/>
ſeverals are there to be found, And here by the by, I would ſeriouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to the uniting of theſe Two, <hi>(viz.</hi> The New Philoſophy and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry) which to the great prejudice of ſolid Learning, have too long been unluckily ſeparat: For the former being mainly taken up about Motion, has almoſt intirely neglected the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: While the latter on the other hand, being as much concerned with the Matter, have wholly over-looked the Motion.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid I think may ſuffice to evert our <hi>Author</hi>'s Poſition: When in his 8. §. he engages to prove <hi>Heat</hi> in <hi>Fevers</hi> to be the genuine Effect of ſlow Motion in the Blood. It being rather produced, while the Motion thereof, eſpecially Inteſtine, is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the ſulphureous Particles do move, as it were, from the Center to the Circumference.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Symptom of <hi>Fevers, vix.</hi> A fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35727:21"/>
and hard beating Pulſe, which the experienced <hi>Slyvius,</hi> to whom the Hypotheſis of the Ancients was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying, made enter the Definition of <hi>Fevers,</hi> as the Genus. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this his Opinion is lyable to the ſame Cenſures with the former. For neither the beginning of <hi>Fevers</hi> have ſtill the Pulſe augmented, nor yet can we always call it a <hi>Fever</hi> where it is accelerate: As in congrumate Blood, Commotions of the Mind, Worms contained in the Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is eaſily demonſtrable Moreover, by the by, I cannot but obſerve, that theſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcoveries made in Anatomy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Bile, Succus Paner,</hi> &amp;c. do noways deſtroy this Hypotheſis, which are nevertheleſs given by the <hi>Doctor</hi> as the only Reaſons why he rejects it: For it can very well ſtand without that prope, and hath been, and ſtill is maintained by theſe, who never adopted his Triumverat. The Cauſe of this frequency of the Pulſe, I take
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35727:21"/>
to be nothing elſe, as the frequent and violent Contraiction of the Heart, by which the contained Blood is ſqueezed out, and ſo diſtendeth the Arteries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is alſo to be noticed, that Cold is not only a Symptom of all <hi>Intermittent Fevers:</hi> But frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo it is obſervable in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Continual Ones. Which Cold, any perſon acquaint with the experimental Philoſophy, the <hi>Doctor</hi> pretends to be ſo much verſed in will think to be a more native product of the ſlowneſs of the Blood's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Heat. In a word, the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Members in perſons troubled with Sounding, where the Motion of the Blood, as well Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as Inteſtine, together with the Pulſe, is ſenſibly diminiſhed, does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly prove it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt of theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms I purpoſe to ſpeak of is a change in the Urine, (and it admits of the

ſame Exceptions with the former, as to malign <hi>Fevers)</hi> which in reſpect of their Conſiſtence, generally turn thicker, ſeldom thinner: As to their Colour the Natural or Citrin is often turn'd red and fiery, and ſometimes pale and watry, but eſpecially in the beginning theſe are remarkable, while in the Progreſs and Status they appear ſtill red and thick. In rendring Cauſes for theſe Phaenomena, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways incline to follow them, who run inſtantly to Acids and Alkalies. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I readily grant this Hypotheſis to be of pretty large extent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently applicable to ſeveral Caſes; yet I cannot in all acquieſce in their Sentence, for Reaſons, perhaps to be afterwards rendred.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſuppoſe now with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Bohn</hi> and Experience: That the elemental parts of Urine are Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Salt, Sulphur, and Earth. So that the Urine whoſe watry and lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid portion is moſt ſaturate with theſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35727:23"/>
Saline and Sulphureous Particles, is always obſerved the thickeſt and craſſeſt: Hence I conclude the cauſe of thick and turbid Urine, to conſiſt in the confuſed Admiſtion, and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Diſſolution of the ſolid Particles in the aqueous Vehicle. So ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we obſerve the Urine to be clear when voided, and afterwards to turn thick, craſs and turbide: Which is commonly called, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rina tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata.</hi> And, in my Opinion, ariſeth hence: That theſe ſaline and earthy Particles being more cloſly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inſinuate, in the Pores of the watry part when firſt voided, do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Rays of the Sun to penetrat, and ſo it appears Diaphanous: But if afterwards either by their own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and looſer Coheſion, or by the conſtriction and ſtraitning of the Pores of the Serum, by the ambient frigid Air, they chance to be turnèd out, the paſſage to the Rays is thereby intercepted, and the Urine turns
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35727:24"/>
turbide and opack, as I formerly ſaid. Again it is ſometimes evacuate turbide, and perſiſteth in that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition, whence it is named, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rina confuſa,</hi> and this is ordinary in the Increment and Status of <hi>Fevers:</hi> Perhaps, there being many Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous and Terreous Particles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally mixed with the watry por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which nevertheleſs are ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjoined to the Serum, all being yet in a ſtate of Crudity, that neither by their proper weight, nor by the help of the external Ambient, can they be thence ſeparate. And <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the ſame Urine is ſometimes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the end of the Status and beginning of the Declination emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Thick and Turbide, but does ſhortly after become Clear and Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide: Probably the Concoction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then approaching, theſe Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Minima, which being kept in motion in the Body, did ſtill run up and down the containing Liquor,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35727:24"/>
whereby if ſeemed confuſed, do now being voided and acquiring reſt, yea ſome two or three, or more of them joining together, become heavier <hi>inſpecie</hi> as the Serum, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of neceſſity muſt ſeek to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, where they conſtitute the <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But if they Hang in the midle, they are called <hi>Suſpenſio,</hi> and if they ſwime above, go under the name of <hi>Nubecula:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the other hand, that Urine, which ſhould ordinarly repreſent and a Ly mid-way boiled, does ſometimes turn thinner, and this eſpecially in the beginning of acute <hi>Fevers</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable. For the explaining of which, it will not be impertinent, to diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinam potus,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinam Sanguinis,</hi> for the <hi>Urine of the Drink,</hi> being never digeſted in the Ventricle, nor aſſimilate to the Blood in the Veſlels, paſſeth the Reins without all alteration. But the cauſe of this thin conſiſtence in the <hi>Urine,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:35727:25"/>
as we ſpeak of the <hi>Blood,</hi> may be a twofold Crudity: <hi>First,</hi> That in the Stomach, where the Aliments being fruſtrate of their due, Digeſtion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupply the Serum with its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Salts. And the ſecond is that in the Reins, whoſe <hi>Tubult</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obſtructed, admit only the thin and Watery, excluding the groſs and terreous particles.</p>
            <p>The Citrine or natural Colour of the Urine, as it depends in a natural ſtate (which I think none will deny) from the ſaline and ſulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Chyle, in the different Digeſtions extracted, and more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matly therewith commixed: So from the greater or leſſer quantity of theſe Minima admixed in a praeternatural ſtate, their Colour is ſometimes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſometimes darkned: However I never intend to exclude other Cauſes, ſuch as congrumate Blood, the uſe of Rhubarb <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this ſhall ſuffice for the Changes of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35727:25"/>
Urine, upon which I have inſiſted the longer, becauſe they are wholly neglected in the <hi>Vindicatory Schedule,</hi> ſuppoſe of all others they give us the greateſt Light, both as to the Prognoſticks and Cures of <hi>Fevers.</hi> Neither was this Omiſſion of the <hi>Doctors</hi> altogether without reaſon, for not only the Signs of Crudity and Coction, which ever have, and ſtill will be obſerved by Learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in <hi>Fevers,</hi> and by which the <hi>New Method</hi> is intirely deſtroyed, from them, and them only are to be had; but alſo few or none of the Moderns, from whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> might expect help, have write any thing tollerably of them.</p>
            <p>Having briefly handled ſome few of theſe Symptoms, with which a <hi>Fever</hi> is ordinarly attended, I come next to enquire after the antecedent Cauſes, which may, and ordinarly do produce this Exagitation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, in which I have been labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35727:26"/>
to prove the continent Cauſe of <hi>Fevers</hi> to conſiſt. And theſe I think, for the moſt part (never intending to exclude all others) will be found the following Four. <hi>viz. Obstruction, too violent Motion, Natural Evacuation</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and eſpecially <hi>Crua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ties</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred into the Maſs of Blood.</p>
            <p>By Obſtructions I would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe underſtood, as the Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that limpid and ſerous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which being ſecerned in the Subcutaneous or Miliar Glands, is excerned through the Pores of the the whole Habit, and that in no ſmall plenty, under the Name of <hi>Inſenſible Tranſpiration.</hi> Which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement being condenſed and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late by the cold ambient Air, or any other Cauſe, does interrupt, not only the further Tranſpiration: But alſo diſturbs the whole Circulation in the capillary Veſſels, or rather muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fibers. By which means the Motion of the ſubſequent Blood being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35727:26"/>
intercepted, the Fibres of the Muſcles, as well as theſe of the Veſſels are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, and thereby urged into fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and irregular (not unlike to Convulſions) Contractions, by which both the circular and inteſtine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Blood are notably inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that which we call a <hi>Fever</hi> produced. It being enough here, for brevities ſake, to ſuppoſe from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thologie, that the Motion of Fluids is augmented, either by the Movent, Mobile, or Canals. And this account ſeems to me, and I hope will alſo to others, far more reaſonable, than with the Learned <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>V. S. P. 106. &amp; ſeq.</hi> to attribute Senſe and Reaſon to groſs and ſtupid Matter. Concerning Obſtructions more may perhaps be found hereafter, when I come to conſider our <hi>Author</hi>'s New and Mechanical <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> For of all other Cauſes I look upon them as the moſt ſeldom,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:35727:27"/>
It is eaſie to gather, from what is immediatly ſaid, that theſe Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſes or Inoſculations of the Arteries and Veins. which with the Ancients, ſome of the Learned Moderns do admire as very convenient, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly neceſſary, for the Explication of the animal Functions, are not by me admitted, I deſire to move a Debate to no Man, therefore ſhall ſuffer them to abound in their own Senſe who embrace them, providing they will only allow me to give ſome Reaſons why I reject them: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I never have (neither I think ever ſhall) adopted or repudiat any Opinion, becauſe it was defended by this, or impugned by the other Man. And to let alone Secretion and Nutrition, which to me, theſe Inoſculations being granted, ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unexplicable: There be two Experiments to be found in ſome place of the <hi>Learned</hi> Bohn <hi>his Cire Anat.</hi> (I not having the Book by me
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35727:27"/>
cannot deſign the Page, but ſure I am of them. having oftner as once ſeen them tryed) which do clearly evince the Bloods Extravaſation. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> Inject with a Syphon tepid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an Arterie, <hi>v. g.</hi> of the Arm, of any ſubject whatſomever, a knot being caſt upon its fellow Vein: The Water will never run out at the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Vein (it being lanced betwixt the Ligature and the Arterie) till the whole Arm and Hand be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtended: <hi>i. e.</hi> The Pores of the Muſcles be all repleniſhed. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Injection being made of melted Wax into an Arterie, as alſo of the ſame, but of another colour, into its neighbour Vein: They will be found to have penetrate to the extremities of both the capillary Veſſels (but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Arteries, the Valves hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring much in the Veins) but we ſhall never diſcern any intermediate Canal, communicating with both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35727:28"/>
The grand, yea only Objection, formed againſt this Opinion, is, That this Extravaſation being admitted, a continual Hemorhagie muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity follow, and that the Blood would rather diffuſe it ſelf through the Fleſh, as enter the ſmall capillary Veins. This Objection indeed appears to be plauſible, and to create ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But yet there is nothing in it what ſerious and after reflection will not eaſily remove, which were no hard matter to ſhew, if my deſign and leaſure did not hinder me now. I ſhall at this time only deſire the Objectors to conſider and ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not there be any difficulty in the Extravaſation of the Blood, which is not in each of the following Three Obſervations I offer to their conſideration. The <hi>Firſt</hi> of which is, That ordinary way of ſeparating Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Oyls, commonly called, <hi>Filtratio per Elychnium,</hi> where the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Oyl, any of them in which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35727:28"/>
the Cotton is dipped, will by means of the Wool be carried from one Glaſs to another, without the loſs of ſo much as a drop: And why pray may not the Blood be carried the very ſame way by the fleſhy Fibers from one. Veſſel to another, eſpecially ſince the Tonick Motion of the Parts, and influx of the Artereal Blood do help much: Whereas the Experiment with the Oyl, hath no other Aſſiſtant, than the gravity of the Air. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That Experiment firſt tried by <hi>Burnerus de Paner.</hi> and afterwards ſucceeding to others, as alſo to my ſelf, does, in my weak Judgement, not a litle confirm what I am ſaying: And it is this, Blow with a Tub into the Weazand of a Gooſe, whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine being tyed nothing can deſcend, the Flatus will enter the open Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Meſaraick Veins, and tend to the <hi>vena porta.</hi> From which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, without any conſtraint, the following Concluſion I think
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35727:29"/>
may be drawn: That the capillary Veins may be open, and yet no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morhagie or Effuſion of Blood will follow. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is further made probable <hi>per purgationem menctruam,</hi> where no doubt the capillary Veſſels, by which that Excretion does hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, are always patent. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, I think, who will affirm, that they, being otherways cloſed, ſhould at the due and ſet time get open. If that were objected, I know no other cauſe that could, with the leaſt appearance of Reaſon, be aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their ſo doing, ſave the Blood it ſelf, which being yielded, it could hardly be refuſed, that whatever gave the Cauſe the firſt being, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all queſtion ſtill endeavour its perpetuation, from whence there muſt of neceſſiry ariſe a continual Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagie, the contrary whereof is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs dayly experienced, What needs more, theſe Anaſtomoſes are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to Reaſon, and they yet never appeared to the Senſes,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:35727:29"/>
The <hi>Second</hi> of the antecedent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I alledged to be too violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Body, I may perhaps alſo add theſe of the Mind. It were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to produce Obſervations, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this my Aſſertion, there being abundance to be had from the general Collectors, I mean <hi>Forrest, Schenkins, Hildanus,</hi> and others. I ſhall rather explain the ways by which they ſeem to produce their Effects: Which may be the following Two. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By attenuating the Blood, and accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its Motion, as well Circular as Inteſtine: Which is done either by rarefying it ſelf, or by opening the Pores, and admitting calorifick Atoms. Though this laſt chances very rarely, for it rather happens that the Pores being dilated, cold Particles get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by which theſe Obſtructions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned are procured: And this, I think, may be the other way too violent Motions work in exciting a <hi>Fever,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:35727:30"/>
In the <hi>Third</hi> place, ordinary Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations ſuppreſſed come under our Conſideration, whoſe concurrence, I expect, by none will be denied: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that not only Blood-letting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, yea ſometimes Cures <hi>Continual Fevers;</hi> but alſo Nature it ſelf does frequently endeavour, and ſometimes obtain its own Relief, by bleeding at the Noſe and elſewhere. But this, as a thing conceded by all, I ſhall leave, and rather conſider the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription afforded us by our Author, of inſenſible Tranſpiration, (it being of all moſt frequently ſuppreſſed) in which he ſhews nothing of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and exactneſs, that might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected from an Author of a New Method.</p>
            <p>It's needleſs to mention how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently and prolixly he inſiſts not only upon the Invention, Utility, and Greatneſs of this Secretion: But he muſt needs diſcourſe alſo of Chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Reſpiration, and fixed Salts,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35727:30"/>
(how skilfully ſhall be afterwards ſhewn) all which are tranſcribed from <hi>Sanctorius, Majou, Etmuller,</hi> &amp;c. and for any thing I can ſee, upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Deſign, ſave to enlarge the bulk of his Book: For all that can any ways concern <hi>Fevers</hi> in that large 9. §. conſiſting of 14 Pages, may be eaſily contained in ſeven Lines. Yea ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt argue no ſmall Folly in a Man, to bring in ſuch ſtuff as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſubject requires, nor he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf underſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> How he makes the Air the principal efficient of <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> I cannot underſtand, for to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Man it is evident, that the Ambient, by its Gravity and Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, will rather impede as promove it. But that I may ſhew him all the Favour I can, I ſuppoſe it is rather that, which according to him, is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood in Inſpiration, he here intends: Yet in the mean time it is no ſmall Debate, whether the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35727:31"/>
Air be mixed with the Blood in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration or not? as he may ſee in <hi>Harvey de Circ. San. Higemore Diſq. Anat. Needham de Form. Fort.</hi> &amp;c. And really it muſt be confeſſed, there want not Reaſons on both ſides. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grant it were ſo, none who hath the leaſt knowledge in Phyſiology, will call it the efficient Cauſe of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration: That being acknowledged by all, to be nothing elſe, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Motion of the Blood, which nevertheleſs noways depends upon Reſpiration, as <hi>Maurocordatus</hi> would have it. The <hi>Doctor</hi> may make the Experiment in himſelf, it being in his power, to ſtop his Breathing, though not the Bloods Circulation. Ay there is no School Boy in the Kingdom but knows, that by Runing the Circulation is accelerate, the Pulſe augmented, and inſenſible Tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration intended to Sweat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By what Figure our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor comes to call that no natural
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35727:31"/>
Excretion in the 128 Page, which in the 119, he ſays, and that truly, does twiſe exceed all other Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatſomever, perhaps he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly does know: Unleſs it be for the Reaſon immediatly after Page 128 ſubjoined, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sweat is only profitable in ſo far as it ſhuns a greater Evil, was ever ſuch Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard? For what pray are all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evacuations natural! or are any whatſomever natural. Nay, really by this New Method of Reaſoning they are not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Who will ever believe, that inſenſible Tranſpiration ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, condenſeth and thickneth the Blood, while in the mean time, except what goes to the Spirits, its thinneſt and ſubtileſt Portion is thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and ſo by its abode does ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther render it thin and aqueous, than craſs and viſcid. Yea all Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners whatſomever adviſe Sweating as a fit and proper Expedient to render
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35727:32"/>
the Blood thick, and conſequently its ſuppreſſion (inſenſible Tranſpiration and Sweating differing only <hi>ſecundum majus &amp; minus)</hi> muſt have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect in making it thin, Will the <hi>Doctor</hi> anſwer. Theſe condenſed Particles being abſorbed and carried back, do of neceſſity render the other more viſcid. But to this I reply, Theſe by their being ſuppreſſed, do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impede the Excretion of Twenty times as many thinner and watry ones, and thereby abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe their own thickneſs; but alſo it will appear no great Paradox to ſay, that theſe craſs and abſorbed ones, are by the far greater quantity of the Blood and its continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reduced to their former and limpid condition. By all which it is clear, that inſenſible Tranſpiration ſuppreſſed, rather attenuates as thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Blood, contrary to the mind of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>V. S. P.</hi> 126. And hence I conclude, that all or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35727:32"/>
moſt part, the ſtoping of inſenſible Tranſpiration does in procuring <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> is only, by creating Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo diſturbing the Blood in its Motion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Last,</hi> and by far the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, of the Four named antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſes of <hi>Fevers, viz.</hi> Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties conveyed into the Maſs of the Blood, do as yet remain. To inſiſt in proving of this, which is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged, were a meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Time and Paper. Yea, from hence it is, that the generality of the Moderns have perſwaded themſelves, that the Formality of a <hi>Fever</hi> conſiſted in a Fermentation: Conceiving this Heterogeneous Body under the Notion of a Ferment, which, when it could not be aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Maſs of Blood, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in raiſe an Efferveſſence. I gave my Reaſons before, why I could not fight under their Banner, who delight in the Terms of Ferment and Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35727:33"/>
therefore ſhall not repeat them here.</p>
            <p>I think then, in few words, a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> may not be ineptly conceived, as a Wreſtling or Strugling betwixt Nature and what is Heterogeneous thereto, under which it does either ſuccumb or expel whatever is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and injurious to it.</p>
            <p>There are Two Things here to be noticed ere I further proceed: <hi>Firſt,</hi> When I ſpeak of Crudities transferred to the Blood, I underſtand not only Crudities proceeding from the firſt ways (though I eaſily grant theſe to be the moſt ordinary, which may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not only from the great efficacy we find in Emeticks in the Cure of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual as well as Intermittent <hi>Fevers;</hi> but alſo from the great Hurt daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them both, by Errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the firſt Digeſtion) but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits alſo morbiſick Atoms or <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which may enter either by the Pores or Reſpiration, from the ambient
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35727:33"/>
Air: As likeways Raments from Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous, Scirrous and Gypſeous (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don theſe uncouth Terms, for I can give none more plain) <hi>Viſcera.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I muſt own my diſſent from theſe, otherways Learned Men, who are pleaſed to call this Ferment, as they ſpeak, always Acide. For as I could never forgive them, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to build all upon no ſurer Fundation, as an Acid and Alcali; ſo I can hardly either pardon theſe, who trouble us ſo much with them in Phyſick. And that for many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, (without which I'le deny no Mans Hypotheſis) but eſpecially the following Three. 1. Their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Arguments prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways what they are brought for. 2. In their Explication of both Acid and Alcali, they are ſtill very obſcure, and could never ſatisfy me, yea I believe hardly themſelves. And 3. A great many Phaenomena, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> Gravity,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35727:34"/>
Levity, Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are by them unaccountable.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Reaſons againſt the Hypotheſis in general, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obviate the Arguments produced for it here in particular. The chief of which I take to be the following Two: <hi>Firſt,</hi> According to the different degree and increaſe of the <hi>Fever,</hi> the Urine is alſo obſerved to intend and heighten its Colour, and that not unlike to thoſe who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnat with Acids, <hi>v. g.</hi> Vinegar, Spirit of Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, by granting the whole, though not always, yet frequently to be ſo; as alſo that it may perhaps be, that this Ferment may ſometimes prove Acide: Yet that this change of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is always, and only the Effects of Acids, I poſitively deny, ſeing by Saline and Sulphureous Agents the ſame may be wrought, and dayly is <hi>in statu ſano,</hi> in which, nevertheleſs no Acid has ever yet been obſe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ved.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35727:34"/>
In a word, they commit that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Error in Phyſick, as well as in Philoſophy, of forming from particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Experiments general Hypotheſes. So obſerving Acids and Alcalies to Ferment, they have laid it down as an univerſal Axiom, that wherever Fermentation is found, there muſt of neceſſity an Acid and Alcalie exiſt; while yet ſucceeding Experiments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that very high Acids. <hi>v. g.</hi> Oyl of Vitriol, Butter of Antimony, beſides many others, which can be inſtanced by ſuch as are aquaint with Chymiſtry, will efferveſce together.</p>
            <p>Their other Argument, which is of the ſame force, is taken from the great and good Effect of Salts, <hi>(Salia ſalſa</hi> I mean, which are compoſed of Acids and Alcalies, and conſtitute a Third very different from both) Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaceous and Alcalick Powders in Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Fevers:</hi> Which being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Acids, makes them conclude <hi>(dum contraria contrarus curantur)</hi> the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35727:35"/>
morbifick Cauſe to be always ſoure: To this it may be replyed, That they fall into the ſame Fault, which was reprehended in the former: <hi>viz.</hi> Of drawing univerſal Concluſions from particular Premiſes. For I can ſafely ſay, that Acids themſelves, <hi>v. g. Spir. ſalis, Elyxir Vitrioli Mynſichti,</hi> &amp;c. are frequently, and that not without deſirable ſucceſs imployed in <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were very eaſie yet further to move a great many Arguments againſt this Hypotheſis: Such as an artificial <hi>Fever</hi> excited by the Inunction of the Oyl of Beetls, <hi>Fevers</hi> not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing their ariſe to Fear, Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I ſuppoſe it needleſs. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already inſiſted longer on this as I deſigned, I proceed to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, after I have told, what every perſon, at leaſt Phyſician, knows, that the Procatartick Cauſes, which give occaſion to the Antecedent, and ſet them a working, be the <hi>ſex res non naturales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:35727:35"/>
I ſhall neither trouble my ſelf nor my Reader, with that infinite Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Fevers,</hi> to be had in <hi>Sylvius</hi> and others, thinking it enough to conſider the following Four, under which all others may be eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are diviſible into Continual and Intermittent: Which Continual may again be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe called <hi>Continentes,</hi> which from the beginning to the end, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all exacerbation, obſerve the ſame Schem: And into theſe called <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuas,</hi> which never leave the Body without a <hi>Fever,</hi> but yet have Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations, ſometimes once a day, and then they are called, <hi>Continuae Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidianae,</hi> ſometimes once in two days, when they go under the Name of <hi>Continuae Tertianae,</hi> &amp;c. And to me they appear nothing elſe, as a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and Intermittent <hi>Fever</hi> joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Secondly, Fevers</hi> are devid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Benign and Malign. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35727:36"/>
Into Acute and Lent. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Into Primary and Secundary or Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomatick.</p>
            <p>All that hath already been ſaid is concerning Continual <hi>Fevers,</hi> and applicable to them: So I proceed to conſider theſe called Intermittent, which have created as great Trouble to Phyſicians in this Age, in aſſigning them a true and congrous Cauſe, as they did to theſe in the former, in finding a proper and ſucceſsful Cure. I cannot now ſtay to cribrate the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sentiments of different Authors, but ſhall propoſe what to me ſeems moſt probable, which in few words is this: Every Paroxiſm of an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent <hi>Fever,</hi> is Analogous to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Continual one, and hath its ariſe from Crudities carried through the firſt Ways and <hi>Vaſa lactea</hi> into the Maſs of Blood, in which, they being thereto hardly aſſimilable, raiſe and excite theſe Tumults before deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And do now conſtitute a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35727:36"/>
now a Tertian, now a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at one time an Erratick, at another time a Periodical <hi>Fever. Firſt,</hi> Becauſe of the Matter, which is now more copious, now more ſcant, now craſſer, and thicker, now thinner and fluider, in one perſon at certain, in another perſon at uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times, thither transferred. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Becauſe of the diverſity of the ſubject, the Blood of one being eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſet a working as that of another. In a word, when ever there comes ſo much Matter to the Blood, as can raiſe a ſtrugling therein, a Paroxiſm is produced. But after all, I think no ſhame to confeſs, that there occurrs to me ſomewhat here which ſeems unaccountable, and therefore I ſhall never obtrude upon others, what I do not enough underſtand my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Benign <hi>Fevers</hi> are theſe called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, but not accompanied with theſe horrid Symptoms, which being preſent, do give them the Name of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35727:37"/>
Malign. And ſuch are great Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Inquietude, ſudden Proſtration of the Strength, Spots, cold Sweats, Tumors about the Glands, called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides, &amp;c.</hi> In enquiring after the Cauſe of theſe <hi>Malign Fevers,</hi> I can find nothing ſave obſcurity in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of Authors: While ſome, with <hi>Willis,</hi> fancy to themſelves a great Coagulation of the Blood: Again others who follow <hi>Sylvius,</hi> ſtrive as much for a lixivious and uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Acrimony of the ſame. <hi>De la Font</hi> pleads hard for an Arſenical and Corroſive Poyſon inſpired with the Air. For me, in ſuch ambiguity, I willingly profeſs my Ignorance: But ſtill enclines to look upon their Cauſe as always Epidemick, coming either from the Air, Meat or Drink: And whenever it effects, ſeazeth eſpecially upon the Head; we ordinarly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Symptoms of the Brain to inſult, whilſt Pulſe and Urine ſuffer ſmall or no change. And hence I ſuppoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35727:37"/>
is the Proverb, Good Pulſe, good U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and the Patient Dies.</p>
            <p>Acute <hi>Fevers</hi> are ſuch, as termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt the 9, 14, 20, or 21. day: But continuing no longer as the 7, they are called Peracute: Yea, ſometimes they Kill in the Third and Fourth Day, and ſo get the Name, (and that deſervedly) of <hi>Peracutiſſimae:</hi> While theſe, who extend themſelves to the 40 day, are termed <hi>Acutae ex Decidentiâ.</hi> And all that exceed this Term whether <hi>Fevers</hi> or other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, have obtained the general Denomination of Lent or Chronick Diſeaſes. It is certainly beyond all queſtion, that this Diverſity ariſeth from the weakneſs or ſtrongneſs of the morbifick Matter, which in Lent Diſeaſes, at the beginning, brings litle or no alteration to the Humane Body, but through proceſs of time, partly by defatigating the Body, partly by rendring more of the Blood like unto it ſelf, proves exitial to the Patient:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35727:38"/>
Which is too frequently ſeen in a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick, it being of all Lent <hi>Fevers</hi> the moſt formidable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Fevers</hi> were divided into Primary and Secundary or Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick. The firſt are ſuch as have their Cauſe within themſelves, and own their Being to no other Diſeaſe, as do the others called Secundary or Symptomatick. Which be ſometimes excited by pain, as in the Gout, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes they accompany Wounds, Inflammations, Ulcers, and many other Maladies: By all which the Motion of the Blood, as well Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular as Inteſtine may be augmented, and that which we call a <hi>Fever</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>In the Page 185 of the <hi>V.</hi> S. the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Exactneſs, and great Skill in Phyſick is very conſpicous: For there he aſſerts <hi>Fevers</hi> and Tumors (I ſuppoſe he means Inflammations, Tumors being of a large extent) to be perpetual Companions: So that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35727:38"/>
according to his Pathology, the one cannot exiſt without the other. Whereas all the World knows, yea dayly finds it, that <hi>Fevers</hi> can exiſt without his Tumors, yea not one of ten Thouſand, without all Hyperbole, hath them. True it is indeed, that Inflammations are ordinarly (yet not always) followed by <hi>Fevers,</hi> and they are among the number of theſe I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Secondary or Symptomatick.</p>
            <p>Many Things appertaining to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> and their Theory: as Symptoms, Prognoſticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do as yet remain. But I being far from preſuming to give a particular Account or Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Diſeaſe, knowing it to be a Load too heavy for my young and tender Shoulders, finds my ſelf nowayes obliged to mention them here: My purpoſe being only to give a general, and for what appears to me, the eaſieſt and beſt Deſcription of the Malady, into whoſe Method of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I reſolve to inquire. Neither will
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35727:39"/>
I labour (it being more my deſire to do well my ſelf, than to diſcover that others have done ill) in refuting the Opinions of others, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> doth, though with Arguments I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. ſometimes againſt, but as often for them.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt paſs ſome Reflections upon the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s New and Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hypotheſis, left my paſſing it by ſhould offend its Author. And to ſpeak ingenuouſly, his deſcription of the Diſeaſe is as obſcure, as his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Curing is dangerous. Have then the Scheme of the New and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Hypotheſis in the Author's own words, <hi>P.</hi> 104. <q>Seing then</q> (for the five Pages which go before, contain only the Fundation, though very unproportionable to the Noble Building afterwards erected in little more as one) <q>the returns of Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the parts and functions ought to be made, both in time and quantity in proportion to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35727:39"/>
waſte, by the efflux of the arterial Blood from the Heart as the <hi>Vehicle,</hi> and thorow the <hi>Arteries,</hi> as the <hi>Conduites</hi> of theſe Recruites: When this is done <hi>Vegetly, Integrally,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtop or delay, then redounds <hi>Felicity Eaſe,</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> of the <hi>Functions</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> But when that <hi>Efflux</hi> is retarded or ſtopt, either by reaſon of the Blood it ſelf, or ſome ſtopage in the Extremities and ſmall Channels of the Veſſels; or by reaſon of immoderate and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual waſte, beyond the proportion of the ordinary ſupply, (as falls out in immoderate Exerciſe and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) And, ſo I ſay, when by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any of theſe Cauſes, the Heart cannot convey and lay in the deſired Supplement in due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and timouſly, by Stroaks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at the uſual Intervals, then it does, by precipitating the Stroaks, and ſtraitning the Intervals of the <hi>Pulſations,</hi> endeavour, what in it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35727:40"/>
lyes, to overcome the ſlowneſs of the Motion of the Blood, and to come ſo near as it can to the due and proportionable diſtribution of <hi>Nutriment,</hi> in reſpect of the waſte: But if, notwithſtanding of theſe <hi>ſedulous Endeavours</hi> of the Heart by redoubling of the <hi>Pulſations,</hi> that ſlowneſs of the Blood, ſhall by a gradual encreaſe of the thickneſs, and of Obſtructions in the <hi>Capillary Veſsels,</hi> prove yet ſo obſtinate as ſtill to be augmented, then this leads ſtraight to the Porch and Gate of Death; Death being nothing elſe but a total and permanent Ceſſation, and defect of this diſtribution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the Deſcription of a Diſeaſe, and it never once named! Is this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> becauſe it is ſo clear, that who runs may read it? ſurely then my Capacity is very ſhallow: For had not the Title of that 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> promiſed a New and Mechanical Hypotheſis, I ſhould from this Deſcription never
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35727:40"/>
have inferred it, and had not the very next Paragraph propoſed an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhould further have looked back for it. Yea I believe it would puzle your ſelf, were it not for theſe Marks, to find it. For my part, I ſee nothing here deſcribed ſave Death, and that perhaps not undeſervedly, for by means of the New Method Death and <hi>Fevers</hi> are become <hi>Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and ſo the one with you, may ſafely go for the other. But Thanks be to God, it is otherways with us, who walk in the Good, Old and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Path, where it becomes but ſometimes a paſſage unto it.</p>
            <p>But why, pray, a New Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis? it being as old as ſince <hi>Bontekoe</hi> write <hi>de Febribus.</hi> It is indeed very hard to know that Author's proper Opinion, he being more taken up in refuting others, as in explaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And what he hath ſaid is ſo harſh and obſcure, that he can ſcarcely be underſtood, yet, if I be not deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35727:41"/>
he endeavours to evince a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Blood in Continual <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving this I go to things more ſerious, where it ſeems to me not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that one of the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errors into which the <hi>Doctor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſlipped, is that which I have noticed before, <hi>viz.</hi> The drawing of univerſal Concluſions from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Propoſitions: For by what I can learn from this Deſcription, it being indeed very hard, at leaſt for me to draw any thing therefrom, he would gladly perſwade us that Obſtructions and only they, are the Antecedent (and for what I can ſee the Conjunct to) Cauſe of <hi>Fevers.</hi> The contrary of which, not only innumerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors with infinite Examples have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: But I my ſelf have ſhewn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, that there can be, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are other Three, beſides many moe by me over looked. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Rock upon which many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Men have ſplit, therefore to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35727:41"/>
pardoned in our Author, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him therefrom, to the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I gave before, I ſhall now join other Two.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> There was nothing more ordinary, as upon the ſeeing Acids coagulate, to aſſert, that wherever Coagulation hapned, there muſt of neceſſity exiſt an Acid: While yet after Experience did teach us, that Alcalies can crudle Milk, and Spirit of Wine coagulate Humane Blood. In the like manner, Practitioners ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the good ſucceſs of Acids at ſome occaſions (for they do it not always, as <hi>Poterius</hi> obſerves) in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Digeſtion, precariouſly they conclude an Acid Humor the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Agent in Chylification: Yea, as <hi>Moebius</hi> obſerves, it was received with ſo general Applauſe and Conſent, that it became almoſt Hereſie to call it in queſtion: Albeit later Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts have not only demonſtrate, that Alcalies and Urinous Bodies may have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35727:42"/>
the ſame, yea greater Effect, but have intirely baniſhed the famed Acid its fictitious Office. To ſhut up all, it is this, that hath given occaſion to a great many Errors in Phyſick as well as Philoſophy, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> peculiar to this or the other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, have been generally applied to all kinds, and ſo from particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Obſervations, we have formed univerſal Hypotheſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot conceive how Obſtructions can be either ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious or ſo frequent as the <hi>Doctor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates. I ſhall not make uſe of the ordinary Objection, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs of no ſmall force: That there can be no Obſtruction without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Tumor. However I wiſh the <hi>Doctor</hi> had told us, in which of the Veſſels, I mean Arteries or Veins, theſe Obſtructions fall out. For firſt it is to me unconceivable how they can be in the Arteries; ſeing nothing enters them, that hath not firſt run
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35727:42"/>
through the ſmall milky Veſſels, from thence to the <hi>Ductus Thoracicus,</hi> which empties it ſelf in the ſubclavial Vein, and that again by the <hi>Vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> into the right Ventricle of the Heart, out of which it is conveyed to the Lungs by the Pulmonal Artery, and from thence to the Hearts left Ventricle by the Vein of the ſame Name, from which, as from a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it is diſpenſed to the whole Body, by the great Artery and its Branches.</p>
            <p>All which being conſidered, may not I reaſonably argue: That ſurely, whatſomever hath paſſed theſe ſmall Lymphaticks, commonly called the milky Veſſels, and the capillary Branches of the Pulmonal Vein; will never ſtick in any part of the great Artery, eſpecially when its ſtrong and frequent Vibrations, do afford great aſſiſtance to this its Motion. Yea without ſtopping the Courſe of the Blood in the whole Branch, it is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35727:43"/>
altogether impoſſible, that any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can happen in the minuteſt Artery.</p>
            <p>The ſame Difficulties, if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will meet us in the Veins, which are the other kind of Veſſels: For if we conſider their Figure, we find it a Cone inverted; now no Man of Senſe will alledge, that what hath entered the ſmall end of a Cone, as the Blood does in the Veins, will ſtop in the great: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions muſt be denied.</p>
            <p>Several other Obſervations might ſafely be made on this Paradoxical, as he himſelf, <hi>P.</hi> 109, juſtly calls it, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis: But I ſhall detain the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no longer. Only I cannot omit, that in the beginning of the 8 <hi>Sect.</hi> he perſwades himſelf, that the rapid Circula<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of the Blood, is wholly overturned, and yet <hi>P.</hi> 105<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he is giving that which he would have us digeſt for a New Scheme of <hi>Fevers,</hi> he boldly, and as I think,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35727:43"/>
contradictorly, affirms the Heart to redouble its Pulſations. Which how it can happen, ingenuouſly I, nor I ſuppoſe none elſe, can conceive: Yea it is clearly repugnant to Reaſon and the Circulation. Nevertheleſs I ſee by the 27 <hi>P, of Philanders ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that the <hi>Doctor</hi> will needs defend it.</p>
            <p>What D. <hi>Black,</hi> or any who carries that Name, may have ſaid againſt it, I am wholly ignorant, theſe Books having never come to my Hands. But what I ſhall do, ſhall be only this, to give a brief Account of the Hearts Motion and its Cauſe, and ſo leave the <hi>Doctor</hi> and others to judge, how reconcilable theſe Two are: <hi>For the Heart to double its Pulſations, and yet not to accelerate the Bloods Circulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Blood that enters the right and left Ventricles of the Heart from the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> does ſtimulate its Fibers: By which ſtipulation the Animal Spirits
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35727:44"/>
are brought from the Brain by the Eight, or wandring pair of Nerves, and being depoſed in its lax Fibers, do contract the ſamen, and ſtraiten its Ventricles with ſo great a force, that whatever is contained therein, is expelled, and thruſt into the Arteries in this its <hi>Systole,</hi> by which they are diſtended and acquire a <hi>Diaſtole:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the ſame Fibers are laxed, and theſe of the Auricles contracted, whereby the Blood, theſe Auricles had immediatly received from the Veins, is diſmiſſed to the Heart, which now, by the Relaxation of its Fibers, is in the <hi>Diastole:</hi> Which Blood does a new ſtimulate as formerly, and ſo procures to the Heart a new <hi>Syſtole,</hi> under which the Blood is again thruſt forth into the Arteries, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them a <hi>Diastole</hi> or Beating. So that the Arteries will never be diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, except the Blood be admitted, for they can be the cauſe of their own <hi>Syſtole,</hi> but never of their <hi>Diaſtole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:35727:44"/>
Now how can a Man averr, that the Heart can double its Pulſations, and yet not render the Circulation more rapid: Seing except it emit what Blood it had received in its laſt <hi>Diastole,</hi> it can never obtain a new <hi>Systole.</hi> The <hi>Syſtole</hi> being nothing, ſave the contraction of the Fibers, and expulſion of that Blood, it had received in the former <hi>Diastole.</hi> In a word, it is as impoſſible for the Heart to be contracted in the <hi>Syſtole,</hi> without expelling the contained Blood, which muſt of neceſſity go into the Arteries and cauſe their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation; as it would be for the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> to preſs together the two ſides of a Bladder filled with Water, without expelling the contained Liquor.</p>
            <p>By which brief and true Account of the Hearts Motion, it may excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently appear, how fitly it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our Learned <hi>Doctor, in the 27 P. of Philand: ſecond Letter,</hi> to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of Water in Pumps.

In the mean time the Air having no acceſs to the Cavity of the Pump, does neceſſarly gravitat upon the Water in which it ſtands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is forced to aſcend in the Pump, in which, by the retraction of the Sucker, it meets with no oppoſition, till ſuch a height, as is able (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it will by no means go) to keep an <hi>Equilibrium</hi> with an equal Column of the external Air, which hath the ſame ſuperfice, wherein the Pump ſtands for its Baſis, and the Atmoſphaere for its height.

               </gap>ation, Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> himſelf may be Judge: However it quadrates as well as the moſt of his Simile's.</p>
            <p>And now while I'm yet upon his Theory, it may be a fit time to give a Specimen of his exactneſs in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, Phyſiologie, and Chymiſtry. To begin then with Anatomy, his great Skill herein is excellently ſhewn <hi>P.</hi> 178, where he pretends to give a Reaſon, why hurtful to lye with the Head low: Which is, that then, the groſſer Blood does aſcend, whereas it being higher, the more ſpiritous only gets up, while the more craſs ſeceeds at the <hi>(N. B.) Axillary branches</hi> Excellent indeed! From whom I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did D. <hi>Brown</hi> learn, but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever enters the Branches of Arteries, is carried foreward to their end, yea how can it otherways be, ſeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, by the help of their ſecond Coat, which is tendinous, they are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35727:46"/>
conſtringed, and ſo at every place and in every moment, give a new <hi>Impetus</hi> to the contained Blood. But yet better Anatomy, for ay till D. <hi>Brown</hi> did write, we have been in a general Error, when we uſed to ſay, That the ſubclavial Arteries, after they had demitted from themſelves, three ſuperiour <hi>Intercoſtals,</hi> the <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariae Vertibrales, Cervicales &amp; Muſculae,</hi> did go out of the Thorax or Trunck, and tend to the <hi>Artus</hi> or Arms, where they got the new Name of Axillares But now D. <hi>Brown</hi> hath diſcovered our Ignorance, by ſhewing, that they have their ariſe from the Carotides (otherways it were Folly and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe to ſay, that the groſſer Blood ſeceeds by them, for except they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Carotides, how ſhall it enter them?) Had the Doctor ſaid inſtead of the Axiliars, that it ſeceeds to the Larynx and Pharynx, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receiving a ſhare of that Blood, which tends to the Head; he might
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35727:46"/>
have concealed his Ignorance, though not given any great proof of his Knowledge.</p>
            <p>For ſo far is it from being true, what the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays: That the great Artery is not at all, according to the Ancients, divided into the Trunck aſcending and deſcending; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to the Learned and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Anatomiſt D. <hi>Highmore,</hi> it is immediatly upon its egrefs from the left Ventricle of the Heart, divided into the two ſubclavial Branches. Nevertheleſs it is not all true, what he alledgeth, when he affirmeth that from the right Subclavial both the Carotides do ariſe: For frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath taught me, and no doubt will alſo do any, who will be at the pains to try it, that from the right Subclavial does only ariſe the right Carotis, and the left (which, to my knowledge, was never noticed by any) comes neither from the right Subclavial, nor yet from the left;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35727:47"/>
but is a third Branch ariſing from the Heart it ſelf, and hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with any of the Subcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vials, but far leſs with the Axillary Branches. I know the Doctor hath this from <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> but really it is too well known, that this great Wit and ſubtile Man, was none of the beſt Anatomiſts, and perhaps it was his greateſt Fault, to aſſert things he thought conſonant to Reaſon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much careing or conſidering how they might be favoured by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nevertheleſs the Doctor when citing him, ſhould have known to diſcover his Error.</p>
            <p>Good Phyſiology is ſtill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of accurate Anatomy, as is alſo to be ſeen in the Doctors New and Ingenious Hypotheſsis of Chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which <hi>P.</hi> 131. is moſt dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly explained, by a Grinding and attenuating the Aliments, their parts one againſt another by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Ventricle whereby it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35727:47"/>
ſeems the Doctor would grate them to Chyle. But I would willingly know, if ever he, or any Man elſe obſerved a ſolid Body turned into a Fluid, except it were Ice, Butter and and ſuch like, which have been Fluid before, by meet attrition: When ever the Doctor affoords me one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (for that of a Plume looks like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expreſſion as Attrition) then, and never till then, I'le grant his whole Hypotheſis. Moreover for what end is all that Apparatus of Glands in the Stomach, and why do Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans adviſe the ſwallowing of the Spitle with large drinking at Meat, as great helps to the digeſtion, if it happen by meer Attrition: For certainly the harder any thing is, it is ſo much the ſitter for Grinding; or elſe the <hi>Authors Idea</hi> thereof, muſt be quite different from the Vulgar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And really what is brought from the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious <hi>Papins</hi> Digeſter does rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute as confirm, what it is brought for:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35727:48"/>
The Gelly being produced, not by the Bones mutual Attrition, but by the Waters diſſolving and extracting. Yea if I remembor right (it being now a good time ſince I read that Book, and not being at Home I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſult it) the Ingenious <hi>Author</hi> himſelf calls it Extraction, which all the World knows is quite different from Attrition.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame kind is that account of Sanguification, which in the 18<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Page of his <hi>V. S.</hi> he is pleaſed to communicate with us. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed extreamly obliged to him, at leaſt for his good Intentions, for labouring in a few Lines to accomodate that Difference, which hath cauſed almoſt bloody Conteſts for ſo many Ages. I cannot enough admire the Policy of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> who prudently (knowing moſt Debates to be about Words) conceals theſe invidious Terms of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical and Similar Functions, they having given occaſion to no ſmall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35727:48"/>
ſtrife: Whilſt ſome with the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, plead hard for the former, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> cry as loud for the latter. However, albeit our Author hath not been ſo ingenuous as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, the Aetiology he gives, makes it purely Organical, only what ſome adſcribed to the Heart, others to the Liver, the Doctor attributes allenner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lungs. But pray, what does the Duty in the Foetus, where during Nine Months, the Lungs lye intirely idle: For I doubt nothing, but the Doctor knows the Foramenovale (which does not go from the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> to the <hi>Vena Pulmonalis,</hi> as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally affirmed, but rather termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the left Auricle it ſelf) and <hi>Canalem Arterioſum.</hi> Now I hope the Doctor will never ſay, that Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the work of the Lungs, when the Blood is made for Nine Months in the Foetus, and they never once concurr. After the Doctor hath conſidered and ſoundly anſwered this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35727:49"/>
Objection, if I can raiſe no other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, I ſhall adopt his New Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis. But till ſuch time, I expect he'll not be offended, if I ſhall aſſert Sanguification to be a Function part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Organical, and partly Similar. <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Liver, Reins, Pancreas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such Particles as could not turn into Blood, are depoſed, and ſo its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical: Alſo by the continual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, the ſulphureous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Particles of the Chyle, are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate to the Blood, for which it is called Similar.</p>
            <p>Yet I am ſo ingenuous as to grant to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that Sanguification hath more help from the Lungs (the Blood deſcending always more florid and brisk by the <hi>Vena Pulmonalis,</hi> as it did aſcend by the Artery) as from any other part whatſomever: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they concurr only as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with many others, albeit they may perhaps be the principal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:35727:49"/>
As for that Argument ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, by the Learned <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> it creates me no great difficulty: For albeit I cannot but grant, ocular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection having demonſtrat it to me, that the Blood appears in the Embryo, before any Organ, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be made by that, which is poſterior to it ſelf. Yet I ſtill think, there is great difference betwixt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guification in the Foctus and in an Adult Perſon: For in the former, it is not ſimple Chyle that is converted into Blood, but that which already circulating in the Mothers Body, hath demitted its Bile in her Liver, its Urine in her Reins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it is diſpoſed to turn into Blood. So that if it had not experienced already the organical part from the Mother, the ſimilar action in the Foetus ſhould hardly have produced the effect. For, which I hope none will deny, as the ſame Subject may be different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected by diverſe Agents, ſo the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35727:50"/>
ſame Agent will produce divers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon various Subjects.</p>
            <p>As expert ſeems the Doctor to be in Chymiſtry, as either Anatomy or Phyſiology. In all his Book there occurs nothing, that ſavours of that Noble Art, ſave one paſſage from <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Tackenius,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to either Author or Book might have been omitted, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond all debate now, that alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate or fixed ſalts, are not formerly preexiſtent in any Body, being only produced by the acting of the Fire, ſo cannot as the Doctor would have it, be diſſolved and extracted by the Aire, before they exiſt. He ought rather to have ſaid, That the Saline (there being a great difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Salts) and Sulphureous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which by joining together, do conſtitute fixed (they not being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural but Factitious) or alcalizat Salts, while the Herbs are a drying, exhale and fly away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:35727:50"/>
After having dwelt ſo long upon the Theory of <hi>Fevers,</hi> it's time to proceed to their Method of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Which indeed is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Thing, it being no great Matter how wild a Mans Opinions be in Speculations, providing he do not apply them to practice. No Man muſt expect here a Deſcription of all the various Indications, which may, and ordinarly do require Attention in a dogmatick and methodical Cure. My deſign being only (as I often ſaid) to propoſe the Good, Old, Rational and Succeſsful Method, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it from D. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Objections: who hath not himſelf, albeit the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a New One, noticed the half, of what deſerves conſideration in a Rational Cure.</p>
            <p>Which nevertheleſs I'le readily grant in ſome Epidemick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Seaſons, and in certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, eſpecially where the Critical Motions of Nature happen <hi>per ſeciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:35727:51"/>
which is not once in a hundred times, to prove unſucceſsful. This only I would ſay, that it is the moſt frequent, and therefore deſerves the Name of the beſt Method: And where nothing happens about the Patient that is ſingular; it ought always to be practiſed.</p>
            <p>Before I go further it will not be impertinent to lay down ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Axioms, which being founded upon ſound Reaſon, and frequent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, have extorted Aſſent from, and Credit with Phyſicians of all Ages: Nevertheleſs they are not underſtood, or rather not much regarded by our Learned <hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Cures are threefold 1. <hi>Cura Curatoria,</hi> which reſpect the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Cauſe, as in <hi>Fevers</hi> and all acute Diſeaſes. 2. <hi>Praeſervatoria,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially regards the Antecedent Cauſe; <hi>ex. gr.</hi> in a perſon troubled with Gout, Gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after the removal of the Paroxiſm, we Purge,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35727:51"/>
Bleed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prevent the Acceſſion of another. And 3. <hi>Cura Paltativa, v. g.</hi> in a Patient troubled with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of Urine, which cannot be Cured, the Sphincter of the Bladder being lacerate, we apply ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus, as <hi>Van Heer</hi> in his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions provides for ſuch a Strait.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Indications</hi> ordinarly (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they be moe, but they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particular) are Three. 1. <hi>Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Curatoria,</hi> which levels at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe and its Continent Cauſe. 2. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatoria,</hi> preſerving the Strength, that being by all means to be cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And 3. <hi>Mitigatoria,</hi> for it is principally occupied againſt the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Symptoms: Such as Thirſt, Pains, Watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more troubleſome as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper it ſelf, do require Attention, even with the neglect of the primary Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Some indeed there be, who have denied this any room among <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:35727:52"/>
alledging that the one being removed, the other will neceſſarly ceaſe, Symptoms following only the Diſeaſe, as a ſhadow does the Body. But to this moment, I never heard of any, who refuſed an <hi>Indication</hi> to the Continent Cauſe and Diſeaſe it ſelf, as Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in the 71 <hi>Page</hi> of the <hi>V.</hi> S. hath precariouſly done. <hi>Where leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eſſence of the Diſeaſe, he proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Antecedent cauſe.</hi> Can any Perſon that knows or hath a reſpect for Phyſick and Phyſicians, read or hear this, without offence? And this really is the Fountain, from which many of his Errors do flow.</p>
            <p>But conſider Doctor, and I intreat you, as you love your Neighbours Safety and your own Quiet do: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Fevers</hi> are not Intermittent, in which the Antecedent Cauſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the firſt ways, and from thence is gradually and ſucceſſively carried in to the Blood; ſo that whoever can take away the Fomes, may expect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35727:52"/>
in all reaſon, to prevent the acceſſion of a new Paroxiſm, though never hinder the preſent. Whereas in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Fevers,</hi> the whole Antecedent Cauſe is <hi>Semel &amp; Simul</hi> carried into the Blood, and excites the <hi>Fever:</hi> Which we muſt eſpecially regard, and not the Antecedent Cauſe, which now is not, it being turned into the Continent. Further when the <hi>Doctor</hi> is called to a Patient, is it to Cure the preſent <hi>Fever,</hi> or to prevent a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? If it be to prevent a future, then he does well, to look to the Antecedent Cauſe, which ſtill reſpects the future; and ſo he inſtitutes that Cure, in the firſt Axiom, called <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatoria:</hi> But if it be to Cure the preſent, then Senſe and Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he ſhould level at its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Cauſe and Eſſence. Whereas according to the New Method, the preſent Diſtemper is committed to Nature, while the <hi>Doctor</hi> only labours to prevent a future Evil, which real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35727:53"/>
as I am informed, he does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ſucceſsfully, by putting them beyond all fear of Miſery, as well as Happineſs, except what's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Third of our Axioms is: <hi>That Contraries are Cured by Contraries, and the like preſerved by the like.</hi> By ſome a Controverſie is here again moved, as if Diſeaſes were ſometimes Cured by the like. <hi>v. g.</hi> an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morhagie by Bleeding, a Flux by Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the queſtion is not about the Diſeaſe and its Remedy, which may indeed ſometimes prove alike: but betwixt the <hi>Indicans</hi> and the <hi>Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or that which indicates, and that which is in dicated, they ſtill being oppoſitite: Looſneſs ever indicating binding, it matters not much, by what mean it be done.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Whatever is natural ought to be preſerved, and that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural muſt be removed.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:35727:53"/>
V. Of two Evils the leaſt is to be choſen.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Critical Evacuations are wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcerned from Symptomati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. The not diſtinguiſhing of which, is a mater of great Moment, and of bad conſequence, while it brings the Phyſician into the greateſt of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and errors, as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient into the greateſt of Hazards. Out of which nevertheleſs both the Phyſician and Patient may be eaſily extricate, by rightly ponderating the following four 1. The times of the Diſeaſe are prudently to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, the Coction and Crudity of the Humours, diſcernable eſpecially in the Urin, muſt exactly be obſerved: the Evacuation which happens in the beginning of a Diſtemper, with the ſigns of Crudity being ſtill Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick. 2. The place where the Evacuation happens ſignifies much, for if it chance in a place, whither Nature in that Malady uſeth to tend,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35727:54"/>
other things concurring, it is ſtill convenient. So a looſe Belly is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more ſuſpected in a Feaver as, ſweat, this being natures ordinary path in that Diſtemper, whereas a Flux is ſtill looked on as dangerous: And if there were no more as this: Natures own Courſe, it is ſufficient to evert the whole new Method. 3. The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Humour voided, if ſuch as it ought, is to be noticed: And 4, Neither ſhould the quantity be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, for larger Evacuations make us ſtill affraid.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Whatever is to be evacuat, drive it to the way it moſt tends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the 21. of the <hi>first Section</hi> of <hi>Hippocrat's Aphoriſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Concocted, not crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are to be expelled by the 22. <hi>Aphoriſm of the ſame first Section.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. The Times of Diſeaſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to be noticed, it being ſafe to do at one time that, which is perfect Death at another. Which times are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35727:54"/>
four the <hi>Beginning,</hi> the <hi>Increment,</hi> the <hi>Status</hi> and <hi>Declination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. The vaſt difference betwixt Purges, is alſo worth the conſidering. Some being ſo Gentle that they only evacuat the Ventricle and firſt ways, never reaching the Maſs of the Blood, and are ordinarly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Laxantia.</hi> Others tend farther in the Body, precipitat the Serum, and properly are called <hi>Purges</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks.</hi> Which diviſion of Purges, acknowledged and admitted by all, Will, I hope, ſtand us in no ſmall ſtead.</p>
            <p>At length I come to the Method of Curing, wherein, to keep cloſe to the matter, according to the ſecond Axiome, a skilful Phyſician propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to himſelf theſe three Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. To remove and expell the Diſeaſe and its continent cauſe, as preternatural. 2, To preſerve as much as he can, the Strength, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing natural: And 3. To mitigat the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35727:55"/>
urgent Symptoms if any ſuch appear. I am abundantly ſenſible, that there occure many other things in a Feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh perſon, which require attention: But, as I ſaid before, theſe are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and general Indications, and under them moſt others may come, therefore can only be treated of in a general Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>For the Removal of the Diſeaſe and its cauſe, it will be convenient to remember, what was formerly ſaid concerning the Nature of <hi>Fevers</hi> in general: When I aſſerted their Formality to conſiſt in a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Exagitation of the Blood, being moſt frequently thereto excited, by Heterogeneous Atomes transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into it. Therefore to ende vour the Removal of the Diſeaſe, is to lay this commotion, and to expell the cauſe, is to baniſh the Body, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that ſets the Blood thus a working.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:35727:55"/>
And this we labour to accompliſh by ſeveral means and Medicaments, as well Alterants as Evacuants, but concerning the laſt, I am now eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially engaged. As to the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant, of preſerving the ſtrength, and the third of mitigating the Symptoms, the Doctor and I do agree, at leaſt his Book contains nothing of them. Therefore I, whoſe only purpoſe it is, to defend as much of the Old Method, as D. <hi>Brown</hi> does moleſt, and to refute his, wherein it goes oppoſite thereto, am no ways engaged to treat of all, that in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate and exact Method, ought to be practiſed.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially I ſaid by Evacuants we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Diſeaſe and expels it's cauſe. Among which the firſt that offers its ſelf to our conſideration, is that Noble and excellent Remedy, if duely and skilfully applied, of Bleeding. Which as the Doctor obſerves <hi>P.</hi> 143. is granted by all as very beneficial.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35727:56"/>
And if this be true, as certainly it is, the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath given us no new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as to this part, and ſo might have ſpared his Labour in Writting a Book, to convince the World of that, of which never Nan doubted. When and how often the <hi>Doctor</hi> uſeth this Remedy, which was abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in an accurate Method (there being four very different times as the <hi>9th.</hi> Axiome obſerveth) he does not inform us, and therefore I can ſay nothing againſt him.</p>
            <p>However I muſt not omit, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that Vulgar as well as pernicious Error, of Bleeding all perſons and in all <hi>Fevers.</hi> For ſo long as a Plethory is the only Indicant of Bleeding (of Revulſion, Derivation and Explorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which do frequently call for and allow of the ſame, I am not now ſpeaking) it can never ſafely, and with advantage to the Patient be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrat, but where that Plethory is. So that if a <hi>Fever</hi> fall out in a Young
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35727:56"/>
and robuſt perſon, where any natural Evacuation is ſuppreſſed in one uſing a good and laudable Dyet, in a word, where the way of Living, or any other circumſtance may perſwade us of abundance of Blood, no doubt the Phyſician does wiſely, who adviſeth it's Eventilation, if he cannot ſet a working the natural Evacuation it ſelf: Providing it be in the beginning and Increment of the Malady, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when Nature is endeavouring her own Liberation, he may be apt to diſturb her Motions.</p>
            <p>But that raſh and inconſiderat Courſe of Bleeding, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſubjects of all Ages, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Sexes; is a practice which neither Reaſon perſwades to, nor Experience allows of. We all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and not without Cauſe, that our Life and Strength conſiſts in our Blood. It's alſo confeſſed, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Strength do Cure Diſeaſes: The Phyſician only aſſiſting where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35727:57"/>
Nature is weak, and directing when ſhe's wrong. Why then do we eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate that Blood, which we expect ſhould Cure the Diſeaſe and relieve the Patient? Ay but ſay ſome, with the <hi>Doctor:</hi> The ill Blood comes away and leaves the good behind. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this is a Reaſon ſo ridiculous in its ſelf, and ſo repuguant to the Laws of the Circulation, that hardly any ſave Gardners, Old-wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom that Noble Invention is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, will ever pretend it: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to the Vein, good or evil, is alſo evacuate. Yea the Evil is ſo intermixed with the Good, that till it ſelf have made a ſeparation, no Art can disjoin them, For Example, ſuppoſe a ſick Man having in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Twelve Pounds of Blood, Eight of which are Good, and Four Evil: Now being all circulate through the Heart, at leaſt twiſe every quarter of an Hour, is there any Man ſo abſurd as to affirm, that only the Evil, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35727:57"/>
only at that time, will come to the Vein which is wounded, while the Good, being ſtrangely ſagacious, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſtay in the ſick perſons Body to reſtore him his Health, will go to the other and remoter places? Is there, I ſay, any Man ſo abſurd as to maintain this prodigious Fancy? Nay I think it is far more credible, that of the whole Twelve, one Pound being evacuate, two parts will be Good, and one Evil, juſt as it was in the Body. And all the Advantage, which the Patient by Bleeding does reap, is only this: That before he had Twelve Pounds of Blood, Eight whereof were Good and Four Evil, but now he hath only Eleven in all, whereof Seven Pound with Four Ounces are Good, and Three Pound with Eight Ounces are Evil.</p>
            <p>However, the Doctor for his tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſiſtance to this decaying Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, deſerves to be liſted with, if not to get the precedence among the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35727:58"/>
forenamed Medicaſters. For, ſays he, <hi>P.</hi> 151, <hi>As in a River we obſerve the heterogeneous Body still to tend towards the Brink, ſo in the Veins, the feculent and ill Blood runs to their ſides, and runs first out, while the finer returns to the Heart.</hi> A notable Invention indeed, to preſerve this feculent and exploded Figment! What way, pray, can the fine Blood return? not by the Arteries, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely impoſſible, for grant their Motion ſhould invert, which yet no Man of common Senſe will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, the three Semilunar Valves do ſtill hinder. Neither by the Vein, for your Band put betwixt the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and the Heart ſtops the paſſage: So that of neceſſity, whatever enters the Vein, good as well as bad, runs out at the Wound: For do we not ſee, that the Ligature being removed, and paſſage being granted, neither good nor bad appears, a ſure Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it being preſent, both of them evacuates. When Doctor <hi>Brown</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:35727:58"/>
finds the third way, he hath gained the point. If the Doctor had only given this, as an Anſwer to ſome of the impertinent Queſtions of a Patient, I could have forgiven him and applauded his Wit; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to propoſe it in a printed Book, is abſolutly inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>The Chirurgical Fountain, does further ſupply us with <hi>Veſicator Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> from which, in <hi>Fevers</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever, we obtain no ſmall Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: But eſpecially in Malign, and where the Head is affected, yea in all Cephalick Diſtempers, their uſe, by reiterated Experience is approven. But there being no debate about them and their uſe, I proceed to Pharmacie, which aſſiſts us with moe Weapons, to ſtrugle againſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Enemy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof ſhall be <hi>Vomiters,</hi> which, providing they be timouſly and warily adminiſtrate, do oftentimes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nip the Evil in the very Bud, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35727:59"/>
by ſtricking at the Root, do with one blow diſlodge this unkind Gueſt.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that for the moſt part, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cauſe of a <hi>Fever,</hi> comes from the Ventricle. If then in the beginning of the Malady, before the Antecedent Cauſe, be all transferred to the Maſs of the Blood, and there become the Continent, we uſe this Remedy; we do thereby purge the Stomach, withdraw the Matter, and either extinguiſh, or at leaſt ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſwage the Fury of the <hi>Fever,</hi> that after it is hardly ever able to make great diſturbance. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are not to be given indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatly, but with great warineſs, as all other Remedies whatſomever: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the D. in his whole Book, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever mentions one Caution.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are to conſider where the Matter does lodge: For if the Antecedent Cauſe ſhould be any Evacuation ſuppreſt, great Motion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35727:59"/>
and the like: There could be nothing more ridiculous than to adviſe Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. but if it be in the Stomach, which is eaſily known, by the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondria Swelling, frequent Rifting, Nauſeating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they can hardly be neglected, but with the Patients emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. Providing his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Age, ſhape of Body, and other Diſtempers, <hi>v. g.</hi> Hemorhagy adjoined, do not diſſwade it. All which being carefully obſerved, they are moſt innocent, as well as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remedies, in the beginning of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> It is likeways to be noticed, that if the Circumſtances require Bleeding, it ought to preceed Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. leſt by the ſhaking of the Body, ſome ſmall Veſſel burſt.</p>
            <p>Next I come to <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> which I may truly call the univerſal Cure of <hi>Fevers.</hi> Nature pointing with its Finger to their uſe, while in the univerſal Declination of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, and in the parricular Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35727:60"/>
of Intermittent <hi>Fevers,</hi> Sweat breaks forth in a very great plenty.</p>
            <p>This nevertheleſs is the Method which our <hi>Author</hi> rejects, wherefore I ſhall take the more pains to confirm it: Which I'le endeavour to do by the following Three. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how they work. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By giving ſome Reaſons why we uſe them. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By anſwering the ſeeming Objections inſtanced by D. <hi>Brown</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>About the <hi>First,</hi> I need not be very prolix, for if we conſider what Conditions are requiſite to inſenſible Tranſpiration and Sweating in a ſtate natural: Betwixt which there is no greater difference, as that in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Matter is excerned in a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer quantity, and ſo abſorbed by the Cloaths or ambient Air, under the name of Vapour; whereas in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Sweat, it chances in a greater abundance, and ſo cannot be ſweept up, but rather conſtitutes Drops cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35727:60"/>
               <hi>Sweat.</hi> I ſay, whoever will be at the pains to conſider the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions requiſite for this inſenſible Tranſpiration and Sweating, while they are natural: Which are Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the Liquor, a due Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Pores, and a Briskneſs in the circular Motion; will eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> work, when given according to Art. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can either attenuat the Blood in its Conſiſtence, quicken it in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or dilate and amplify the Miliar Glands and Pores, will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Sweat.</p>
            <p>And ſuch are either Heterogeneous Bodies mixed with the Blood, which by ſtimulating the Ventricles of the Heart, the interiour Coats of the Veſſels, and muſcular Fibers of the Parts, cauſe frequent Contraction, and conſequently ſwiftneſs of Motion: or inciding and volatile Medicaments, which partly attenuating and inciding the Maſs of Blood, partly amplifying
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35727:61"/>
and inlarging the Pores and Paſſages, produce the ſame effect with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</p>
            <p>When I ſpeak here of intending the circular Motion, I mean only that of the Arteries, for both Reaſon and Experience teach us that the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of the returning Motion by the Veins, would rather prove a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance as a help to this, as well as to all other Secretions. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is clear from Reaſon, for if the Blood were as readily taken up by the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veins, as its is brought in by the Arteries, it muſt neceſſarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the Heart from whence it came: Whereas admittance being denied by the Veins, it ſeeks another way or paſſage, which is that of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Neither does Experience deny its aſſent to this perpetual Truth: For if you will tye the ſocial Vein of any Artery, by which Blood is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſecerning Organ, <hi>v. g.</hi> the <hi>Vena emulgens,</hi> you ſhall quickly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35727:61"/>
the Secretion to be far more copious, than when the regreſſive Motion was allowed. So that I may reaſonably affirm, <hi>The ſlowneſs of the refluent Motion of the Blood by the Veins, to be none of the leaſt among the efficient Cauſes of Secretion.</hi> And this much for the Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I come to give ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why in the Cure of Continual <hi>Fevers,</hi> Phyſicians of all Ages, have adopted and practiſed this Method of Sweating: As alſo why we at this day, eſpecially while D. <hi>Brown</hi> offers a Surer and Better, do imitate them in that, which, to ſpeak in his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is pernicious and deſtructive to Mankind. Indeed if without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and theſe weighty ones too, we ſhould do that, which according to the <hi>V.</hi> S, can be nothing but horrid Murder, and deviliſh Malice. In ſtead of being Cheriſhed, Honoured and Entertained, as in all Ages, and among all civilized People, Phyſicians
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35727:62"/>
have been; we ought to be taken and Hanged, for Villains and publick Murderers. But if I can prove our Method to be right, which I'le en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour now, and his to be wrong, which is to be done hereafter, when diſcourſing of Purging: Then let him judge, upon whom the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to accumulate Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Favours of <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> but I ſhall ſatisfy my ſelf, and I hope my Reader to, with the following three,</p>
            <p>Let us then <hi>Firſt,</hi> According to the ſeventh Axiome, conſider the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, I mean the courſe it takes when left to its ſelf, as in many mean and Indigent People it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly is: And this is continually to ſeek its own Relief by Sweating, ſo that not one <hi>Fever</hi> of a hundred and that of all ſorts, is Cured another way. Is there any Country Clown ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but in a <hi>Fever,</hi> he'll cry for a Sweat, and if either by Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35727:62"/>
he can procure it, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe himſelf ſpeedy Relief and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſafety. Now this being granted the <hi>Dr.</hi> himſelf not darring deny it, ſhould not the Phyſicitians, who have taken to themſelves that modeſt, Denomination of Natur's Servants, and whoſe duty it is to aſſiſt her when doing right, and to Correct her when doing wrong (as by all ſhe is looked upon to do when endeavouring to eaſe her ſelf by Seige in a <hi>Fever,</hi> except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps once in a hundred times, when it comes critically) ſhould not they I ſay, imitate her, in Curing <hi>Fevers</hi> by <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> the ordinary, yea I I may ſay, the only way by which ſhe removes that Diſtemper, yea certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhould, and that according to good Old <hi>Hippocrats</hi> excellent Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme: <hi>Whetherſoever Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to go, thither lead her and it conduceth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, it becomes us <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to conſider the Seat of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35727:63"/>
matter in <hi>Fevers,</hi> which none will deny to be in the Arteries &amp; veins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likeways the conformation of theſe Veſſels deſerves our attention: Their Roots being in the Heart, while their Branches tend to all parts of the Body (that I may ſhun all occaſions of Objections, I know that properly ſpeaking, the Origine of the Veins is in the parts, and they terminate with one Root in the Heart) Now let us conſider by what way, that which is contained in theſe Veſſels may be beſt and eaſilieſt expelled: Surely any Man of ſenſe and Reaſon, will freely confeſs, by their Extremi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties or ends (of <hi>Anastomoſes</hi> or <hi>Inoſculations</hi> I have ſaid what I thought neceſſary before) which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, we can not but alſo grant, that whatſomever part of the Body, manyeſt of theſe Extremitie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> run to, or where moſt of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries end in, there will be the readieſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and moſt natural way, providing i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:35727:63"/>
be as patent as others, to diſcharge whatſomever is contained therein: But moſt of theſe Extremities do terminate by far in the habit, and that this way is as patent, as any other inſenſible Tranſpiration, which by the Doctors own conceſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all other Evacuations of the Body, no leſs as three times, does clearly evince: Therefore from theſe premiſes, I may lawfully conclude, the habit to be the readieſt and beſt way, to expell whatſomever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Heterogeneous in the Blood,</p>
            <p>It was not unadviſedly that I ſaid, where moſt Arteries end, there will be the readieſt way to expell, the Morbifick matter. For whoſoever is not altogether ignorant of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, will eaſily allow, that whatever once enters the Veins, can never be eliminate, till ſuch time as it again run through the Arteries. At their ſmall end it cannot be, ſeing what once enters there, can by no means
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35727:64"/>
return, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe of their valves <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe of the tonick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the continual Influx of the Arterial Blood. And as it cannot happen at their ſmall ends ariſing from the parts, ſo far leſs can it be at the great end, which terminats in the Heart: Nothing entring its Ventricles in the <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> but what is again thruſt out into the Pulmonal and great Artery, in the <hi>Systole:</hi> from all which it is clear, that <hi>neither Secretion nor Excretion can be of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Blood</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet here, I'll preſent the Doctor, with a ſtronger argument for Purging in <hi>Fevers,</hi> as his whole Book hath done to his Readers. And it is this, being I aſſert, what no Phyſician, if he be not deſtitute of Anatomy and Phyſiology (the want of which bring inexpreſſible Damage to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) will deny, that, wherever Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries end, and depoſitate what is in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35727:64"/>
them contained, there muſt needs happen the Expulſion of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick matter: But the Arteries, ſome of them at leaſt end in the inteſtines, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there in theſe inteſtinal Glands muſt happen the ſecretion of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter. All which I grant and acknowledge, yea farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, by avowing the <hi>faces Ani</hi> to be not only Excrements of the firſt, but alſo of the third and ſecond Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which may be proven by ſeveral Obſervations, one of which at this time ſhall ſuffice. <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Foetus</hi> the <hi>Meconium</hi> is ſtill obſerved to have its beginning, and greateſt quantity in the craſs inteſtines. Nevertheleſs all this concludes nothing againſt what either hath already, or ſhall hereafter be ſaid: Becauſe <hi>First</hi> the Arteries are but very few (in reſpect of that infinit number which direct their courſe to the habite) from the Coeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack and two Meſenterick Branches, which tend to the Inteſtines. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:35727:65"/>
Neither do we altogether, for as little as it is, neglect it, but partly by applying Clyſters, partly by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Medicaments, in the 10 and laſt Axiom, called <hi>Laxantia,</hi> drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what may be lurking in the firſt ways. But we never give Purges, properly ſo called, which by entring the Maſs of the Blood, do play there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their unlucky Tragedy, except we intend (which God forbid ſo wicked a Thought ſhould ever enter a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians Heart) to ſend the Patient to the Houſe of all Living. Yea farther, it is with reſpect to this, that after the Recovery we ordinarly adviſe Purging.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Argument ſhall be, the general Practice and conſtant Obſervation of Phyſicians in all Ages, in all Countries, and of all Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yea of the Excellent <hi>Sydenham</hi> himſelf, as ſhall afterwards be ſhewn. Who as one Man, acknowledge not only the great Advantage of Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35727:65"/>
but exclaim againſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of Catarticks, in the Curing of <hi>Fevers.</hi> What, would the <hi>Doctor</hi> have all theſe ſo ignorant, as that they ſhould not know how to Cure the moſt ordinary of Diſtempers? or ſo malicious and wicked, as when they knew it, yet neither to practiſe it themſelves, nor communicat it to others? or were they ſo ſtupid, as not to have known what they uſed, neither from whence the Cure did proceed? Were there never Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo conſcientious in the World, before D. <hi>Brown</hi> came to it, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the damage of Diaphoreticks? or were they ſo blind that they could not ſee it? Was <hi>Hippocrat,</hi> was <hi>Galen, Fernelous, Sennert, Harvey,</hi> and all the reſt of theſe brave Souls, who have enriched the noble and uſeful Art, with their curious Obſervations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inventions, and judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, were all theſe, I ſay, beſides many others, who practiſed this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35727:66"/>
themſelves, and recommended it to their Succeſſors, Fools or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants? Nay, nay, it is far better to ſay that D. <hi>Brown</hi> is both. But of Experience more hereafter: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go on to the Examination of the Arguments urged by the Doctor againſt this Old and long Practiſed Method: Which we find in the 71 Page of the <hi>V. S.</hi> where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Diaphoretick Method is conſidered and rejected forſooth; and they be neither moe nor ſtronger as the following Two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First. We have no Speciſick in Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuat Fevers, therefore must not level at the Continent Cauſe, which is truly the Diſeaſe.</hi> According to which way of Reaſoning I will go on and conclude: We have no Specifick in any Diſeaſe, ſave <hi>Intermutent Fevers;</hi> therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them. none muſt be Cured. The conſequent of the one is as native as that of the other, and truly in both it is none at all. Phyſick and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35727:66"/>
are obliged to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> for bringing the Imployment to this weak paſs. Is not this a ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to deſtroy a Theory of ſome Thouſand Years ſtanding? Yet it is as ſtrong as the other to be found in the ſame 71 Page, where he farther inveighs againſt this our approved Method, in theſe words: <hi>This indeed were no unfit Deſign,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I look upon it as needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, what is formerly ſaid anent: <hi>Fevers</hi> and their Cauſes, which I hope do ſufficiently prove the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> to be none of the beſt. I ſhall rather here obſerve, that the force of this ſham Argument drives at theſe Two. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Sudorificks tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate the morbiſick Matter or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Cauſe, from the Ventricle, Meſentery and Inteſtines, into the Muſs of Blood, and by that means turns the Antecedent Cauſe into the Continent. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by the ſame we drive it to the Head,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35727:67"/>
whereby we produce theſe terrible Symptoms, under which, Nature not being able to overcome, muſt of neceſſity ſuccumb.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer theſe Three: 1. All, ſave D. <hi>Brown,</hi> do know and confeſs, that in Continual <hi>Fevers,</hi> the morbiſick Matter is in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tranſlated to the Blood, and ſo does procure the Diſeaſe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways we ſhould never have, but only an <hi>Apparatus</hi> to it. Yea in this ſeems to me, to conſiſt the difference betwixt Continual and Intermittent <hi>Fevers:</hi> That in the former the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſick Matter is tranſlated all at once and ſo produces one great and <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fever;</hi> whereas in the latter or <hi>Intermittent Fevers,</hi> it is conveyed at ſeveral times and ſo conſtitutes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paroxiſms, which may be ſaid to be as many Continual, but ſhorter <hi>Fevers.</hi> By which we may clearly diſcern, how falſely the <hi>Doctor</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that by Diaphoreticks we carry
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35727:67"/>
the Matter from the firſt Ways to the Blood, that being a thing already done, elſe there could be no <hi>Fever.</hi> And really all along it appears, that it is not a <hi>Fever,</hi> but an <hi>Apparatus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the Doctor would Cure. So that inſtead of intituling his Book, <hi>A new Method of Curing Fevers,</hi> he ſhould rather have named it, <hi>A new Method for preventing them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How any thing can be more urged on the Head by the uſe of Sudorificks, I ſuppoſe if the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> were asked, he could not well tell, it being a meer precarious Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grounded upon no Foundation, and he might with as good Reaſon, have ſaid the ſame, of the Hands, Feet, or any other part of the Body. For, as they were only the <hi>Artertae Carotides</hi> and <hi>Vertebrales,</hi> which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Brain with Blood before; So, for ought I know, by the uſe of Sudorificks no other are added: Neither is there any other way, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35727:68"/>
which any thing whatſomever can be carried to the Head, ſave by the forenamed Arteries. I hope the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> is not come to that Pitch of lg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to averr, that Diaphoreticks by ſome occult quality are offenſive to the Brain. True it is indeed, that Sudorificks, by intending the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well Circular as Inteſtine, put all the Humours, and perhaps the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits too, in a little confuſion: But this carries nothing to the Head, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to other places, which went not before.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Where learned the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that Sudorifick Medicines, had their operation in the Ventricle, Meſentery and Inteſtines: Can any Man read this without Laughing. Surely this is another Errour, in which Phyſians till this time have been in, for they ſtill taught, that Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did work in the Blood, and not in the firſt Ways. So then to grant, what the <hi>Doctor</hi> deſires, which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:35727:68"/>
nevertheleſs ſo long as Phyſicians are Maſters of Reaſon will never be: <hi>That the Continent Cauſe</hi> (for the Antecedent is no more, it being converted into the Continent) <hi>lodges about the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named places;</hi> it will profit him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſince Diaphoreticks will never awake it, they working only in the Blood, not in the firſt Ways.</p>
            <p>In the 165 Page, the <hi>Doctor</hi> incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates a new the damage of meer Diaphoreticks (for I ſhall do him the Juſtice to conceal none of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) and the Reaſon is this: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby the Vaſcous matter is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to the Pores in great abundance, and ſo begetteth new Obstructions.</hi> And, which is wonderful, to prevent this Inconveniency, he adviſeth the uſe of <hi>Paregoricks,</hi> which, as all the World knows, do incraſſate extremely, and ſo inſtead of weakning the Malady he ſtrengthneth its Hands.</p>
            <p>However I would have the <hi>Doctor</hi> to know, this Fear of his to be vain
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35727:69"/>
and groundleſs, we never forcing the Matter till once incided, and till we obſerve the Signs of Coction in the Urine, as ſhall afterwards (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) be ſaid. Neither is the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick Compariſon which he brings to illuſtrate this his Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception: For the greatest Fool in the Kingdom does know, that the Church Doors can be no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or widned; whereas we know certainly, that occaſion requiring, the Pores of the Body may be double enlarged and diſtended.</p>
            <p>It is in the 167 Page, where the Doctor runs to that pitch of Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to exclaim againſt a Method direct to a <hi>Criſis,</hi> Boldneſs I muſt call it, and the Reader will perhaps judge worſe of it, when he conſiders with me, that there be only Four Ways by which Diſeaſes are terminate<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whereof a <hi>Criſis</hi> is ever deſired as the beſt. Which happens, when after <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wreſtling betwixt the Diſeaſe and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35727:69"/>
Nature, the laſt at length obtains the Victory, and with one blow ejects this its hoſtile Enemy. Which is done ſometimes by Bleeding at the Noſe, ſometimes by Purging, ſometimes by Vomiting, but an hundred times for one, by Sweating. The ſecond So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Diſeaſes, is that by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians called <hi>Lyſis:</hi> When there comes no critical Motion (which is ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by all, it being beyond all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the beſt) but rather the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy decays ſlowly and gradually, and this is moſt frequent in thir our Cold Countries. Thirdly the morbifick Matter, is ſometimes diſcuſſed or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from one place to another <hi>per Metastaſin,</hi> which if it happen to be from a nobler to a meanner, it is good (although it were better to have it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together expelled the Body by a <hi>Criſis)</hi> but if it chance contrary, is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The Fourth and laſt way of Diſeaſes terminating, is by <hi>Death,</hi> when the morbiſick Matter ſubduing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35727:70"/>
Nature, renders the organical Body uncapable of obeying the Inclinations of the reaſonable Soul, ſo that it muſt needs forſake its Manſion, and leave it a dead Cadaver. If there be any other way of Diſeaſes terminating, they do not to me now occurr, yea after ſometimes thinking, I cannot conceive them. Now let my Reader, yea D. <hi>Brown</hi> himſelf judge, how good reaſon he hath to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Method which aims at a <hi>Criſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I leave Diaphoreticks, it will be neceſſary to inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that neither in the Beginning nor Increment of the <hi>Fever,</hi> we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them; yea never, till we have once incided and attenuate the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with proper and convenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments, do we uſe them. And then, when we behold the Signs of Coction in the Urine, we haſten away the Malady, ſometimes with weaker, ſometimes with ſtronger
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35727:70"/>
Medicines, juſt as the Circumſtances allow and adviſe.</p>
            <p>It is alſo worth noticing, that there is no material Difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Inciders and Diaphoreticks: For every Incider, providing its Doſe be augmented, will prove Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick: And whatſomever provokes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sweat, given more ſparingly does, only incide. Wherefore, whatever hath been ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in defence of Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſicks, may alſo be applyed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciders: Eſpecially ſince they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiate by the <hi>Doctor,</hi> for one and the ſame Cauſe, which to ſpeak the Truth, is none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purging</hi> comes next to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of, for neither can the Cure of <hi>Fevers,</hi> always want their Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which nevertheleſs are not to be adviſed, as D. <hi>Brown</hi> does, at all times, and of all kinds. Wherefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall here ſhew <hi>First,</hi> When and how they are and have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Phyſicians, in all Ages.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35727:71"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Bring ſome Arguments againſt the perpetual uſe of ſuch of them, as properly go under the Name of Purges. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obviate any Arguments afforded by the <hi>Doctor</hi> in their behalf.</p>
            <p>Before I go farther, I am neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to obſerve and complain: that the <hi>Author</hi> ſhould have Printed a new Method, and yet never ſo much as once inform us, when, and to what Patients it is, and ſafely may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: Nor yet does he mention the Medicaments he then imployeth, none of which, beſides many other things ought to have been neglected by him, who preſumed to Write an intire Method, but far leſs by the Author of a New One. For whoever hath the leaſt knowledge in Phyſick, cannot but be ſufficiently acquaint with the difficulty of purging, where a few hours, ſome few grains, or ſome conttrary <hi>Indicants,</hi> may readily bring Death to the Patient. And really
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35727:71"/>
for my part, ſuppoſe I were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced both of the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Succeſs of D. <hi>Brown</hi>'s New Method (which nevertheleſs without other Arguments as I have yet ſeen, I never will be) yet I durſt not upon that trivial and ſuperficial account he gives of it, adventure to uſe it.</p>
            <p>But to return to the things propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in preſcribing of Purges to perſons in <hi>Fevers,</hi> we are to conſider 1. The Diviſion of Purges, as it in the 10 and laſt Axiome, <hi>in Laxantia &amp; propriè purgantia.</hi> 2. The different times of the Diſeaſe, alſo above in the 9 Axiome ſpecified, are carefully to be obſerved. And 3. The Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſometimes adjoined, is by no means to be neglected; for at certain times to give a Purge when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is not without great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger. So that by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians of all ages not only the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gninnig
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35727:72"/>
but alſo in the Increment and ſtatus of the Diſeaſe, where there is no Malignity preſent (in which condition the very giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Clyſter was ſtill ſuſpected) theſe Purges called <hi>Laxantia,</hi> which go no farther, as the firſt ways have over been adviſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which <hi>Laxantia</hi> are ſometimes given at the Mouth, and ſo reſpect the Ventricle with the reſt of the Inteſtines: but oftner they are applyed in the form of a Clyſter, which reaches no farther as the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of the Inteſtine Colon, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by there ſtimulating, augment the periſtaltick motion of the whole, and help the Excretion of the <hi>Faeces,</hi> contained therein.</p>
            <p>Yet ſometimes in the beginning and before the antecedent cauſe be turned into the continent, by its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Ventricle and firſt ways to the Maſs of the Blood, it may not be improper to adviſe a Purge: However were I the Phyſician, I had
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35727:72"/>
rather (if all circumſtances allowed thereof) and for the moſt part, make uſe of <hi>Emeticks,</hi> which do ordinarly cauſe alſo three or four Stools. But the uſe of Purges properly ſo called, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently delayed till the ſolution of the whole Diſtemper, if critical Motions adviſe not the contrary, when (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſome of the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be deſpoſed in the Iteſtines, and adhering to, or in their Glands) ſtrength being ſomewhat recovered, we uſe firſt the help of that Medicine which we could not ſafely imploy before: For which our Reaſons are the following five.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In obedience to the eight Axiome, Concocted not Crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are to be Evacuat: where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Nature her Courſe is worth the noticing, which being left to its ſelf, never expels Humours till once digeſted, unleſs with great Hazard to the Patient. and then it becomes the skilful Phyſician, to ſtop and hinder
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35727:73"/>
her wrong &amp; Symptomatick proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not meerly <hi>Hypocrates</hi> his Authority that makes us decline them in this Condition, but becauſe we ſee it confirmed with ſtrong Reaſon and ſad Experience: For while the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are Crude and indigeſted, the Heterogenities are ſo wrought in with the good and laudable matter, that the one cannot be extruded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Expulſion of the other: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we rather expect, yea helps their Digeſtion, that ſo we may have the Evil ſeparat from the Good.</p>
            <p>Neither is this all the evil, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Sick, by adviſing Purging in a ſtate of Crudity, But <hi>Secondly,</hi> When given, they either operate none, or by their working extremly, do intend the <hi>Fever.</hi> This is not ſaid <hi>Gratis,</hi> for daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirms it, and that not only in perſons troubled with <hi>Intermittent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> where Purges being given ſhortly after the ceaſing of the Diſeaſe,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35727:73"/>
do infallibly make the Paroxiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: But even in ſound perſons, in whom Catarticks never do their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without raiſing a great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exagitation in the Blood. Yea by injecting <hi>Gummi,</hi> or rather <hi>Succus Go<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> a muſt ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Purge, into the Veins of a Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Animal, we can procure an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By theſe ſtrong and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Purges, the <hi>Serum</hi> which is the vehicle of the Blood, and by which the Morbifick matter ſhould be dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo it may be the better and eaſilier excluded, is altogether ſpent and conſumed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by theſe ſame reiterat Purges, Nature is extremly weakned and the ſtrength mightily dejected, which nevertheleſs as a thing Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the fourth Axiome tells us ought to be preſerved.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hereby again are the Motions of Nature diſturbed, ſhe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35727:74"/>
ſeldom or never tending this way, except when perverſely and Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically, in which caſe, <hi>Art,</hi> as it is in the Sixth Axiome, adviſeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtop as encourage her.</p>
            <p>May other Arguments, ſuch as the Hazard of Superpurgation, the inconveniencie of Purging when affixed to Bed &amp;c. Could eaſily be urged againſt this prepoſterous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: But they being of leſs moment, I leave them, till I ſee the <hi>Doctors Anſwers</hi> to the five inſiſted on. Which being rightly conſidered and pondered, I think it will be no hard matter to gueſs, with what advantage to the Patient, Purges properly ſo called, in <hi>Fevers</hi> are uſed If the <hi>Doctor</hi> meant only ſuch as I have called <hi>Laxantia,</hi> then he hath given us no New Method: Their uſe under the Cautions, I gave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as old as ſince <hi>Hippocrats</hi> days.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I come to the Arguments, by which he endeavours to confirm
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35727:74"/>
this his Method: Which I find <hi>P.</hi> 76. to be the <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> are not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, <hi>ergo</hi> we muſt Purge: But the conſequent of this, <hi>Doctor,</hi> eſpecially its Antecedent being truer, is as good: Purges are offenſive, <hi>ergo</hi> ſudorificks are neceſſar. None of them follow, there being no Reaſon, why, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them both unſucceſsful, a third may not be choſen. But, proceeds the Doctor, without the help of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks we cannot level at the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent cauſe: Therefore we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the extirpating the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thereby we may ſtarve that enemy we are not able to attack. All which is moſt falſe, Ridiculous and Diſhonourable to Phyſick and Phyſicians, as is formerly proved, therefore needs not be here again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>His other Motives (to be found in the firſt Sect.) adviſing to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of this his precarious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, are as deſtitute of good and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35727:75"/>
real Concluſions, as any of the two Arguments juſt now conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor Sydenhame</hi> was no doubt, a Man of great Ingenuity, Candor and Experience and if I thought an Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium from ſo mean and deſpiſed an Author as I am, could contribute any way to his Praiſe, I would as willingly confer it, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf. For I think that both this and future ages, are, and will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely obliged to his Candor and great Sagacity, which he hath all along manifeſted in his excellent Writtings, but eſpecially for his <hi>Historia Morbi &amp; Regimen Aegri.</hi> And I would to God that D. <hi>Brown</hi> had been more of his temper, who, without all Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on other Phyſicians, wrote what he had obſerved in the Latin Tongue. Not that I envy the knowledge of any, for as <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed all the people of the Lord to be Prophets, ſo I am much indifferent, ſuppoſe all Patients (which in a ſhort time I think may
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35727:75"/>
be) were Phyſicians. Yet ſure I am, the publiſhing of Phyſick Books in our Mother Tongue, does much hurt but no good: For thereby Gardners, Old wifes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> acquire as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as to Kill, but ſeldom as much as to Heal. In a word, as our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb ſpeaks, it is the putting a Weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Mad-mans hand. However I being no more concerned as others, wiſhes them ſucceſs in their laudable attempts.</p>
            <p>But how D. <hi>Brown</hi> comes to make D. <hi>Sydenhame</hi> his Defender, or rather how he comes to writ a Book, to vindicat D. <hi>Sydenham</hi> in that, which he ſeems never to have practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that which I cannot conceive. The <hi>Schedula Monitoria</hi> is not in my hands, neither am I in a place where I can procure it: Yet his <hi>Method of Curing Continual Fevers,</hi> Printed at <hi>Amsterdam An.</hi> 1666. is; Wherein all along he practiſeth the good Old and approven Method: For in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35727:76"/>
page 27. he adviſeth the uſe of a Clyſter only every other day, P. 29. he expreſly affirms, that the more bound he can make the Patients Belly, the more he puts him beyond Hazard: His words are ſo expreſs they deſerve to be here inſerted, and they are, <hi>quanto magis obſtructam illi al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum praeſtitero, tanto magis eum extra periculi aleam colloco: P.</hi> 36. at length upon the 15 and ſometimes 17. day, for the firſt time he preſcribes a Purge, and that none of the Strongeſt.</p>
            <p>Now was not D. <hi>Sydenhame</hi> as Candid, as ingenuous and skilled, when he wrote this as when he wrote the <hi>Sched. Monitoria:</hi> If he was, then what reaſon can there be for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this New Method to the old, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both are commended. If he was not, then no man can blame me, for denying aſſent and Credit to him, who did once ſo egregiouſly Cheat me. Nay I doubt nothing, but he was ingenuous in both: the matter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35727:76"/>
being only this, in this <hi>Schedula Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitoria</hi> (to my beſt remembrance it being ſome years ſince I read it) he gives only a deſcription of an Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick conſtitution, which beyond all queſtion, ſometime may extremely alter the Scene, and may require a Method contrary to what is ordinary, and which he in his <hi>Treatiſe de Curand. Febr: Con.</hi> had both practiſed himſelf and commended to others. And by this time I think it is clear, how little reaſon D. <hi>Brown</hi> hath to boaſt of <hi>Sydenhams</hi> Authority: No it is a meer Fiction of D. <hi>Browns</hi> to apply to all occaſions, what D. <hi>Sydenham</hi> meaned only of particular Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>How can D. <hi>Brown</hi> think to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us at this rate, he muſt thinke us all very negligent, and ſo we do not read, or elſe very ignorant, and ſo cannot underſtand what we do Read: Truly it ſeems we muſt be both according to his Calculation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:35727:77"/>
But grant D. <hi>Sydenham</hi> were of this mind, as it is clear he is not, what then does follow: For we all know and believe, that no honeſt nor inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Man, will wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly cheat or deceive, yet we count it no Hereſy to think and ſay both, that out of ignorance and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectneſs he may.</p>
            <p>What concerns the unparalelled danger he was ſaved from: I fear leaſt in uſing that as a cogent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Doctor prove himſelf as ill a Divine, as all along in his Book he he appears to be a Phyſician. There being no doubt, but that Gods good Providence is ſtill Exerciſed about all things, good as well as bad (permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering them to his own wiſe and good ends) and ſmall as well as great. Yet that ſpecial acts of preſervation, will either prove the perſon himſelf, or the end for which he is preſerved, to be good in its ſelf (for I know and believe that God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35727:77"/>
does nothing, but what ſome way or other, tends to his own Glory, as alſo to His Peoples Good eventually, as the permitting of an Impoſtor, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and intentionally; is a thing which I very much doubt: For we know <hi>they are the Wicked who proſper in their way, while the Righteous are chastened every Morning:</hi> And ſuppoſe he, and all the Epiſcopal Clergy in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould Swear, that the <hi>French</hi> King's Deliverance from his Fiſtula, was for ſome good end and great benefit to Mankind; yet I ſhall ever look on him as the Scourge of the True Reformed Religion, which God at length will, I hope, caſt into the Fire. And by this way of Reaſoning the Doctor will anſwer <hi>Epicmus</hi> his Objection againſt Providence: <hi>Cur males benè &amp; bonis malè,</hi> by granting the whole.</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall Evidence of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>'s deſperate Cauſe, when he flies to ſuch Arguments for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:35727:78"/>
thereof, as the Commendations beſtowed by Learned Men upon the perſon, whom he would perſwade us, though falſely, to be the Author thereof: But eſpecially conſidering that theſe Encomiums were given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hypotheſis was known. For <hi>Etmuller</hi> died at <hi>Lypſick, Anno 1683. Sponius</hi> write his Epiſtle <hi>An: 1681. Dalaeus</hi> his <hi>Encyclopaedia. An:</hi> 1685. Whereas the <hi>Schedula Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> never ſaw Light till the Year 1687. If then there be any ſtrength in that Argument, as I think there is none, it militates intirely againſt the New Method: Their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations being given upon account of the old, profeſſed and practiſed in his Book <hi>de Meth: Curand: Febr:</hi> the <hi>Schedula Monitoria</hi> not being at that time publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> is indeed a Great Man, and deſervedly eſteemed by our Author, for his excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe written formerly <hi>de Pihiſi:</hi> as alſo
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35727:78"/>
for his late Book <hi>de Febribus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as I am informed (I not having indeed peruſed it as yet, which I am almoſt aſhamed to profeſs) he does noways follow our <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> which is no great proof of his overvaluing it: Nevertheleſs upon other Scores he might, and that deſervedly too, applaude D. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning theſe Excellent Men, <hi>Goodall, Harris,</hi> &amp;c. I have nothing to ſay, but perhaps it might be, that in ſome Epidemick and Anomalous <hi>Fever,</hi> they did find that Method ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and ſo did imploy it: But ſurely therefore it muſt not be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all.</p>
            <p>And now I think, I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Anſwered our <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as alſo confirmed the contrary Hypotheſis. Yet there remains one, which both in his Books, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among his Admirers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, he principally inſiſts on: <hi>viz.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35727:79"/>
His great and ſucceſsful Experience.</hi> This is a thing the greateſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks boaſt moſt of; yea they will hardly grant a Patient ever to have died in their Hands. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt Experience it ſelf, it being, with Reaſon, the Foundation of Phyſick. Neither will I here in an Engliſh Book, diſcover the Fraud of ſome Mens Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but I will offer to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's and the Doctor's Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Five following Things. 1. I wiſh the Doctor were as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous to tell us how many Died, as he is careful to publiſh how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Recovered, by this his New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. 2. To one, I can oppoſe a hundred, not only of ſuch as were Cured by Old and Antiquated Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians; but of ſuch as live and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in this very Age. 3. As, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, all our Patients do not Die, ſo neither, I ſuppoſe, do all the Doctor's Recover: And ſurely
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35727:79"/>
if any of theſe two were, it would be a far more effectual mean to gain the Doctor Imployment, as his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Vindicatory Schedule.</hi> No, Thanks be to the Phyſician of Souls, we have no reaſon to complain. 4, How many perſons Recover, not only when no Mean is uſed, but even when that which is certainly Evil is applyed: So that a litle ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in a few Patients, deſerves not the Name of ſound Experience in Phyſick. Eſpecially when 5. we are ſometimes right uncertain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apothecary hath rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, or the Patient rightly uſed, that which the Phyſician preſcribed: None of which Doubts are without all ground, as too frequent Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience tells us, and I could eaſily evince: But I have no Inclination to diſcover my Father's Nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>As for what he brings in the 14 <hi>Sect.</hi> for corroborating his Theory of <hi>Fevers</hi> from the <hi>Helpers</hi> and <hi>Hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:35727:80"/>
&amp;c. as things of ſmall Moment, and ſavouring nothing, ſave Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Anatomy and Phyſiology, I paſs them. As alſo the Solutions he gives of Difficulties moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, are of the ſame Mettal, as hath clearly been ſhewn, in his Account of Sanguification, Chylifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only, it deſerves the Reader's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, that Page 77. where he propoſeth that true and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Method, as he is pleaſed to call it: I find mention, and only mention, of <hi>Paregoricks,</hi> without any Advertiſement, how and when they ought to be uſed, albeit of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments whatſomever, they ſhould be adviſed with the greateſt Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I ſhall neither inſiſt on them nor their uſe: They be theſe unto which both he and we are forced to flie, when other Refuges fail. And they be of two ſorts: <hi>First,</hi> Such as either by obtunding the Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35727:80"/>
of the Humours, or laxing the Tone of the Fibers, do really mitigate the Pain, by removing ſomewhat the Cauſe, and they are commonly called <hi>Auodyns.</hi> And the others are theſe, who do not remove the Cauſe, but lay it a ſleep, and renders it quiet by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefying the Senſes, and they go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of <hi>Narcoticks.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt, or <hi>Anodyns,</hi> there is here no queſtion, they being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied outwardly: But for <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> I cannot conceive, upon what account he adviſeth them in <hi>Fevers,</hi> (except when Symptoms grievouſly urge) unleſs it be to ſtop critical Evacuations, there being hardly any thing, which does it more happily. And if this be a good Deſign, whatever the Doctor may pretend, let the World judge.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhut up all, I ſhall lay down a brief Scheme of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which we dayly, and, Bleſſed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35727:81"/>
be God, with good Succeſs practiſe, and I have been here labouring to defend. I ſay a brief one, for I noways pretend to play the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but only to ſhew in few words, what it is I have been wreſtling for. Yea there are ſo many Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Accidents, which both may and frequently do occurr and fall out about feveriſh Perſons, that they make it abſolutly impoſſible, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all to Paper, what a skilled and judicious. Phyſician will find expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
            <p>When then called to a Patient, in the Firſt, Second or Third Day, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath found a Coldneſs and Grewing through his whole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Body, which is ordinarly accompanied with, or at leaſt is ſhortly after followed, with a Pain, in the Head and Laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the whole, together with a frequent Pulſe, red and thick Urine, great Thirſt, dejection of Appetite, Watching, Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which we
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35727:81"/>
eaſily conjecture a <hi>Fever</hi> to infeſt. I ſay when called to ſuch a Patient, immediatly, if his Age, Sex, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations ſuppreſſed, kind of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do allow, we adviſe Bleeding, more or leſs as the ſeveral Circumſtances permit, however, if need ſo require, we think it ſtill ſafer to evacuate at different times as all at once: But the Prohibents exceeding the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents, it ought to be totally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. After that, if the Patient hath been, or is yet troubled, with Nauſeating, Rifting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Vomiter, providing nothing diſſwading the ſame be preſent, is next adviſed. And then through the whole Courſe of the Cure, our principal aim is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at the Continent or Conjunct, Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, which, by giving Inciders and Aperients, ever till we obſerve the Signs of Coction in the Urine, we labour to Incide and Digeſt; Which Signs appearing, with ſtronger Sudorificks we aſſiſt Nature
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35727:82"/>
endeavouring its own Liberation, and ſo we bring the Malady to a <hi>Criſis,</hi> or rather <hi>Lyſis.</hi> In the mean time we neither neglect the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Strength according to the ſecond Axiom: Nor yet do we forget the Antecedent Cauſe, as is in the firſt; but partly by Clyſters, partly by Laxants given at the Mouth, we abſorbe and cleanſe the firſt Ways, and ſo prevent the further accumulating of Crudities, which by running into the Maſs of the Blood, might increaſe the <hi>Fever.</hi> And while theſe are a doing, with proper and fit Medicaments, we provide (yet even ſometimes, as it is in the fifth Axiom, with the neglect of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Diſeaſe) againſt the urgent Symptoms, ſuch as Thirſt, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this Method, God aſſiſting, we Cure <hi>Tutò, Citò, &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde.</hi>
