            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Design of the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, is to vindicate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Christ's Satisfaction</hi> from the <hi>Socinian Objections.</hi> Which, that I might do more effectually, I set my self to consider the Force and Strength of all that <hi>Crellius</hi> had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his elaborate Answer to <hi>Grotius.</hi> For I have always endeavoured to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the right state of a Question, before I undertook it; and when I had done that, I have taken as much Care, as I could, to represent it truly to others. Which made me not a little surprized, when I found our modern <hi>Socinians</hi> in their late Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets to charge Me as well as others,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 31.</hi>
                     </note> with <hi>not reading their Books upon this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wholly mistaking the State of the Question between the Church and them.</hi> Whereas, if I had not read their Books
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:37433:3"/>
I might peradventure have entertained a more favourable Opinion of them, than I now have. But it was upon a diligent Consideration of the utmost I could find was said by their best Writers, that I so long since satisfied my self, that if the Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi> are to be our Rule of Faith, they were extreamly mistaken. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, our <hi>Unitarians</hi> (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) seem to go another way to work; which is, by undermining the Authority of these Books, and so to introduce <hi>Deism</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; (of which I hope to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in another Discourse.) But my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business is to lay open the true state of this Controversie between us. In their Answer to my Sermon (which is here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed) they say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ. to Serm. p 12.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That the Unitarians never denied, as I fancy, that Jesus Christ made himself a voluntary Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Expiation of the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> If this be true, I confess, I have mistaken them; but if the contrary prove very true from their own Writings, what do these Men deserve, for denying that which they know to be true? For it is hardly possible to suppose such bold Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, as they are, should be ignorant that <hi>Socinus</hi> absolutely denied, <hi>That Christ made himself a voluntary Sacrifice for
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:37433:3"/>
Expiation of the Sins of Mankind.</hi> For in his Answer to <hi>Volanus,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socin. Op. T. 1. p. 391.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That he and most others are greatly mistaken when they say, that Christ offered up himself to God, when his Blood was shed upon the Cross:</hi> And he positively affirms, <hi>That the Sacrifice which Christ offered was not upon the Cross, but in Heaven.</hi> These Passages gave great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to one <hi>Niemojevius,</hi> a Friend of his, who in his first Epistle to him, calls it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Socin. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. p. 196. Ed. Racov.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>A horrid Paradox, and directly contrary to Scripture, and wonders what he meant to write so confidently against the plain Testimonies of Scripture. Socinus</hi> in answer to him, saith, <hi>It is no more than himself had asserted some Years before,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Servatore;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p. 204.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and others of their Party before him.</hi> And he lays down, as his Conclusion, which he desires his Friend to bring his Arguments against, viz. <hi>That the Expiatory Sacrifice of Christ for our Sins was not performed on the Cross, but in Heaven. Niemoje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> brings express places of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Opinion; and saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p. 224.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>He could by no means excuse such plain Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the words of Scripture. Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his Reply persists in saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p. 226.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>That there was no Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:37433:4"/>
in the Death of Christ; and that it ought to be considered as an Intervening Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in order to the Expiation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p. 254.</hi>

                        <hi>p. 265.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and not otherwise;</hi> but he will by no means allow <hi>any Proof of any Sacrifice of the Expiation on the Cross.</hi> And so the Dispute ended. With what face can they now say, <hi>That the Unitarians never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied this,</hi> when <hi>Socinus</hi> not only doth it, but defends it, to the last, and saith, <hi>That others had done it before him:</hi> Which shews, that it was no singular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his own, but that which had been received among the <hi>Unitarians</hi> before him.</p>
                  <p>But say they, <hi>The</hi> Vnitarians <hi>ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the Lord Christ was an Expiatory Sacrifice for our Sins, as may be seen in the</hi> Racovian Catechism. This is indeed a wonderfull Proof, <hi>they ever acknowledged it, as may be seen in the</hi> Racovian Catechism: Were there no <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> before the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi>? And was that always the same? Suppose the <hi>Unitarians</hi> before, were of another Opinion; suppose the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi> it self hath been altered in this matter: how can any man of Sense be satisfied with such kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments as these? One would think, they wrote onely for such as would take their Words; they joyn so much Confidence with
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:37433:4"/>
so very little appearance of Reason. All that know any thing of these Matters, know very well, that the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi> was first framed by <hi>Smalcius,</hi> a strict Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower and Defender of <hi>Socinus,</hi> from whose Opinions he did not vary at all as to this matter, as will appear from all the old E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it. In which the Question is put,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Catech. Racov. c. 8. q. 4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>What is the Reason of the Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Christ?</hi> The Answer is two fold; <hi>1. To be an Example of Patience. 2. To confirm the Truth of God's Promises.</hi> And after these are explained, another Question is asked,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Q. 12.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Is there no other Cause of the Death of Christ?</hi> The Answer is very short, <hi>Nulla prorsus, None at all.</hi> And in the Conclusion of that Chapter a Question is put about Sacrifices,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Q. 38.</hi>
                     </note> and the Answer is, <hi>That the Death of Christ was no Sacrifice, but only a Preparation to it, and a kind of Introduction to it, for the Sacrifice was offered in Heaven and not before.</hi> Have we not now great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to believe from the <hi>Racovian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ made himself a voluntary Sacrifice for Expiation of the Sins of Mankind?</hi> But besides the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covian Catechism,</hi> they referr me to <hi>Schlictingius</hi> and <hi>Ruarus.</hi> For what, I pray? For what the <hi>Unitarians</hi> always
<pb n="viij" facs="tcp:37433:5"/>
held? That is impossible, when there is such evident Proof to the contrary. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their meaning is, That the <hi>Racovian Catechism, being reviewed by them speaks otherwise.</hi> And is this a good Proof, that they were always of that mind, because from hence it is evident they have changed it? And so it will appear to any one that will compare the latter Editions with the former.<note place="margin">

                     </note> In the last Edition I have seen, as it is review'd by <hi>Schlictin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius, Ruarus,</hi> and others, there is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, wherein they confess it is changed in several things from what it was, when it was first published by <hi>Moscorovius,</hi> A. D. <hi>1609,</hi> and yet the <hi>Unitarians</hi> were still of the same mind, although some more softning Expressions were for meer shame thought fit to be inserted. In this Correct Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Question is put, <hi>Why was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Christ to suffer as he did?</hi> And the Answer is twofold;<note place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>1. That Christ suffered for our Sins by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and underwent a cruel Death as a Sacrifice of Expiation.</hi> Who could imagine this to be the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi> still? <hi>2. Because those who are to be saved by him are subject to the like Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</hi> This is somewhat a dark Reason; but the former is that which we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>

                  <p>The first <hi>Rise</hi> of it was from the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Places of Scripture, which Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all the proper Effects of an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice to the Death of Christ.</hi> And that by those who best understood for what End it was that Christ suffer'd, and had no Intention to deceive or to amuse Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I mean our Saviour and his Apostles.

(4.)</hi> That the Expiation did not depend upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as an intervening Condition, as to the Party who thereby performed an Act of Obedience, but upon the Nature of the Sacrifice which was offer'd to God. For,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:37433:8"/>
whatever had been required, the Obedience had been the same; but here the great Force is laid on the <hi>Blood being offer'd for Expiation. (5.)</hi> That however the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God was seen both in the Appointing and Accepting the Ransom; yet the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifice</hi> was never understood by them to Respect <hi>the Mercy of God,</hi> but his <hi>Just Displeasure</hi> against their Sins. What strange Language would it have been thought among the <hi>Jews</hi> to offer an <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice to the Mercy of God?</hi> But Men that bring in New Doctrines, must make a New Sense of Words and Phrases; or else they can never reconcile them to each other. And it is a mighty Advantage to our Cause, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Expressions of the New Testament with Respect to these Matters, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the <hi>Jews</hi> understood them, among whom they were spoken; and who had their own Law to interpret them by. Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Unitarians</hi> do not deny that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Law had an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God; but they say, it <hi>Was not by way of Satisfaction to the Justice of God, but by way of Application to the Mercy of God, by way of humble Suit and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there were such a Sanction of the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:37433:9"/>
Law, whereby an Obligation to Punishment did follow the Offences forbidden by it; If the Iustice of God were concerned to see the Punishment executed, if the Law were not satisfied; If the Sacrifice of Atonement or Expiation were designed for satisfaction of the Law; and God did accept it for that End, then it follows, that these Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were intended not meerly as Rites of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi> and <hi>Deprecation</hi> to the Mercy of God; but by way of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to his <hi>Justice.</hi> For was it not Iustice in God to punish Offenders against his Law? Was it not Iustice in God to require a Satisfaction to his Law when it was broken? Was it not Iustice in God, when he had declared that he would accept a Sacrifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to require that instead of the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Offenders, and to punish those who wilfully neglected or despised it? How then, can they pretend <hi>that these Sacrifices had no Respect to the Justice of God?</hi> We never read in Scripture any Expressions, as to the Methods of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation like this, <hi>That the Blood of the Sacrifices was to expiate for their Sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it was given for an Atonement for the Soul.</hi> Is it ever said, that Prayer and Supplication was to make a Sacrifice of Atonement, and that it was appointed for
<pb n="xvij" facs="tcp:37433:9"/>
that End? Prayer is a Natural and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Duty and a Condition in order to Pardon, but the Life and Force of that lies in a Man's own Breast, in the inward and fervent Desires of the Soul: but a Sacrifice of Atonement was a thing of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Blood was to be shed and then offer'd up to God, as a Sacrifice of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God himself had appointed for that End; and without which no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins was to be expected. <hi>But was not this from the Mercy of God to appoint such a Sacrifice of Atonement?</hi> No doubt of it, and so it was that he would accept it for such an End. But that is by no means the present Question; for it is, Whether the Sacrifice, which God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an Atonement, was only a Rite of <hi>Supplication to the Mercy of God</hi>? In one Sense a Sacrifice of Atonement is a way of <hi>Deprecation:</hi> but then it relates to the Wrath and Displeasure of God; for it is that which God hath appointed as the Means of Averting his Wrath, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Execution of his Iustice. But the main Question is, Whether the Sacrifice of Atonement as to God's just Wrath and Displeasure, be not a Real <hi>Satisfaction to his Justice?</hi> For if he be justly displeased, and might justly punish, but doth accept a
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:37433:10"/>
Sacrifice of Expiation in stead of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a Concurrence of Mercy, yet there is a Real Atonement to his Iustice: unless they will say, the Iustice of God is not concerned in preserving the Honour of his Laws. But of this more afterwards. If an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> under the Law were nothing else but a Solemn Rite of <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Mercy of God</hi> it would take away the Typical Nature of those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and especially those on the Day of Expiation.

And all the Confusion these Men have run into, hath been from want of distinguishing these; of which I have treated at large in the following Discourse.</p>
                  <p>Thus far it appears that they have by no means allow'd the Death and Sufferings of Christ to have been an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice</hi> in the Sense of the Iews, as it was a <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som or Price of Redemption.</hi>

is a <hi>Substitution in place of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> For that the <hi>Jews</hi> and others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Expiation;</hi> when the Punishment of one was laid upon another in order to his Deliverance.

What now is to be said to all these places of Scripture? Were they designed only to humor and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the Credulity of Mankind by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of such an Expiatory Sacrifice in the Death of Christ, which never was, nor could be, being Repugnant to the Iustice of God? For Christ, say they, <hi>being Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent could not suffer the Punishment of our Sins, and God being Just could not accept of it, although he freely offer'd himself as a Sacrifice for our Sins.</hi> Doth this agree with the Force and Design of all these Expressions? Had not Christ the Power and Will to offer up himself as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Propitiation to God? And where lies the <hi>Injustice</hi> of accepting such a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he freely offer'd? <hi>But it could not be,</hi> say they, <hi>by way of Punishment
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:37433:13"/>
for our Sins.</hi> What then is the meaning of all those places, wherein he is said to <hi>bear our Sins</hi> and to suffer in our stead, <hi>the just for the unjust?</hi> What is this but to contradict the Tenour and Scope of the <hi>New Testament</hi> with respect to the Death of Christ; and to turn their Sense quite another way from what they were thought to signifie at that time? which is no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable way of interpreting Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Do they deny that Christ suffered, what we say he did? No; that they dare not do. But they say, <hi>What he underwent was only Labour and Suffering; but not the Punishment of our Iniquities.</hi> Then, I say, it could be no <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice,</hi> which implies <hi>a Substitution,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears by the many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture already mentioned, wherein our Sins and the Sufferings of Christ are joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the true <hi>Rise</hi> of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie was from the many places of Scripture, which seem very plain and clear in this matter; and therefore I shall now give an account of the <hi>Progress</hi> of it.</p>

                     <hi>F. Socinus</hi> seeing the bent of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so much against him, sets himself to the finding out ways to avoid the force of them.</p>

                     </note> he answers, <hi>That these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be understood only Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and Christ's Death being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening Condition in order to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, it is therefore called, a Price of Redemption.</hi> And to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Correct <hi>Racovian Catechism;</hi> only there it is added, <hi>That God did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Death of Christ as a most Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice.

The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, Whether God appointed or accepted him, for that we have allowed in all Sacrifices of Atonement by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> but whether his Sufferings were not required in order to the Satisfaction of

Divine Iustice for the Sins of Mankind; not by way of <hi>strict Payment,</hi> as in case of <hi>Debts;</hi> but by a <hi>Legal Satisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Justice of God</hi> as it is concerned in the Honour of his Laws.</p>

                     <hi>That Christ was a Ransom and Price of Redemption for us;</hi> but they deny, <hi>That he was an Adequate Price, or a Sacrifice to the Justice of God.</hi> But still they run upon the Notion of <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Payments,</hi> as though there were no other Notion of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> but between <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Debtors;</hi> or as if their Notions of these things were rather taken from the <hi>Shops</hi> than the <hi>Schools.</hi> And the <hi>monstrous Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> they conclude the charge of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with, is, <hi>That God freely Pardons the whole Debt of Sin, and yet hath been infinitely over-paid for both in the Death and other Sufferings of the Lord Christ.</hi>

                  <p>But in the following Discourse,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ch. I.</hi>
                     </note> I have endeavoured to lay open this Mistake, by shewing, That <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> are of a different Nature; and therefore the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in one Case is not to be measured by the other. But I shall not here anticipate the Reader, as to what follows; but I shall take notice of what they
<pb n="xxviij" facs="tcp:37433:15"/>
say, which seems to relate to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almighty God,</hi> say they, <hi>as King and Proprietor of all Persons and things, can forgive any Offence or all Offences even without Repentance or Amendment, nor is it contrary to his Justice so to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a very strange Assertion. For then there is no Obligation on God's part in point of Iustice to punish the most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent and Incorrigible Offenders. But there is a great deal of difference, between making the Exercise of <hi>Punitive</hi> or <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Justice</hi> necessary upon every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and saying that the Iustice of God doth not require that any Offences should be punished.</p>
                  <p>The former makes Iustice in God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by a natural Necessity, which would leave no place for Mercy, nor any Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by a Mediator, for that must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Liberty and Relaxation, as to the Executive Part of Iustice. And if God must punish Sinners as they deserve, there can be no stop to the Execution of Iustice short of Annihilation; for our very Beings are the Gift of God which we have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be deprived of. But on the other side, to say, that <hi>the Justice of God</hi> doth not require the Punishment of any Offences
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:37433:15"/>
                     <hi>without Repentance or Amendement,</hi> is to overthrow any such thing as <hi>Punitive Justice</hi> in God; by which I do not mean, the actual execution of it, and the due measures which belong to it, but the Will to punish Obstinate and Impenitent Sinners. And that results from his Hatred and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of Evil, and his just Government of the World. For how can any Men, who believe that God is really displeased with the Wickedness of Men, and that he is a Iust and Righteous Governour, ever think that it is not Repugnant to his Iustice to forgive all Offences without Repentance or Amendment? How can his Hatred of Sin and the Iustice of his Government be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with the Impunity of the most Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Offenders? Is there no such thing as Iustice to himself and to his Laws; which lies in a just Vindication of his Honour and of his Laws from Contempt? And who can be guilty of greater Contempt of him, than those who persist in their Wickedness <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance or Amendment?</hi> And after all, <hi>Is it not contrary to his Justice to forgive such as these, because he is absolute Lord and Proprietor of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Things?</hi> This might signifie something, if we could imagine God to be nothing but <hi>Almighty Power</hi> without <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:</hi>
                     <pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:37433:16"/>
but if his <hi>Justice</hi> be as Essential an Attribute as his Omnipotency, we must not so much as suppose the Exercise of one without the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Answ. to Milb. p. 53.</hi>
                     </note>But they do not deny, <hi>That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Wisdom and Holiness of God to let the Incorrigible and Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent escape unpunished, or to forgive Sin without Repentance or Amendment.</hi> But if the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of God will not permit the Impunity of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, is it not <hi>just in God</hi> to <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> them? Not barely as to the <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Desert</hi> of <hi>Punishment</hi>; but as to <hi>the Will of Punishing</hi> them according to their merits? Whence doth their Punishment come? Is it not from the Will of God? Is that Will just or not? If the Will to punish be just? whence comes it to be so? From the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> of God? Then <hi>Punitive Justice,</hi> when it is agreeable to God's <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> is a proper Divine Attribute as well as they. And they must have strange Notions of <hi>Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice,</hi> who would separate it from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But Justice,</hi> they say, <hi>hath no other share or interest in Punishment, but only to see that Punishment be not misplac'd, and that it do not exceed the Offence.</hi> We
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:37433:16"/>
are far from denying these things to belong to the Measures in the Exercise of <hi>Punitive Justice:</hi> But whence comes <hi>Punitive Justice</hi> to belong to God? Is it not because it is just in him to punish Offenders according to those measures? And whence comes this, but from that <hi>Universal Justice in God,</hi> which is always joyned with his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness:</hi> and implies an <hi>Universal Rectitude</hi> in all he doth? And from thence it comes that all the Measures of Iustice are observed by him in the Punishment of the greatest Offenders.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Universal Justice</hi> in God is that, whereby he not only punishes Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Impenitent Sinners, but he takes care of preserving the Honour of his Laws. And therefore, although Almighty God out of his great Mercy were willing that Penitent Sinners should be forgiven; yet it was most agreeable thereto, that it should be done in such a manner as to discourage Mankind from the practice of Sin, by the same way by which he offers Forgiveness; and for this end, it pleased God in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom and Goodness to send his Son to become a Sacrifice of Propitiation for the Sins of Mankind; which being freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by him, there was no breach in the Measures of <hi>Punitive Justice</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="xxxij" facs="tcp:37433:17"/>
to him; and so by his Death he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up himself as <hi>a full, perfect and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Sins of Mankind.</hi> And this is that Doctrine of the <hi>Satisfaction of Christ</hi> which we own and defend.</p>
                  <p>But these bold Assertions, <hi>That God as absolute Lord may forgive all Offences without Repentance,</hi> and <hi>it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Justice so to do; that, it is not the Justice of God which prompts him to punish Sinners,</hi> arise from too mean and narrow a Conception of <hi>Divine Justice;</hi> as though it lay only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Execution of it. But that there is an Essential Attribute of <hi>Justice</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Divine Nature, appears from hence, that there are some things which are so disagreeable to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he cannot do them; he cannot break his Promises, nor deceive Mankind to their Destruction; he <hi>cannot deny himself,</hi> nor pervert that Order, or due Respects of things to each other, which he hath established in the World. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it the Duty of Mankind to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Maker, or to violate the Rules of Good and Evil, so as to make Evil Good and Good Evil; he cannot make Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Adultery to be Virtues, nor Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
<pb n="xxxiij" facs="tcp:37433:17"/>
and Wickedness not to deserve Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. But whence comes all this? Is it that God wants <hi>Almighty Power</hi> to do what he pleases? No doubt, he is supreme Lord over all, and hath all things under his Will. But there is an Essential Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in God, which is a supreme Rule of Righteousness, according to which he doth always exercise his Power and Will. And so <hi>Moses</hi> saith of him,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But here the main Difficulty which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be cleared is this, How far <hi>Puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice</hi> is founded on that <hi>Universal Justice</hi> which is an Essential Attribute of God. For the want of understanding this, hath been the great occasion of so much Confusion in the Discourses about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for the clearing of it, these things must be considered;</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That there is a difference between that Iustice in God, whereby he hates Sin, and that whereby he punishes the Sinner. The hatred of Sin doth necessarily follow the Perfection of his Nature. Therefore
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:37433:18"/>
God is said, <hi>To hate the Wicked;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal. 11.5. Prov. 6.16. Psal. 45.7. Zech. 8.17.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and Evil to be an Abomination to him; to love Righteousness and to hate Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</hi> But if the Punishment of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender were as necessarily consequent as his Hatred of Sin, all Mankind must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as they offend, and there would be no place for Mercy in God, nor for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Men. But Sin in it self is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly hatefull to God, there being nothing like God in it; but Man was God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and made after <hi>his Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> and however God be displeased with Mankind on the account of Sin, yet the Workmanship of God still remains; and we continually see that God doth not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise his Punitive Iustice according to the Measures of their Iniquities. And they who plead most for the necessity of Punitive Iustice, are themselves a Demonstration to the contrary; for they cannot deny, that they are not punished as their Iniquities have deserved. And if Punitive Iustice be necessary in it self it must reach the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have deserved to be punished, if there be no Relaxation of the Severity of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> That it is very agreeable to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice,</hi> to exercise the Severity of Punitive Iustice on obstinate and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:37433:19"/>
Offenders. And this is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iustice of the Punishments of Sinners in another World is founded; because God hath been so mercifull to them here, and used so many ways to reclaim them, and it is the Not exercising his Punitive Iustice upon them in this World, which makes it so much more reasonable in another. For thereby they have shewed their Contempt of God and his Laws, of his offers of Mercy and their wilfull obstinacy in offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. And the reasonableness of the Punishment of such Offenders is not deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of our more Learned Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as I have shewed in the following Discourse from <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The old Editions of the <hi>Racovian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism</hi> follow <hi>Socinus,</hi> and there the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Places which speak of <hi>Christ's Dying for us,</hi> is, <hi>that they do not signify in our stead; but for our good.</hi> Which they are very careful to distinguish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they think that the latter implies no more than a Condition in order to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation in Heaven; but the other makes him a true Propitiatory Sacrifice for our Sins. But if Christ did not <hi>suffer in our stead;</hi> how can they possibly Reconcile his undergoing this Condition with their own Measures of Divine Iustice? All they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to say, is, <hi>that it was Labour and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering but not Punishment.</hi> Which is to speak against the Common Sense of Mankind; and is a ridiculous piece of <hi>Stoicism.</hi> They say, <hi>it was a meer Act of Dominion as to Christ and not of Justice.</hi> But if there be such an Essential Attribute as Iustice in God, then the Exercise of Dominion must
<pb n="xlij" facs="tcp:37433:22"/>
be regulated by it; especially where there was nothing but perfect Innocency. The Case is very different as to the sinful Race of Mankind, who having the Guilt of Sin upon them, God may justly exercise his Dominion over them as he sees cause; but he always doth it justly, although the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reasons may not be within our reach. But here is no Guilt of Sin consider'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own, or others; according to their Principles; and yet they make him to undergo as great Sufferings, as we do, who assert that he suffer'd for our sakes <hi>in our stead;</hi> which alone gives a Reasonable Account of it.</p>
                  <p>But in the late correct Edition of the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi> they say, <hi>the Sense of Christ's Suffering for our Sins is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, but both come to one at last, 1. That Christ suffered as a Sacrifice in our stead; tanquam victima pro nobis Succedanea.</hi> How can <hi>Socinus</hi> and the <hi>Racovian Catechism</hi> agree? <hi>2. That he suffer'd for our good.</hi> But they deny any <hi>Commutation</hi> which they say, <hi>was not in the Expiatory Sacrifice among the Jews.</hi> What doth a <hi>Substitution</hi> differ from a <hi>Commutation</hi> in this Case?</p>
                  <p>But how do <hi>suffering in our stead and for our good come all to one at last?</hi>
                     <pb n="xliij" facs="tcp:37433:22"/>
Either it must be, that Christ did truly <hi>suffer in our stead,</hi> when he underwent the Punishment of our Sins in order to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Expiation; and that is a very good and true Sense; which we readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and are very well content that they should <hi>come all to one:</hi> Or if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be only, that Christ may be said <hi>to suffer in our stead,</hi> because we have <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> by the <hi>Consequences of his Death;</hi> then his dying is only consider'd as a bare <hi>Condition</hi> and not as a <hi>Sacrifice in our stead.</hi> As to make it plain by an Instance; we all agree that <hi>Joseph</hi>'s <hi>Suffering</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> was designed by the Wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for the good of his Brethren, which they received after his Advancement, to which his Suffering was an Antecedent Condition. But can any Man say, that he suffer'd in stead of his Brethren? But now if <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren had been sold for Slaves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> had gone down thither and offer'd himself a Prisoner for their Deliverance; this had been truly Suffering <hi>in their stead,</hi> as well as <hi>for their Advantage.</hi> And suppose the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> had agreed with <hi>Joseph,</hi> that if he would become Prisoner for his Brethren, he would advance him, and he should himself deliver them by his own Power; this doth
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:37433:23"/>
not at all hinder his <hi>Suffering in their stead.</hi> But if it had no Relation to their Deliverance by his being made Captive himself; but was only a step to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; then it cannot be said to be <hi>in their stead,</hi> although it might turn to their Advantage. And so much for the Sense of the <hi>Racovian Catechism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Unitarians</hi> fly higher, for they say,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1. That God could not justly or wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substitute an Innocent Person to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo Punishment in place of the Guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2. That Christ could not freely offer himself as a Sacrifice in our stead, nor could God accept of it, or allow it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that here we have the <hi>true State</hi> of this Controversie between us, <hi>viz. whether Christ were a Real Expiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of Mankind.</hi> For, if he could not be <hi>Substituted in our stead, nor God accept of his offering up himself for us</hi>; all the other Expressions are meer Words given out on purpose to Amuse and Deceive us.</p>
                  <p>And this is that which I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to make out in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">

to consider what reason there was why the plain and easie sense of those places must be forsaken, and a remote and Metaphorical meaning put upon them. Which I thought my self the more obliged to do, because I could not conceive if it had been the design of the Scripture, to have delivered the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of the Christian Church, concerning the reason of the sufferings of Christ, that it could have been more clearly and fully expressed than it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. So that supposing that to have been the true meaning of the several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which we contend for; yet the same arts and subtilties might have been used to pervert it, which are imployed to perswade men that is not the true meaning of them. And what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually serviceable to truth and falshood, can of it self, have no power on the minds of men to convince them it must be one, and not the other. Nay, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unusual and improper acception of words in the Scripture, shall be thought sufficient to take away the natural and genuine sense, where the matter is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, I know scarce any article of Faith can be long secure; and by these arts men may declare that they believe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37433:27"/>
the Scriptures, and yet believe nothing of the Christian Faith. For if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, though unusual acception of those expressions <hi>of Christ's dying for us,</hi> of <hi>redemption, propitiation, reconciliation by his blood, of his bearing our iniquities,</hi> and <hi>being made sin and a curse for us,</hi> shall be enough to invalidate all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from them to prove that which the proper sense of them doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, why may not the improper use of the terms of Creation and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as well take away the natural sense of them in the great Articles of the Creation of the world, and Resurection after death? For if it be enough to prove that <hi>Christ's dying for us,</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>dying in our stead</hi>; because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>dying for others</hi> imports no more than dying for some advantage to come to them; if <hi>redemption</hi> being sometimes used for <hi>mere deliverance,</hi> shall make our <hi>redemption</hi> by Christ, wholly <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>; if the terms of <hi>propitiation, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> &amp;c. shall lose their force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are sometimes used where all things cannot be supposed parallel with the sense we contend for: why shall I be bound to believe that the World was ever created in a proper sense, since those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37433:28"/>
persons against whom I argue, so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend that in those places in which it seems as proper as any, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood only in a metaphorical? If when <hi>the world and all things are said to be made by Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">John 1.3, 10.</note> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the production but the reformation of the World and all things in it, although the natural sense of the Words be quite otherwise; what argument can make it necessary for me not to understand the Creation of the World in a metaphorical sense, when <hi>Moses</hi> delivers to us the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of it? Why may not I understand <hi>in the beginning,</hi> Gen. 1. for the beginning of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, as well as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth <hi>in the beginning,</hi> John 1. for the beginning of the Evangelical? and that from the very same argument used by him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in the beginning</hi> is to be understood of the main subject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the author intends to write, and that I am as sure it was in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> concerning the <hi>Law</hi> given by him, as it was in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning the <hi>Gospel</hi> delivered by <hi>Christ.</hi> Why may not <hi>the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> be no more than the erection of the Jewish Polity? since it is acknowledged, that by <hi>New Heavens and New Earth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37433:28"/>
wherein dwelleth righteousness,</hi> no more is understood than a new state of things under the Gospel? Why may not the <hi>confused Chaos</hi> import no more than the state of Ignorance and Darkness under which the World was before the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> since it is confessed that it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the New Testament such a state of the World before the Gospel appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and consequently, why may not <hi>the light which made the first day</hi> be the first tendencies to the Doctrine of <hi>Moses,</hi> which being at first divided and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was united afterwards in one great Body of Laws, which was called the <hi>Sun,</hi> because it was the great Director of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and therefore said <hi>to rule the day</hi>; as the less considerable Laws of other Nations are called the <hi>Moon,</hi> because they were to govern those who were yet under the <hi>night</hi> of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Why may not the <hi>Firmament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midst of the Waters,</hi> imply the erection of the Jewish State in the midst of a great deal of trouble, since it is confessed, that <hi>Waters</hi> are often taken in Scripture in a Metaphorical sense for troubles and afflictions? and <hi>the Earth appearing out of the Waters,</hi> be no more but the settlement of that State after its
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37433:29"/>
troubles; and particularly with great elegancy after their passage through the Red Sea? And <hi>the Production of Herbs and living Creatures,</hi> be the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the People of all sorts, as well those of a meaner rank (and therefore called herbs) as those of a higher, that were to live upon the other, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times trample upon them, and therefore by way of excellency called <hi>the Living Creatures?</hi> And when these were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and brought into order, (which being done by steps and degrees, is said to be finished in several days) then the State and the Church flourished and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a great deal of pleasure, which was the production of Man and Woman, and their being placed in Paradise: (for <hi>a perfect Man,</hi> notes a high degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and <hi>a Woman</hi> is taken for the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi>) but when they followed the Customs of other Nations which were <hi>as a forbidden tree</hi> to them, then they lost all their happiness and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and were expell'd out of their own Country, and lived in great slavery and misery, which was the Curse pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against them, for violating the rules of Policy established among them. Thus you see how small a measure of wit, by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37433:29"/>
the advantage of those ways of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scripture, which the subtilest of our adversaries make use of, will serve to pervert the clearest expressions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to quite another sense than was ever intended by the Writer of them. And I assure you, if that rule of interpreting Scripture be once allowed; that if words are ever used in a Metaphorical sense, there can be no necessity of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them any where in a proper; there is scarce any thing which you look on as the most necessary to be believed in Scripture, but it may be made appear not to be so upon those terms. For by reason of the paucity, and therefore the ambiguity of the Original words of the Hebrew language, the strange Idioms of it, the different senses of the same word in several Conjugations, the want of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral modes of expression which are used in other Languages, and above all the lofty and Metaphorical way of speaking used in all Eastern Countries, and the imitation of the Hebrew Idioms in the Greek Translation of the Old Testament, and Original of the New, you can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affix a sense upon any words used therein, but a man who will be at the pains to search all possible significations
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37433:30"/>
and uses of those words, will put you hard to it, to make good that which you took to be the proper meaning of them. Wherefore although I will not deny to our adversaries the praise of subtilty and diligence; I cannot give them that (which is much more praise-worthy) of discretion and sound judgment. For while they use their utmost industry to search all the most remote and Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical senses of words, with a design to take off the genuine and proper meaning of them, they do not attend to the ill consequence that may be made of this to the overthrowing those things, the belief of which themselves make necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For by this way the whole Gospel may be made an Allegory, and the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ be thought as meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical as the Redemption by his Death, and the force of all the Precepts of the Gospel avoided by some unusual signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words wherein they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. So that nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable than such a method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unless it be first sufficiently proved that the matter is not capable of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense, and therefore of necessity the improper only is to be allowed. And this is that which <hi>Socinus</hi> seems after all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37433:30"/>
his pains to pervert the meaning of the places in controversie, to rely on most; viz.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Socin. de Servat. Part.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Doctrine of satisfaction doth imply an impossibility in the thing it self, and therefore must needs be false; nay,</hi> he saith, <hi>the infallibility of the Revealer had not been enough in this Case, supposing that Christ had said it, and risen from the dead, to declare his own Veracity; unless he had delivered it by its proper causes and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and so shewed the possibility of the thing it self. And the reason,</hi> he saith, <hi>why they believe their Doctrine true, is not barely because God hath said it, but they believe certainly that God hath said it, because they know it to be true</hi>; by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary Doctrine to be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The controversie then, concerning the meaning of the places in dispute is to be resolved from the nature and reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the matter contained in them? for if <hi>Socinus</hi> his reason be answerable to his confidence, if the account we give of the sufferings of Christ, be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant not only to the Justice, Goodness and Grace of God, but to the nature of the thing; if it appear impossible, that mankind should be redeemed in a proper sense, or that God should be propitiated by the Death of his Son as a Sacrifice
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37433:31"/>
for sin; if it enervate all the Precepts of Obedience, and tend rather to justifie sins than those who do repent of them; I shall then agree, that no industry can be too great in searching Authors, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring places, examining Versions, to find out such a sense as may be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of things, the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, and the design of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. But if on the contrary, the Scripture doth plainly assert those things, from whence our Doctrine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and without which no reasonable account can be given either of the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions used therein, or of the sufferings of Christ; if Christ's death did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect God as a sacrifice, and was paid as a price for our redemption; if such a design of his death be so far from being repugnant to the nature of God, that it highly manifests his Wisdom, Justice and Mercy; if it assert nothing but what is so far from being impossible, that it is very reconcileable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles of Reason, as well as the Free-Grace of God in the pardon of sin; if, being truly understood, it is so far from enervating, that it advances high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the purposes of Christian Religion, then it can be no less than a betraying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37433:31"/>
one of the grand Truths of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine, not to believe ours to be the true sense of the places in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. And this is that which I now take upon me to maintain.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. For our clearer proceeding herein, nothing will be more necessary, than to understand the true <hi>state of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in general.</hi>
                        </note> which hath been rendred more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure by the mistakes of some, who have managed it with greater zeal than judgment; who have asserted more than they needed to have done, and made our Adversaries assert much less than they do: And by this means have shot over their Adversaries heads, and laid their own more open to assaults. It is easie to observe, that most of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments are levelled against an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which few who have considered these things do maintain, and none need to think themselves obliged to do it; which is, That Christ paid a proper and rigid satisfaction for the sins of men, considered under the notion of debts, and that he paid the very same, which we ought to have done; which in the sense of the Law, is never called Satisfaction, but strict Payment. Against this <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> disputes from the impossibility of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37433:32"/>
Christ's paying the very same that we were to have paid; because our penalty was eternal Death, and that as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of inherent guilt, which Christ neither did nor could undergo. Neither is it enough to say, <hi>That Christ had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone eternul Death, unless he had been able to free himself from it</hi>; for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of one to pay for another, who could discharge the debt in much less time than the offenders could, was not the same which the Law required. For that takes no notice of any other than the persons who had sinned; and if a <hi>Mediator</hi> could have paid the same, the Original Law must have been disjunctive; <hi>viz.</hi> That either the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender must suffer, or another for him; but then the Gospel had not been the bringing in of a better <hi>Covenant,</hi> but a performance of the old. But if there be a relaxation or dispensation of the first Law; then it necessarily follows, that what Christ paid, was not the very same which the first Law required: for what need of that, when the very same was paid that was in the obligation? But if it be said, <hi>That the dignity of the person makes up, what wanted in the kind or degree of punishment</hi>; this is a plain confession
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37433:32"/>
that it is not the same, but something equivalent, which answers the ends of the Sanction, as much as the same would have done, which is the thing we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for. Besides, if the very same had been paid in the strict sense, there would have followed a deliverance <hi>ipso facto</hi>; for the release immediately follows the payment of the same: and it had been injustice to have required any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to the discharge of the Offender, when strict and full payment had been made of what was in the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But we see that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the consequences of those two, are made conditions on our parts, in order to the enjoying the benefit of what Christ hath procured; So that the release is not immediate upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but depends on a new contract, made in consideration of what Christ hath done and suffered for us. If it be said, <hi>That by Christ's payment, we become his, and he requires these conditions of us</hi>; besides the contrariety of it to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which make the conditions to be required by him to whom the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made; we are to consider, that these very persons assert, that Christ paid all for us, and in our name and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37433:33"/>
stead; so that the payment by Christ was by a substitution in our room; and if he paid the same which the Law required, the benefit must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately accrue to those in whose name the debt was paid. For what was done in the name of another, is all one to the Creditor, as if it had been done by the Debtor himself. But above all things, it is impossible to reconcile the freeness of remission, with the full payment of the very same which was in the obligation. Neither will it serve to say, <hi>That though it was not free to Christ, yet it was to us.</hi> For the satisfaction and remission must respect the same person; for Christ did not pay for himself, but for us, neither could the remission be to him. Christ therefore is not consider'd in his own name, but as acting in our stead; so that what was free to him, must be to us; what was exactly paid by him, it is all one as if it had been done by us: so that it is impossible the same debt should be fully paid and freely forgiven. Much less will it avoid the difficulty in this case to say, <hi>That it was a refusable payment:</hi> for it being supposed to be the very same, it was not in justice refusable; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not in equity, if it answer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37433:33"/>
of the Law, as much as the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the offenders had done; and the more it doth that, the less refusable it is. And although <hi>God himself found out the way,</hi> that doth not make the pardon free, but the designation of the person who was to pay the debt. Thus when our Adversaries dispute against this opinion, no wonder if they do it successfully; but this whole opinion is built upon a mistake, that satisfaction must be the payment of the very same; which while they contend for, they give our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries too great an advantage, and make them think they triumph over the Faith of the Church, when they do it only over the mistake of some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But the foundation of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, lies in the consideration of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under the notion of <hi>debts,</hi> and that satisfaction therefore must be by strict payment in rigor of Law; but how great that mistake is, will appear in the subsequent discourse. But it cannot but be wondred at, that the very same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who consider sins, as debts which must be strictly satisfied for, do withal contend for the absolute necessity of this satisfaction: whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would hold good, <hi>if sins were only
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37433:34"/>
considered as debts, and God as the mere Creditor of punishment; he might as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part with his own right without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as any Creditor may forgive what summ he pleases to a person indebted to him</hi>; and no reason can be brought to the contrary, from that notion of sins, why he may not do it. But if they be considered, with a respect to God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, and the honour of his Laws, then some further account may be given, why it may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with that, to pass by the sins of men, without satisfaction made to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. And because the mistake in this matter,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of debts and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                        </note> hath been the foundation of most of the subsequent mistakes on both sides, and the discovery of the cause of errors, doth far more to the cure of them, than any Arguments brought against them; and withal, the true understanding of the whole Doctrine of satisfaction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it, I shall endeavour to make clear the notion under which our sins are considered; for upon that depends the nature of the satisfaction which is to be made for them. For while our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries suppose, that sins are to be looked on under the notion of debts in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, they assert it to be wholly free for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37433:34"/>
God to remit them, without any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. They make the right of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment merely to depend on God's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Dominion; and that all satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction must be considered under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of compensation, for the injuries done to him, to whom it is to be made. But if we can clearly shew a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference between the notion of debts and punishments, if the right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not depend upon mere Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and that satisfaction by way of punishment, is not primarily intended for compensation, but for other ends, we shall make not only the state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie much clearer, but offer some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing considerable towards the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. The way I shall take for the proof of the difference between debts and punishments, shall be using the other for the Arguments for it. For besides, that those things are just in matter of debts, which are not so in the case of punishments; as, that it is lawfull for a man to forgive all the debts which are owing him by all persons, though they never so contumaciously refuse pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but our Adversaries will not say so in the case of sins; for although they assert, That the justice of God doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37433:35"/>
debt. And withal, those things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the remission of debts, which are unjust in the matter of punishments; as it is lawfull for a Creditor, when two persons are considered in equal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to remit one, and not the other; nay, to remit the greater debt, without any satisfaction, and to exact the lesser to the greatest extremity; but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just in matter of punishments, where the reason and circumstances are the same, for a person who hath committed a crime of very dangerous consequence, to escape unpunished, and another who hath been guilty of far less to be severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed. Besides these considerations, I say, I shall now prove the difference of debts and punishments, from those two things whereby things are best differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from each other; <hi>viz.</hi> The different Reason, and the different End of them.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. (1.) <hi>The different Reason of debts and punishments:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The reason of humane punishment is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</hi>
                        </note> The reason of debts is dominion and property, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of them, depends upon volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary contracts between parties; but the reason of punishments is Justice and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and depends not upon mere contracts, but the relation the person stands in to that Authority to which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37433:36"/>
he is accountable for his actions. For if the obligation to punishment, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon mere contract, then none could justly be punished, but such who have consented to it by an antecedent contract: If it be said, <hi>That a contract is implied, by their being in society with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>; that is as much as I desire to make the difference appear, for in case of debts, the obligation depends upon the voluntary contract of the person; but in case of punishments, the very relation to Government, and living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws doth imply it. And the right of punishment depends upon the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Laws, where the reason of them holds, without any express con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or superiority of one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in the case of violation of the Law of Nations, that gives right to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation to punish the infringers of it. Otherwise Wars could never be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full between two Nations, and none could be warrantable, but those of a Prince against his rebellious subjects, who have broken the Laws themselves consented expresly to. Besides, in case of debts every man is bound to pay, whether he be call'd upon or no; but in case of punishments, no man is bound
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37433:36"/>
to betray or accuse himself. For the obligation to payment in case of debt ariseth from the injury sustained by that particular person, if another detains what is his own from him; but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to punishment, arises from the injury, the Publick sustains by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of crimes, of which the Magistrates are to take Care; who by the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of punishments, do shew that to be true which <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, that if there be any Creditor to be assigned in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is the publick good: Which appears by this, that all punishments are proportioned, according to the influence the offences have upon the publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; for the reason of punishment is not because a Law is broken, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the breach of a Law tends to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the community, by infringing the Authority of the Laws, and the honour of those who are to take care of them. For if we consider it, the measure of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments is in a well ordered State, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the influence which crimes have upon the peace and interest of the community. No man questions, but that Malice, Pride and Avarice, are things really as bad as many faults, that are severely punished by humane
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37433:37"/>
Laws, but the reason these are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished is, because they do not so much injury to the publick interest, as Theft and Robbery do. Besides, in those things wherein the Laws of a Nation are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the utmost rigor is not used in the preventing of crimes, or the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them when committed, if such an execution may endanger the publick more than the impunity of the offenders may do. And there are some things which are thought sit to be forbidden, where the utmost means are not used to prevent them; as Merchants are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to steal customs, but they are not put under an Oath not to do it. And when penalties have been deserved, the execution of them hath been deferred, till it may be most for the advantage of the publick: as <hi>Ioab</hi>'s punishment till <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s Reign, though he deserved it as much in <hi>David</hi>'s. So that the rule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly talked of, <hi>Fiat justitia &amp; pereat mundus,</hi> is a piece of Pedantry, rather than true Wisdom; for whatever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty inflicted brings a far greater detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the publick, than the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, is no piece of Justice to the State, but the contrary; the greatest Law, being the safety and preservation
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37433:37"/>
of the whole Body. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in humane Laws, the reason of punishment is not, that such an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is done, but because the impunity in doing it, may have a bad influence on the publick interest; but in debts, the right of Restitution depends upon the injury received by a particular person, who looks at no more than the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his loss by it.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. We are now to consider, how far these things will hold in Divine Laws,<note place="margin">

                        <note place="margin">P. 144.</note> 
                        <hi>but when that is not performed, the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty succeeds in its room, and therefore that doth belong to God on the same account:</hi> His other arguments are, <hi>from the compensation of injuries due to the offended party, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37433:38"/>
from God's anger against sin, in which he is to be consider'd as the offended party:</hi> These two latter will be answered under the next head; the first I am to examine here. He therefore tells us, that the right of punishment belongs to God's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, because the reason of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind is, because he is the Lord of them. But, for our better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding this, we are to consider, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the original right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth result from God's Dominion; for therefore our obedience is due, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his Sovereignty over us; yet when God takes upon him the notion of a Governour, he enters into a new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his creatures, distinct from the first as mere Lord. For he is equally Lord of all to whom he gives a being, but he doth not require obedience upon equal terms, nor governs them by the same Laws: Dominion is properly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the exercise of power; but when God gives Laws according to which he will reward and punish, he so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the exercise of his Dominion to a subserviency to the ends of Government. If we should suppose, that God governs the world merely by his Dominion, we must take away all rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37433:38"/>
for then the actions of men, would be the mere effects of irresistable power, and so not capable of rewards and punishments; for there could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, where mens actions are capable of the differences of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and that they cannot be, if they be the acts of God's Dominion, and not of their own. But if God doth not exercise his full Dominion over rational creatures, it is apparent that he doth govern them under another notion than as mere Lord, and the reason of punishment is not to be taken from an absolute right which God doth not make use of, but from the ends and designs of Government, which are his own Honour, the Authority of his Laws, and the good of those whom he doth govern. And <hi>Crellius</hi> is greatly mistaken, when he makes <hi>punishment to succeed in the place of the right of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>; for it is only the desert of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which follows upon the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that right; and as we assert, that the right of obedience is derived from God's Sovereignty, so we deny not, but the desert of punishment is from the violation of it; but withal we say, that the obligation to punishment depends upon the Laws, and God's right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37433:39"/>
punishment (Laws being supposed) is immediately from that Government which he hath over mankind: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if the whole right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did still depend upon God's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and the first right of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then all sins must have equal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because they are all equal viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fundamental right of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; then it were at liberty for God to punish a greater sin, with a less pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; and a lesser sin, with a greater: And lastly, this would make the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin, a mere Arbitrary thing in God; for there would be no reason of punishment, but what depended upon God's mere will; whereas the reason of punishment in Scripture is drawn from a repugnancy of sin to the divine purity and holiness, and not merely from God's power or will to punish; but if that were all the reason of it, there would be no repugnancy in the nature of the thing for the most vitious person to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and the most pious to be made everlastingly miserable. But who ever yet durst say or think so? From whence it appears that the relation between sin and punishment is no result of God's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary will; but it is founded in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37433:39"/>
nature of the things; so that as it is just for God to punish offenders, so it would be unjust to punish the most innocent person without any respect to sin. But if the right of punishment depends mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on God's Dominion, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand why God may not punish when and whom, and in what manner he pleaseth; without any impeachment of his Justice, and therefore it is to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, that the same persons who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the right of punishment to be mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God's Dominion, should yet cry out of the injustice of one person being punished for anothers faults; for why may not God exercise his Dominion in this case? yes, say they, <hi>he may his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but he cannot punish, because pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment supposes guilt, and cannot be just without it</hi>; how far that reaches, will be examined afterwards; at present, we take notice of the contradiction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which our Adversaries are guilty of, that they may serve their own <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi> for when we dispute with them, against absolute remission without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, then they contend that the right of punishment is a mere act of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and God may part with his right, if he please; but when they dispute with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37433:40"/>
us against the translation of punishment from one to another, then they no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger say that the right of punishment is an act of Dominion, but that it is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequent of inherent guilt, and cannot be removed from one to another. And then they utterly deny that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is of the nature of debts; for <hi>one man's money,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        </note> make it appear that there is a difference in the nature of them; for the intention of the obligation to pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in case of debt, is the compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the damage which the Creditor sustains; but the intention of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not bare compensation, but it is designed for greater and further ends. For which we are to consider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent nature of punishments, as they are inflicted by way of reparation of some injury done to private persons, and as they do respect the publick good. I grant, that private persons in case of injuries, seek for compensation of the damage they sustain, and so far they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37433:40"/>
bear the nature of debts; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them as inflicted by those who have a care of the publick, though they are to see that no private person suffers injury by another; yet the reason of that is not merely that he might enjoy his own, but because the doing injuries to others tends to the subversion of the ends of Government. Therefore, I can by no means admit that Position of <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell. c. Grot. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 147. <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. <hi>p.</hi> 162.</note> 
                        <hi>that a Magistrate only punishes as he assumes the person of the particular men who have received injuries from others</hi>; for he aims at other ends than merely the compensation of those injured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Their great end is according to the old Roman <hi>Formula, nè quid Resp. detrimenti capiat:</hi> the reason of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penalties upon private men is still with a regard to the publick safety. Supposing men in a state of nature no punishment is due to the injured person, but restitution of damage, and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the loss that accrues to him by the injury sustained; and whatever goes beyond this, is the effect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which constitutes penalties for perservation of the Society which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws. But herein <hi>Crellius</hi> is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, but with no advantage at all to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37433:41"/>
his Cause; for he offers to prove against <hi>Grotius, That something more is due by an injury beyond bare compensation for what the other is supposed to lose by the right of nature;</hi> for saith he, <hi>in every injury there is not only the real damage which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sustains, but there is a contempt of the person implyed in it, for which as well as the former, he ought to have compensation.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That this doth not prove what he designs, <hi>viz.</hi> that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment doth belong to the injured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in a state of Nature, beyond bare restitution, but that it is necessary, that men should not continue in such a state, that so they may be vindicated from that contempt, and others compelled to restitution. Both which, as they are punishments, are not in the power of the offended party as such, but shew that it is very reasonable there should be Laws and Governours, that private persons may be preserved in their just rights, and offenders punished for the vindication not only of their honour, but of the Laws too. And Laws being established, the injured person hath right to no more, than the compensation of his loss; for that being forced upon the offending party, is a sufficient vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37433:41"/>
of his honour. 2. If the contempt of a private person makes a compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion necessary, how much more will this hold in a publick Magistrate; whose contempt by disobedience is of far worse consequence than that of a private person. And by this argument <hi>Crellius</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his main <hi>hypothesis,</hi> viz. that God may pardon sin without satisfaction; for if it be not only necessary, that the loss be compensated but the dishonour too; then so much greater as the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is, so much higher as the person is, so much more beneficial to the world as his Laws are, so much more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is it that in order to pardon there must be a satisfaction made to him, for the affronts he hath received from men. And if the greatness of the injury be to be measured as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell. c. Grot. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 174.</note> 
                        <hi>from the worth and value of the thing, from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honour of the person, from the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicency of the fact to him,</hi> which he makes the measure of punishment; this makes it still far more reasonable, that God should have satisfaction for the sins of men, than that men should have for the injuries done them by one another; especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what the same Author doth assert afterwards,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that it is sometime repugnant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37433:42"/>
to justice, for one to part with his own right in case of injuries, and that either from the nature and circumstances of the things themselves or a decree or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the contrary:</hi> for the first he instanceth in case of <hi>notorious defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in which he saith, <hi>it is a dishonest and unlawful thing for a man, not to make use of his own right for his vindication:</hi> and for the other, <hi>in case of great obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and malice.</hi> By both which, it is most apparent, that <hi>Crellius</hi> puts a mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the nature of debts, and punishments, since in all cases he allows it lawful for a person free, to remit his debts; but in some cases he makes it utterly unlawful for a person not to make use of his right for punishment. And withal if a private person may not part with his own right in such cases, how unreasonable is it not to assert the same of the great Governour of the World? and that there may be a necessity for him upon supposition of the contempt of himself and his Laws, to vindicate himself and his honour to the world, by some remarkable testimony of his seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against sin.</p>

of punishment to be the evil of him that suffers it. Where the right of punishment is derived from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury received, and therefore that which gives that right, is some damage sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the reparation of which is the first thing designed by the offended party: Though it take not up the whole nature of punishment. And on this account no man can justly propose any end to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in anothers evil, but what comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of restitution. For the evil of another is only intended in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as it respects the good of him for whose sake that evil is undergone. When that good may be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anothers evil, the desire of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just and unreasonable: and therefore all that contentment that any one takes in the evil another undergoes, as it is evil to him, is a thing repugnant to humane nature, and which all persons condemn in others when they allow themselves in it. It will be hard for <hi>Crellius</hi> to make any difference between this end of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which he assigns, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cruelty; for what can that be worse than taking delight in making others miserable, and seeing them so when he hath made them.

For there can be no reason at all assigned for it; for that <hi>lenimentum doloris</hi> which <hi>Crellius</hi> insists on is meerly imaginary, and no other than the Dog hath in gnawing the stone that is thrown at him; and for all that I know, that propension in nature to the retribution of evil for evil any further than it tends to our security, and the preservation for the future, is one of the most unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Passions in humane Nature.</p>

notion, although the Governour may be justly offended at the neglect of them.

For the first design of the Law was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any evil being done, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coming in by way of Sanction to the force of the Law, must have the same primary end which the Law it self had; which is not to satisfie barely the offended party for the breach, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that satisfaction tends to the security of the Law, and preventing the violation of it for the future. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what I have said upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, may be thus briefly comprized, That antecedently to Laws, the offended party hath right to no more than bare reparation of the damage sustained by the injury; that the proper notion of punishment is consequent to Laws, and the inflicting of it is an act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is not designed for meer satisfaction of the anger of the injured

person, but for the publick good, which lies in preserving the authority of the Laws, the preventing all injuries by the security of mens just rights, and the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the dignity and honour of him, who is to take care of the publick good. For these <hi>Crellius</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, to be <hi>the just ends of punishments,</hi> only he would have the satisfaction a man takes in anothers evil, to come in the first place; wherein how much he is mistaken,<note place="margin">

But he hath not thought fit to explain how such new motions or inclinations in the divine nature every time sin is committed, are consistent with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability and perfection of it; nor what such a kind of desire to punish in God imports, whether a meer inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the effect, or an inclination with the effect following: if <hi>without the effect,</hi> then either because the sin was not great enough, or God's honour was not concerned to do it, and in this case the same reasons which make the effect not to follow, make the desire of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the divine wisdom and perfection: or else because the effect is hindred by the repentance of the person, or some other way which may make it not necessary to do it; then upon the same reason the effect is suspended, the inclination to do it should be so too; for that must be supposed to be governed by an eternal reason and counsel as well as his actions; unless some natural pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in <hi>God</hi> be supposed antecedent to his own wisdom and counsel, which is derogatory to the infinite perfection of God, since those are judged imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in our selves: if it be taken only

by the sufferings of Christ, then we can never prove the doctrine of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be true; whereas we do not mean by God's anger any such passion, but the just declaration of God's will to punish upon our provocation of him by our sins; we do not make the design of satisfaction to be, that God may please himself in the revenging the sins of the guilty upon the most innocent person; because we make the design of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to be the satisfaction of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger as a desire of revenge, but to be the vindication of the honour and rights of the injured person, by such a way as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall judge most satisfactory to the ends of his Government.</p>

of another Life,</hi> which must chiefly respect the vindication of God's glory, in the punishment of unreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sinners. And this we do not deny to be a just punishment, since our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries themselves, as well as we, make it necessary. But we are not to understand, that the end of Divine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments doth so respect the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as though God himself were to be excluded out of it; for we are so to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, as made up of God as the Governour, and mankind as the persons governed, whatever then tends to the vindication of the rights of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Sovereignty, tends to the good of the whole, because the manifestation of that end is so great an end of the whole.</p>

But withal, though we assert in the life to come, the ends of punishment not to be the reclaiming of sinners, who had never undergone them, unless they had been unreclaimable; yet a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence must be made between the ends of punishments in that, and in this present state. For the other is the <hi>Reserve,</hi> when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else will do, and therefore was not primarily intended; but the proper ends of punishment, as a part of Government,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37433:54"/>
are to be taken from the design of them in this life. And here we assert, that God's end in punishing, is the advancing his Honour, not by the meer miseries of his creatures, but that men by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his severity against sin, should break off the practice of it, that they may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the punishments of the future state. So that the ends of punishment here, are quite of another kind, from those of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life; for those are inflicted, because persons have been unreclaimable by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the mercies or punishments of this life; but these are intended, that men should so far take notice of this severity of God, as to avoid the sins which will expose them to the wrath to come. And from hence it follows, That whatsoever sufferings do answer all these ends of Divine punishments, and are inflicted on the account of sin, have the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of punishments in them, and God may accept of the undergoing them as a full <hi>satisfaction</hi> to his Law, if they be such as tend to break men off from sin, and assert God's right, and vindicate his Honour to the world; which are the ends assigned by <hi>Crellius,</hi> and will be of great consequence to us in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

They acknowledge, <hi>that Christ died for us,</hi> but <hi>not in our stead,</hi> but <hi>for our advantage;</hi> that there was a <hi>commutation</hi>; but not such a one, as that the Son of God did lay down his blood as a <hi>proper price</hi> in order to our redemption as the <hi>purchase</hi> of it; when they speak of a <hi>moving cause,</hi> they tell us, they mean no more than <hi>the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any condition</hi> may be said <hi>to move,</hi> or as our prayers and repentance do. The <hi>reconciliation</hi> they speak of, doth not at all respect <hi>God</hi> but <hi>us</hi>; they assert <hi>an expiation of sins</hi> consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of Christ, but not depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon it any otherwise, than as a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> necessary for his admission to the office of a High Priest in Heaven, there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37433:57"/>
to expiate our sins by his power, and not by his blood; but they utterly deny, that the death of Christ is to be considered as a <hi>proper expiatory sacrifice for sin;</hi> or that it hath any further influence upon it, than as it is considered as a means of the confirmation of the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and particularly the promise of remission of sins, on which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not on the death of Christ they say our remission depends; but so far as the death of Christ may be an argument to us to believe his Doctrine, and that faith may incline us to obedience, and that obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition in order to pardon, at so many removes they make the death of Christ to have influence on the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our sins. They assert, <hi>that God took occasion by the sins of men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise an act of dominion upon Christ in his sufferings, and that the sufferings of Christ were intended for the taking away the sins of men;</hi> but they utterly deny, <hi>that the sufferings of Christ were to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a punishment for sin; or that Christ did suffer in our place and stead;</hi> nay, they contend with great vehemency, <hi>that it is wholly inconsistent with the justice of God to make one mans sins the meritorious cause of anothers punishment; especially one whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

innocent, and so that the guilty shall be freed on the account of his sufferings.</hi> Thus I have endeavoured to give the true state of the controversie with all clearness and brevity. And the substance of it will be reduced to these two debates.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether the sufferings of Christ in general are to be considered <hi>as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin,</hi> or as <hi>a meer act of dominion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whether the death of Christ in particular were <hi>a proper expiatory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sin,</hi> or only <hi>an antecedent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his exercise of the Office of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in Heaven</hi>?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. (1.) Whether the sufferings of Christ in general are to be considered as a punishment of sin,<note place="margin">Whether the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin.</note> or as a meer act of dominion? for that it must be one or the other of these two, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by our Adversaries; for the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those sufferings upon Christ, must either proceed from an antecedent meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cause, or not. If they do, they are then punishments; if not, they are meer exercises of power and dominion; whatever ends they are intended for, and whatever recompence be made for them. So <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts,<note place="margin">

But we must yet further enquire into their meaning, for though here <hi>Crellius</hi> attributes the sufferings of Christ meerly to God's <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> without any respect to sin, yet elsewhere he will allow a respect that was had to sin antecedently to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

And although <hi>Socinus</hi> in one place utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies <hi>any lawful antecedent cause of the death of Christ, besides the will of God and Christ,</hi> yet <hi>Crellius</hi> in his Vindication saith, <hi>by lawful cause,</hi> he meant <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> or such upon supposition of which <hi>he ought to die;</hi> for elsewhere he makes <hi>Christ to die for the cause, or by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our sins;</hi> which is the same that <hi>Crellius</hi> means by an <hi>impulsive,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartick cause.</hi> Which he thus explains, <hi>we are now to suppose a decree of God not only to give salvation to Mankind,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell. c.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</note> 
                        <hi>but to give us a firm hope of it in this present state, now our sins by deserving eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, do hinder the effect of that decree upon us, and therefore they were an impulsive cause of the death of Christ, by which it was effected, that this decree should obtain not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our sins. But we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand as tho' this were done by any expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the guilt of sin by the death of Christ; but this effect is hindred by three things, by taking away their sins, by assuring men that their former sins, and present infirmities upon their sincere obedience shall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, and that the effect of that decree shall obtain, all which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37433:59"/>
effected</hi> morte Christi interveniente, <hi>the death of Christ intervening, but not as the procuring cause.</hi> So that after all these words he means no more by making our sins <hi>an impulsive cause of the death of Christ,</hi> but that the death of Christ was an argument to confirm to us the truth of his Doctrine, which doctrine of his doth give us assurance of these things: and that our sins when they are said to be <hi>the impulsive cause,</hi> are not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with a respect to <hi>their guilt,</hi> but to that <hi>distrust of God</hi> which our sins do raise in us; which distrust is in truth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this sense of <hi>Crellius the impulsive cause,</hi> and not the <hi>sins</hi> which were the cause or occasion of it. For that was it which the doctrine was designed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, and our sins only as the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>es of that. But if it be said, <hi>that he speaks not only of the distrust, but of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin as an impediment which must be removed too, and therefore may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an impulsive cause,</hi> we are to consider that the removal of this is not attributed to the death of Christ, but to the leaving of our sins by the belief of his Doctrine; therefore the punishment of our sins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, unless in a very remote sense, be said to be an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of that, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37433:59"/>
for all that we can observe by <hi>Crellius,</hi> might as well have been done without it; if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ny other way could be thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ent to confirm his Doctrine, and Christ, without dying, might have had power to save all them that obey him. But we understand not an impulsive cause in so remote a sense, as though our sins were a <hi>meer occasion of Christs dying,</hi> because the death of Christ was one argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others to believe his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the belief of which would make men leave their sins; but we contend for a nearer and more proper sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that the death of Christ was primarily intended for the <hi>expiation of our sins,</hi> with a respect to <hi>God</hi> and not to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our sins as an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> are to be considered as they are so displeasing to God, that it was necessary for the Vindication of God's Honour, and the deterring the world from sin, that no less a Sacrifice of Atonement should be offered, than the blood of the Son of God. So that we understand an <hi>impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive cause</hi> here in the sense, that the sins of the people were, under the Law, the cause of the offering up those Sacrifices, which were appointed for the expiation of them. And as in those Sacrifices
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37433:60"/>
there were two things to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi> the mactation, and the oblation of them, the former as a <hi>punishment</hi> by a substitution of them in place of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who had offended; the latter as the proper Sacrifice of Atonement, although the mactation it self, considered with the design of it, was a Sacrificial act too: So we consider the sufferings of Christ with a two-fold respect, either as <hi>to our sins,</hi> as the impulsive cause of them, so they are to be considered as a <hi>punishment,</hi> or as <hi>to God,</hi> with a design to expiate the guilt of them, so they are a <hi>Sacrifice of Atonement.</hi> The first consideration is that we are now upon, and upon which the present debate depends, for if the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ be to be taken under the notion of <hi>punishment,</hi> then our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries grant, that our sins must be an impulsive cause of them in another sense than they understand it. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, I shall prove these two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That no other sense ought to be admitted of the places of <hi>Scripture</hi> which speak of the sufferings of Christ with a respect to sin, but this.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That this <hi>Account</hi> of the sufferings of Christ, is no ways repugnant to the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:37433:60"/>III. That no other sense ought to be admitted of the places of Scripture,<note place="margin">The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ proved to be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. 1 Pet. 2.24. Isa. 53.4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. Rom. 4.25.</note> which speak of the sufferings of Christ with a respect to our sins, but that they are to be considered as a punishment for them. Such are those which speak of <hi>Christ bearing our sins, of our iniquities being laid upon him, of his making himself an offering for sin, and being made sin and a curse for us, and of his dying for our sins.</hi> All which I shall so far consider, as to vindicate them from all the exceptions which <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> have offered against them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Those which speak of <hi>Christ's bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our sins.</hi> As to which we shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, First, The importance of the phrase in general of bearing sin, and then the circumstances of the particular places in dispute.

                        <hi>that it generally signifies bearing the punishment of sin in Scripture: but that sometimes it signifies taking away.</hi>

                           <hi>Crell. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 32.</note> The same is confessed by <hi>Crellius,</hi> but he saith, <hi>it doth not always signifie bearing proper punishment, but it is enough</hi> (says he) <hi>that one bears something burdensome on the occasion of others sins: and so Christ by undergoing his sufferings by occasion of sins, may be said to bear our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37433:61"/>
sins.</hi> And for this sense he quotes <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.33. <hi>And your Children shall wander in the Wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the Wilderness. Whereby,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is not meant that God would punish the Children of the</hi> Israelites, <hi>but that by the occasion of their parents sins, they should undergo that trouble, in wandring in the Wilderness, and being deprived of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the promised Land.</hi> But could <hi>Crellius</hi> think that any thing else could have been imagined, (setting aside a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal destruction) a greater instance of God's severity, than that was to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> all their circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being considered?<note place="margin">Psal. 95.11. Heb. 3.11.</note> Is it not said, that <hi>God did swear in his wrath, they should not enter into his rest</hi>? Surely then the debarring them so long of that rest, was an instance of God's wrath, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own principles must have something of <hi>Vindicta</hi> in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a proper punishment. The truth is, our Adversaries allow themselves in speaking things most repugnant to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in this matter of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they may justifie their own <hi>hypothesis.</hi> For a whole Nation to be for forty years debarred from the greatest
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37433:61"/>
blessings were ever promised them; and instead of enjoying them, to endure the miseries and hardships of forty years travels in a barren wilderness, must not be thought a punishment, and only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause occasioned by their Parents sins. But whatever is inflicted on the account of sin, and with a design to shew God's severity against it, and thereby to deter others from the practice of it, hath the proper notion of punishment in it; and all these things did concurr in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, besides the general sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the matter of their punishment, which was such, that supposing them preserved in their liberty, could not have been imagined greater. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Vatablus,</hi> whom <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> highly commend, thus renders those words,<note place="margin">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37433:62"/>
true to his principle, that one cannot be punished for anothers faults,) he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very pleasant discourse, <hi>That the Beasts are not said to be punished for mens sins, but for their own, and therefore when it is said, before the flood, that all flesh had corrupted his way;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 6.12.</note> 
                        <hi>he will by no means have it understood only of men, but that the sins of the beasts at that time, were greater than ordinary, as well as mens.</hi> But he hath not told us what they were, whether by eating some forbidden herbs; or entring into conspiracies against man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind their lawful Sovereigns, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mixtures; and therefore we have yet reason to believe, that when God saith, <hi>the ground was cursed for man's sake,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 8.21.</note> that the beasts were punished for mans sin. And if <hi>all flesh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 40.5.</note> must comprehend <hi>beasts</hi> in this place, why shall not <hi>all flesh see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of the Lord,</hi> take in the beasts there too? for <hi>Vatablus</hi> parallels this place with the other. <hi>But if,</hi> saith <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, any shall contend that some beasts at least were innocent, then,</hi> he saith, <hi>that those though they were destroyed by the flood, yet did not suffer punishment, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a calamity by occasion of the sins of men.</hi> I wonder he did not rather say, that the innocent beasts were taken into the Ark,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37433:63"/>
for the propagation of a better kind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. But by this solemn distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> there is nothing so miserable, that either men or beasts can undergo, but when it serves their turn, it shall be only a calamity and no punishment, though it be said to be on purpose to shew God's severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sins of the world. And this excellent notion of the <hi>beasts being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for their own sins,</hi> is improved by him to the vindication of the <hi>Scape-Goat</hi> from being <hi>punished, because then,</hi> saith he, <hi>the most wicked and corrupt Goat should have been made choice of.</hi> As though all the design of that great day of expiation had been only to call the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> together with great solemnity; to let them see, how a poor Goat must be punished for breaking the Laws which we do not know were ever made for them. I had thought our Adversaries had maintained that the Sacrifices (on the day of expiation at least) had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and typified the Sacrifice which was to be offered up by Christ; and so <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> elsewhere contend: he needed not therefore have troubled himself concerning the sins of the Goat,<note place="margin">Lev. 16.21.</note> when it is expresly said, <hi>That the sins of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37433:63"/>
the people were put on the head of the Goat</hi>; Whatever then the punishment were, it was on the account of the sins of the people, and not his own. But <hi>Crellius</hi> urgeth against <hi>Grotius, that if the Scape-Goat had been punished for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of the sins of the people, that should have been particularly expressed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piure, whereas nothing is said there at all of it, and that the throwing down the Scape-Goat from the top of the rock, was no part of the Primitive Institution, but one of the superstitions taken up by the Iews in after-times, because of the Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the return of it; and although we should suppose (which is not probable) that it should die by famine in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet this was not the death for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was to be by the shedding of blood.</hi> To this therefore I answer, 1. I do not insist on the customs of the later Jews to prove from thence any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment designed by the primitive institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For I shall easily yield, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny superstitions obtained among them aftewards about the Scape-Goat; as the stories of the red list turning white up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of it, the booths and the causey made on purpose, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things mentioned in the Rabbinical

So uncertain are our Adversaries, in affixing any sense upon these words, which may attribute any effect at all, to the death of Christ upon the Cross. For if they be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of taking away sins, then they are only to be meant of the power that was in the death of Christ, to perswade men to leave their sins; which we must have a care of understanding so, as to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any effect to the death of Christ in order to it; but only that the death of Christ was an argument for us to believe what he said, and the believing what he said would incline us to obey him, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37433:69"/>
if we obey him, we shall leave off our sins whether Christ had died or no: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his miracles had the same effect on us, which those of <hi>Moses</hi> had upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> which were sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to believe and obey without his death. But if this be all that was meant by Christ's <hi>bearing our sins in his body on the tree</hi>; why might not St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself be said to bear them upon his Cross too? for his death was an excellent example of patience, and a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perswade men he spake truth, and that doctrine which he preached, was repentance and remission of sins: So that by this sense there is nothing peculiar attributed to the <hi>death of Christ.</hi> But taking the other sense for the <hi>taking away the punishment of sins,</hi> we must see how this belongs to the death of Christ: Do they then attribute our delivery from the punishment of sin, to the death of Christ on the <hi>Cross</hi>? yes, just as we may attribute <hi>Caesar</hi>'s subduing <hi>Rome,</hi> to his passing over <hi>Rubicon,</hi> because he took that in his way to the doing of it: so they make the death of Christ only as a passage, in order to expiation of sins, by taking away the punishment of them. For that shall not be actually perfected,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37433:69"/>
they say, till his full deliverance of all those that obey him, from hell and the grave, which will not be till his second coming. So that if we only take <hi>the body</hi> of Christ for his <hi>second coming,</hi> and the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ, or the <hi>tree,</hi> for his <hi>Throne of Glory,</hi> then they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Christ may very well be said <hi>to take away sins in his own body on the tree:</hi> but if you take it in any sense that doth imply any peculiar efficacy to the death of Christ, for all the plainness of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, they by no means will admit of it.</p>

was spoken by Isaias,</hi> &amp;c. To which I answer: 1. It is granted by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> in those words, doth not give the full sense of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> but only applies that by way of accommodation, to bodily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which was chiefly intended for the sins of men. And in a way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation it is not unusual to strain words beyond their genuine and natural signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or what was intended primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the person who spake them. Would it be reasonable for any to say that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies <hi>to give,</hi> because that place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.18. where the word by all is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to signifie <hi>to receive,</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>to give, Eph.</hi> 4.8. so that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting another sense of the word here, as applied to the cure of bodily diseases, it doth not from thence follow, that this should be the meaning of the word in the primary sense intended by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> 2. The word as used by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> is very capable of the primary and natural sense; for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> retains words of the same signification, with that which we contend for, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>, neither of which doth signifie taking away, by causing a thing not to be. So that all that is implied hereby,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37433:71"/>
is the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>took</hi> in the healing of the sick. For to that end, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well observes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that place, the circumstances are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>That it was at even, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were brought to him in St.</hi> Matthew,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.16.</note> that <hi>after Sun set all that were diseased were brought, and all the City was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at the door, in St.</hi> Mark;<note place="margin">Mat. 1.32, 33.</note> 
                        <hi>That he departed not till it was day, in St.</hi> Luke;<note place="margin">Luk. 4.42.</note> that we might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how our Saviour did <hi>bear our griefs,</hi> because the pains he took in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them were so great. And here I cannot but observe, that <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Notes on that place, continued still in the same mind he was in, when he writ against <hi>Socinus</hi>; for he saith,
<q>Those words may either refer to the diseases of the body, and so they note the pains he took in the cure of them; or to our sins, and so they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled when Christ by suffering upon the Cross, did obtain remission of sins for us, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.</q>
But upon what reason the <hi>Annotations</hi> on that place come to be so different from his sense expressed here, long after <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> his answer, I do not understand. But we are sure he declared his mind, as to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37433:72"/>

To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That whatever answers to the ends of an <hi>exemplary punishment,</hi> may properly be called so: but supposing that Christ suffered the punishment of our sins, those sufferings will answer to all the ends of an exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the ends of such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37433:76"/>
assigned by <hi>Crellius</hi> himself, are,
<q>That others observing such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may abstain from those sins which have brought it upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who suffers.</q>
Now the question is, whether supposing Christ did suffer on the account of our sins, these suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his may deterr us from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of sin or no? And therefore in opposition to <hi>Crellius,</hi> I shall prove these two things: 1. That supposing Christ suffered for our sins, there was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument to deterr us from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of sin. 2. Supposing that his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had no respect to our sins, they could not have that force to deterr men from the practice of it: for he after as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, <hi>That Christ's sufferings might be a <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> to us, though they were no punishment of sin.</hi> 1. That the death of Christ considered as a punishment of sin, is a proper <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or hath a great force to deterr men from the practice of sin: and that because the same reason of punishment is supposed in Christ and in our selves, and because the example is much more considerable, than if we had suffered our selves. 1. The same reason of punishment is supposed. For why are men deterred
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37433:76"/>
from sin, by seeing others punished; but because they look upon the sin as the reason of the punishment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the same reason holds, the same ends may be as properly obtained. If we said that Christ suffered death meerly as an innocent person out of God's dominion over his life; what imaginable force could this have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr men from sin, which is asserted to have no relation to it as the cause of it? But when we say, that <hi>God laid our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities upon him,</hi> that he suffered not upon his own account but ours, that the sins we commit against God were the cause of all those bitter Agonies which the Son of, God underwent, what argument can be more proper to deterr men from sin than this is? For hereby they see the great abhorrency of sin which is in God, that he will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the sins of men without a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation made to his Honour, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to the world of his hatred of it. Hereby they see what a value God hath for his Laws, which he will not relax as to the punishment of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without so valuable a consideration as the blood of his own Son. Hereby they see, that the punishment of sin is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37433:77"/>
no meer arbitrary thing depending bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the will of God; but that there is such a connexion between sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment as to the ends of Government, that unless the Honour and Majesty of God, as to his Laws and Government ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be preserved, the violation of his Laws must expect <hi>a just recompence of reward</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereby they see what those are to expect who neglect or despise these sufferings of the Son of God for them; for nothing can then remain, but <hi>a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the Adversaries.</hi> So that, here all the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arguments concur which may be most apt to prevail upon men to deterr them from their sins. <hi>For if God did thus by the green tree, what will he do by the dry?</hi> If he who was so innocent in himself, so perfectly holy, suffered so much on the account of our sins; what then may those expect to suffer, who have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency at all to plead, and add wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and impenitency to their sins? But if it be replied by <hi>Crellius, that it is otherwise among men:</hi> I answer, that we do not pretend in all things to parallel the sufferings of Christ for us, with any sufferings of men for one another. But
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37433:77"/>
yet we add, that even among men the punishments inflicted on those who were themselves innocent as to the cause of them, may be as exemplary as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the greater appearance of severity there is in them, the greater terror they strike into all offenders. As Children's losing their estates and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or being banished for their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents treasons in which they had no part themselves. Which is a proper punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on them of their Father's faults, whether they be guilty or no? and if this may be just in men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why not in God? If any say, <hi>that the Parents are only punished in the Children,</hi> he speaks that which is contradictory to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense of mankind; for punishment doth suppose sense or feeling of it; and in this case the Parents are said to be punished, who are supposed to be dead and past feeling of it, and the Children who undergo the smart of it must not be said to be punished; though all things are so like it, that no person can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine himself in that condition, but would think himself punished, and severely too. If it be said, <hi>that these are calamities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but they are no proper punishments,</hi> it may easily be shewed that distinction
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37433:78"/>
will not hold here. Because these pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments were within the design of the Law, and were intended for all the ends of punishments, and therefore must have the nature of them. For therefore the Children are involved in the Father's punishment on purpose to deterr others from the like actions. There are some things indeed that Children may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by occasion of their Father's guilt, which may be only <hi>calamities</hi> to them, because they are ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>essary consequents in the nature of the thing, and not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely design'd as a punishment to them. Thus, being deprived of the comfort and assistance of their Parents, when the Law hath taken them off by the hand of justice: this was designed by the Law as a punishment to the Parents, and as to the Children it is only a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of their punishment. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Parents would have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for the Childrens faults, and not the Children only involved in that which unavoidably follows upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents punishment. So that <hi>Crellius</hi> is very much mistaken either in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case of our Saviour's punishment, or in the general reason of exemplary punishments, as among men. But the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37433:78"/>
case of our Saviour is more exemplary, when we consider the excellency of his person, though appearing in our nature, when no meaner sufferings would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, than of so transcendent a nature as he underwent, though he were the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God, this must make the punishment much more exemplary, than if he were considered only as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries do, as <hi>a mere man.</hi> So that the dignity of his person under all his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may justly add a greater considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deterr us from the practice of sin, which was so severely punished in him, when he was pleased to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our sins. From whence we see that the ends of a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

God's severity against those who are obstinate in sin; we ought the more diligently to attend to what is said for the clearing of it.
<q>
                           <hi>First,</hi> saith he, If God spared not his own most innocent and holy and only Son, than whom nothing was more dear to him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, but exposed him to so cruel and ignominious a death; how great and severe sufferings may we think God will inflict on wicked men, who are at open defiance with him?</q>
I confess my self not subtle enough to apprehend the force of this argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If God dealt so severely with him who had no sin either of his own or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to answer for; therefore he will deal much more severely with those that have. For God's severity considered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to sin, gives rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to sinners, than any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deterr them from it. For the natural consequence of it is, that God doth act arbitrarily, without any regard to the good or evil of mens actions; and therefore it is to no purpose to be solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about them. For upon the same account that the most innocent person suffers most severely from him, for all that we know, the more we strive to be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37433:79"/>
innocent, the more severely we may be dealt with, and let men sin, they can be but dealt severely with; all the difference then is, one shall be called <hi>punishments,</hi> and the other calamities, but the severity may be the same in both. And who would leave off his sins meerly to change the name of <hi>punishments</hi> into that of <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> And from hence it will follow, that the differences of good and evil, and the respects of them to punishment and reward, are but airy and empty things; but that God really in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of things to men, hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what men are or do, but acts therein according to his own Dominion, whereby he may dispose of men how or which way he pleases. If a Prince had many of his Subjects in open rebellion against him, and he should at that time make his most obedient and beloved Son to be publickly exposed to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of indignities, and be dishonoured and put to death by the hands of those rebels; could any one imagine that this was designed as an exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all rebels, to let them see the danger of rebellion? <hi>No,</hi> but would it not rather make them think him a cruel Prince, one that would punish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37433:80"/>
as much as rebellion; and that it was rather better to stand at defiance, and become desperate, for it was more dangerous to be beloved than hated by him, to be his Son than his declared E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy? so that insisting on the death of Christ as it is considered as a <gap reason="foreign">

For if we suppose him to be <hi>a meer man</hi> that suffered, then there could be no argument drawn from his sufferings to ours, but according to the exact proportion of sins and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but supposing that he had a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> as well as <hi>humane nature,</hi> there may not be so great a proportion of the sins of the world to the sufferings of Christ, as of the sins of a particular person to his own sufferings; and therefore the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37433:80"/>
from one to the other doth still hold. For the measure of punishments must be taken with a proportion to the dignity of the person who suffers them. And <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confesseth elsewhere,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that the severity of God against sinners may be discovered in the sufferings of Christ, because God's hatred against sin is discovered therein.</hi> But if we ask how God's hatred against sin is seen in the sufferings of one perfectly innocent and free from sin, and not rather his hatred of innocency, if no respect to sin were had therein: he answers, <hi>That God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred against sin was manifested, in that he would not spare his only Son to draw men off from sin.</hi> For answer to which, we are to consider the sufferings of Christ as an innocent person, designed as an exemplary cause to draw men off from sin; and let any one tell me, what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sin can possibly be discovered, in proposing the sufferings of a most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent person to them without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37433:81"/>
of sin as the cause of those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? If it be said, <hi>That the Doctrine of Christ was designed to draw men off from sin; and that God suffered his Son to die to confirm this Doctrine, and thereby shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hatred to sin.</hi> I answer, 1. This is carrying the dispute off from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent business, for we are not now argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the design of Christ's Doctrine, nor the death of Christ as a means to confirm that, but as a <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and what power that hath without respect to our sins as the cause of them, to draw us from sin, by discovering God's hatred to it. 2. The Doctrine of Christ accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>hypothesis,</hi> discovers much less of God's hatred to sin than ours doth. For if God may pardon sin without any compensation made to his Laws or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if repentance be in its own nature a sufficient satisfaction for all the sins past of our Lives; if there be no such a Justice in God which requires punishment of sin commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ted; if the punishment of sin depend barely upon God's will; and the most innocent person may suffer as much from God without respect to sin as the cause of suffering, as the most guilty; let any rational man judge whether this Doctrine discovers as much God's abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37433:81"/>
of sin, as asserting the necessity of vindicating God's honour to the World, upon the breach of his Laws, if not by the suffering of the offenders themselves, yet of the Son of God as a sacrifice for the expiation of sin, by undergoing the punishment of our iniquities, so as upon consideration of his sufferings, he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accept of repentance and sincere obedience, as the conditions upon which he will grant remission of sins, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. So that if the discovery of God's hatred to sin be the means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim men from it, we assert upon the former reasons, that much more is done upon our Doctrine concerning the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, than can be upon theirs.

                              <hi>Crell. c.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 60.</note> that by the name of sin, when applied to sufferings, any more should be implied, than that those sufferings were occasioned by sin, no more is there when it is applied to the person; nay, much less, for he saith, No more is required to this, but that he should be handled as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners use to be, and undergo the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of punishment, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to sin, either as the cause or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it. So he saith, The name
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37433:82"/>
                           <hi>Sinner</hi> is used, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.21. and in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the name of sin in the first clause is to be understood, as of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in the latter; and as we are said to be righteousness in him, when God deals with us as with righteous persons, so Christ was said to be sin for us, when he was dealt with as a sinner. And the Sacrifices for sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law were so called, not with a respect to the punishment of sin, but because they were offered upon the account of sin, and were used for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the guilt of it, or because men were bound to offer them, so that they sinned if they neglected it. So that all that is meant by <hi>Esaias</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, That Christ was made an expiatory Sacrifice, or that he exposed himself for those afflictions which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only by right undergo.</q>
But let <hi>Crellius</hi> or any others of them tell me, if the <hi>Scripture</hi> had intended to express, that the sufferings of Christ were a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our sins, how was it possible to do it more emphatically than it is done by these Expressions (the custom of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language being considered) not only by saying, that <hi>Christ did bear our sins,</hi> but, <hi>that himself was made sin for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37433:83"/>
us?</hi> those phrases being so commonly used for the punishment of sin. Let them produce any one instance in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where those expressions are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any without the consideration of sin: that place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.21. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from it; for in all probability, the design of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> in making <hi>Solomon King</hi> was already discovered, which was the reason that <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declaring himself <hi>King,</hi> invited not him with the rest of the <hi>King</hi>'s sons: All that she had for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s succession, was a secret promise and oath of <hi>David</hi>; and therefore she urgeth him now to <hi>declare the succession,</hi> v. 20. <hi>Otherwise,</hi> she saith, <hi>when David should die, I and my son So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon shall be accounted offenders</hi>; i. e. saith <hi>Crellius, we shall be handled as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, we shall be destroyed:</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not without the supposition of a fault; by them which should inflict that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon them: The plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, they should be accused of Treason, and then punished accordingly. But we are to consider, that still with a respect to them, who were the inflicters, a fault or sin is supposed as the reason of their punishment, either of their own or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But of our Saviour it is not said,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37433:83"/>
                        <hi>That he should be counted as an offender by the Iews</hi>; for although that doth not take away his innocency, yet it supposeth an accusation of something, which in it self deserves punishment. But in <hi>Esai.</hi> 53.10. it is said, <hi>He made his soul sin</hi>; and 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>That God made him sin for us,</hi> which must therefore imply, not being dealt with by men only as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that with a respect to him who inflicted the punishment, there was a consideration of sin as the reason of it. We do not deny but God's suffering him to be dealt with as a sinner by men, is implied in it, for that was the method of his punishment designed; but we say further, that the reason of that permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in God, doth suppose some antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cause of it: For God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have suffered his only Son, to be so dealt with by the hands of cruel men, unless he had made himself <hi>an offering for sin</hi>; being willing to undergo those sufferings, that he might be an expiatory Sacrifice for the sins of the world. And although <hi>Socinus</hi> will not yield,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Soc. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                        <hi>That by being made sin for us should be understood Christ's being an expiatory Sacrifice for sin</hi>; yet <hi>Crellius</hi> is contented <hi>it should be so taken in both places:</hi> Which if he
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37433:84"/>
will grant, so as by vertue of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the guilt of sin is expiated, we shall not contend with him about the reasons, why those Sacrifices were called <hi>sins,</hi> although the most proper and genuine must needs be that, which is assigned by the Law, that the sins of the people were supposed to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and therefore they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the expiation of them: But it is very unreasonable to say, <hi>That expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifices were called sins, because it would have been a sin to neglect them:</hi> For on the same account, all the other Sacrifices must have been called so too; for it was a sin to neglect any where God required them, and so there had been no difference between Sacrifices for sin and others. To that reason of <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, from our being made righteous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause dealt with as such, to Christ's being made sin only, because dealt with as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> we need no more than what this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel will afford us; For as <hi>Crellius</hi> would never say, that any are dealt with as righteous persons, who are not ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently supposed to be so by his own Argument, Christ being dealt with <hi>as a sinner,</hi> must suppose guilt antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to it; and since the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37433:84"/>
it was not his own, in those words, <hi>Who knew no sin,</hi> it follows that it must be the consideration of ours, which must make him be dealt with as a sinner by him, who made him to be sin for us. But to suppose that Christ should be said to be <hi>made sin,</hi> without any respect <hi>to sin,</hi> is as much as if the <hi>Latins</hi> should call any one <hi>Scelus,</hi> and mean thereby a very honest man; or a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any supposition of his own or others guilt. But we are to consider, that the sufferings of Christ, seeming at first so inconsistent with that relation to God as his only Son, which the Apostles assert concerning him, they were obliged to vindicate his innocency, as to men, and yet withal to shew, that with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God, there was sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for his permission of his undergoing these sufferings. That <hi>he knew no sin,</hi> was enough to clear his innocency as to men; but then the question will be asked, If he were so innocent, why did God suffer all those things to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> plead of old with God,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25.</note> 
                        <hi>That he would not slay the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the wicked,</hi> because it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the righteousness of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do so; <hi>That be far from thee to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37433:85"/>
do after this manner, to slay the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the wicked, and that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee; shall not the Iudge of all the Earth do right?</hi> How then comes God to suffer the most perfect innocency to be dealt with so, as the greatest sins could not have deserved worse from men? Was not his righteousness the same still? And <hi>Abraham</hi> did not think the distinction of <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi> enough to vindicate God's proceedings, if the righteous should have been dealt withal as the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if that would hold for such a measure of righteousness as might be supposed in such who were not guilty of the great abominations of those places, that it should be enough, not only to deliver themselves, but the wicked too; how comes it that the most perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Son of God, is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to excuse him from the greatest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Malefactors? But if his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings had been meerly from men, God had been accountable only for the bare permission; but it is said, that <hi>he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained and determined these things to be,</hi> that Christ himself complained, that <hi>God had forsaken him;</hi> and here, <hi>that he made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37433:85"/>
him sin for us:</hi> and can we imagine all this to be without any respect to the guilt of sin, as the cause of it? Why should such an expression be used of <hi>being made sin?</hi> might not many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have served sufficiently to declare the indignities and sufferings he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, without such a phrase as seems to reflect upon Christ's innocency? If there had been no more in these expressions than our Adversaries imagine, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were so careful of Christ's honour, they would have avoided such ill-sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expressions as these were; and not have affected <hi>Hebraisms,</hi> and uncouth forms of speech, to the disparagement of their Religion. But this is all which our Adversaries have to say, where words are used by them out of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense, <hi>That the Prophets and Apostles affected tricks of wit, playing with words, using them sometimes in one sense, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently quite in another.</hi>

this liberty of interpreting, they make words (without any other reason, than that they serve for their purpose) be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in several senses in the same verse: For <hi>Socinus</hi> in one verse of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, makes the <hi>World</hi> to be taken in three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral senses:<note place="margin">

                        <hi>He was in the World,</hi> there it is taken, saith he, for the men of the World in general: <hi>The world was made by him,</hi> there it must be understood only of the reformation of things by the Gospel: and, <hi>the world knew him not,</hi> there it must be taken in neither of the former senses, but for the wicked of the world: What may not one make of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by such a way of interpreting it? But by this we have the less reason to wonder, that <hi>Socinus</hi> should put such an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the curse of the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</hi> In which he doth acknowledge <hi>by the curse,</hi> in the first clause to be meant, <hi>the punishment of sin,</hi> but not in the second: And the reason he gives for it is, <hi>amavit enim Paulus in execrationis verbo argutus esse.</hi>

But it is plain that the design of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> are very different in these words: <hi>Socinus</hi> thinks he speaks only Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, when he saith, that <hi>Christ was made a curse for us; i. e.</hi> by a bare allusion of the name, without a correspondency in the thing it self; and so that the death of Christ might be called a curse, but was not so: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of this not by way of extenuation, but to set forth the greatness and weight of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he underwent for us. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tells us, what it was which Christ did redeem us from, <hi>The curse of the Law;</hi> and how he did it, <hi>by being not only made a curse, but a curse for us; i. e.</hi> not by being hateful to God, or undergoing the very same curse, which we should have done; which are the two things object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Crellius</hi> against our sense; but that the death of Christ was to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not as a bare separation of soul and body, but as <hi>properly poenal,</hi> being such a kind of death, which none but <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> were to suffer; by the undergoing of which punishment in our stead, he redeemed us from that <hi>curse</hi> which we were liable to by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law of God.

To this a short an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will at present serve: for, It is not possible a meritorious cause can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed more emphatically than by these words being joyned to sufferings: so that we have as clear a testimony from these expressions as words can give; and by the same arts by which these may be avoided any other might; so that it had not been possible for our Doctrine to have been expressed in such a manner, but such kind of answers might have been given as our Adversaries now give.
If it had been said in the plainest terms, <hi>that Christ's death was a punishment for our sins,</hi> they would as easily have avoided the force of them as they do of these; <q>they would have told us the Apostles delighted in an Antanaclasis, and had expressed things different from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use of the words by them; and though punishment were sometimes used properly, yet here it must be used only metaphorically because the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would bear no other sense.</q>
And
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37433:90"/>
therefore I commend the ingenuity of <hi>Socinus</hi> after all the pains he had taken to enervate the force of those places which are brought against his Doctrine;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Socin. de Servat. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> he tells us plainly,
<q>That if our Doctrine were not only once, but frequently mentioned in Scripture? yet he would not therefore believe the thing to be so as we suppose. For, <hi>saith he,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing it self cannot be, I take the least inconvenient interpretation of the words; and draw forth such a sense from them, as is most consistent with itself and the tenor of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</q>
But for all his talking of the tenor of the <hi>Scripture</hi>; by the same reason he interprets one place upon these terms, he will do many, and so the tenor of the <hi>Scripture</hi> shall be never against him: and by this we find, that the main strength of our Adversaries is not pretended to lie in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; all the care they have of them is only to reconcile them if possible with their <hi>hypothesis;</hi> for they do not deny but that the natural force of the words doth imply what we contend for; but because they say the Doctrine we assert is inconsistent with reason, therefore all their design is to find out any other possible meaning which they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37433:91"/>
therefore assert to be true, because more agreeable to the common reason of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This therefore is enough for our present purpose, that if it had been the design of Scripture to have expressed our sense, it could not have done it in plainer expressions than it hath done, that no expressions could have been used, but the same arts of our Adversaries might have been used to take off their force, which they have used to those we now urge against them, and that setting aside the possibility of the thing, the Scripture doth very fairly deliver the Doctrine we contend for; or, supposing in point of reason there may be arguments enough to make it appear possible, there are <hi>Scriptures</hi> enough to make it appear true.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I.</hi> The words of Scripture being at last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by our Adversaries to make for us, the only pretence remaining is, that our Doctrine is repugnant to reason. The debate managed upon point of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The grand difficulty enquired into, and manifested by our Adversaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions, not to lie in the greatness of Christ's sufferings, or that our sins were the impulsive cause of them, or that it is impossible that one should be punished for anothers faults: or in all cases un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just. <hi>II.</hi> The cases wherein <hi>Crellius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, instanced. From whence it is proved that he yields the main cause. <hi>III.</hi> The arguments propounded whereby he attempts to prove it unjust for Christ to be punished for our sins. <hi>Crellius</hi> his principles of the justice of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments examined. Of the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween desert and punishment. <hi>IV.</hi> That a person by his own consent may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished beyond the desert of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>V.</hi> An answer to <hi>Crellius</hi> his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. What it is to suffer undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly. <hi>Crellius</hi> his mistake in the state
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37433:92"/>
of the question. <hi>VI.</hi> The instances of Scripture considered. In what sense Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are punished for their Parents sins. <hi>VII. Ezek. 18.20.</hi> explained at large. <hi>VIII.</hi> Whether the guilty being freed from the sufferings of an innocent person makes that punishment unjust or no? <hi>Crellius</hi> his shifts and evasions in this matter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Why among men the offenders are not freed in criminal matters though the sureties be punished. The release of the party depends on the terms of the sureties suffering, therefore delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance not <hi>ipso facto.</hi> No necessity of such a translation in criminal, as is in pecuniary matters.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. HAving gained so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concessions from our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> concerning the places of <hi>Scripture,</hi>

And if there appear to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing repugnant in the nature of the thing, or to the justice of God, then all their loud clamours will come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for on that they fix, when they talk the most of our Doctrine being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reason. This therefore we now come more closely to examine, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37433:92"/>
to which we must carefully enquire what it is they lay the charge of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in God upon, according to our belief of Christ's sufferings being a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for our sins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is not, <hi>That the offenders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do not undergo the full punishment of their sins.</hi> For they assert, that there is no necessity at all that the offenders should be punished from any punitive justice in God: for they eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that God may freely pardon the sins of men: if so, then it can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice in God not to punish the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders according to the full desert of their sins.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is not, <hi>That God upon the sufferings of Christ doth pardon the sins of men:</hi> for they yield that God may do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any charge of injustice, and with the greatest demonstration of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For they acknowledge, that the sufferings of Christ are not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a bare antecedent condition to pardon, but that they were a <hi>moving cause</hi> as far as the obedience of Christ in suffering was very acceptable to God.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is not, <hi>that there is so necessary a relation between guilt and punishment, that it cannot be called a punishment which is inflicted on an innocent person.</hi> For <hi>Crellius,</hi> after a long discourse of the difference of afflictions and punishments, doth acknowledge,
<q>That it is not of

All this <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> acknowledgeth; who saith,
<q>They do not make it necessary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to the justice of punishment, that it be inflicted upon none but the person who hath offended. <hi>So by his own Confession,</hi> it is not against the nature of punishment,<note place="margin">

From whence it follows, that all <hi>Socinus</hi> his arguments signifie nothing, which are drawn from the impossibility of the thing, <hi>that one man should be punished for anothers faults</hi>; for <hi>Crellius</hi> grants the thing to be possible, but denies it to be just; yet not absolutely neither, but with some restrictions and limitations.

                        <hi>but that there may be sufficient causes assigned in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cases; wherein it may be just for God to punish some for the sins of others.</hi> For <hi>Crellius</hi> himself hath assigned divers.
<q>When there is such a near conjunction between them, that one may be said to be punished in the punishment of another:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Quia Deus hunc puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo illum quoque al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum ob cujus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti eum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, simul pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire possit, ob arctiorem quae inter illos inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctionem.</hi> Crell. ib.

1. <hi>At the greatest distance of time, if they have been of the same Nation</hi>; for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to the utmost degree of God's patience towards a people;
<q>For, <hi>saith he,</hi> God doth not presently punish as soon as they have sinned; but spares for a great while, and forbears, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of their repentance, in the mean while a great many guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons die, and seem to have escaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. But at last the time of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s patience being past, he punisheth their Posterity by exacting the full pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of their sins upon them, and by this means punisheth their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37433:95"/>
too, and punisheth their sins in their punishment; for, <hi>saith he,</hi> all that people are reckoned for one man of several Ages, and that punishment which is taken of the last, may be for the sins of the first, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and succession of them: of which we have an example, <hi>saith he,</hi> in the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                        </q>
By which we see a very remote conjunction, and a mere similitude in comparing a succession of Ages in a people with those in a man, may (when occasion serves) be made use of to justifie God's punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Generation of men for the sins of others that have been long before. 2. <hi>When sins are more secret or less remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able which God might not punish, unless an occasion were given from others sins impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to it;</hi> but because God would punish one very near them, he therefore punisheth them, that in their punishment he might punish the other. Or in case sins spread through a Family or a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or they are committed by divers persons at sundry times, which God doth not severely punish, but sometimes then, when the Head of a People or Family hath done something which remarkably deserves punishment, whom he will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37433:95"/>
in those he is related to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally punisheth the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or People. 3. <hi>That which may be a meer exercise of dominion as to some, may be a proper punishment to others;</hi> as in the case of <hi>Infants,</hi> being taken away for their <hi>Parents</hi> sins; <hi>For God, as to the Children,</hi> he saith, <hi>useth only an act of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but the punishment only redounds to the Parents, who lose them; and though this be done for the very end of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet he denies, <hi>that it hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Punishment in any but the Parents.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell. ib. sect.</hi> 11. <hi>sect.</hi> 19.</note> 4. <hi>That punishment may be intended for those who can have no sense at all of it;</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts in the case of <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>sons,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.8, 14. that the punishment was mainly intended for <hi>Saul,</hi> who was already dead. From these concessions of <hi>Crellius</hi> in this case, we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, 1. That a remote conjunction may be sufficient for a translation of penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> from one Generation to another. 2. That sins may be truly said to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in others, when the offenders themselves may escape punishment, thus the sins of Parents in their Children, and Princes in their Subjects. 3. That an act of dominion in some may be design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a proper punishment to others.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37433:96"/>
4. That the nature of punishment is not to be measured by the sense of it. Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these concessions, though our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries will not grant, that Christ was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly punished for our sins, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but that we may very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to be <hi>punished</hi> for our sins in <hi>Christ,</hi> and if they will yield us this, the other may be a strife about words. For surely there may be easily imagined as great a conjunction between Christ and us, as between the several Generations of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that last which was punished in the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and though we escape that punishment which Christ did undergo, yet we might have our sins punished in him, as well as Princes theirs in their Subjects, when they escape themselves; or rather as Subjects in an innocent Prince, who may suffer for the faults of his people; if it be said, <hi>that these are acts of meer domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as to such a one,</hi> that nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but granting it, yet our sins may be said to be punished in him; as well as Parents sins are punished properly in meer acts of dominion upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if it be said, <hi>that can be no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where there is no sense at all of it,</hi> that is fully taken off by <hi>Crellius;</hi> for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37433:96"/>
surely we have as great a sense of the sufferings of Christ, as the first Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Iews</hi> had of the sufferings of the last, before the fatal destruction of the City, or as <hi>Saul</hi> had of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Sons after his death. So that from <hi>Crellius</hi> his own concessions, we have proved, that <hi>our sins may very properly be said to be punished in Christ,</hi> although he will not say, that Christ could be properly punished for our sins; nay he and the rest of our Adversaries not only deny it, but earnestly contend, that it is very unjust to suppose it, and repugnant to the rectitude of God's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do it.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. And so we come to consider the mighty arguments that are insisted on for the proof of this,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crellius</hi> his arguments propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> which may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to these three; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That there can be no punishment but what is deserved, but no man can deserve that another should be punished.</hi> 2. <hi>That punishment flows from revenge, but there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge where there hath been no fault.</hi> 3. <hi>That the punishment of one, cannot any ways be made the punishment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in case it be supposed possible, then those in whose stead the other is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, must be actually delivered upon the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37433:97"/>
payment of that Debt which was owing to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That one man cannot deserve anothers punishment,</hi> and therefore one cannot be punished for another; for there is no just punishment, but what is deserved. This being the main Argument insisted on by <hi>Crellius,</hi> must be more carefully consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; but before an answer be made to it, it is necessary that a clear account be given in what sense it is he understands it, which will be best done, by laying down his principles, as to the justice of punishments, in a more distinct method than himself hath done; which are these following: 1. That no person can be justly punished, either for his own or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers faults, but he that hath deserved to be punished by some sin of his own: For he still asserts,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell. c.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 239, 240.</note>
                        <q>That the justice of punishment ariseth from a mans own fault, though the actual punishment may be from anothers: But he that is punished without respect to his own guilt, is punished undeservedly; and he that is punished undeservedly, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unjustly.</q>
2. That personal guilt being supposed one man's sin may be the <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of another's punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but they cannot be the <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:37433:97"/>
The difference between them he thus explains,
<q>The cause is that which makes a thing to be; the impulsive, that which moves one to do a thing, without any consideration of right that one hath to do it: Merit, is that which makes a man worthy of a thing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, and so gives a right to it; if it be good, to himself; if bad, to him at whose hands he hath deserved it.</q>
Now he tells us, that it is impossible.
<q>That one mans sins should make any other deserve punishment, but the person who committed them; but they may impell one to punish ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that justly, if the person hath otherwise deserved to be punished, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly if he hath not.</q>
The reason he gives of it is,
<q>That the vitiosity of the act, which is the proper cause of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, cannot go beyond the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the offender; and therefore can oblige none to punishment, but him that hath committed the fault.</q>
And therefore he asserts,
<q>That no man can be justly punished beyond the desert of his own sins, but there may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be a double impulsive cause of that punishment; <hi>viz.</hi> His own and other mens,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Crell. ib. sect.</hi> 18.</note> whereof one made that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37433:98"/>
they might be justly punished, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they should be actually: but the latter, <hi>he saith,</hi> always supposeth the former, as the foundation of just punishment; so that no part of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment could be executed upon him, wherein his own sins were not suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as the meritorious cause of it.</q>
These are his two main principles which we must now throughly examine, the main force of his Book lying in them. But if we can prove that it hath been generally received by the consent of mankind, that a person may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the desert of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; if God hath justly punished some for the sins of others, and there be no injustice in one mans suffering by his own consent for another, then these principles of <hi>Crellius</hi> will be found not so firm as he imagines them.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. 1. That it hath been generally received by the consent of mankind,<note place="margin">That a person by his own consent may be punished beyond the desert of his own actions. <hi>Grot. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisf. c.</hi> 4.</note> that a person may be justly punished beyond the desert of his own actions. For which purpose <hi>Grotius</hi> objected against <hi>Socinus</hi> (who appealed to the consent of Nations, about one being punished for anothers fault)
<q>That the Heathens did agree, that Children might be punished for

their Parents faults, and People for their Princes, and that corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment might be born by one for another, did appear by the <hi>Persians</hi> punishing the whole family for the fault of one.

In which cases, the punishment did extend beyond the desert of the person who suffered it; for no other reason is assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of these sufferings, besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the person, or his consent; but no antecedent guilt is supposed as necessary, to make the punishment just. We are now to consider what <hi>Crellius</hi> doth answer to this: 1. As to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37433:99"/>
of God's punishing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their Parents faults, he gives the same answer which he doth to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> to that purpose, <hi>That either they were punished for the sins of others, but their own sins deserved the punishment; or that the Parents were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in the Children, but the Children were not properly punished.</hi> 2. As to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments among men, he answers two things;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell c</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 244.</note>
                        <q>1. That such persons were truly punished, but not justly: for he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, That in such a case it is a proper punishment, and that it is enough in order to that, that any fault be charged upon a person, whether his own or anothers, whether true or false, on the account of which he is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed worthy to be punished: And that such a conjunction is sufficient for cruel, angry, or imprudent men: for where-ever there is a place, <hi>saith he,</hi> for anger, there is likewise for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</q>
So that he confesseth, there may be <hi>a true punishment,</hi> and that which answers all the reason and ends of punishment assigned by him where there is <hi>no desert</hi> at all of it in the person who undergoes it. But then he adds, <hi>that this is an unjust punishment,</hi> to which I reply,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37433:99"/>
That then the reason of punishment assigned by <hi>Crellius</hi> before is insufficient; for if this answers all the ends of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments assigned by him, and yet be unjust, then it necessarily follows, that those ends of punishment are consistent with the greatest injustice. For he before made punishment to have a natural respect to anger, and makes the ordinary end of punishment to be a satisfaction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenge in men, yet now grants, that these may be in an unjust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neither can it be said, <hi>that he considered punishment only naturally, and not morally</hi>; for he tells us, that <hi>this is the nature of divine punishments,</hi> which are therefore just, because designed for these ends; but in case there be no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of a fault at all, then he denies that it is a punishment, but only an affliction, and an exercise of dominion. So that according to him, where-ever there is a proper punishment, it must be just, when ever God doth punish men: and the only difference between God and man supposable in this case is, that we have assurance God will never use his dominion unjustly; but that men do so when they make one to suffer for anothers fault, notwithstanding a consent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37433:100"/>
between the man that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fault, and the person that suffers for him. But this is begging the thing in question, for we are debating, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an unlawful exercise of power or no? for we have this presumption, that it is not unlawful, because it may answer all the ends of punishments, and what way can we better judge, whether a punishment be just or no, than by that?</p>

And in this case we assert, since according to <hi>Crellius</hi> the natural and proper ends of punishments may be obtained, and the consent of the person takes away the wrong done to him in the matter of his sufferings, so far as he hath power over himself, that such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not unjust. For if it be, it must suppose some <hi>injury</hi> to be done; but in this case let them assign where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury lies; it cannot be to the <hi>publick,</hi> if the ends of punishments may be obtained
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37433:100"/>
by such a suffering of one for another by a valid consent of the suffering party, it cannot be to the <hi>person</hi> in <hi>whose room</hi> the other suffers, for what injury is that to escape punishment by anothers suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it cannot be to <hi>the suffering person,</hi> supposing that to be true, which the Heathens still supposed,<note place="margin">

may be said to be <hi>worthy</hi> to undergo it. <hi>But doth not this lay open the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to as great a desert of sufferings, as the highest guilt?</hi> By no means. For we make a lyableness to punishment, the natural consequent of guilt: and he that hath committed a fault, cannot but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> to be punished, so that no suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others can take away the natural consequence of a bad action, which is a <hi>desert of punishment</hi>; So that as we say, a wicked action cannot but deserve to be punished, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is an agreeableness in reason and nature, that he who hath done ill, should suffer ill; so we say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is necessity in nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he that hath thus deserved it, must unavoidably suffer it. And on the other side, we say, <hi>no man by his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency can deserve to be punished,</hi> i. e. no man's innocency makes him by vertue of that obnoxious to punishment; but yet we add, that <hi>notwithstanding his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,</hi> the circumstances may be such that he may be <hi>justly</hi> punished, and in that sense <hi>deservedly.</hi> So that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is strangely mistaken, when it is thus put, <hi>Whether an innocent person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as such, may be justly punished</hi>; for no one asserts that, or is bound to do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37433:101"/>
it; but the true question is, <hi>whether a person notwithstanding his innocency may not by some act of his own will oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to undergo that punishment which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he did not deserve? which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, in that case is just and agreeable to reason.</hi> And this is that which we assert and plead for.

If it be said, <hi>that the substitution is unjust, unless the substituted person hath before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand deserved to be punished</hi>; it is easily answered, that this makes not the matter at all clearer; for either the person is punished for the former fault, and then there is no substitution; or if he be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by way of substitution; then there is no regard at all had to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

                        <q>That God doth never punish them for their Parents faults beyond the desert of their own sins, and therefore no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be drawn from thence, that God may punish an innocent person for the sins of others, because he hath punished some for what they were innocent:</q>
For the force of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument doth not lie in the supposition of their innocency, as to the ground of punishment in general, for we do not deny, but that they may deserve to be punished for their own faults: but the argument lies in this, whether their own guilt were then considered as the reason of punishment, when God did punish them for their fathers faults? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they by their own sins did deserve to be punished not only with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due to their own miscarriages, but with the punishment due to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too?

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37433:102"/>
that punishment they undergo; if they did deserve it, then one person may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be punished for anothers sins. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crellius, that his own sins make him capable of punishment, and God by occasion of others sins doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute that punishment, which he might not have done for his own.</hi> I answer, we are not enquiring into the bare capacity of punishing, but into the reason of it: was the reason of punishment his own or his fathers sins? If his own, then he was punished only for his own sins? if his fathers, then the punishment may be just which is inflicted without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proper <hi>desert</hi> of it; <hi>for no man</hi> (say they) <hi>can deserve to be punished, but for his own sins.</hi> But it's said, <hi>that the sins of Fathers are only an impulsive cause for God to punish the Children accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the desert of their own sins which he might otherwise have forborn to punish.</hi> Then, the sins of the Fathers are no <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> why the Children should be punished; but their own sins are the <hi>reason,</hi> and their Fathers the <hi>bare occasion</hi> of being punished for them. But in <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>reason</hi> of punishment is drawn from the <hi>Fathers sins,</hi> and not from the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens:</hi> For then the words would have

not only for their own sins, but the sins of their <hi>Fathers:</hi> But lest they should think, they should be utterly consumed for their iniquities, and be no longer a people enjoying the Land which <hi>God</hi> had promised them, he tells them by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> though they had smarted so much, by reason of their <hi>Fathers</hi> sins, this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity should not always continue upon them; but that God would visit them with his kindness again, and would plant them in their own Land, then they should see no reason to continue this Proverb among them, for they would then find, <hi>Though their Fathers had eaten sowre grapes, their teeth should not be always set on edge with it.</hi> And if we observe it, the occasion of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Land of Israel, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.2.</note> than the other Versions do. So that the <hi>Land of Israel</hi> was the occasion of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> by their being banished out of it for their Fathers sins. Now God tells them, they should have no more occasion to use this Proverb concerning the <hi>Land of Israel</hi>; for they, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their Fathers sins, should return into their own <hi>Land.</hi> And even during
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37433:107"/>
the continuance of their captivity, they should not undergo such great severities for the future, but they should find their condition much more tolerable than they imagined; only, if any were guilty of greater sins than others, they should themselves suffer for their own faults, but he would not punish the whole Nation for them or their own Posterity. This I take to be the genuine meaning of this place; and I the rather embrace it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find such insuperable difficulties in other interpretations that are given of it: For to say as our Adversaries do, <hi>That what God saith, should not be for the future, was repugnant to his nature and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice ever to do,</hi> is to charge God plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with injustice in what he had done: For the <hi>Prophets</hi> told them they should suffer for the sins of their <hi>Fathers:</hi> Which sufferings were the ground of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint now, and the answer here given must relate to the occasion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; for God saith, <hi>They should not have occasion to use that Proverb:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is implyed, they should not have the same reason to complain which they had then. I demand then, Do not these words imply, That God would not do for the future with them, what he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37433:108"/>
if not, the proper answer had been a plain denial, and not a promise for the future he would not; if they do, then either <hi>God</hi> properly punished them for the sins of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and then God must be <hi>unjust</hi> in doing so, or it was just with <hi>God</hi> to do it, and so this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of overthrowing will prove, that some may be justly punished, beyond the desert of their own sins: or else, <hi>God did only take occasion by their Fathers sins, to punish them according to the desert of their own iniquities:</hi> But then they had no cause to complain, that they were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for any more than their own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and withal, then God doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himself by his promise here, never to punish men for the future <hi>by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of others sins:</hi> which is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own Doctrine, but to what is plainly seen afterwards in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Iews</hi> for their <hi>Fathers sins,</hi> mentioned by our <hi>Saviour</hi> after this:<note place="margin">Matt. 23.35.</note> And if this be a certain rule of equity which God here saith, that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vary from, then the punishing of some on the occasion of others sins, would be as unjust, as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> suppose the punishing any beyond the desert of their own sins to be. <hi>But is it not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37433:108"/>
implyed, that Gods ways would be unequal,</hi>

                        <hi>if he ever did otherwise than he there said he would do?</hi> No, it is not, if by <hi>equal</hi> he meant <hi>just,</hi> for his ways never were, or can be so unequal; but here if it be taken with a respect to the main dispute of the Chapter, no more is implied in them, but that they judged amiss concerning God's actions, and that they were <hi>just,</hi> when they thought them not to be so: or if at least they thought his ways ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry severe, though just, God by remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this severity, would shew that he was not only <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>kind</hi>; and so they would find his ways <hi>equal,</hi> that is, always agreeable to themselves, and ending in <hi>kindness</hi> to them, though they hitherto were so severe towards them in their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and captivity. Or if they be taken with a respect to the immediate occasion of them both, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.—33. They do not relate to this dispute about <hi>Childrens suffering for their Fathers sins</hi>;<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.20.</note> but to another, which was concerning a righteous mans sinning and dying in his sins, and a wicked mans repenting, and living in his righteousness; which were directly contrary to the common opinion of the <hi>Iews</hi> to this day, which is, that God will judge men according
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37433:109"/>
to the greatest number of their actions good or bad: as appears by <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others. Now they thought it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard case, for a man who had been righteous the far greatest part of his time, if he did at last commit iniquity, that his former righteousness should signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but he must die in his iniquity. To this therefore God answers, that it was only the inequality of their own ways, which made them think God's ways in doing so unequal. This then doth not make it unequal, for God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to punish men, upon the occasion, or by the desert of other mens sins, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing such a conjunction between them, as there is in the same body of people, to those who went before them.

                        <q>That it was never received by the consent of Nations, that one man should suffer in the stead of another, so as the guilty should be freed by the others suffering. For, <hi>he saith,</hi> neither <hi>Socinus</hi> nor he do deny that one man may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for anothers sins; but that which they deny is, that ever the innocent were punished so as the guilty were freed by it; <hi>and so he answers,</hi> in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37433:110"/>
case of Hostages and Sureties, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment did never excuse the offenders themselves. And to this purpose <hi>he saith, Socinus</hi> his argument doth hold good, that tho' one mans money may become anothers, yet one mans sufferings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become anothers: For, <hi>saith he,</hi> if it could, then it would be all one who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as it is who pays the money due: And then the offender must be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly released, as the Debtor is upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the debt.</q>
This is the substance of what is said by him upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To which I reply; 1. That this gives up the matter in dispute at present between us; for the present question is, Whether it be unjust for any one to suffer beyond the desert of his own actions? <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, it is, in case he suffers so, as that the guilty be freed by his sufferings.</hi> But we are not enquiring, Whether it be just for another person to be freed for a mans suffering for him? but whether it be just for that man to suffer by his own consent, more than <hi>his own</hi> actions, without that consent, deserved? The release of another person by vertue of his sufferings, is a matter of another consideration. Doth the freeing or not freeing of another by suffering, add any thing to the <hi>desert</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37433:110"/>
suffering? He that being wholly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and doth suffer on the account of anothers fault, doth he not suffer as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deservedly,</hi> though another be not freed, as if he were? As in the case of <hi>Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> or Sureties, doth it make them at all the more guilty, because the persons they are concerned for, will be punished notwithstanding, if they come under the power of those who exacted the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, who suffered for them? Nay, is not their <hi>desert</hi> of punishment so much the less, in as much as the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are still bound to answer for their own offences? If we could suppose the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be freed by the others sufferings, it would be by supposing their guilt more fully translated upon those who suffer, and consequently, a greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to punishment following that guilt. From whence it follows, that if it be just to punish, when the person is not deliver'd from whom the other suffers, it is more just when he is; for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the penalty is much less in the former case, than in the latter; and what is just upon less grounds of punishment, must be more just upon greater. I look on this therefore but as a shift of <hi>Crelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> hoping thereby to avoid the consent
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37433:111"/>
of mankind in one mans suffering for another, without attending to the main argument he was upon; <hi>viz.</hi> The justice of one person suffering for another. 2. It is a very unreasonable thing, to make an action unjust for that, which of it self is acknowledged by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> to be very just; <hi>viz.</hi> The pardoning the offenders themselves. If it were just to suffer, if the other were not pardoned, and it were just to pardon, whether the other were punished or no, how comes this suffering to be unjust, merely by the others being pardoned by it: nay, is it not rather an argument, that those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are the most just, which do so fully answer all the ends of punishments; that there is then no necessity that the offender should suffer; but that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour having obtained the ends of Government, by the suffering of one for the rest, declares himself so well pleased with it, that he is willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the offenders themselves. 3. Many of those persons who have had their sins punished in others, have themselves esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the punishment due to the desert of their sins: As is plain in the case of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> whose punishment was not so great as his sins deserved, because the full pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37433:111"/>
of them was reserved to his posterity. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, That</hi> Ahab <hi>was not wholly freed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>his life being taken away for his own sins:</hi> That gives no sufficient answer; for if some part of the punishment was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that part he was delivered from; and the same reason in this case will hold for the whole as the part. As is plain in the case of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the guilt of whose sins were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished on their posterity, themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaping it. 4 Our Adversaries confess, that in some cases it is lawful and just for some to suffer, with a design that others may be freed by their suffering for them. Thus they assert, <hi>That one Christian, not only may, but ought to lay down his life for another, if there be any danger of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the truth, or he judges him far more usefull and considerable than himself: so likewise a Son for his Father, one Brother for another, or a Friend, or any,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Crell cap.</hi> 6. <hi>sect.</hi> 39.</note> 
                        <hi>whose life he thinks more usefull than his own.</hi> Now I ask, whether a man can be bound to a thing that is <hi>in its one nature unjust?</hi> if not, as it is plain he cannot, then such an obligation of one man to suffer for the delivery of another cannot be unjust, and consequently the suffering it
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37433:112"/>
self cannot be so. But <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, <hi>The injustice in this case lies wholly upon the Magistrate who admits it:</hi> but I ask, wherefore is it unjust in the Magistrate to admit it? it is because the thing is in it self unjust? if so, there can be no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to do it; and it would be as great a sin to undergo it, as in the Magistrate to permit it; but if it be just in it self, we have obtained what we contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be just for a man to suffer beyond <hi>the desert</hi> of his own actions; for he that lays down his life for his Brethren, doth not deserve by his own actions that very punishment which he undergoes. And if the thing be in it self just, how comes it to be unjust in him that permits it? 5. The reason why among men the offenders themselves are punished, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those were not the terms, upon which the persons suffered. For if they had suffered upon these terms that the other might be freed, and their suffering was admitted of by the Magistrate on that consideration, then in all reason and justice the offenders ought to be freed on the account of the others suffering for them. But among men the chief reason of the obligation to punishment of one man for another, is not, that the other
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37433:112"/>
might be freed, but that there may be security given by the publick, that the offenders shall be punished: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sureties suffering is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the offender, but to satisfie the Law, by declaring that all care is taken that the offender should be punished, when in case of escape, the Surety suffers for him. But it is quite another thing when the person suffers purposely that others might be freed by his suffering, for then in case the suffering be admitted, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease of the other is not only not unjust, but becomes due to him that suffered, on his own terms. Not as though it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>ipso facto</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> fansies, but the manner of release doth depend upon the terms which he who suffered for them, shall make in order to it. For upon this suffering of one for another upon such terms, the immediate consequent of the suffering is not the <hi>actual discharge</hi> but the <hi>right</hi> to it which he hath purchased; and which he may dispense upon what terms he shall judge most for his honour. 6. Although one persons sufferings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not become anothers so as one mans <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> may; yet one mans sufferings may be a sufficient consideration on which a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit may accrue to another. For to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37433:113"/>
that end a Donation, or such a transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring right from one to another as is in <hi>Money,</hi> is not necessary, but the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which it hath from him who hath the power to pardon. If he declare that he is so well pleased with the sufferings of one for another, that in consideration of them, he will pardon those from whom he suffered; where lies the impossibility or unreasonableness of the thing? For <hi>Crellius</hi> g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>that rewards may be given to others than the persons who did the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in consideration of those actions</hi>; and why may not the sufferings of one for others, being purposely undertaken for this end, be available for the pardon of those whom he suffered for? For a man can no more transfer the right of his good actions, than of his sufferings. From all which it follows, that one person may by his own consent, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereto by him to whom the right of punishing belongs, suffer justly; tho' it be beyond the desert of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the guilty may be pardoned on the account of his sufferings. Which was the first thing we designed to prove from <hi>Crellius,</hi> in order to the overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>hypothesis.</hi> For it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by him that such sufferings have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:37433:113"/>
all that belongs to the nature of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and since God hath justly punished some for the sins which they have not committed; since all Nations have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it just for one man by his own consent to suffer for another; since it cannot be unjust for the offender to be released by anothers sufferings, if he were admitted to suffer for that end, it evidently follows, contrary to <hi>Crellius</hi> his main Principle, that <hi>a person may be justly punished beyond the desert of his own actions:</hi> And so that first argument of <hi>Crellius</hi> cannot hold, <hi>that one man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by his own consent suffer for another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man can deserve anothers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no punishment is just but what is deserved.</hi> His second argument from the nature of <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> hath been already answered in the first Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about the nature and ends of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, and his third argument, <hi>that one mans punishment cannot become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> immediately before. And so we have finished our first consideration of the <hi>sufferings of Christ</hi> in general, as <hi>a punishment of our sins,</hi> which we have shewed to be agreeable both to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

For it had been very unreasonable to have thought, that they had been merely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted out of compliance with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of other Nations, since the whole design of their Religion, was to separate them from them: and on such a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition the great design of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> signifies very little; which doth far more explain to us the nature and tendency of all the Sacrifices in use among them, that had any respect to the expiation of sins, than all the customs of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or the Commentaries of the later <hi>Iews.</hi> But I intend not now to discourse at large upon this subject of Sacrifices, either as to the nature and institution of them in general, or with a particular respect to the Sacrifice of Christ, since a learned person of our <hi>Church,</hi> hath already undertaken <hi>Crellius</hi> upon this Argument, and we hope e'er long will oblige the world with the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his pains.

For that those were designed by way of <hi>Substitution</hi> in the place of the offenders, will appear from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and reason of their Institution: But before we come to that, it will be necessary to shew what that <hi>Expiation</hi> was, which the Sacrifices under the Law were designed for; the not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, gives a greater force to our Adversaries Arguments, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they would have. For while men assert, that the expiation was wholly ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, and of the same nature with that expiation which is really obtained by the death of Christ, they easily prove, <hi>That all the expiation then, was only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:37433:116"/>
and did no more depend on the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered, than on a condition required by God, the neglect of which would be an act of disobedience in them; and by this means it could represent,</hi> say they, <hi>no more than such an expiation to be by Christ</hi>; viz. <hi>God's declaring that sins are expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, on the performance of such a condition required in order thereto, as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life was.</hi> But we assert another kind of expiation of sin, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrifice being slain and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which was real, and depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacrifice: And this was twofold a <hi>Civil,</hi> and a <hi>Ritual</hi> expiation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the double capacity in which the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> may be considered, either as members of a Society, subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a body of <hi>Laws,</hi> which according to the strictest <hi>Sanction</hi> of it, makes death the penalty of disobedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. but by the will of the Legislator, did admit of a relaxation in many cases, allowed by himself; in which he declares, That the death of the beast designed for a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> should be accepted, instead of the death of the offender; and so the offence should be fully expiated, as to the execution of the penal Law upon him. And thus far, I freely admit what
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37433:117"/>
                        <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts upon this subject,<note place="margin">

And therefore no sin which was to be punished by cutting off, was to be expiated by Sacrifice; as <hi>wilful Idolatry, Murther, &amp;c.</hi> Which it is impossible for those to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, who make the expiation whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>typical</hi>; for why then should not the greatest sins much rather have had sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>expiation</hi> appointed for them: because the Consciences of men would be more solicitous for the pardon of greater than lesser sins; and the blood of Christ represented by them, was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the expiation of all. From whence it is evident, that it was not a meer <hi>typical</hi> expiation; but it did relate to the civil constitution among them. But besides this, we are to consider the people with a respect to that mode of Divine Worship which was among them; by reason of which, the people were to be purified from the <hi>legal</hi> impurities which they contracted, which hindred them from joyning with others in the publick Worship of <hi>God,</hi> and many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were appointed purposely for the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37433:117"/>
expiating this <hi>legal guilt,</hi> as particularly, <hi>the ashes of the red heifer,</hi> Numb. 19.9. which is there called <hi>a purification for sin.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts <hi>the blood of Bulls and of Goats,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9.12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean,</hi> together; and the effect of both of them, he saith, was <hi>to sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh</hi>; which implies, that there was some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and immediate effect of these sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices upon the people at that time, though infinitely short of the effect of the blood of Christ upon the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men. By which it is plain, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> doth not speak of the same kind of <hi>expiation</hi> in those sacrifices, which was in the Sacrifice of Christ, and that the one was barely typical of the other; but of a different kind of <hi>expiation,</hi> as far as <hi>purifying the flesh</hi> is from <hi>purging the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> But we do not deny, that the whole dispensation was <hi>typical,</hi> and that <hi>the Law had a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> i. e. a dark and obscure representation, and not the perfect resemblance of them. There are two things which the Apostle asserts concerning the Sacrifices of the <hi>Law:</hi> First, that they had an effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bodies of men, which he calls
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37433:118"/>
                        <hi>purifying the flesh</hi>; the other is, that they had no power to expiate for the sins of the soul, considered with a respect to the punishment of another life, which he calls <hi>purging the Conscience from dead works</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 9.9.10.4.</note> and therefore he saith, <hi>that all the gifts and sacrifices under the Law, could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the Conscience,</hi> and <hi>that it was impossible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sin.</hi> So that the proper expiation which was made by them, was civil and ritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating either to corporal punishment, or to legal uncleanness, from whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> well proves the necessity of a higher Sacrifice to make expiation for sins, <hi>as pertaining to the Conscience:</hi> But that expiation among the <hi>Iews</hi> did relate to that <hi>Polity</hi> which was established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as they were a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of a body of Laws distinct from the rest of the world. And they being considered as such, it is vain to enquire, whether they had only <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> or <hi>eternal</hi> promises; for it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible they should have any other than temporal, unless we imagine, that <hi>God</hi> would own them for a distinct people in another World as he did in this. For
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37433:118"/>
what Promises relate to a People <hi>as such,</hi> must consider them as a People, and in that capacity they must be the blessings of a <hi>Society,</hi> viz. peace, plenty, number of People, length of days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we are far from denying that the general Principles of <hi>Religion</hi> did remain among them, viz. <hi>that there is a God, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that seek him;</hi> and all the Promises God made to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> did continue in force <hi>as to another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and were continually improved by the <hi>Prophetical</hi> instructions among them. But we are now speaking of what did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the people in general, by vertue of that Law which was given them by <hi>Moses,</hi> and in that respect the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faults being either <hi>death</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> from the publick Worship, the expiation of them, was taking away the obligation to either of these, which was the guilt of them in that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <hi>But doth not this take away the typical nature of these sacrifices?</hi> No, but it much rather establisheth it. For as <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> argues,<note place="margin">

So that to make good the true notion of a <hi>Type,</hi> we must assert an <hi>expiation</hi> that was <hi>real</hi> then, and agreeable to that dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, which doth represent an expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a far higher nature, which was to be by the Sacrifice of the Blood of Christ.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37433:120"/>
use of the blood, on the account of its being consecrated to sacred use, it had been enough to have said, that the blood was holy unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> as it is in the other instances mentioned by <hi>Crellius,</hi> of the <hi>holy Ointment and Perfume,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 30.32, 33.</note> for no other reason is there given, why it should not be profaned to common use,<note place="margin">37, 38.</note> but <hi>that it should be holy for the Lord</hi>; if therefore the blood had been forbidden upon that account, there had been no necessity at all of adding, that <hi>the blood was it that made atonement for the soul:</hi> which gives no peculiar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why they should not eat the blood, beyond that of bare consecration of it to a sacred use; but if we consider it as respecting the first clause, viz. <hi>For the life of the flesh is in the blood,</hi> then there is a particular reason why the blood should be for atonement, viz. <hi>because the life was in that</hi>; and therefore when the <hi>blood</hi> was offered, the life of the Beast was supposed to be given instead of the life of the offender.

                           </gap> is mentioned; which price,</hi> he saith, <hi>by accident may be a person; and because the person is not presently delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> he therefore saith,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>is such a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of persons, that the substituted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is in all respects to be in the same place and state wherein the other was; and if it refers to sufferings, then it is when one suffers the very same which the other was to suffer, he being immediately delivered
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37433:125"/>
by the others sufferings.</hi> And against this kind of surrogation, <hi>Crellius</hi> needed not to have produced any reasons; for <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> never asserted it; neither do we say, that Christ suffered eternal death for us, or that we were immediately freed by his sufferings. But that which <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, that he meant by substitution was this, that <hi>unless Christ had died for us, we must have died our selves, and because Christ hath died, we shall not die eternally. But if this be all,</hi>

But notwithstanding all these fair words, <hi>Crellius</hi> means no more than <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> did; and tho' he would allow the words which <hi>Grotius</hi> used, yet not in the sense he understood them in; for <hi>Crellius</hi> means no more by all this, but that <hi>the death of Christ was an antecedent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the expiation of sins in Heaven, Grotius</hi> understands by them, that <hi>Christ did expiate sins by becoming a Sacrifice for them in his death.</hi> However, from hence it appears, that our Adversaries
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37433:125"/>
can have no plea against the death of Christ's being an expiatory Sacrifice (from want of a substitution in our room) since they pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ess themselves so willing to own such a substitution. But if they say, that there could be no <hi>proper substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> because <hi>the death of Christ was a bare condition, and no punishment,</hi> they then express their minds more freely; and if these places be allowed to prove a substitution, I hope the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course will prove that it was by way of punishment. Neither is it necessary, <hi>that the very same kind of punishment be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in order to surrogation,</hi> but that it be sufficient in order to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end for which it was designed. For this kind of <hi>substitution</hi> being in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the delivery of another by it, whatever is sufficient for that end, doth make a <hi>proper surrogation.</hi> For no more is necessary to the delivery of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person than the satisfying the ends of the Law and Government, and if that may be done by an equivalent suffering, though not the same in all respects, then it may be a proper surrogation. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had obtained his wish, that he had died for his Son <hi>Absolom,</hi> it had not been necessary in order to his Son's escape,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37433:126"/>
that he had <hi>hanged by the hair of his head,</hi> as his Son did; but his death, though in other circumstances, had been sufficient. And therefore when the Lawyers say, <hi>subrogatum, sapit naturam ejus in cujus locum subrogatur:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Covarru.</hi> 3. <hi>To.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</note>

<q>That it was the chief Office of a High-Priest, to plead the cause of sinners with God, and to take care, that they may find him kind and propitious, and not angry or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</q>
In what sense <hi>God</hi> was said to be <hi>moved</hi> by the Expiatory Sacrifices, is not here our business to discuss; it is sufficient for our purpose, that they were instituted with a respect to <hi>God,</hi> so as to procure his favour, and divert his wrath. In which sense, the Priest is so often in the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> said, by the offering up of Sacrifices, to expiate the sins of the people. But <hi>Crellius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

<q>This cannot be said of all, or of the most proper Expiatory Sacrifices;</q> but we see it said of more than the meer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sin,</hi> as appointed by the Law; <hi>viz of burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings, and incense,</hi> in the examples mentioned.
So that these Levitical Sacrifices did all respect the atoning God; although in some particular cases, different Sacrifices were to be offered; for it is said, <hi>the burnt-offering was to make atonement for them,</hi>

                        <q>The High-Priest was a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and man, by whom men might propitiate God, and God dispense his favours to men.</q>
But the means whereby he did procure favours to men, was by atoning God by the Sacrifices, which he was by his Office to offer to him.

set himself to prove, that he is our <hi>High-Priest?</hi> when he must needs fail in the main thing, according to his own asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How easie had it been for the <hi>Iews,</hi> to have answered all the <hi>Apostles</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, if he had been such a <hi>Priest,</hi> and made no other Oblation than <hi>Crellius</hi> allows him? When the <hi>Apostle</hi> proves against the <hi>Iews,</hi> that there was no necessity, that they should still retain the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispensation, because now they had a more excellent <hi>High-Priest</hi> than the <hi>Aaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> were; and makes use of that chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that <hi>he was one taken out from among men, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins:</hi>
                        <q>Well, <hi>say the Iews,</hi> we accept of this character, but how do you prove concerning Christ, that he was such a one? Did he offer up a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for sin</hi> to God upon earth, as our <hi>High-Priests</hi> do?</q>
                        <hi>No,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, his sufferings were only a preparation for his Priesthood in Heaven:</hi>
                        <q>But did he then offer up such a Sacrifice to God in Heaven?</q>
                        <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, he made an Oblation there.</hi>
                        <q>But is that Oblation such a Sacrifice to God for sin, as our <hi>High-Priests</hi> offer?</q>
Yes, saith
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37433:135"/>
                        <hi>Crellius,</hi> it may be called so <hi>by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</hi>
                        <q>Well then, say they, you grant that your <hi>Iesus</hi> is only a <hi>High-Priest</hi> by way of <hi>allusion,</hi> which was against your first design to prove; <hi>viz.</hi> That he was a true <hi>High-Priest,</hi> and more excellent than ours. But suppose it be by way of allusion, doth he make any Oblation to God in Heaven or not?</q>
                        <hi>No,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, really and truly he doth not: for all his Office doth respect us, but the benefits we enjoy coming originally from the kindness of God, you may call it an Oblation to God if you please.</hi>
                        <q>But how is it possible then, say the <hi>Iews,</hi> you can ever convince us, that he is any <hi>High-Priest,</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> at all, much less, that he should ever exceed the <hi>Aaronical High-Priests</hi> in their Office? for we are assured, that they do offer <hi>Sacrifices for sin,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned by them: but if your <hi>High-Priest</hi> make no atonement for sin, he falls far short of ours, and therefore we will still hold to our <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> and not forsake that for one barely Metaphorical, and having nothing really answering the name of a High-Priest.</q>
Thus the force of all the <hi>Apostles</hi> Arguments is plainly taken

away, by what <hi>Crellius</hi> and his Brethren assert concerning the Priesthood of Christ. But <hi>Crellius</hi> thinks to make it good by saying,<note place="margin">

So that there could be no reason at all given, why the name of a <hi>High-Priest</hi> should be at all given to Christ, if no more were implied in it, than <hi>the exercise of his power with respect to us,</hi> without any proper oblation to <hi>God:</hi> For here is no proper Sacerdotal act at all attributed to him; so that upon their <hi>hypothesis,</hi>

the name of <hi>High-Priest,</hi> is a meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant title used by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> without any foundation at all for it. <hi>By no means,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, for his expiation of sin is implyed by it, which is not implied in the name of King:</hi> True, if the expiation of sin were done by him in the way of a <hi>Priest</hi> by an oblation to God, which they deny; but though they call it <hi>Expiation,</hi> they mean no more than <hi>the exercise of his divine power</hi> in the delivering his people.

                        <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, his continuance there, is a condition in order to the expiation by actual deliverance, and therefore it may be said, that God is as it were moved by it to expiate sins.</hi> The utmost then, that is attributed to Christ's being in Heaven, in order to the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sins, is that he must continue there without doing any thing in order to it; for if he does, it must either respect God or us: but they deny (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the importance of the words, and the design of the places where they are used) that the terms of <hi>Christ's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for us,</hi> or <hi>being an Advocate with the Father for us,</hi>

                           <hi>and the reason</hi> Crellius <hi>gives is,</hi> because that phrase of a sweet-smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling savour is generally and almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways used of sacrifices which are not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory; but if ever they be used of an Expiatory Sacrifice, they are not applied to that which was properly expiatory in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the offering up of the blood, for no smell, <hi>saith he,</hi> went up from thence, but to the burning of the fat, and the Kidneys, which although re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to perfect the expiation, yet not being done till the High-Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned out of the Holy of Holies, hath nothing correspondent to the expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice of Christ, where all things are perfected before Christ the High-Priest goes forth of his Sanctuary.</q>
How inconsistent these last words are with what they assert concerning the <hi>expiation</hi> of sin by actual deliverance at the great day, the former discourse hath
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37433:139"/>
already discovered.

The <hi>mactation</hi> may be considered two ways, either with a respect to the bare <hi>instrument</hi> of taking away the life, or to the design of the <hi>Offerer</hi> of that which was to be sacrificed: As the <hi>mactation</hi> hath a respect only to the instruments, so it is no otherways to be considered than as a <hi>punishment</hi>; but as it hath a respect to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs it for a Sacrifice, so the shedding of the blood, hath an immediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the expiation of sin. And that by this clear Argument, <hi>The blood is said to make an Atonement for the soul</hi>;<note place="margin">Levit. 17.11.</note> and the reason given is, because <hi>the life of the flesh is in the blood:</hi> So that which was <hi>the life,</hi> is the great thing which makes the <hi>Atonement</hi>; and when the <hi>blood</hi> was shed, the <hi>life</hi> was then given; from whence it follows, that the great efficacy of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for <hi>Atonement</hi> lay in the <hi>shedding of the blood</hi> for that end.

It is then to no purpose at all, if <hi>Crellius</hi> could prove that sometimes in ordinary Sacrifices, (which he will not say, the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37433:146"/>
Sacrifice of Christ was represented by) the <hi>Levites</hi> might kill the beasts for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; for it appears, that in these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, wherein themselves contend that Christ's was represented, the office of the <hi>High-Priest</hi> did not begin with entring into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> but with the <hi>macta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that Sacrifice whose blood was to be carried in thither. Therefore if we speak of the bare instruments of <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> in the death of Christ, those were the <hi>Iews,</hi> and we make not them <hi>Priests</hi> in it, for they aimed at no more than ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his life (as the <hi>Popae</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and those whose bare Office it was to kill the beasts for Sacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Iews</hi> did:) but if we consider it with a respect to him that offered up his life to God, then we say, that Christ was the <hi>High-Priest</hi> in doing it; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing designed for the expiation of sin; and by vertue of this <hi>blood shed</hi> for that end, he enters into Heaven as the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> there <hi>ever living to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us.</hi> But the vertue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent acts, depends upon the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> shed for expiation; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>High-Priest</hi> might have entred with the same effect into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> with any other blood besides that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37433:147"/>
which was shed on purpose as a <hi>sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> for expiation of the sins of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which it was unlawful for him to do. And from hence it is, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> insists so much on the comparison between the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>legal Sacrifices,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9.13, 14.10.4, 10.</note> and the efficacy of the one far above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in its power of expiation; which he needed not to have done, if the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his blood, had been only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for his entrance on his <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> in Heaven.

different from the <hi>animales hostiae,</hi> yet among the <hi>Persians,</hi> every Sacrifice had a respect to expiation of the whole people. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, that every one that offers Sacrifice among them,<note place="margin">

                        <q>That the name of Oblation as applyed to Christ, primarily signifies Christ's first entrance into Heaven, and appearance before the face of God, there, but consequently the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that appearance; so that when a thing is once actually exhibited and presented, it is said to be once offered, although being offered, it always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the same place, and so may

be said to be a continual Oblation. But this first appearance, <hi>saith he,</hi> hath a peculiar agreement with the legal Oblation; and therefore the name of Oblation doth most properly belong to that, because Christ by this means obtained that power on which the perfect remission of our sins depends: but although the continuance of that appearance, seems only consequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have the name of Oblation belonging to it, yet in its own nature, it hath a nearer conjunction with the effect of the Oblation, <hi>viz.</hi> the remission of sins, or deliverance from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doth of it self confer more to it than the other doth.

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37433:149"/>
the Law, which hath no immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the expiation of sins. 2. In making that to have the most immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate respect to the expiation of sins, which can in no tolerable sense be called an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> For the first, since <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, that the proper notion of <hi>Oblation</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>Oblations</hi> in the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Law,</hi> we must consider what it was there, and whether <hi>Christ's</hi> first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven can have any corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency with it.

If we could have suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the <hi>High-Priest</hi> under the Law, instead of offering a Goat for a <hi>Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for the people, on the day of <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> should have made an oblation of himself to God, by dying for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their sins: In this case, his death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrifice, and himself the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>mactation,</hi> as it relates to his own act, and his <hi>oblation</hi> had been one and the same thing. For his death had been nothing else, but the offering up himself to God,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37433:151"/>
in order to the expiation of the sins of the people; and there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why the oblation must be of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity something consequent to his death, since all things necessary to a perfect <hi>oblation</hi> do concur in it. For where there is something solemnly devoted to God, and in order to the expiation of sins, and by the hand of a <hi>Priest,</hi> there are all things concurring to a legal oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but in this case, all these things do concur, and therefore there can be no imaginable necessity of making the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, only consequent to his Ascension, since in his death all things concur to a proper oblation. In the Law, we grant that the oblation made by the <hi>Priest,</hi> was consequent to the death of the beast for Sacrifice; but the reason of that was, because the beast could not offer up it self to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> had made it necessary, that the Priest should expiate sins, not by himself, but by those Sacrifices, and therefore the oblation of the blood was after the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was slain; neither could this have been solved barely <hi>by the Priest's slaying of the Sacrifices</hi>; for this being an act of violence towards the beasts that were thus killed, could not be a proper obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37433:152"/>
which must suppose a consent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to it. All which shewed the great imperfection of the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> in which so many several things were to concur, to make up a <hi>sacrifice for sin; viz.</hi> The <hi>first offering</hi> made by the <hi>party</hi> concerned, of what was under his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> The beast to be sacrificed <hi>at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> but the beast not being able to offer up it self, if was necessary for the offering up its <hi>blood,</hi> that it must be <hi>slain</hi> by others; and for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, not only of the efficacy of the <hi>blood,</hi> but the concurrence of the <hi>Priest</hi> for <hi>expiation,</hi> he was <hi>to take the blood, and sprinkle some of it on the Altar,</hi> and pour out the rest at the foundation of it. But since we assert a far more noble and excellent Sacrifice, by the Son of God freely offering up himself, to be made a Sacrifice for the sins of the world, why may not this be as proper an <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made unto <hi>God,</hi> as any was under the <hi>Law,</hi> and far more excellent, both in regard of the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> why should his oblation of himself then be made only consequent to his death and resurrection? Which latter, being by our Adversaries made not his own

act, but God's upon him, and his entrance into Heaven, being given him (as they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert) <hi>as a reward of his sufferings,</hi> in what tolerable sense can that be called an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of himself, which was conferred upon him as a reward of his former suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? From whence it follows, that upon our Adversaries own grounds, the death of Christ may far more properly be called the <hi>oblation</hi> of himself, than his <hi>entrance into Heaven</hi>; and that there is no necessity of making the oblation of Christ consequent to his death, there being so great a difference between the Sacrifice of Christ, and that of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for sin under the <hi>Levitical Law.</hi>

Now this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37433:153"/>
appears in this particular, in the solemn <hi>Sacrifices for sin,</hi> after the <hi>sprinkling</hi> of <hi>the blood,</hi> which was carried into the <hi>Holy place to reconcile withall,</hi> all the remainder of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was <hi>to be burnt without the Camp,</hi> and this held on the <hi>day of Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 13.12.</note> as well as in other <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> for the Congregation.

                     <p n="4">4. We observe, That the Oblation in Expiatory Sacrifices under the Law, by the Priest, had always relation to the <hi>consumption</hi> of what was offered: Thus the offering of the <hi>blood,</hi> in token of the destruction of the life of the beast, whose blood was offered; for no <hi>blood</hi> was to be offered of a <hi>living creature,</hi> nor of one
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37433:154"/>
killed upon any other account, but for that end to be a <hi>sacrifice for sin,</hi> and after the <hi>sprinkling</hi> and pouring out of the blood, the <hi>inwards</hi> of some, and all of the other, were to be consumed by fire. And it is observable, that the greater the <hi>Sacrifice for sin</hi> was, always the more was <hi>consumed</hi> of it; as appears plainly by the forementioned difference of the <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> for <hi>private persons,</hi> and for the <hi>people</hi>; of the former, the <hi>Priests</hi> were allowed to eat, but not at all of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

From hence all Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifices were at first whole Burnt-offerings, as appears by the Patriarchal Sacrifices, and the customs of other Nations, and among the Jews themselves, as we have already proved in all solemn offerings for the people. And although in the sacrifices of private persons, some parts were allowed to be eaten by the Priests; yet those which were designed for expiation were consumed. So that the greater the offering was to God, the more it implied the <hi>Consumption</hi> of the thing which was so offered: How strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable then is it, That the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Christ should not (as under the Law) have respect to his death and sufferings; but to his <hi>entrance into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> wherein nothing is supposed to be consumed, but all things given him with far greater power, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:37433:155"/>
suppose, than ever he had before. But we see the <hi>Apostle</hi> parallels Christ's <hi>suffering</hi> with the <hi>burning of the Sacrifices,</hi> and his <hi>blood</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of them, and consequently his offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, must relate not to <hi>his entrance into Heaven,</hi> but to that <hi>act</hi> of his whereby he suffered for sins, and offered up <hi>his blood</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the world.</p>

From all which it appears; how far more agreeably to the <hi>Oblations</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, Christ is said to offer up himself for the expiation of sins by his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>sufferings,</hi> than by his <hi>entrance into Heaven;</hi> For it is apparent, that the <hi>Oblations</hi> in expiatory Sacrifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, were such upon which the expiation of sin did chiefly depend; but by our Adversaries own confession, Christ's oblation of himself by his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven, hath no immediate respect at all to the expiation of sin: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>as the way whereby he was to enjoy that power by which he did expiate sins,</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> saith; now, let us consider, what more propriety there is in making this presenting of Christ in Heaven to have a correspondency with the legal Oblations, than the offering up himself upon the Cross. For, 1. on the very same reason that
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:37433:155"/>
his entrance into Heaven is made an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> his death is so too; viz. <hi>Because it was the way whereby he obtained the power of expiation;</hi> and far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so than the other, since they make Christ's entrance and power the reward of his sufferings, but they never make his sitting at the right hand of God, the reward of his <hi>entrance into Heaven.</hi> 2. His offering up himself to God upon the Cross, was his own act, but his entrance into Heaven was <hi>God</hi>'s, as themselves acknowledge, and therefore could not in any propriety of speech be called <hi>Christ's offering up himself.</hi> 3. If it were his own act, it could not have that respect to the <hi>expiation</hi> of sins, which his death had; for our Adversaries say, <hi>that his death was by reason of our sins,</hi> and that he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purge us from sin; but his <hi>entrance into Heaven</hi> was upon his own account, to enjoy that power and authority, which he was to have at the right hand of God. 4. How could <hi>Christ's entrance into Heaven,</hi> be the way for his enjoying that power which was necessary for the expiation of sin, when Christ before his entrance into Heaven, saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> 
                        <hi>that all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was given to him in Heaven and Earth:</hi> and the reason assigned in Scripture of that power and authority which <hi>God</hi>

                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:37433:156"/>
gave him is, <hi>because he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross:</hi> So that the <hi>entrance of Christ into Heaven,</hi> could not be the means of obtaining that power which was conferred before; but the death of Christ is mentioned on that account in <hi>Scripture.</hi> 5. If the death of Christ were no expiatory Sacrifice, the entrance of Christ into Heaven could be no <hi>Oblation</hi> proper to a <hi>High Priest</hi>; for his <hi>entrance into the Holy of Holies,</hi> was on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>sin-offering</hi> which he carried in with him. If there were then no expiatory Sacrifice before, that was slain for the sins of men; Christ could not be said to make any <hi>Oblation in Heaven,</hi> for the Oblation had respect to a Sacrifice already slain; so that if men deny that Christ's death was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sacrifice for sin, he could make no Oblation at all in Heaven, and Christ could not be said to enter thither, as the <hi>High Priest</hi> entred into the Holy of Holies with the blood of the Sacrifice; which is the thing which the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> asserts concerning Christ.<note place="margin">Christ's exercise of power in Heaven in no sense an Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God.</note>

                        <note place="margin">Heb 9.12, 13 10 4.5.</note> and therefore the Oblation of Christ must be in such a way as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to what was used in the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sacrifices,</hi> which we have already at large proved he could not do in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries sense. 3.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37433:159"/>
and if he had been on earth, he could not have been a Priest:</hi> The meaning of which is only this, that if Christ's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice had ended in what he did on earth, he would not have had such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency as he was speaking of; for then he had ceased to be at all such a <hi>High Priest,</hi> having no <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> to go into, which should as much transcend the earthly Sanctuary, as his Sacrifice did the <hi>blood of Bulls and Goats:</hi> Therefore in correspondency to that <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which he did so far excell in all the parts of it, he was not to end his <hi>Priesthood</hi> merely with <hi>the blood</hi> which was shed for a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but he was to carry it into Heaven, and present it before God, and to be a perpetual intercessor in the behalf of his people: And so was in regard of the perpetuity of his Office, <hi>a Priest after the Law of an endless Life:</hi> But lest the people should imagine, that so great and excellent a <hi>High Priest,</hi> being so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above them, should have no sense or compassion upon the infirmities of his people, therefore to encourage them to adhere to him, he tells them, <hi>That he was made like to his Brethren</hi>; and therefore they need not doubt, but by the sense which he had of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37433:160"/>
of humane nature, he will have <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on the weaknesses of his people; which is all the <hi>Apostle</hi> means by those expressions.

imagine, that this was all that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by the Sacrifices of old, who considers the antiquity and universality of them in the world in those elder times before the Law, the great severity by which they were requir'd under the Law, the punctual prescriptions that were made in all circumstances for them, the vast and almost inestimable expence the people were at about them, but above all, the reason that God himself assigns in the Law, <hi>That the blood was given for expiation, because it was the life,</hi> and the correspondency so clearly expressed in the New Testament, between the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, and those Levitical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices? Can any one, I say, imagine upon these considerations, that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices had no other respect to the expiation of sin, than as they were a slight testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their obedience to God? Why were not an inward sorrow for sin, and tears and prayers rather made the only conditions of Expiation than such a burthensome and chargeable service im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon them, which at last signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, but that a command being supposed, they would have sinned if they had broken it? But upon our supposition a reasonable account is given of all the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:37433:167"/>
expiatory Sacrifices; <hi>viz.</hi> That God would have them see, how highly he esteemed his Laws, because an expiation was not to be made for the breach of them, but by the sacrificing of the life of some Creature which he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point instead of the death of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and if the breach of those Laws which he had given them must require such an expiation, what might they then think would the sins of the whole world do, which must be expiated by a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice infinitely greater than all those put together were; <hi>viz.</hi> The death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Son of God for the sins of men? But if the offering Sacrifice had been <hi>a bare condition required of the person who committed the fault, in order to expiation</hi>; Why is it never said, That the person who offered it, did expiate his own fault thereby? For that had been the most proper sense; for if the expiation did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the offering the Sacrifice, as on the condition of it, then the performing the condition, gave him an immediate right to the benefit of the promise. If it be said, <hi>That his own act was not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in bringing the Sacrifice, but the Priests also in offering up the blood:</hi> This will not make it at all the more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:37433:167"/>
because the pardon of sin should not only depend upon a man's own act, but upon the act of another, which he could not in reason be accountable for, if he miscarried in it. If the Priest should refuse to do his part, or be unfit to do it, or break some Law in the doing of it, how hard would it seem that a mans sins could not be expiated, when he had done all that lay in his own power in order to the expiation of them, but that another person, whose actions he had no command over, neglected the doing his duty? So that if the Sacrifice had no other influence on expiation, but as a part of obedience, in all reason the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation should have depended on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conditions but such as were under the power of him, whose sins were to be expiated by it.</p>

For in the <hi>Legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> nothing can be more plain than that the expiation was to be by the Sacrifice offered for <hi>Atonement:</hi> supposing then
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:37433:173"/>
that in some other way (which could be by no means proper to those Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) Christ may be said to expiate sins, what doth this prove that there was an expiation belonging to his Sacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Sacrifices of old? But as I urged before in the case of <hi>Christ</hi>'s being <hi>High Priest,</hi> that by their asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the <hi>Iews</hi> might utterly deny the force of any argument used by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to prove it: so I say as to the expiation by Christ's Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it hath no analogy or corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency at all with any Sacrifice that was ever offered for the expiation of sins. For by that they always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood something which was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered to <hi>God</hi> for that end, upon which they obtain'd remission of sins; but here is nothing answerable to it in their sense of Christ's Sacrifice; for here is no Oblation at all made <hi>unto God</hi> for this end; all the efficacy of the Sacrifice of Christ, in order to expiation doth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately respect us; so that if it be a proper Sacrifice to any, it must be a Sacrifice to us, and not to God: for a Sacrifice is always said to be made to him whom it doth immediately respect; but Christ in the planting Faith, in actual
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:37433:173"/>
deliverance, in declaring to us this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, doth wholly respect us, and therefore his Sacrifice must be made to men, and not to God. Which is in it self a gross absurdity, and repugnant to the nature and design of Sacrifices from the first institution of them; which were always esteemed such immediate parts of divine worship, that they ought to respect none else but God, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they were directed, though for the benefit and advantage of mankind. As well then might Christ be said <hi>to pray for us,</hi> and by that no more be meant but that <hi>he doth teach us to understand our duty</hi>; as be made an expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for us, and all the effect of it only respect us and not God. And this is so far <hi>from adding to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ's Sacrifice above the Legal</hi> (which is the thing pleaded by <hi>Crellius</hi>) that it destroys the very nature of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:37433:174"/>
that a <hi>General</hi> of an <hi>Army</hi> hath a more <hi>excellent conduct</hi> that all that went before him, because he can make <hi>finer speeches</hi>; or that the <hi>Assomanaean</hi> Family discharg'd the Office of <hi>Priesthood</hi> best, because they had a <hi>greater power</hi> over the people; or that <hi>Nero</hi> was the most <hi>excellent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> because he excelled the rest in <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Poetry:</hi> by which we see that to assert an excellency of one above another, we must not go to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, but shew its excellency in <hi>that</hi> wherein the comparison lies: So that this doth not prove the excellency of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he hath a greater power to perswade, deliver and govern, than any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> under the Law; for these are things quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature from the consideration of a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> But therein the excellency of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is to be demonstrated, that it excells all other in the proper end and design of a <hi>Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> if it be more effectual towards <hi>God</hi> for obtaining the expiation of sin; which was always thought to be the proper end of all <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> for expiation.

                        <hi>That
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:37433:176"/>
those words which do properly signifie the thing it self, may very conveniently be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only for the declaration of it, when the performance of the thing doth follow by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that declaration: which then happens, when the declaration is made of the thing decreed by another, and that in the name and by the command of him who did decree it. And in this sense, Christ by his blood may be said to deliver us from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our sins, by declaring or testifying to us the will and decree of God for that purpose.</hi> But this answer is by no means sufficient, upon these considerations; 1. Because it doth not reach the proper and natural sense of the words, as <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> himself confesseth; and yet he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs no reason at all, why we ought to depart from it, unless the bare possibility of another meaning be sufficient. But how had it been possible for the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ for <hi>purging away the guilt of our sins,</hi> to have been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in clearer and plainer terms than these, which are acknowledged of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to signifie as much as we assert? If the most proper expressions for this purpose, are not of force enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our Adversaries, none else could ever do it: so that it had been impossible
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:37433:176"/>
for our Doctrine to have been delivered in such terms, but they would have found out ways to evade the meaning of them. It seems very strange, that so great an efficacy should not only once or twice, but so frequently be attributed to the blood of Christ for expiation of sin, if nothing else were meant by it, but that Christ by his death did only declare that God was willing to pardon sin? If there were danger in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words in their proper sense, why are they so frequently used to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? why are there no other places of Scripture that might help to undeceive us, and tell us plainly, that Christ dyed only to declare his Father's will? but what ever other words might signifie, this was the only true meaning of them. But what miserable shifts are these, when men are forced to put off such Texts which are confessed to express our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, only by saying that they may be otherwise understood? which destroys all kind of certainty in words; which by reason of the various use of them, may be interpreted to so many several senses, that if this liberty be allowed, upon no other pretence, but that <hi>another mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is possible,</hi> men will never agree about
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:37433:177"/>
the intention of any person in speaking. For upon the same reason, if it had been said, <hi>That Christ declared by his death God's readiness to pardon,</hi> it might have been interpreted, <hi>That the blood of Christ was therefore the declaration of God's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to pardon, because it was the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration upon which God would do it:</hi> So that if the words had been as express for them, as they are now against them, according to their way of answering places, they would have been recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to our opinion. 2. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in these expressions, doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute something <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>blood of Christ</hi>; but if all that were meant by it were no more, than the <hi>declaring God</hi>'s will to pardon, this could in no sense be said to be peculiar to it. For this was the design of the Doctrine of Christ, and all his miracles were wrought to confirm the truth of that part of his Doctrine, which concerned remission of sins as well as any other: but how absurd would it have been to say, that the <hi>miracles</hi> of Christ <hi>purge us from all sin,</hi> that through <hi>Christ healing the sick, raising the dead,</hi> &amp;c. we have <hi>redemption, even the forgiveness of sins,</hi> which are attributed to the <hi>blood of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:37433:177"/>
Christ?</hi> but if no other respect, than as a testimony to the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Remission of sins, they were equally applicable to one as to the other. Besides, if this had been all intended in these expressions, they were the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruously applied to the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ; nothing seeming more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Doctrine of the Remission of sins, which was declared by it, than that very thing by which it was declared, if no more were intended by it: For how unsuitable a way was it to declare the pardon of the guilty persons, by such severities used towards the most Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent! Who could believe, That God should declare his willingness to pardon others, by the death of his own Son; unless that death of his be considered as the <hi>meritorious cause</hi> for procuring it? And in that sense we acknowledge, That the death of Christ was a <hi>declaration</hi> of God's will and decree to pardon, but not meerly as it gave <hi>testimony</hi> to the truth of his Doctrine (for in that sense the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> might be said <hi>to purge us from sin,</hi> as well as the <hi>blood of Christ</hi>) but because it was the <hi>consideration</hi> upon which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to pardon. And so as the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:37433:178"/>
of the condition required, or the price paid, may be said to declare or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, the intention of a person to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease or deliver a Captive: So God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of what Christ did suffer for our sakes, may be said to <hi>declare</hi> his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to pardon us upon his account. But then this <hi>declaration</hi> doth not belong properly to the act of Christ in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but to the act of God in accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and it can be no other ways known, than <hi>God</hi>'s acceptance is known; which was not by the <hi>Sufferings,</hi> but by the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And therefore the declaring Gods will and decree to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, doth properly belong to that: and if that had been all which the <hi>Scripture</hi> had meant, by <hi>purging of sin by the blood of Christ,</hi> it had been very incongruously applied to that, but most properly to his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> But these phrases being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attributed to that which most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly might be said <hi>to declare</hi> the will of God; and being peculiarly attributed to the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, which cannot be said properly to do it; nothing can be more plain, than that these expressions ought to be taken in that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be their proper sense; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Expiation</hi> of sin, which doth belong to

to something farther; but as the great instance of the love both of <hi>God and Christ;</hi> of God, in sending his Son; of Christ, in laying down his life for sinners, in order to their being justified by his blood. But where is it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the death of Christ had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther influence on the expiation of our sins, but as a bare condition intervening in order to that power and authority whereby he would expiate sins? what makes him attribute so much to the death of Christ, if all the benefits we enjoy depend upon the consequences of it; and no otherwise upon that, than meerly as a preparation for it? what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>emphasis</hi> were there in Christ's <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sinners, and for the ungodly</hi>; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his death had a particular relation to the expiation of their sins?

But nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:37433:180"/>
than what <hi>Crellius</hi> would have to be the meaning of this place, viz. <hi>that the Apostle doth not speak of the proper force of the death of Christ distinct from his life; but that two things are opposed to each other for the effecting of one of which the death of Christ did intervene, but it should not intervene for the other</hi>; viz. <hi>it did intervene for our reconciliation, but it should not for our life.</hi> For did not the death of Christ equally intervene for our <hi>life</hi> as for our <hi>reconciliation</hi>? was not our eternal deliverance the great thing designed by Christ, and our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order to that end? what oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition then can be imagined, that it should be necessary for the death of Christ to intervene in order to the one than in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other? But he means, <hi>that the death of Christ should not intervene any more</hi>; what need that, when it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by themselves, that Christ died only for this end before, that he might have power to bestow eternal life on them that obey him? But the main force of the Apostles argument lies in the comparison between <hi>the death of Christ</hi> having respect to us <hi>as enemies</hi> in order to <hi>reconciliation,</hi> and the <hi>life of Christ</hi> to us considered as <hi>reconciled</hi>; so that if

he had so much kindness for enemies, to die for their reconciliation, we may much more presume that he now living in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will accomplish the end of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, in the eternal salvation of them that obey him.

whereas if the expiation meant by him had been found by <hi>Christ's Oblation</hi> of himself in Heaven, he would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Christ's entrance into Heaven</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, with the <hi>entrance of the High-Priest into the Holy of Holies,</hi> and his argument had run thus. For if the <hi>High-Priest</hi> under the Law did expiate sins by entring into the Holy of Holies; How much more shall the Son of God entring into Heaven expiate the sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? but we see the <hi>Apostle</hi> had no sooner mention'd the <hi>redemption</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us; but he presently speaks of the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ in order to it, and as plainly asserts the same, v. 15. <hi>And for this cause he is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which were under the first Testament, they which were called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</hi> Why doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> here speak of the <gap reason="foreign">

And to confirm this sense, the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not go on to prove the necessity of <hi>Christ's entrance into Heaven</hi>; but <hi>of his dying,</hi> v. 16, 17, 18. But granting that he doth allude to the <hi>High Priest's</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> yet that was but the representation of a Sacrifice already offer'd, and he could not be said to find expiation by his entrance; but that was already found by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and his entrance was only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the end for which the blood was offer'd up in Sacrifice. And the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which came to men is attributed to the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and not to the <hi>sprinkling of blood</hi> before the <hi>Mercy-seat:</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever effect was consequent upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Sanctuary, was by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the blood which he carried in with him, and was before shed at the Altar.

state of Christ in Heaven, his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven doth imply it: For therefore <hi>God exalted him to be a Prince and a Saviour:</hi> and the reason of the power and authority given him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is no where attributed to his <hi>entrance</hi> into it as the means of it; but our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour before that tells us,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>that all power and authority was committed to him</hi>; and his very entrance into Heaven was a part of his glory; and given him in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his sufferings; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> plainly asserts;<note place="margin">Phil. 2 8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and he became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross, wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. There can be then no imaginable reason to make the entrance of Christ into Heaven, and presenting himself to God there, a condition or means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that power and authority which is implyed in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God.</hi> 2. Supposing, we should look on these as distinct, there is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reason to attribute the expiation of sin to his <hi>entrance,</hi> considered as distinct from the other: For the expiation of sins in Heaven being by <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confessed to be by the exercise of Christ's power, and this being only the means to that power, how could Christ expiate
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:37433:183"/>
sins by that power which he had not? But of this I have spoken before, and shewed that in no sense allowed by themselves the expiation of sins can be attributed to the entrance of Christ into Heaven as distinct from his sitting at the right hand of God. Thus much may suffice to prove, that those effects of an Expiatory Sacrifice, which do respect the sins committed, do properly agree to the death of Christ.</p>

God, and stirs him up to anger against all who commit it?</hi> what means, I say, all this, if God be not angry with men on the account of sin? Well then; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God to be averse from men by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their sins, shall this displeasure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue or not? if it always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, men must certainly suffer the desert of their sins; if it doth not always continue, then God may be said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> in the same sense that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended party is capable of being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him who hath provoked him.

First, when he is not only willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of terms of agreement, but doth declare his acceptance of the mediation of a third person, and that he is so well satisfied with what he hath done in order to it, that he appoints this to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the World to assure the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if the breach continues, the fault wholly lies upon himself. The second is, when the offender doth accept of the terms of agreement offered, and submits himself to him whom he hath provoked, and is upon that received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour. And these two we assert
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:37433:189"/>
must necessarily be distinguished in the reconciliation between God and us. For upon the death and sufferings of Christ, God declares to the World he is so well satisfied with what Christ hath done and suffered in order to the reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himself and us, that he now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes remission of sins to the World upon those terms which the Mediator hath declared by his own doctrine, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> he sent to preach it: But because remission of sins doth not immediately follow upon the death of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out supposition of any act on our part, therefore the state of favour doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which are required from us. So that upon the death of Christ <hi>God</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his acceptance of Christ's mediation, and that the obstacle did not lie upon his part; therefore those Messengers who were sent abroad into the world to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to accept of these terms of agreeement, do insist most upon that which was the remaining obstacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the sins of Mankind, that men by laying aside them, would be now reconciled to God, since there was nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this reconciliation, their obstinacy in sin excepted. Which may be a very
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:37433:189"/>
reasonable account why we read more frequently in the Writings of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> of mens duty in being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God; the other being supposed by them as the foundation of their preaching to the world, and is insisted on by them upon that account, as is clear in that place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

leave off their sins? how comes God to reconcile the World to himself by the preaching of <hi>Christ,</hi> since <hi>Christ</hi> himself saith, he was not sent to preach to the world; but <hi>to the lost sheep of the house of Israel?</hi> Was the World reconciled to God by the preaching of Christ, before they had ever heard of him? Why is God said not to <hi>impute to men their trespasses</hi> by the preaching of Christ, rather than his <hi>Apostles</hi>; if the not imputing were no more than declaring God's readiness to pardon; which was equally done by the <hi>Apostles</hi> as by <hi>Christ</hi> himself?

                        </gap>h on the account of sin, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should ever admit of any terms of Reconciliation with them, which is the only thing inconsistent with the greatness of God's love, in sending Christ into the world; but we adore and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the infiniteness and unexpressible greatness of his love, that nothwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:37433:192"/>
all the contempt of the former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mercies of Heaven, he should be pleased to send his own Son to die for sinners, that they might be reconciled to him. And herein was the great love of God manifested, that <hi>while we were enemies and sinners, Christ died for us,</hi> and that for this end, that we might be reconciled to God by his death. And therefore surely, not in the state of favour or Reconciliation with God then. But it were worth the while, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what it is our Adversaries mean, when they say, <hi>God was reconciled when he sent his Son, and therefore he could not die to reconcile God to us.</hi> Either they mean, that God had decreed to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled upon the sending his Son, or that he was actually reconciled when he sent him: if he only decreed to be reconciled, that was not at all inconsistent with Christ's dying to reconcile God and us in pursuance of that decree: if they mean, he was actually reconciled, then there was no need for Christ to die to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God and us; but withal, actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation implies pardon of sin; and if sin were actually pardoned before Christ came, there could be no need of his coming at all, and sins would have
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:37433:192"/>
been pardoned before committed; if they were not pardoned, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that love of God, then it can imply no more, but that God was willing to be reconciled. If therefore the not-remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins were consistent with that love of God, by which he sent Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, then notwithstanding that he was yet capable of being reconciled by his death. So that our Adversaries are bound to reconcile that love of God, with not presently pardoning the sins of the world, as we are to reconcile it with the ends of the death of Christ, which are asserted by us.</p>

Nay we find that God himself,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.7.</note> in the case of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> appointed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to pray for him,</hi> in order to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; And will any one say, this was a derogation to the Grace of God in his pardon?<note place="margin">Job 42.7.</note> Or to the pardon of <hi>Iob's</hi> Friends, because <hi>Iob</hi> was appointed to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for them? Or to the pardon of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> out of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them, directed them by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and appointed the means in order to it? But although <hi>God</hi> appointed our <hi>High-Priest</hi> for us, and out of his great love sent him into the world, yet his Sacrifice was not what <hi>was given him,</hi> but what he <hi>freely underwent himself</hi>; he gave us Christ, but <hi>Christ</hi> offered up himself <hi>a full, perfect and sufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the sins of the world.</hi>

                  <epigraph>
                     <q>
                        <bibl>
                           <hi>1 TIM. I.15.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                        <p>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, That Christ Iesus came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to save Sinners, of whom I am chief.</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IF these Words were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without any Restriction or Limitation <hi>that Christ Iesus came into the World to save sinners,</hi> they would overthrow the great Design of the Gospel, and make its Excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts Useless and Ineffectual. For, to what purpose should men be put upon the severe Practice of Repentance, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:37433:196"/>
and a continued Course of a Holy Life, if the meer being <hi>Sinners</hi> did sufficiently qualifie them for Salvation? This indeed would be thought a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>worthy of all Acceptation</hi> by the <hi>greatest Sinners</hi>; but it could not be <hi>a faithful saying,</hi> being not agreeable either to the Nature of God, or Revelation of his Will by <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such <hi>Sinners</hi> as himself had been, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as had been great Sia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but had truly and sincerely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Of whom I am chief.</hi> What then? Must we look on him as the Standard and Measure of such <hi>Sinners</hi> whom <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> came to save? What will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all those who have been Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a higher Rank than ever he was? It's true in the Verses before the Text, he sets out his Sins, as a humble Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is wont to do, with the worst Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and deepest Aggravations,<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor, and injurious</hi>; but yet he adds, <hi>that he obtained Mercy because he did it ignorantly, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi> How then is S. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Chief of Sinners</hi>? Are Sins of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Mistake</hi> the greatest of Sins, for which Christ died? Is there no <hi>Expiation</hi> for any other by <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> What will
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:37433:196"/>
become then of all such who sin against Knowledge and Conscience, and not <hi>in Ignorance and Vnbelief?</hi> Can none of these hope for Mercy by <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> although they do truly Repent? But <hi>the Blood of Christ</hi> is said elsewhere <hi>to cleanse us from all Sin</hi>; not,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.7.</note> while we continue in them,<note place="margin">Ch. 2. v. 2.</note> but if we repent and forsake them. And <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is said <hi>to be a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And therefore this Expression of S. <hi>Paul</hi> notes his great Humility and deep Sense of his own Sins; but doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others from the hopes of Pardon whose Sins have other Aggravations than his had. For, if we leave out the last words as peculiar to his Case, yet the other contain in them a true Proposition and of the greatest Importance to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; <hi>This is a faithful saying and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation, that Christ Iesus came into the world to save sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, you may say, is a matter out of all doubt among all such who hope for Salvation by <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; for all are agreed, that one way or other we are to be <hi>saved by him.</hi> But there is great Difficulty as to the Way of <hi>saving sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> by <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; whether by <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:37433:197"/>
and Example of the Man Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, by the Power he attained through his Sufferings</hi>; Or, <hi>by the Eternal Son of God's assuming our Nature and suffering in our stead in order to the Reconciling God to us and making a Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> These are two very different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> or Notions of <hi>Christ's coming to save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; and the former seems more easie to be understood and believed; and the other seems to have Insuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in point of Reason; and to run our Religion into <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which expose our Faith and make Christianity appear Contemptible to Men of Sense and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Is it not therefore much better to embrace such a Scheme of it, as will have the least Objection against it, that so Men of Reason may not be tempted to Infidelity, and Men of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition may not under the Colour of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> bring in the most Absurd and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Doctrines?</p>
                  <p>These are plausible Insinuations, and would be apt to prevail on considering Mens minds, if they were to form and make a Religion that might be most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Humour</hi> of the Age they live in. And truly no Men (by their own Authority) can
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:37433:197"/>
pretend to a Right to impose on others any <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> or any such things which are above their Capacity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. But that is not our case; for we all profess to believe and receive <hi>Christianity</hi> as a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi>; and God (we say) may require from us the belief of what we may not be able to comprehend, especially if it relates to Himself, or such things which are Consequent upon the Union of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Nature. Therefore our business is to consider, whether any such things be contained in that <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which we all own; and if they be, we are bound to believe them, although we are not able to comprehend them.</p>
                  <p>Now here are two Remarkable <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> in these Words, by which we may examin these different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> concerning the way of <hi>Salvation by Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>It is a faithfull saying,</hi> and therefore must be contained in that Revelation which God hath made concerning our Salvation by Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>It is worthy of all Acceptation; i. e.</hi> most useful and beneficial to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:37433:198"/>Now by these two I shall procceed in the Examination of them.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. Which is most agreeable to the Revealed Will of God.</item>
                     <item>II. Which doth offer fairest for the Benefit and Advantage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">I. Which is most agreeable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God. For that we are sure is the most <hi>faithfull saying</hi>; since Men of Wit and Reason may deceive us, but God cannot. When the Apostles first preached this Doctrine to the World, they were not bound to believe what they affirmed to be <hi>a faithfull saying</hi> till they gave sufficient Evidence of their Authority from God, by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Assistance of the Holy Ghost. But now this <hi>faithfull saying</hi> is contained in the Books of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> by which we are to judge of the Truth of all <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrines. And when two different Senses of Places of Scripture are offer'd, we are to consider, which is most Reasonable to be preferr'd. And herein we are allow'd to Exercise our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as much as we please; and the more
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:37433:198"/>
we do so, the sooner we shall come to Satisfaction in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Now according to Reason we may judge that Sense to be preferr'd,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Which is most plain and easie and agreeable to the most receiv'd Sense of Words; not that which is forced and intricate, or which puts improper and <hi>metaphorical</hi> Senses upon Words which are commonly taken in other Senses; especially when it is no Sacramental thing, which in its own Nature is Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That which suits most with the Scope and Design not only of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Places, but of the whole <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; which is, to magnifie God and to depress Man? to set forth, the Infinite Love and Condescension of God <hi>in giving his Son to be a Propitiation for our Sins</hi>; to set up the Worship of one <hi>true God</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Creatures</hi>; to Represent and Declare the mighty Advantages Mankind receive by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That which hath been generally receiv'd in the <hi>Christian Church</hi> to be the Sense of those places. For, we are certain, this was always look'd on as a matter of great Concernment to all Christians;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:37433:199"/>
and they had as great Capacity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Sense of the Apostles: and the Primitive Church had greater Helps for knowing it than others at so much greater Distance. And therefore the Sense is not to be taken from modern <hi>Inventions,</hi> or <hi>Criticisms,</hi> or pretences to <hi>Revelation</hi>; but that which was at first deliver'd to the <hi>Christian Church</hi> and hath been since received and embraced by it in the several Ages; and hath been most strenuously asserted, when it hath met with Opposition, as founded on <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>general Consent</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) That which best agrees with the <hi>Characters</hi> of those Persons from whom we recive the Christian Faith; and those are <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> and his <hi>holy Apostles.</hi> For, if their <hi>Authority</hi> be lost, our Religion is gone; and their Authority depends upon their <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> and Care to inform the World aright in matters of so great Importance.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) I begin with the Character which the Apostles give of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> himself; which is, that he was a Person of the greatest Humility and Condescension, that he did not assume to himself that
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:37433:199"/>
which he might justly have done. For let the Words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be understood either as to the <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Dignity</hi> of Christ, it is certain that they must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thus much, that when <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> was here on Earth, he was not of a vain assuming humour, that he did not boast of himself, nor magnifie his own Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but was contented to be look'd on as other Men; although he had at that time far greater and Diviner Excellency in him than the World would believe. Less than this, cannot be made of those Words of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Who being in the form of God, he thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this being the <hi>Character</hi> given of him, let us consider what he doth affirm concerning himself. For although he was far from drawing the People after him, by setting forth his own Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet upon just Occasions, when the <hi>Iews</hi> contested with him, he did Assert such things, which must savour of Vanity and Ostentation, or else must imply that he was the <hi>Eternal Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> For, all Mankind are agreed that the highest degree of Ambition lies in Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:37433:200"/>
Divine Honour, or for a meer Man to be thought a <hi>God.</hi> How severely did God punish <hi>Herod</hi> for being pleased with the Peoples folly in crying out, <hi>the Voice of God and not of Man</hi>?<note place="margin">Act. 12 22.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could never have born with such positive Assertions and such repeated Defences of his being <hi>the Son of God</hi> in such a manner as implied his being so from Eternity. This in his Disputes with the <hi>Iews</hi> he affirms several times, <hi>that he came down from Heaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh 6. 32, 33.</note> not in a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> but in a proper Sense, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by those words, <hi>What and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">38.50.58.62</note> In another <hi>Conference</hi> he assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Joh 8.58.</note> 
                     <hi>that he was before Abraham.</hi> Which the <hi>Iews</hi> so literally understood, that without a <hi>Metaphor they went about to stone him</hi>;<note place="margin">v. 59.</note> little imagining that by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was to be understood. But above all, is that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression which he used to the <hi>Iews</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conference,<note place="margin">Joh. 10.30.</note> 
                     <hi>I and my Father are one</hi>; which they understood in such a manner that immediately <hi>they took up stones to have stoned him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 31.</note> What means all this Rage of the <hi>Iews</hi> against him? What? for saying <hi>that he had Vnity of Consent with his Father?</hi> No certainly.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:37433:200"/>
                     <hi>But the Iews misunderstood him.</hi> Let us suppose it; would not our <hi>Saviour</hi> have immediately explained himself to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent so dangerous a Misconstruction? But he asked them, what it was they stoned him for? They answer him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and plainly,<note place="margin">v. 32, 33.</note> 
                     <hi>because that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man makest thy self God.</hi> This was home to the purpose. And here was the time for him to have denied it, if it had not been so. But doth he deny it? Doth he say, it would be <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in him to own it? No; but he goes about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; and proves it to be no <hi>Blasphemy for him to say that he was the Son of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> so <hi>as to be God,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it. Can we imagine that a <hi>meer Man</hi> knowing himself to be such, should As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume this to himself; and yet <hi>God</hi> to bear witness to him not only by <hi>Miracles</hi> but by a <hi>Voice from Heaven,</hi> wherein he was called his <hi>beloved Son in whom he was well pleased?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> Could God be pleased with a mortal, finite, despicable Creature, as the <hi>Iews</hi> thought him, that assumed to himself to be <hi>God,</hi> and maintained and defended it among his own People, in a solemn <hi>Conference</hi> at a very Publick Place, in one of the <hi>Portico's</hi> of the Temple? And this he persisted in to the last. For,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:37433:201"/>
when <hi>the High Priest adjured him by the living God to tell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26.63.</note> 
                     <hi>whether he were the Christ the Son of God,</hi> (for he, no doubt, had heard of the <hi>Result</hi> of this <hi>Conference</hi> in <hi>Solomon's Porch) Iesus said unto him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 64. Mark 14.62.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast said, S. Mark,</hi> more expresly, <hi>Iesus said, I am.</hi> And this was the <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi> for which they put him to death; as appears by the <hi>Evangelists.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 64.</note> So that this ought to be a Dispute only between <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth 26.66.</note> since it was the very point, for which they condemned him to death. And in his last most divine Prayer just before his suffering, he owns the <hi>Glory</hi> which he had <hi>with the Father</hi> before the World had a being. <hi>And now, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.71. Joh. 17.5.</note> 
                     <hi>glorifie thou me with the glory which I had with thee, before the World was.</hi> Was this nothing but the <hi>Glory</hi> which <hi>God</hi> had designed to give him? This is so far from being peculiar to Christ, that it is common to all whom <hi>God</hi> designs to glorifie; and takes away the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the <hi>Decree</hi> and the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) As to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the Reason we believe their Testimony is, that they were Men of great Sincerity and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of great Zeal for the Honour and Glory of God. And according to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:37433:201"/>
this <hi>Character,</hi> let us examine what they say concerning <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that was most conversant with him, and beloved by him, and lived to see his <hi>Divinity</hi> contested by some, and denied by others, is most ample in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it forth in his Admirable, Sublime,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and Divine Introduction to his Gospel.

of Sinners; whereas, if they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed they are no longer <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and if they are not Revealed, how come they to be made Articles of Faith? The Scripture knows of no other <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Faith</hi> but such as were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before the Revelation of them, but since they are Revealed they are plain and open to all mens Capacities; and therefore it is a great Injury to the Plainness and Simplicity of the Gospel to impose such incomprehensible My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, as Necessary Articles of Faith; and it is abusing the Credulity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to make such things necessary to be believed, which are impossible to be understood. But those who have ever loved to deceive and abuse the rest of the World, have been always fond of the Name of <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and therefore all such things are to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which come under that Name.

                  <p n="1">(1.) That God may justly require from us in general, the Belief of what we cannot comprehend. It is to very little purpose to enquire whether the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> be applied to such particular Doctrines, whose Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is revealed, but the manner of them is incomprehensible by us; for why may not we make use of such a Word whereby to express things truely revealed, but above our Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:37433:203"/>
We are certain the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> is used for things far less difficult and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse; and why may it not then be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to such matters, which are founded on Divine Revelation, but yet are too deep for us to go to the bottom of them? Are there not <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Arts, <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Nature, <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? And what Absurdity is there to call those <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which in some Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure are known, but in much greater unknown to us? Although therefore in the Language of Scripture it be granted, that the word <hi>Mystery</hi> is most frequently applied, <hi>to things before hidden, but now revealed,</hi> yet there is no Incongruity in calling that a <hi>Mystery,</hi> which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, hath yet something in it which our understandings cannot reach to. But it is meer Cavilling to insist on a Word, if the Thing it self be granted. The chief thing therefore to be done is, to shew that God may require from us the belief of such things which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible by us. For, <hi>God</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing from us, which it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to do; if it be then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to give Assent where the manner of what <hi>God</hi> hath revealed is not comprehended, then <hi>God</hi> may certainly

We know that either God must have been for ever, or it is impossible he ever should be; for if he should come into Being when he was not, he must have some Cause of his Being; and that
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:37433:205"/>
which was the first Cause would be God. But, if he was for ever he must be from himself; and what Notion or Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can we have in our Minds concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? And yet, <hi>Atheistical</hi> men can take no Advantage from hence; because their own most absurd <hi>Hypothesis</hi> hath the very same Difficulty in it. For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing must have been for ever. And it is far more reasonable to suppose it of an Infinite and Eternal Mind, which hath Wisdom and Power and Goodness to give Being to other things, than of dull, stupid and sensless Matter, which could never move it self, nor give Being to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing besides. Here we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thing which must be owned by all; and yet such a thing which can be conceived by none. Which shews the narrowness and shortness of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and how unfit they are to be the Measures of the Possibilities of things. <hi>Vain men would be wise</hi>; they would fain go to the very bottom of things, when alas! they scarce understand the very Surface of them. They will allow no <hi>Mysteries</hi> in Religion; and yet every thing is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to them. They cry out of <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Mysteries</hi>; and yet there is
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:37433:205"/>
not a Spire of Grass but is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to them; they will bear with nothing in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> which they cannot comprehend, and yet there is scarce any thing in the World which they can comprehend. But above other things the <hi>Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> even those which are most Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Necessary are above their Reach. For let such Men try their Imaginations about God's <hi>Eternity,</hi> not meerly how he should be from himself, but how God should coexist with all the Differences of Times, and yet there be no Succession in his own Being. I do not say there is such Difficulty to conceive a Rock stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still when the Waves run by it; or the <hi>Gnomon</hi> of a Dial when the Shadow passes from one Figure to another; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are gross unactive things; but the Difficulty is far greater where the Being is Perfect and always Active. For, where there is Succession there is a passing out of not being in such a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into being in it; which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Absolute Perfection of the Divine Nature. And therefore God must be all at once what he is, without any Respect to the Difference of Time past, present or to come. From whence <hi>Eternity</hi> was defined by <hi>Boethius</hi> to <hi>be a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:37433:206"/>
perfect and complete Possession all at once of everlasting Life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol. l. 3.</note> But how can we from any Conception in our Minds of that being all at once, which hath such different Acts as must be measur'd by a long Succession of Time? As, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Dissolving the Frame of the World; the promising and sending the <hi>Messias</hi>; the Declaring and Executing a general Judgment; how can these things be consistent with a Permanent Instant, or a Continuance of being without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession? For, it is impossible for us in this Case, as to God's Eternity, to form a clear and distinct <hi>Idea</hi> in our Mind, of that which both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> convince us must be. The most we can make of our Conception of it is, that God hath neither Beginning of Being, nor End of Days; but that he always was and always must be. And this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a necessary Conclusion from Reason and Scripture, than any distinct Notion or Conception of Eternity in our Minds. From whence it evidently follows, that God may reveal something to us, which we are bound to believe, and yet after that Revelation the Manner of it may be incomprehensible by us, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Mystery</hi> to us.</p>

                  <p>But let such men Examine their own thoughts about this matter; and try, whether the utmost they can attain to, be not something <hi>Negative,</hi> viz. because great Absurdities would follow if we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed any thing <hi>Corporeal</hi> to God; for, then he must be compounded of Parts, and so he may be dissolved; then he must be confined to a certain place, and not every-where present; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the Power of Acting and Self-determining which a meer Body hath not. For the clearest Notion we can have of <hi>Body,</hi> is, that it is made up of some things as parts of it, which may be separated from each other; and is confined to a certain place, and hath no Power to move or act from it self. But some of these men who cry down <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>

and magnifie Reason, to shew how slender their pretences to Reason are, have asserted a <hi>Corporeal God,</hi> with <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi> It was indeed, well thought of by those who would make <hi>a Man</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> to bring <hi>God</hi> down as near to <hi>Man</hi> as might be. But how to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Notion of a Body with Infinite Perfections, is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to me, and far above my Comprehension. But if it be no <hi>Mystery</hi> to such Men, they must either deny God's Infinite Perfections or shew how a bodily Shape can be capable of them.

But how can they solve the Difficulties about <hi>Divine Prescience</hi>? Is there no <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> in this? Nothing above their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension? What then made their great Master deny it,<note place="margin">

Because nothing can be fore-known but what hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cause, and therefore, if evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be fore-told, God must be the Cause of them, and Men will not be free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in them. And yet it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Sufferings of Christ by the Wickedness of Men, were fore-told. What then? Must we make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Sin? God forbid. Will the righteous Judge of all the Earth, punish Mankind for his own Acts, which they could not avoid? Then we must yield, that there is something in the manner of the <hi>Divine Prescience,</hi> which is above our Comprehension.

                  <p>I shall not now insist on any more of the particular Attributes of God, but only in general I desire to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe them to be <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite?</hi> If to be <hi>finite,</hi> then they must have certain bounds and limits which they cannot exceed; and that must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be from the imperfection of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or from a Superiour Cause, both which are repugnant to the very Being of God. If they believe them to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> how can they comprehend them? We are strangely puzled in plain, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, finite things; but it is madness to pretend to comprehend what is <hi>Infinite</hi>; and yet if the Perfections of God be not <hi>Infinite</hi> they cannot belong to Him.</p>
                  <p>I shall only add, in Consequence to this Assertion, <hi>That if nothing is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but what may be comprehended,</hi> the very <hi>Being of God</hi> must be rejected too. And therefore I desire all such who talk so warmly against any <hi>Mysteries in Religion,</hi> to consider whose work it is they are doing; even theirs who under
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:37433:208"/>
this pretence go about to overthrow all Religion.
<q>For, say they, <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Mystery</hi> in its own Nature; not this or that, or the other Religion; but <hi>they are all alike,</hi> all is <hi>Mystery</hi>; and that is but another Name for <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Imposture.</hi> What were the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Mysteries</hi> but tricks of <hi>Priest-craft</hi>; and such are maintained and kept up in all kinds of Religion. If therefore these men, who talk against <hi>Mysteries</hi> understand themselves, they must in pursuance of their Principles reject <hi>one God,</hi> as well as <hi>three Persons</hi>; For, as long as they believe an Infinite and Incomprehensible Being, it is Nonsense to reject any other Doctrine, which relates to an <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>Incomprehensible.</hi>

We say that he made himself a voluntary Sacrifice for Expiation of the Sins of Mankind; and so there was a great and noble End designed, and no Injury done to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Mind; and the <hi>Scripture</hi> as plainly expresses this, as it can do in Words.

For as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the great Intention of it is to magnifie the wonderful Love of God in the sending of his Son; so it is as plain that one great End of the Christian Doctrine was to take Mankind off from giving Divine Worship to Creatures; and can we then suppose that at the same time it should set up the <hi>Worship</hi> of a <hi>meer Man</hi> with all the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> which belongs to <hi>God?</hi> This is to me an <hi>incomprehensible Mystery</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and far beyond all that is implied in the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> For it subverts the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Design of Christianity as to the Reforming <hi>Idolatry</hi> then in being; it lays the Foundation for introducing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

away, in the matter of Worship, there is nothing left but the Declaration of his Will; which doth not exclude more <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Intercession</hi> but upon this Ground, that the <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> is the Foundation of that of <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> And it is far more easie for us to suppose there may be some things too hard for us to understand in the Mystery of our <hi>Redemption by Iesus Christ,</hi> than that at the same time it should be both <hi>a Duty</hi> and <hi>a Sin</hi> to worship any but the <hi>true God</hi> with proper Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. For if it be Idolatry to give it to a Creature, then it is a great Sin; for so the Scripture still accounts it; but if we are bound to give it to Christ who is but a Creature, then that which in it self is a Sin, is now become a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Duty; which overthrows the Natural Differences of Good and Evil, and makes <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be a meer <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> thing. And I take it for granted, that in Matters of Religion, <hi>Moral</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties are more to be regarded than <hi>Intellectual</hi>; because Religion was far more designed for a Rule of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than for the Satisfaction of our Curiosity.

                  <p>But a <hi>God by Office</hi> who is not so <hi>by Nature</hi> is a new and <hi>incomprehensible Mystery.</hi> A <hi>Mystery hidden from Ages and Generations</hi> as to the Church of God; but not <hi>made known by the Gospel of his Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is such a kind of <hi>Mystery</hi> as the <hi>Heathen</hi> Priests had, who had <hi>Gods many and Lords many,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.5.</note> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>i. e.</hi> many by <hi>Office</hi> although but one <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But if the Christian Religion had owned <hi>one God by Nature</hi> and only <hi>one by Office,</hi> the Heathens had been to blame chiefly in the Number of their Gods by <hi>Office,</hi> and not in the Divine Worship which they gave to them. But S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:37433:213"/>
blames the Heathens for <hi>doing Service to them which by Nature are no Gods</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 4.8.</note> not for doing it without Divine Authority, nor for mistaking the Person who was God by Office, but in giving Divine Worship to them who <hi>by Nature were no Gods</hi>; which he would never have said, if by the Christian Doctrine, Divine Worship were to be given to one who was not <hi>God by Nature.</hi>

                     </gap>, that <hi>Christ</hi> did suffer very much both in his Mind and in his Body. In his Mind,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.21.</note> when it is said, <hi>that he was
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:37433:217"/>
troubled in Spirit</hi>;<note place="margin">Matt. 26.37, 38.</note> that <hi>he began to be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and very heavy</hi>; and soon after, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowfull, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death.</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Mark 14.33, 34. Luke 22.44.</note> 
                     <hi>that he was in an Agony</hi>; wherein he not only <hi>prayed more earnestly, but his sweat was as it were great Drops of Blood falling to the Ground.</hi> What made this Amazement, and dreadfull Agony in the mind of the most innocent Person in the World? Was it meerly the Fear of the Pains of Death which he was to undergo? That is impossible, considering the Assurance which he had of so glorious a Reward so soon following after; when so many Martyrs endured such exquisite Torments for his sake without any such Disturbance or Consternation. But the Apostles give us another Account of it. S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> he was <hi>to bear our Sins in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the tree</hi>;<note place="margin">3.18.</note> that <hi>Christ suffered for Sins, the just for the unjust.</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> 
                     <hi>that God made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that he might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in him.</hi> Hereby we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how so innocent a Person came to suffer; <hi>he stood in our stead; he was made Sin for us</hi>; and therefore was to be treated as a Sinner; and to suffer that on our Account, which he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:37433:218"/>
on his own. If he suffer'd on his own Account, this were the way to fill our Minds with perplexity concerning the Justice of Providence with Respect to his dealings with the most innocent and holy Persons in this World; If he suffer'd on our Account, then we have the Benefit of his Sufferings, and therein we see how displeasing to God sin is, when even his own Son suffer'd so much by taking the guilt of our Sins upon him. And what can tend more to the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in us a due hatred of sin, than to consider what <hi>Christ</hi> himself suffer'd on the Account of it? What can make us have more dreadful thoughts of it, than that the great and merciful God, when he designed <hi>to save sinners,</hi> yet would have his own Son to become <hi>a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for the Sins of Mankind?</hi> And unless we allow this, we must put force upon the plainest Expressions of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; and make <hi>Christ</hi> to suffer meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew God's Power over a most innocent Person, and his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to inflict the most severe Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any Respect to <hi>Guilt.</hi> And surely such a Notion of <hi>God,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>worthy of all Acceptation.</hi>

Which tends most to strengthen our <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Salvation by Christ Iesus.</hi> If we believe that he suffer'd for our Sins, then we have great Reason to hope for the Forgiveness of them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been many and great, if we sincerely Repent; because the most prevailing Argument for Despair will be removed; which is taken from the <hi>Iustice of God,</hi> and his declared <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Displeasure</hi> against <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> If God be so much in earnest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Sins of Mankind, and his Justice be concerned in the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sinners, how can they ever hope to escape, unless there be a way for his Displeasure to be removed, and his Justice to be satisfied? And this the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us is done by <hi>Christ,</hi> who died that he might be a <hi>Sacrifice of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to Reconcile us to God by his Death</hi>; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly affirms.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10. 2 Cor. 5.19. Heb. 9.15.</note> And by this means, we may have strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation from the Hopes of Forgiveness of our Sins. Whereas, if this be taken away, either Men must believe that <hi>God</hi> was not in earnest displeased with the Sins of Mankind; which must exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly lessen our Esteem of the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Iustice of God</hi>; or if he were so
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:37433:219"/>
displeased, that he laid aside his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, without any <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of <hi>Expiation.</hi> And so, as many as look on <hi>God's Iustice</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> as necessary and essential Attributes of God, will be in danger of sinking into the Depths of Despair, as often as they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect seriously on the Guilt of their Sins. But on the other side, if we believe that while we were <hi>Enemies we were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God by the death of his Son</hi>; then we may <hi>have Peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>; and have reason to believe that there will be <hi>no Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that are in Christ Iesus</hi> by a lively Faith and sincere Repentance; then they may with Comfort look up to God as a Reconciled Father, through <hi>Iesus Christ our Mediator:</hi> then they may with inward Satisfaction look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, and stedfastly hope for that Salvation which Christ purchased on Earth and will at last bestow on all such as Love and Obey him. To which God of his Infinite Mercy bring us all through <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> For, <hi>This is a faithfull Saying and worthy of all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that he came into the World to save Sinners.</hi>
