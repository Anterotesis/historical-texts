            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>IT was the Complaint of a Perſon no leſs eminent in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then Dr. <hi>Don,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of King <hi>David,</hi> I mean as they were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Metre in his time, and by that means being adapted to the Vulgar Tunes, were made a conſiderable Part of the Publick Worſhip, ſhould be admitted into the Church in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and unmannerly Dreſs. That Great Perſon, who himſelf expreſſing his own Thoughts and Notions with ſo much Rapture and Sublimity, muſt certainly be deem'd a competent Judge, in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em upon the Tranſlation of the Pſalms by Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> and his Siſter the Counteſs of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<pb facs="tcp:153830:3"/>
condoling the Misfortune of theſe Celeſtial Hymns, ſo rudely handl'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pens. Says he,</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Songs are theſe, which Heav'ns High Holy Muſe</l>
               <l>Whiſper'd to <hi>David, David</hi> to the <hi>Jews:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſors in Holy Zeal,</l>
               <l>In Forms of Joy and Art do re-reveal</l>
               <l>To us ſo ſweetly, and ſincerely too,</l>
               <l>That I muſt not rejoice as I would do,</l>
               <l>When I behold that theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> are become</l>
               <l>So well attir'd abroad, ſo ill at home;</l>
               <l>So well in Chambers, in thy Church ſo ill,</l>
               <l>As I can ſcarce call that reform'd, untIl</l>
               <l>This be reform'd —</l>
            </q>
            <p>Since the Death of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons have attempted to redreſs this Grievance with more Zeal then good Succeſs; for Zeal and Poetry are two different Inſpirations that do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompany one another. Men may be good Men, eloquent Divines, moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preachers, yet but very bad Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. <hi>Sandys</hi> of later times, and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:153830:3"/>
before him, both adventur'd to imp their Muſes Wings with Cherubims Feathers, and ſuffer 'em to expatiate in the Tempes of Fancy and Exuberancy; yet <hi>Cowley</hi> in his Preface to his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daric Odes, ranges both thoſe Great Men among thoſe that have not hit the Mark. For, ſays He, All the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators</hi> of the Pſalms of <hi>David, even Mr.</hi> Sands <hi>Himself (for in deſpite of Popular Error, I will be bold not to Except him) are ſo far from doing Honour, or at least Juſtice to that Divine Poet, that, methinks, they revile him worſe then</hi> Shimei. <hi>And</hi> Buchanan <hi>himſelf, who much the beſt of them all, and indeed a great Perſon, comes, in my Opinon, no leſs ſhort of</hi> David, <hi>then his Country does of</hi> Judea. And the Reaſon of this he gives to be, becauſe that none of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſought to ſupply the loſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of another Language, with new ones in their own. To this I cannot forbear adding, That all the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have hitherto ſeen ſince his time, are equally as guilty of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
<pb facs="tcp:153830:4"/>
Faults, and are ſo far from ſupplying us with the Excellencies of our Language, that where they are forc'd, for their conveniency, to gloſs upon the Senſe of the Text, they rather deform the Granduer of the Sacred Authors's Style with flat and inſipid Notions of their own, and Expreſſions no leſs impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, mean, and vulgar. They fetch in Rhimes by the Head and Shoulders like ſo many obſtinate Delinquents, and bind 'em with the Chains of Impropriety ànd Incongruity to Words and Sentences al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together forc'd and foreign from the true Signification: and all this, to patch up a Clink i'the Cloſe. And while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Reformers of others, ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Idiom of the Language which they pretend to be Maſters of. <hi>Unri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall'd,</hi> of which the Tranſlators <hi>N. B.</hi> and <hi>N. T.</hi> ſeem to be proud off, is an Epithite by no means proper for <hi>God:</hi> And <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> ten times worſe for the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi> For <hi>Incarnate</hi> is a word more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taken in an ill then a good Senſe. We ſay of Women that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Brawling and Scolding, that they
<pb facs="tcp:153830:4"/>
are Devils Incarnate. And therefore Words that admit of a twofold and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Signification, are to be carefully avoided in a Sacred Tranſlation. Their Cadences, which ought to fall with the greateſt eaſe and ſoftneſs imaginable, are harſh and violent, rather like the Shogs and Rubs of Carts and Coaches againſt the Poſts i'the Street, then natural Cloſes. Of this number are <hi>The feather'd Throng,</hi> ſpoken of Birds. <hi>His rains from Heav'n parch'd Hills recruite; and Storms, the ſwift wing'd Steeds with which he flies.</hi> Really, not good Senſe. <hi>And make the angry Sea comply— Let all the World, O Lord, combine, to praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall the Teeming Ground a large Increaſe diſcloſe</hi>— Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions will ſerve in a Ballad, but there is nothing of Flight, nothing of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity in 'em. Of the ſame nature are, <hi>A thouſand dewy Sweats diſtill'd— Thy word unſeal'd the Springs — You who the Lord adore, your Vows before him lay— Thy ratling Thunders roard around— As Floods
<pb facs="tcp:153830:5"/>
through ancient Forreſts roar, or Mountain Shrubs ſurprize— God for their Diet finds a way— When great they ſeem, like ſome large Cloak, let ſhame be round 'em rould</hi>— But enough of theſe Blunders in General, little ſuperiour to <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold:</hi> for they do ſo <hi>Scaturire,</hi> that it would almoſt require a Tranſcription of the whole to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat 'em all. In ſhort, the Poetry, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>N. B.</hi> and <hi>N. T</hi>'s is very ordinary, and inſipid, not to be call'd Poetry; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture nothing better then Linſey Woolſey, and the Stuffing meer Thrums.</p>
            <p>To come to particulars, I would fain know how <hi>N. B.</hi> and <hi>N. T.</hi> could pick out of theſe words, <hi>Beterem javinou Sirothekem Atad,</hi> in the 58th. Pſalm, <hi>Ante ſpinae Veſtrae creſcant in Rham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> this piece of ill ſounding and ſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitous Senſe, <hi>E're Thorns can make the Fleſhpots Boyl;</hi> 'twas certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Dinner; For I cannot ſee the leaſt ground in the words for ſuch a <hi>Pye Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> Expreſſion. In the 95th. Pſalm the Text runs thus, <hi>Ki El Gadol Jehova,
<pb facs="tcp:153830:5"/>
ou melek Gadol gnal Col Elohim. Quia Deus Magnus Jehova, &amp; rex Magnus ſuper omnes Deus.</hi> Theſe words <hi>N. B.</hi> and <hi>N. T.</hi> thus Tranſlate.</p>
            <q>
               <l>For God the Lord, enthron'd in State,</l>
               <l>Is with unrival'd Glory great,</l>
               <l>A King Superiour far to all,</l>
               <l>Whom by his Title God we call.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Here are no leſs then two Blunders to ſupply the conciſeneſs of the Text; <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall'd Glory,</hi> hardly warrantable; <hi>whom by his Title God we call,</hi> of which there is nothing at all in the Text; only it was a hard Shift which might have been ſupply'd with much better words. Theſe occurr'd to the firſt Glances of my Eye, and I was unwilling to examin any farther for fear of meeting many more. I ſhall ſay nothing farther at preſent of their Tranſlation, but that it is too full of <hi>He'ls</hi> and <hi>He's,</hi> deformities not to be endur'd in true and elegant Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:153830:6"/>As for the Pſalms that have lately appear'd under the Name of Mr. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn,</hi> they may be truly ſaid to be his: For the whole is an exuberant Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, with little of <hi>David</hi> in it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they may be rightly call'd <hi>David's</hi> Pſalms in Diſguiſe. For why ſhould this Gentleman ſpend ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberancy of words upon only <hi>Ahſre ha Iſch,</hi> in the firſt Pſalm, <hi>Beatus Vir, A thouſand Bleſſings crown his Head</hi>— Or how it could come into his Mind to fancy the <hi>dreadful Sound of the laſt Trumpet</hi> in the word <hi>Miſchphat,</hi> which ſignifies in that place no more then an Aſſembly, which is plain from its being coupled with the word <hi>Gnadath,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Caetus.</hi> Or laſtly, how could he extract ſuch an effluvium from the firſt words of the ſecond Pſalm, <hi>Lummat Ragſchou Goiim, ou leummim yehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou Rik.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>God's wife Decrees are fix'd and ſtrong</l>
               <l>As his Eternal Throne;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:153830:6"/>Why then ſhould Heathen Fools ſo long</l>
               <l>His Sacred Power diſown?</l>
               <l>Vain are their hopes, vain every thought,</l>
               <l>And all their words are vain,</l>
               <l>For what Gods mighty Hands have wrought,</l>
               <l>God's mighty Hands maintain.</l>
            </q>
            <p>What is this to the Purpoſe? nothing I'm ſure to the Text: And beſides the Elegancy of the double expoſtulation is loſt. Such Paraphraſes as theſe rather miſlead then Inſtruct. And therefore <hi>Benedicat Deus operi &amp; Authori.</hi> Paraphraſes are nothing to our Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>There is in the laſt place a ſmall Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men printed for the Company of Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the reforming of old <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> but it begins ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, that I dàre be bold to aſſert, that the Honour of reforming thoſe Authors is not reſerv'd for that Gentleman. For the firſt Pſalm inſtead of being reform'd is render'd ten times worſe then it was before. There is ſuch a Hyſteron Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teron in the two firſt Lines, that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

bles you at the very Threſhold, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently calls for a Candle to light you to the Sence.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The Man is bleſt, by ill advice,</l>
               <l>To walk, who doth forbear.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The reſt is much of the ſame Form and Stile; from whence we may ſafely conclude, that the Expreſſions of <hi>Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins</hi> are too beggarly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to want any more Patching.</p>
            <p>It may be objected in defence of theſe Gentlemen, that they condeſcend to a mean and vulgar way of expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the better underſtanding of the Common People, and in complyance with their Capacities. But whoſe fault is that, the People are no better taught? At leaſt I am ſure it would be much more for the Honour of the Publick Worſhip that they ſhould be better inſtructed, then to ſing the Praiſes of God in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and incongruous Language. 'Tis the General Opinion, that the Pſalms

of <hi>David,</hi> in their Original Beauty were the moſt exalted Productions of a divine and ſoaring Genius, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the Perfection of the Hebrew Idiome, and that they were inrich'd with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Eloquent Conciſeneſs which our Modern Languages cannot reach, without the help of Paraphraſe and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocutions. However thoſe two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances are very warily to be made uſe of; by no means too profuſely; yet ſo as to ſupply the <hi>vacuums</hi> of our own Language with thoſe Beauties of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Idiom, which come the neareſt to the Grandeur of Style and Meaning of the Author: And to this a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Subject of the Pſalm, and the Occaſion of the Author's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and the Connexion and Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Sentences will very much contribute.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that there are ſome of theſe Pſalms that are written with a plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs befitting the Subjects of Penitence, Prayer and Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:153830:8"/>On the other ſide, there are others ſo truly Poetical, and full of ſublime Rapture, that if they be not follow'd with a Spirit and a Fancy in ſome meaſure adequate, they muſt of neceſſity looſe their Luſter.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore that Specimens are come into the Mode, and that ſo many have ſo good an Opinion of themſelves as to believe their Offerings worthy of the Publick View, I thought it now my time to be not <hi>Semper Auditor tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> eſpecially having by me ſo many as I have of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, ſome long ſince Tranſlated, and others of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> later Date. I know I ſhall not wait for Cenſure, having adventur'd to paſs my Judgment ſo freely upon others. But for that, my Years and Education may in ſome meaſure bear me out.</p>
            <p>The Method which I took, that I might avoid the Rock which others had dash'd againſt, was in the firſt place to throw off the Shackles of Rhime, a weight
<pb facs="tcp:153830:8"/>
that lyes a little too heavy upon Fancy and Invention, but which I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a Slave to. In the next place, I had the Aſſiſtance of the Original it ſelf, the Latin, and Greek Verſions, together with the Chaldee Paraphraſe, all which I examin'd with the beſt Judgment I had. Nor was I without the two Engliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, not refuſing to look upon <hi>Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> ſometimes, whether by accident or no, not far diſtant ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the Point.</p>
            <p>As for my Talent in Poetry, I leave that with the reſt for others to judge of: Only this I muſt add, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he be, who has not that Talent in ſome meaſure above <hi>N. B.</hi> and <hi>N. T.</hi> whatever his other Properties or Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are, ſhall never obtain much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit by Tranſlating <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms.</p>
            <p>I will not inſiſt upon the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Singing Pſalms in Churches, which would ſavour too much of inclining to Self-intereſt. 'Tis ſufficiedt for me, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has approv'd
<pb facs="tcp:153830:9"/>
the Cuſtome, and given 'em admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Congregations. And truly, ſince the Voices of the People are ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to what they have been, by the many Organs ſet up in ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in this Ciry, 'tis but Reaſon that the Words they Sing ſhould be reform'd as well. By whomſoever it be done, I ſhall not envy that Honour to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who does it as it ſhould be. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs as I have ſhewd my ſelf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſerve the Publick, I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it among the greateſt Felicities of my Life if ſuch a Work as this ſhould Crown the end of my Days.</p>
