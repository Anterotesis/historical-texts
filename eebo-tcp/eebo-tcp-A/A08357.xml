            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Quenes maiestie Quene Elizabeth is by al right the soueraigne Ladie &amp; Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of vs al, and of you too, &amp; that must ye otherwise acknowlege or otherwise fele, or both, to your terrour I speake it. Her grace is the most louing mother and Nourse of all her good subiectes, to your shame and reproch of vnkindenesse I say it. Her highnesse is the Husbande of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, maried to the Realme, and the same by ceremonie of ring as solemnely signified as any common ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is, to our great comfort and confidence I reherse it.

Call their doings to minde, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use them, wey them. They haue long agoe nourished this treason in their hartes: they haue bene long prouidyng for it: It was brought to her maiestie and her counsell by aduertisements: they haue ben tenderly delt with, priuately admonished of the rumours,

There is no white with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whitnesse, no good without goodnesse, none true without truthe, none faithefull without faithefulnesse, no subiecte without subiection and obedience: What do they herein else, but as all other traytoures and rebelles haue euer and ordinarily do, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselues to be true subiectes, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing otherwise that simple subiects wold not followe them at all?</p>

Of such a good meaning on your part may ryse a good doing, and hap a better spéeding than is yet to be looked for.</p>
            <p>But sée in what forme and particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this good meaning is expressed. Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <note place="margin">Nobilitie slandered.</note> (say they) and other haue giuen their faith to further this lewd meaning. If any such confederacie be, as it is not so greate as you be borne in hande, it shall be good to the parties to purge them of that ielousie in true seruice against your captayns and you. Neither can any be frée from the spot therof, that shall be founde to aduaunce, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, mainteyne or ioyne him selfe to any estate or title that importes her maiesties daunger, or hath impugned her highnesse safety, right or dignitie. No, no, this is but a colour to saunder Nobilitie, and deceiue you with vayne hope of desperate succors. You sée you finde it not, you are destitute and disappoynted of it. If suche leagues had bene, neuer looke that they will kéepe fayth with you that breake it with their Prince, or will ioyne with you, being no stronger than you be to beare them harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.

What hath her Maiestie or her counsell offended? Wherin is the Realme so daungered and oppressed, that it must haue violent remedy, it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide no delay of Counselling, no ordinarie meane of reformation: Northumberland, Westmerland &amp; Swinborn, like <hi>Catiline, Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Manlius</hi> must erecte a newe <note place="margin">The rule of three gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note>

Do they any thing without her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and good liking, as there is good cause? Make they any laws, require they any Subsidies, do they the greatest thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, without assent of the whole Realme, your owne assent by your deputies &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geses, yea your owne forsworne captains, in open parliament, wherunto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties assent is had? or in cases out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is ought put in execution without her highnesse will and pleasure? Do they their things here, trow you, as you do your things there? O impudent beastes to bears you so in hande. O deceyued fooles you to beleue it. But O mad doltes so rashly to hazard your possessions, liues, good names, wiues, chyldren, hauiour, yea soules, and all vpon credit of so false reports. It is her Maiestie that dothe these good thinges her selfe, and honorably auoweth and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will vpholde the doing of those things which your captaynes call misdoings, and will defende the persons of those good and

Thus knowe ye, that her Maiestie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon her the iustification of her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and her Counsels ministerie therein. Therefore when your Earles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse these about the Quéene, they accuse the Queene her selfe. It is but coloure to abuse you. They would say the Queene, if they thought ye would well take it. And it G O D were so farre angry with vs as to giue them miraculous victorie against all likelihode, yea and in mans eye against all possibilitie, no dout her Maiestie shoulde féele it with the fowlest indignitie that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was séen in earth. And if it lay in them to spoile her maiesty and the realme of her good counsellers, their slender curtesie to her person would sone appere. Ceasse then to be so beguiled, take that shadow away, and take it as truthe is, that your Earles proclamation in déede sayth, though not in the selfe same sillables, that the Quéenes Maiestie with her Nobilitie, Parliament,

They haue frequented the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice established by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon authority, they haue receyued Goddes Communion with hys Churche, they haue commended it, which if they had had the contrarie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to hart, they would not nor might haue done, vnlesse they woulde confesse them selues such as you ought not to beleue. But the truth is, they knowe that for want of sufficient preachyng, and especially for want of grace to receyue the truth of God preached, and partly also for that long settled errours euen in men otherwyse good and honest, must haue theyr time of instruction and parsuasion: by these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I say, there be many yet within the realme not well taught: the multitude of which simple men, they hoped by this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to draw to the felowship of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and that way to haue more helpe to shelde them selues from the power of Iustice, and so to gyue an aduenture by more ayde to escape the due punishement for these their treasons that otherwise in peasable place of iustice they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or auoyde.</p>
            <p>So still this is but colour, euen as is the same y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foloweth, that her Maiesties Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

haue disordered the Realme. Well they <note place="margin">Disordring the realme:</note> knowe it is not so, and well they know that they nor their auncesters neuer knewe it so well ordered. But if any would beléeue such sclander, they hoped thereby to winne the moe complices, and so to hide their owne daunger in the multitude. Consider the truthe of this colour. Wey the times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre and examine them truly. Let not false persuasions deceyue you. Be not so wild and wanton with welth, to forget whence your wealth commeth, or not to sée that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme hath it. Hadde Englande euer in our memorie so long so blissed peace bothe at home and abroad? Had euer true Nobilitie more tender indulgence and honorable che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing? Had euer subiectes more true and frée administration of law and right? Was England euer better ordered in all degrées, from hye to lowe, till your shamefull rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion hath interrupted the great blessing of God? Or hath all Christendome the like at this day, your lewde tumult onely excepted? Hath not her Maiestie with the aduise and ayde of her most honorable Counsell, so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered vs, that we haue as it were standing on shore beholden the shipwrackes of other nations? Liue we not dayly so our comfort with the fruites of this good gouernement?
<pb facs="tcp:13702:17"/>
It is suche, that as the case standeth, he is lyke to be vnhappy that shall ouerliue it. Is this the thankes due to her Maiestie and her Counsell for their care and trauayle for your preseruation? Suppose you that such kindnesse is the way to kepe GOD louing and beneficiall vnto vs? Repent your error, acknowledge with thankes the good order of the realme that you haue felt with profite, forsake the disorderers of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, and yelde to suche good order as they that haue wel, wisely, iustly and mercifully orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it can best dispose of you. You sée these be stil but false colours to deceiue moe subiects, to drawe moe adherentes, to helpe to shroud your seducers in communitie of perill.</p>
            <p>And of like sort, falshode and impudencie is that they say of seeking to destroy Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Destruction of nobilitie.</note> Though some of them that so proclaime haue bene noble, you must remember howe Nobilitie may rise and fal. There is no tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor noble, how notable soeuer he be, or how noble soeuer his auncesters were. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement for vertue to the most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order is no more due to good, valiant and true Gentlemen, than the defacing of the former ensignes of Nobilitie, and solemne spurning them into a ditch, is a due preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to desloyal and vntrue subiects, the very
<pb facs="tcp:13702:17"/>
stayne of whose companie, presence or fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the tokens of honoure true Nobilitie can not beare. Pitie it is that they haue so far forgotten the common wealth and their owh, so to deserue. But so deseruing, good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and necessarie iustice it is, that they beare their extremest infamie. Neither yet hath the Quenes maiestie nor her Counsell soughte their destruction, but they themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues haue now procured their owne, and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen you in with them. Let themselues say of the benefites they haue receyued of her maiestie, her good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance and supporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all her Counselles frendly and louing meanes to do them good: then iudge ye what cause they haue so to saye. As for the rest of the Nobilitie, as they be moste déepely bound to her maiestie for her good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tender loue and fauoure to them, which they ceasse not to acknowledge, and will do, euen with the aduenture of their liues, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and possessions, in her Maiesties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense, against all rebels and traytoures, and namely ageinst your Captaines and you: so are they full slenderly beholden to your two good Erles for defaming them with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenership of so fowle and abhominable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And for that the slaunder is generall, without particular naming of any, ye must
<pb facs="tcp:13702:18"/>
loke for the more general reuenge of all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie ageinst you, no one shrinking or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, but euery one moste forwardely pressing to purge himselfe by his good seruice from so great dishonoure, and to shewe hys thankfulnesse (the naturall propertie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) to her maiestie for her great kindnesse and tender loue to that whole degrée. Some of them to their great prayse, you sée, alredy haue shewed their truthe, in repressing your attempts, refusing your societies, &amp; in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to ouerthrow you. Eche man is so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest to desire a newe estate, as he hath most cause to be wery of the olde. In what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dayes did euer Nobilitie liue, or can they hope to liue in suche securitie, in suche (as it were) nerenesse and conuenient familiarity with their prince, so frée from vniust backbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, from vaine <unclear>ielosies</unclear> &amp; suspitions, from dangers by enimies reports or false accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from tumulte, war and malice one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, yea from all vnsuerties and vnquietnesses, as they haue done in her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties dayes? It is maruellous and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally miraculous, that there are founde such two (I meane your two Erles) to shew such vnkindnesse. Thinke not then that any moe of nobilitie be so ill minded. But be not deceyued, take the thing as truth is, this is
<pb facs="tcp:13702:18"/>
but a color, howbeit in dede a leud malicious suttle &amp; dangerous color, partly to the intent to rayse mistrust betwene her Maiestie and her nobles, if either were not so wel known to other as they be, &amp; partly or rather chiefly to deceiue and deteine you with hope of that whiche is not in déede. But as in the one they laboure in vayne, so in the other learne you to be wiser, &amp; to trust them the worse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. You finde it falleth not out so. Hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie hath euer cherished Nobilitie, no one of that estate hath by her perished in all her time, they know it and acknowledge it, and you must féele it. You sée that they come not to you, for all the promises and faithes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in your proclamation. It falleth not out as you are borne in hand: they are al in readinesse with their power ageinst you, to clere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, &amp; to wreke the dishonor vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. If this color deceiue you, you winke hard, or be maruelously blinded.

Neither I trust will her maiestie hir selfe, so yet giue ouer the care of her owne preseruation, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne all aduertisements of attempts, and not by good care and hed of hir counsel, yea &amp; extirpation of the contrarie, stand vpon her gard against all aduauncements <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

But in the meane time you sée, they haue brought you in a gay case, vpon trust of their words, their vayne colours in their procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, their false promises of great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours. You are in the way of vndoing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to helpe them to a little leysure to shift, or (if they abyde by it) to giue the aduenture of their most heynous treasons.</p>

The late tumults in king Edwards time haue taught al the wise people of the Realm, to beware of suche fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

Al the south, the east, eche part, the land, the sea, &amp; heauen it selfe are ioyned against you. Ech man séeth the horror of the fact, but your selues alone.

tie. If they meane by libertie lewde licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse, and dissolute disordre of lyfe, to haue no feare of God Prince, law, or shame, to haue no respect or awe of honestie, such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie I graunt they propounde vnto you, and giue you dayly examples of. But if the true libertie of Christes churche and flocke be, to heare his voyce, and no straungers, to be subiect or in bondage to no strange po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or vsurped tyrannie that shall syt in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences of christian men, captiuing them to an implicite &amp; general faith of what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they shall teach without the warrant of Christ the true head of the church, then your great Libertines bring but bondage and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie.

Gods grace hath forsaken. Pray to God to bring your hartes to libertie of considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you shall plainly see the libertie of the churche assayled by your owne factious, the libertie of your consciences captiued and the true libertie of your lyues in lawfull things restrayned. Sweete in deede is the name of libertie, &amp;c. the treasure of the thing it self beyond al value inestimable: so much the more it behoueth you to take hede that with the sweetenesse of the name you lese not the value of the thing. You may not thinke her maiestie her selfe, and her nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, clergie, and other good subiectes, so farre throwne downe in courage, as they woulde lose the fewell of libertie. Much lesse muste ye beleue your licentious bosters of libertie, that will bring you in deed nothing but bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.

            <p>They say they feare a reformation by <note place="margin">Strangers.</note> Strangers, to the hazard of the realme: and therefore forsooth these noble hazarders of
<pb facs="tcp:13702:21"/>
their own wealth, estate and honour, and of your sureties, must hazard the realme them selues, lest strangers should: and yet further withall, lest themselues should not suffise to hazard it enough, they directely signifie, and it is wel known that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues haue sought and vsed conspiracie of strangers to further the hazarde to their vttermost. But note the fraude I pray you, for the meaning is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you, and therefore it behoueth you to note it. They will not say directly, we haue practized with strangers to take our partes, for that were too broad and too plaine: but it must be penned in such words that you must be giuen to vnderstand that strangers are of that faction, yea and so far forward, that they are also ready to do that which you haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised, though forsooth your captains and they be not of one conspiracie. He is blinde that séeth it not. Al this is but to encourage you and to put you in hope of ayde, either by traytors in Englande, or enimies abroade: whence it come it makes no matter. But they deceiue you, it wil not be: wey it wel, féede not your selfe with vaine hopes.</p>
            <p>First, if strangers were dysposed to come, it is a mad saying, let vs rise and refourme least strangers come &amp; refourme, as though strangers hauing purpose to come, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

            <p>But God hath hetherto preserued this land from being subdued by these horrible treasons, and I trust hée will still, and in your poore case is most likelie to leaue your vain trust disapointed.

No, no, they be not yet so madde, though you be madder. There muste be greater heades and power than you be or haue at libertie, that they wil ioyne wythall.

What be your leaders? Your two Erles, you know wel, are euen of the meanest of all Nobilitie, in hauior, credite and power, to conducte you through so great and dangerous an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

Who knoweth not the enormities of his life, the indiscretion of ruling his owne, the great lackes &amp; dettes wherein he is by his owne fault endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, the estimation of him as of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned man, none otherwyse regarded than for the name sake of honor and some possibilitie that he might parhaps leaue a better son to amend the state of his house?

For the case of Religion: doth any man knowe that euer he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any religion or conscience at all, till now he makes an Apish counterfayting of fayned popish deuotion?

One with little wit far set, an other in his olde age wery of his welth, an other a runne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away with a yong wilde braine tickled to sée fashions. Alas, what be these to carry you through the serious and earnest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterprise that you haue in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:13702:25"/>
They are rather méeter to fraye you from it: méete men surely to followe your omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fatall or vnluckie ensignes, wounde and crosses, the apte and due signes of iust <note place="margin">Omen pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</note> slaughter, or infamous execution.</p>
            <p>But yet perhaps some of you haue this meaning that you owe them dutie, and for <note place="margin">Pretense of dutie.</note> dutie you will not forsake any danger. If this consideration haue place in any dutie, it hath it chiefly in the highest dutie which you haue despised. A mad excuse it is to say you entred into danger for duty, when the principall dutie did bid you sitte in quiet without danger at all. Euen such a fonde doing of dutie it is, as if one would kill his Father to please his Maister, or rather murder Father, Maister and him selfe to kepe promise with a théefe. What be these duties that may moue you? wey them and compare them. The name of <hi>Percies</hi> and <hi>Neuilles</hi> haue long bene honourable and well beloued among you, some of you and your for fathers haue ben auanced by them and their ancesters, some perhaps be knit in kinred, some be tenantes, some be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, some be with like causes allied and bound to the meaner Captaines. Greate things be these to moue loue and good nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhed, and of great importance and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie
<pb facs="tcp:13702:25"/>
to draw honest, true and kinde har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men to sticke by their Lords &amp; frends in all wars against the Princes enemies, and in al honest quarels and perilles: but small matters they be, yea no causes at all to draw any man to stand with any man in rebellions and treasons. Is <hi>Percie</hi> and <hi>Neuill</hi> more auncient, more beloued and deare vnto you, than your naturall Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Ladie, the Quéene of England, yea or England it selfe? Doth one small te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie moue you more than the holding of the whole realme? Is not in all your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and fealties vnto them, saued your faith and allegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to your souerain Lady? This is euen as vntoward a follie, as if a mad foole in a tempest would trauayle to drowne the whole ship to saue one of the mariners cabbens. This is not rightly considered of you.</p>
            <p>The common weale is the ship we sayle in, no one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be safe if the whole do perish. To god, &amp; then to the realme, to the croun, to the law and gouernment, your leaders and you &amp; we all do owe our selues and all that we haue, in highest degrée of dutie. Al other inferior duties are but meanes that these may be the better performed. When now your Captains haue forsaken faith &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13702:26"/>
dutie to God, naturall loue and dutie to the realme, allegeance and dutie to the Croune, obedience and duetie to lawe and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is no following of dutie to followe them against these duties, no thoughe they were your fathers. And that they haue done so you may not beléeue their pretenses, you must beléeue the booke of GOD which you haue troden vnder foote, ye must beleue the lawes of the Realme which you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously broken, you must beleeue the Quéenes Maiestie her selfe speaking in her Proclamations, and by the mouthes of her officers, whose gracious voice you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliously contemned.</p>
            <p>Now as I haue compared your smal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pretended, with your great duties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, <note place="margin">Their doings.</note> compare again your most due duties with your vndue doings. You haue without warrant fro the Q. Maiestie, or any by her authorized, assembled yourselues in forcible maner, adhered to those whom her maiestie hath declared traitors &amp; rebels, you haue le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied war within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm against the realm, within the Quenes dominions against the Quene, you haue broken the common peace wherby your selues, your families and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions haue hitherto bene preserued, you haue in your rebellious outrage committed
<pb facs="tcp:13702:26"/>
many haynous and horrible factes, you haue destroyed the monumentes of Gods moste holy Communion, you haue torne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the sacred Byble of Goddes most holy worde, the very pledge of youre saluation, you haue presumed to alter the forme of Christes Religion, you haue in dishonoure of Christes most blissed and onely sufficient sacrifice, sette vp the most abhominable and blasphemous sacrifice of wicked Masse, you haue committed vnnaturall and vyle cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vppon Gods Ministers and dispensers of Gods mysteries and of the health of youre Soules, you haue defaced Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, whereby all mankynde is preserued in chastitie and continued by lawefull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, you haue robbed your neyghboures, spoyled and destroyed the Quéenes true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, you haue wasted the prouision for your wiues and children, you haue vndone your selues. Trow you, this be your dutie, eyther as Christian men, Englishmen, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, tenauntes, husbandes, fathers, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yea or naturall men?</p>
            <p>And when you haue thus done, thynke you to beare it thus away? A piece of the Bishoprike of Durhamme and Richmond shire conteyneth not all Englande. Your courage may be good, I would it were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

You know you are but fewe, weake, vnarmed, vnfurnished to holde out, vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, vnskilfully guyded, sclenderly prouided for, falsely abused, fondly blinded, your captains not trustie to you, nor bound by any authoritie so to be, youre companie not holden togither by any iuste power but that they may slip away as their luste, their werynesse, their néede, their businesse, hope of pardon or better aduisement may come vppon them, your succoures faile you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, youre vittayles in a barren place not like long to endure, the season harde, your lodgings incommodious, your housholdes in perill of famine or destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in youre absence, no stoare of armoure, Weapon nor Munition, youre number of Horsse though not nowe manie, yet dayly like to be fewer, those necessaries that you haue eyther for defence, inuasion or suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance being once spente, no way to recouer more, one ouerthrowe destroyeth you whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you haue no meane to repaire yours force, you are enclosed round about, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge by Lande, no escape by Sea.
