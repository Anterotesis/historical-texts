            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
From a perſon of quality in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to an Officer of the Army, wherein is

Dated <date>the 25th. of <hi>October,</hi> 1659.</date>

               <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I have not been wanting (by uſing various wayes and means) to impart to you the ſtate of affairs here, yet leſt there ſhould
be a miſcarriage in all or any of them; I thought it a duty incumbent upon me in this our day, to diſpatch a ſure Meſſenger to
<hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> where I truſt he may meet with you, to give you a full account of things as they ſtand here, who is able to make you
an ample relation, and to whom I deſire you would give credit in what he ſhall impart to you; And leſt he ſhould omit any thing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I ſhall as briefly as I can hint it to you in theſe following lines.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt the 18th. inſtant, the Generall had notice that the Parliament was diſſolved. Whereupon he called Col. <hi>Wilkes,</hi> and
Capt. <hi>Miller, Morgan, Hubblethorn, Jerem. Smith, Grimble,</hi> and Lt. Col. <hi>Clobery</hi> (who had been with him 2. or 3. dayes before) to
conſult what to do; And it was reſolved, that he with the Army under his command ſhould declare for the Parliament againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Army in <hi>England,</hi> and for the better effecting thereof, agreed to turn out all as ſhould oppoſe the deſign. The next day
he came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he had appointed his own Regiment, and Col. <hi>Talbots</hi> to be in Armes. The latter had orders to have
lighted matches, powder and bullet, but his own had not. When he came to them, he declared to them, that a factious party of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>England</hi> had interrupted the Parliament, and that he reſolved with the Army under his Command to ſtand to the Parliament in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to them, and expected that they would ſtand by him accordingly; Declaring that he would ſatisfie them all their Arrears, at
which they were made to ſhout, and gave him three volleyes of ſhot. Which being done, he cauſed Captain <hi>Parker, Hatchman, Sto<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
Lievtenant <hi>Carter, Wells, Wilſon, Lindon,</hi> and all the reſt of the Anabaptiſt Officers (except <hi>Grom,</hi> and <hi>Walton</hi>) to be ſecured. Then
comming to <hi>Leith</hi> (the Regiment of Col. <hi>Wilkes</hi> being drawn up) He declared the ſame things to them, and paſt from them with the like ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and Col. <hi>Wilkes</hi> for a farewell gave him 15. or 17 great Guns from the Citadel. Of whoſe Regiment, the General cauſed to
be ſecured, Major <hi>Knoles,</hi> Lt. <hi>Burrell,</hi> Lt. <hi>Hughes,</hi> Enſign <hi>Wilkes,</hi> and Enſign <hi>Wood.</hi> Having thus ſecured theſe three Regiments, and
placed other Officers in the roomes of thoſe whom he had turned out, He diſpatched Letters to Lt. Col. <hi>Young,</hi> of Col <hi>Cobbets</hi> Regiment,
and Lt. Col. <hi>Keyn,</hi> and Major <hi>Kelke</hi> of <hi>Pearſons</hi> Regiments, to come over and conſult with him, about ſome weighty affairs: and when
they came, he clapt up Lt. Col. <hi>Young,</hi> and Major <hi>Kelke,</hi> and at the ſame time received advertiſement from Col. <hi>Read,</hi> that he and his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was at his ſervice, as likewiſe the ſame from Col. <hi>Fairfax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 21th. inſtant, he marched with ſome troops of Horſe and ſome companies of Foot to <hi>Lithgowe,</hi> in order (as it was
thought) to have gon to <hi>Ayre,</hi> but receiving intelligence there, that Lt. Col. <hi>Homes</hi> was got thither, did not proceed for fear he ſhould meet
with a repulſe, which in the beginning of this enterprize would have been of ill conſequence to his affairs. So that upon the 22th. he retreated
to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> again with his forces, where he created new Officers by Commiſſion under his own hand and ſeal, <hi>viz. Cloberry</hi> he made
Collonel of <hi>Cobbets</hi> Regiment, <hi>Hatt</hi> Lt. Col. and <hi>Dennis</hi> Major. To his own Regiment he hath made <hi>Morgan</hi> Lt. Col. <hi>Nicolls</hi> Major, and
<hi>Winter</hi> Captain of <hi>Homes</hi> his Company. <hi>Collins</hi> of <hi>Wilkes</hi> Regiment, hath <hi>Hatchmans</hi> Company. <hi>Biſhop</hi> the Farrier is a Lt. <hi>Sherman</hi>
(one of our caſhiered waiters) is made an Enſign, and all the reſt of the vacant places ſupplied by ſome ſuch men. <hi>Hublethorn</hi> is made Lt.
Col. and <hi>Emerſon</hi> Major of <hi>Talbots</hi> Regiment. All the forces here abouts being by this means at his devotion, He being aſſured of the reſt
in all other parts but <hi>Ayre,</hi> He reſolves to draw all to a randevouz in and about <hi>Edenburgh</hi> againſt the laſt of this Moneth at furtheſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ſuch as muſt be left in the Garriſons, (which he intends ſhall be but few) and expects to make 5000. Foot, and 800. Horſe, with
which he intends (as it is ſaid) immed<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ately to march for <hi>England. Witter</hi> commands in the Citadel of <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> and <hi>Keyn</hi> is this day gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to fetch hither the reſt of that Regiment, <hi>Fairfaxes, Cobets,</hi> and <hi>Reads,</hi> are already on their march hitherwards.</p>
            <p>This day Capt. <hi>Groom</hi> told me that both he and <hi>Walton</hi> would throw up their Commiſſions, as many that are inferiour Officers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Souldiers (who had the face of honeſty) have already done. The General hath wrote 3. Letters: one to the Speaker, another to the Lord
<hi>Fleetwood,</hi> and a third to the Lord <hi>Lambert;</hi> which he hath put in print and are herewith ſent.</p>
            <p>He hath alſo put forth a Declaration, which you ſhall receive from the bearer, ſigned by Clerk in behalf of the reſt. When none was at
the contriving of it but himſelf, <hi>Wilks, Morgan, Emerſon, Smith</hi> and <hi>Grimble.</hi> There is likewiſe a Letter he hath written to the Churches
(drawn by Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>) ſtuffe, with much of <hi>Booths</hi> Language, but I doubt I ſhall not get it for you, before the bearer goes away.</p>
            <p>All theſe printed papers he is diſpatching away in whole bundles to <hi>Hull</hi> by the <hi>Pearl Frigot,</hi> whereof Capt. <hi>Nixon</hi> is Commander, who
ſailes too morrow if wind and weather ſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homes</hi> came very ſafe to <hi>Ayre,</hi> though a party of Horſe was at his heeles. That place he and Col. <hi>Sawry</hi> with all the Officers reſolve to
keep, till they receive orders from the Councill of Officers above, (as I was aſſured by Letters from themſelves to me the laſt night.)</p>
            <p>The General threatens that he will quarter ſome Horſe about that Garriſon, and will not let them have a penny of mony. Major <hi>Kelke</hi>
deſires that ſome of them will acquaint his Wife that he is in health, and that his Son is this day arrived ſafe from <hi>London,</hi> which I intreat you
will ſignifie to her accordingly.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell you that the General hath ſecured <hi>Barwick,</hi> Lt. Col. <hi>Mears</hi> having received in there, two of his foot compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and one of horſe. And as Col. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> paſt by there, they were detained Priſoners till the General ſent a party of
horſe for them. This night they are both come with a guard to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> (where I heard from one that read their <hi>Mittimus</hi>) they
were preſently to be committed to the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to communicate to you, deſiring that the Lord would direct you to make ſuch uſe of it, as may be for his
own glory, and his poor peoples peace. Farewell.</p>
