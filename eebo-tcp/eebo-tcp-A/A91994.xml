            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Supreme Authority of the Common-wealth of ENGLAND
Aſſembled in <hi>Parliament;</hi>
            </head>
            <head>The Caſe of Lievt. Coll. <hi>Roſworme.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>1. IN the infancy of the late Troubles he approved himſelf cordiall and
faithful to the Parliament, and did them eminent ſervice in defending
the Town of <hi>Manchester</hi> againſt the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> and the Kings
Forces, which he ſucceſsfully performed to the wonder both of friends and
foes.</p>
            <p>2. He proſecuted that ſucceſs to the utter ſubduing of the Enemy in all
that County.</p>
            <p>3. In all the paſſages of his Service he cannot be touched in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Free-quarter, plunder, or any one act of unfaithfulneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
            <p>4. He hath refuſed great Offers of Money and Preferments from the
Enemy, and reſolutely oppoſed all wayes uſed to corrupt his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>5. He hath upon all occaſions readily performed all Requeſts and
Commands, tending to the advancement of the Publique Service and
Safety.</p>
            <p>6. The Town of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> for his remarkable and faithful Service, did
ſettle upon him an Annuity of 60 <hi>li. per annum,</hi> for his and his wives life,
which was payd the two firſt years, but ſince that time they have neglected
payment thereof, and now laſtly for theſe 2 years together wherein he hath not
received one penny notwithſtanding the recommendation of the Houſe in an
Order <hi>Dated, Sept.</hi> 4. 1644. And the ſpeciall requeſt of the Councell of State,
in a Letter <hi>Dat. July</hi> 7. 1649. Nor can he recover it at Law, not being a free
Denizon.</p>
            <p>This buſineſs hath been examined by a Committee of the Councell of
State, and found true; and they further find, that the ſum of 776 <hi>li.</hi> &amp; 15 <hi>s.</hi>
is due unto him for his Arrears, of which the Councel of State to ſupply his
neceſſities have paid him 30 <hi>li.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath attended above two years for relief, which hath coſt him above
two hundred pound, which he hath taken up on Credit, and is brought to ſo
low a condition, that he, his wife and children had periſhed, if they had not
been relieved by ſtrangers. Which he takes the more to heart, that he upon
many grounds obſerveth, that his relief is retarded and obſtructed, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
underminings of ſome masked Enemies of the Commonwealth, whoſe
treachery he hath moſt clearly manifeſted in a little Naration, Printed in
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 1649. Whom if they dare to appear with an Accuſation, he deſireth
to Anſwer.</p>
            <p>There hath been a Report on his behalf from the Councel of State ever ſince
1 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1649. for his Relief.</p>
            <closer>His humble Suit is, That you will further the ſpeedie reporting of the buſineſs,
and his Relief, as you ſhall find juſt.</closer>
