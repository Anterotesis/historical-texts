            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF Laſt <hi>Thurſdays</hi> Sea ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TCH</hi> and <hi>FRENCH</hi> Fleets NEAR THE Coaſt of BREST, WITH THE Total Routing of the <hi>FRENCH</hi> FLEET.</head>
            <p>AN <hi>Hambrough</hi> Merchant coming into <hi>Dover</hi> to take in freſh Water, being homeward bound, brings this following Account, as by the particulars of a Letter ſent to <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>P</hi>— an Eminent and Worthy Merchant in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Hambrough</hi> Merchant, came by the two Fleets when they were actually Engaged; the occaſion how this Grand Engagement happened to fall out, was as followeth: Thirty ſix Sail of Stout <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships lying ſome Leagues off of <hi>Breſt,</hi> to ſecure the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> Fleet from the <hi>French Capers,</hi> as well as to Watch the Motions of the late King <hi>James,</hi> who was at <hi>Breſt</hi> with ſixteen Sail of <hi>French</hi> Men of War (from thirty to ſeventy Guns each, as Fire Ships,) with many ſmall Craft to carry Land Forces, Ammunition, and four Cart Loads of Money and Plate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a deſign to Succour <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt, the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> Fleet paſt by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War, under their Safe guard, and are come into the <hi>Channel</hi> to purſue their Courſe ſafely for <hi>Holland.</hi> And on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> in the Afternoon (as it's thought) or at leaſt on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Morning, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet put to Sea from the Port of <hi>Breſt,</hi> (the Wind favouring them) for the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> directly; but ſo it fell out, that the Wind tacking about, by which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet (who lay ready waiting their motions) was driven directly upon them, and the <hi>French</hi> Fleet could not make any part but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts; a moſt deſperate Fight enſued. And when this <hi>Hambrough</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant came away, he left them hotly Engaged, and ſince (as it's general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported) the King this day received an Expreſs, that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet are totally Routed, a great many of their Men of War ſunk, and others taken with a great number of their ſmall Craft Men, that had their Land Soldiers on Board; among which was the Marſhal <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> and many others of their greateſt and beſt Officers. And its general ſaid about the Town, that the late King <hi>James,</hi> with many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, are made their Priſoners of War. You may expect in our next, a more full and particular Account, of this Great, Glorious, and moſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Engagement; happy not only to theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but happy to the Confederate Princes, and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> who are at preſent Engaged in a Common, and no leſs Juſt War, with the Common Enemy of Chriſtianity and Mankind, the moſt Unchriſtian King.</p>
